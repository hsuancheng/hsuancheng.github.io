These organisms have been well described to cause chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection, and urethritis, and to a lesser degree surgical site infection and infection in transplant recipients. Outside of these settings, invasive  infections are rare. We describe the case of a young woman receiving rituximab for multiple sclerosis who presented with fever and bilateral renal abscesses due to  spp., which was successfully treated with oral doxycycline. We searched the literature for cases of invasive  infection and found a patient population that predominates with humoral immunodeficiency, either congenital or iatrogenic. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are discussed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Women experiencing systemic lupus are at high risk for premature ovarian insufficiency if using cyclophosphamide, of osteoporosis, arterial ischemic diseases and venous thrombosis at young age. In about 30% of them, an antiphospholipid/anticoagulant antibody can occur which is associated with very high risk of thrombosis. However, the severity of the disease may vary and some women with lupus could benefit from a menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). As a consequence, management of menopause symptoms needs to evaluate carefully the condition of the patient, her lupus history and cardiovascular risk. We will describe the effect of lupus on menopause, of menopause on lupus and report in detail the literature available on MHT and the risk of lupus or the risk of flares in women with lupus. Some other options than MHT for the management of climacteric symptoms will be discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661527>Factors associated with pneumococcal carriage and density in infants and young children in Laos PDR.</a></h2><p>Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a precursor to pneumococcal disease. Several host and environmental factors have been associated with pneumococcal carriage, however few studies have examined the relationship between host factors and pneumococcal carriage density. We sought to identify risk factors for pneumococcal carriage and density using data from cross-sectional pneumococcal carriage surveys conducted in the Lao People's Democratic Republic before and after the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected infants from aged 5-8 weeks old (n = 999) and children aged 12-23 months (n = 1,010), pneumococci detected by quantitative PCR, and a risk factor questionnaire completed. Logistic and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and pneumococcal carriage and density. In infants aged 5-8 weeks, living in a household with two or more children under the age of five years (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.39-2.79) and low family income (aOR 1.64; 95% CI 0.99-2.72) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. For children aged 12-23 months, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms (aOR 2.64; 95% CI 1.97-3.53), two or more children under five in the household (aOR 2.40; 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and rural residence (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.35-2.50) were positively associated with pneumococcal carriage. PCV13 vaccination was negatively associated with carriage of PCV13 serotypes (aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83). URTI symptoms (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding (p = 0.005), rural residence (p = 0.012), and delivery by Caesarean section (p = 0.035) were associated with higher mean pneumococcal density in pneumococcal carriers (both age groups combined).

Even though less than 1% of malaria infections are fatal, this leads to about 430,000 deaths per year, predominantly in young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, it is imperative to understand why a subset of infected individuals develop severe syndromes and some of them die and what differentiates these cases from the majority that recovers.

However, while the implications of immune function and nutrition on an individual's lifespan and reproduction are well established, the interplay between feeding behaviour, infection, and immune function, remains poorly understood. Asking how ecological and physiological factors affect immune responses and resistance to infections is a central theme of eco-immunology. 2. In this study, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how infection through septic injury modulates nutritional intake, and how macronutrient balance affects survival to infection by the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. 3. Our results show that infected flies maintain carbohydrate intake, but reduce protein intake, thereby shifting from a protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of ~1:4 to ~1:10 relative to non-infected and sham-infected flies. Strikingly, the proportion of flies dying after M. luteus infection was significantly lower when flies were fed a low-P high-C diet, revealing that flies shift their macronutrient intake as means of nutritional self-medication against bacterial infection. 4. These results are likely due to the effects of the macronutrient balance on the regulation of the constitutive expression of innate immune genes, as a low-P high-C diet was linked to an up-regulation in the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. 5. Together, our results reveal the intricate relationship between macronutrient intake and resistance to infection, and integrate the molecular cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways into the framework of nutritional immunology.© 2019 The Authors.

Over the course of the disease, the episodes increased in frequency and severity, with new signs and symptoms continuing to appear. Most importantly, these included skin changes, splenomegaly and transaminitis. Only partial control of the disease was achieved with anti-IL-1 therapy. Extensive investigation showed generalized inflammation without immune deficiency, with increased levels of serum amyloid A and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, as well as an increased type I interferon score. Exome sequence analysis identified P369S and R408Q variants in the MEFV innate  regulator, pyrin (MEFV) gene and T260 M and T320 M variants in the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12) gene.Patients with unclassified and/or unexplained autoinflammatory syndromes present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and collectively form a substantial part of every cohort of patients with autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, it is important to acquire their full genomic profile through whole exome and/or genome sequencing and present their cases to a broader audience, to facilitate characterization of similar patients.

Ways to reduce and prevent myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury are of great clinical significance in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction. TRAF1 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1) is an important adapter protein that is implicated in molecular events regulating , inflammation, and cell death. Little is known about the role and impact of TRAF1 in myocardial I/R injury. Methods and Results TRAF1 expression is markedly induced in wild-type mice and cardiomyocytes after I/R or hypoxia/reoxygenation stimulation. I/R models were established in TRAF1 knockout mice and wild type mice (n=10 per group). We demonstrated that TRAF1 deficiency protects against myocardial I/R-induced loss of heat function, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte death. In addition, overexpression of TRAF1 in primary cardiomyocytes promotes hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced inflammation and apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistically, TRAF1 promotes myocardial I/R injury through regulating ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)-mediated JNK/p38 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38) MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascades. Conclusions Our results indicated that TRAF1 aggravates the development of myocardial I/R injury by enhancing the activation of ASK1-mediated JNK/p38 cascades. Targeting the TRAF1-ASK1-JNK/p38 pathway provide feasible therapies for cardiac I/R injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659127>PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A-B'γ controls Botrytis cinerea resistance and developmental leaf senescence.</a></h2><p>Plants optimize their growth and survival through highly integrated regulatory networks that coordinate defensive measures and developmental transitions in response to environmental cues. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a key signaling component that controls stress reactions and growth at different stages of plant development, and the PP2A regulatory subunit PP2A-B'γ is required for negative regulation of pathogenesis responses and for maintenance of cell homeostasis in short day conditions. Here, we report molecular mechanisms by which PP2A-B'γ regulates Botrytis cinerea resistance and leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We extend the molecular functionality of PP2A-B'γ to a protein kinase-phosphatase interaction with the defense-associated calcium-dependent protein kinase CPK1 and present indications this interaction may function to control CPK1 activity. In pre-senescent leaf tissues, PP2A-B'γ is also required to negatively control the expression of salicylic acid-related defense genes, which have recently proven vital in plant resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. In addition, we find the premature leaf yellowing of pp2a-b'γ depends on salicylic acid biosynthesis via SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT2 and bears the hallmarks of developmental leaf senescence. We propose PP2A-B'γ age-dependently controls salicylic acid-related signaling in plant  and developmental leaf senescence.{copyright, serif} 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Elevated systemic levels of neutrophils have been detected in patients with altered BBB function, but the role of neutrophils in BMEC dysfunction is unknown. Neutrophils are key players of the immune response and, when activated, produce neutrophil-derived microvesicles (NMV). NMV have been shown to impact the integrity of endothelial cells throughout the body and we hypothesize that NMV released from circulating neutrophils interact with BMEC and induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Therefore, the current study investigated the interaction of NMV with human BMEC and determined whether they altered gene expression and function in vitro. Using flow cytometry and confocal imaging, NMV were shown to be internalized by the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 via a variety of energy-dependent mechanisms, including endocytosis and macropinocytosis. The internalization of NMV significantly altered the transcriptomic profile of hCMEC/D3, specifically inducing the dysregulation of genes associated with TJ, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and vesicular transport. Functional studies confirmed NMV significantly increased permeability and decreased the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of a confluent monolayer of hCMEC/D3. These findings indicate that NMV interact with and affect gene expression of BMEC as well as impacting their integrity. We conclude that NMV may play an important role in modulating the permeability of BBB during an infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649650>-Derived Volatile Sulfur Compounds Promote Distal  Growth and a Synergistic Pathogen-Pathogen Interaction That Increases Pathogenicity in Co-infection.</a></h2><p>Pathogen-pathogen interactions in polymicrobial infections are known to directly impact, often to worsen, disease outcomes. For example, co-infection with  and , respectively the most common bacterial and fungal pathogens isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, leads to a worsened prognosis. Recent studies of  microbial cross-talk demonstrated that -derived volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) can promote  growth . However, the mechanistic basis of such cross-talk and its physiological relevance during co-infection remains unknown. In this study we combine genetic approaches and GC-MS-mediated volatile analysis to show that  assimilates VSCs via cysteine (CysB)- or homocysteine (CysD)-synthase. This process is essential for utilization of VSCs as sulfur sources, since -derived VSCs trigger growth of  wild-type, but not of a ΔΔ mutant, on sulfur-limiting media.  produces VSCs when infecting  and co-infection with  in this model results in a synergistic increase in mortality and of fungal and bacterial burdens. Interestingly, the increment in mortality is much greater with the  wild-type than with the ΔΔ mutant. Therefore,  ability to assimilate  derived VSCs significantly triggers a synergistic association that increases the pathobiology of infection. Finally, we show that  can promote fungal growth when growing on substrates that resemble the lung environment, which suggests that this volatile based synergism is likely to occur during co-infection of the human respiratory airways.Copyright © 2019 Scott, Sueiro-Olivares, Ahmed, Heddergott, Zhao, Thomas, Bromley, Latgé, Krappmann, Fowler, Bignell and Amich.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649679>Editorial: Long Non-coding RNAs and .</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661485>[Human Oncogenic Viruses: Old Facts and New Hypotheses].</a></h2><p>Numerous studies on the nature of neoplastic growth have demonstrated that oncogenic viruses maybe one of the factors causing cancer.

In teleost, great progress has been achieved regarding NF-κB signaling for innate , but whether this pathway modulates adaptive , and how, remains largely unclear. In this study, after characterizing the sequence, structure, and phylogeny of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus IκBα (defined as On-IκBα), we investigated the association between IκBα-regulated NF-κB activation and the lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immune response in Nile tilapia. We found that On-IκBα was evolutionarily conserved, and its mRNA was expressed widely in various tissues, with most abundance in the trunk kidney. mRNA expression of On-IκBα was significantly upregulated in spleen at both innate and adaptive immune stages after Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Moreover, phosphorylation of On-IκBα and the downstream On-NF-κB p65 was obviously elevated in spleen leukocytes at 3, 5, or 8 days after A. hydrophila infection, indicating the activation of NF-κB signaling. Correlating with the augmented protein phosphorylation, leukocyte proliferation was enhanced during the same immune stage, suggesting the potential association of IκBα and IκBα-regulated NF-κB signaling in the primary adaptive immune response. Although lymphocyte activation by the T cell-specific mitogen PHA did not alter On-IκBα mRNA expression significantly, lymphocyte activation by the agonist PMA obviously elevated On-IκBα and On-NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in spleen leukocytes. Together, the results suggest that IκBα phosphorylation and its regulated NF-κB activation are essential events associated with lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and anti-bacterial adaptive immune response in Nile tilapia.

Here, we identify Condensin II subunits as novel regulators of mitochondrial respiration and stress response. Condensin II is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. While the effects of Condensin II depletion on nuclear genome organization are well-studied, effects on essential cytoplasmic and metabolic processes are not as well understood. Excitingly, we observe that Condensin II Chromosome Associated Protein (CAP) subunits individually localize to different regions of mitochondria, suggesting possible mitochondrial-specific functions independent from the canonical Condensin II holocomplex. Changes in cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial respiration are observed in Condensin II CAP subunit-deficient cells. Surprisingly, we find that loss of NCAPD3 also sensitizes cells to oxidative stress. Together, these studies identify new, and possibly independent, roles for Condensin II CAP subunits in preventing mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. These findings reveal a new area of Condensin protein research that could contribute to the identification of targets to treat diseases where aberrant function of Condensin II proteins is implicated.© 2019.

Increased cellular autophagy may kill the infected cell and terminate the infection without proper regulation. The mechanism of autophagy regulation during liver disease progression in HCV infection is unclear. The autophagy research has gained a lot of attention recently since autophagy impairment is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are three autophagy processes involved in the lysosomal degradation and extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes under excessive stress. Autophagy processes compensate for each other during extreme endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote host and microbe survival as well as HCC development in the highly stressed microenvironment of the cirrhotic liver. This review describes the molecular details of how excessive cellular stress generated during HCV infection activates CMA to improve cell survival. The pathological implications of stress-related CMA activation resulting in the loss of hepatic innate  and tumor suppressors, which are most often observed among cirrhotic patients with HCC, are discussed. The oncogenic cell programming through autophagy regulation initiated by a cytoplasmic virus may facilitate our understanding of HCC mechanisms related to non-viral etiologies and metabolic conditions such as uncontrolled type II diabetes. We propose that a better understanding of how excessive cellular stress leads to cancer through autophagy modulation may allow therapeutic development and early detection of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654206>Aberrant methylation of host macrophages induced by tuberculosis infection.</a></h2><p>DNA methylation has been introduced as a promising biomarker for different diseases. Alterations in macrophage DNA methylation status have been documented during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. We conducted this study using a human methylation PCR array kit, which comprised a panel of 22 genes in TLR2 signaling pathway, in order to gain insights into epigenetic interactions between drug-susceptible and -resistant Mtb strains and THP-1-derived macrophages (one of the main host  cells during TB infection). We also evaluated the expression of Rv1988 gene in the studied isolates. It was found that the methylation level of all of the studied inflammatory genes, except Irak-2 and Tbk-1, increased in THP-1 macrophages, which were infected by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mtb strains, compared with the mock cells (P < 0.05). In susceptible strains, we only found hypomethylation in Irak-2 gene, in addition to a slight increase in the methylation levels of Ubev, Ube2n, and Traf6 genes. The present findings provide new insights into the potential role of resistant and susceptible Mtb strains in promoting aberrant epigenetic modifications in macrophages.

We validated the gene expression levels at the protein level for a subset of five selected genes belonging to the immune and vascular pathways (CD8A, PDL1, VEGFR3, VEGFR2, and VISTA), in the validation series, and replicated the molecular profiles as well as their prognostic value in the replication series.The prognosis of MPM is best explained by a continuous model, which extremes show specific expression patterns of genes involved in angiogenesis and immune response.Copyright © 2018.

Key challenges for the identification of a predictive immune signature include the high dimensionality of data produced by high-throughput technologies and the limitation of standard statistical tests in accounting for synergetic interactions between immune responses to multiple targets. In this study, using samples collected from young children in Ghana at multiple time points during a longitudinal study, we adapted a predictive modelling framework which combines feature selection and machine learning techniques to identify an antigen signature of clinical  to malaria. Our results show that an individual's immune status can be accurately predicted by measuring antibody responses to a small defined set of 15 target antigens. We further demonstrate that the identified immune signature is highly versatile and capable of providing precise and accurate estimates of clinical protection from malaria in an independent geographic community. Our findings pave the way for the development of a robust point-of-care test to identify individuals at high risk of disease and which could be applied to monitor the impact of vaccinations and other interventions.

Two members of the IFIT protein family: IFIT1 and IFIT5 are capable of binding the very terminal 5' end of mRNA. In eukaryotes these mRNA termini contain a cap structure (m7GpppN, cap 0) that is often subjected to further modifications. Here, we performed a thorough examination of IFIT1 and IFIT5 binding to a wide spectrum of differently capped as well as fully uncapped mRNAs. The kinetic analysis of IFIT1 and IFIT5 interactions with mRNA ligands indicates that the cap structure modifications considerably influence the stability of IFIT1/RNA complexes. The most stable complexes were formed between IFIT1 and GpppG/A- and m7GpppG/A-RNAs. Unexpectedly, we found that NAD+- and NADH-capped RNAs associate with IFIT5 with kinetic parameters comparable to pppG-RNA. Finally, we measured interactions of IFIT1 with mRNAs bearing modified synthetic cap analogs that start to become the important tools in biotechnological and medicinal research. We found that incorporation of modified cap analogs to the RNA protects the latter, to a certain degree, from the translational inhibition caused by IFIT1 protein.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658987>A  missense variant causes flagella destabilization and asthenozoospermia.</a></h2><p>Asthenozoospermia is a common cause of male infertility, but its etiology remains incompletely understood.

However, spermatozoa of all three patients showed higher frequencies of microtubule doublet(s) 4-7 missing at principal piece and end piece than in controls. Mice carrying a homozygous mutation ( ) equivalent to that in patients recapitulated the defects in patients' sperm tails. Further examinations revealed that the doublets 4-7 were destabilized largely due to the storage of sperm in epididymis. Altogether, we first report that a homozygous  missense variant specifically induces doublets 4-7 destabilization and consequently causes asthenozoospermia, providing a novel marker for genetic counseling and diagnosis of male infertility.© 2019 Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649685>Growth Restriction and Systemic Immune Development in Preterm Piglets.</a></h2><p> Many preterm infants are born with growth restriction (GR) following maternal or fetal complications before birth. Such infants may continue to grow slowly after birth, regardless of birth weight (BW), due to morbidities related to their immature organs. Severe GR increases the susceptibility to infections, but it is not clear if this is a consequence of impaired systemic  or other factors, such as prolonged hospital stay or poor mucosal barrier function. Using preterm pigs as models for preterm infants, we hypothesized that moderate GR, exerting limited clinical effects, does not influence systemic immune development.  Preterm pigs were delivered by cesarean section and fed bovine milk diets until 19 d. Piglets with fetal growth restriction (F-GR, the lowest 25% of BW,  = 27, excluding those with BW <350 g) and postnatal growth restriction (P-GR, the lowest 25% of postnatal growth rate,  = 24) were compared with their corresponding controls (F-CON,  = 92, and P-CON,  = 85, respectively). Organ weights were determined and blood collected for assessment of clinical status (blood chemistry and hematology). For a subgroup ( = 58), in depth analyses of neutrophil function, T cell counts, plasma cytokine levels, and leucocyte gene expression were performed.  For F-GR pigs, adrenal gland weight was increased and bone mineral content decreased at 19 d. Total leucocyte levels were lower at birth and interleukin-10 levels increased at d 8-10. In P-GR pigs, total leucocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts along with helper T cell fractions were elevated at 8-19 d of age, while the fraction of neutrophils with phagocytic capacity was reduced. Diarrhea and all remaining organ weights, blood chemistry, and immune variables were not affected by F-GR or P-GR.  Moderate GR before and after preterm birth has limited effect on systemic immune development in preterm pigs, despite marginal effects on immune cell populations, adrenocortical function, and body composition. Similar responses may be observed for preterm infants with moderate fetal and postnatal growth restriction.Copyright © 2019 Bæk, Sangild, Thymann and Nguyen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658944>Modeling the dynamics of  gametocytes in humans during malaria infection.</a></h2><p>Renewed efforts to eliminate malaria have highlighted the potential to interrupt human-to-mosquito transmission - a process mediated by gametocyte kinetics in human hosts. Here we study the in vivo dynamics of  gametocytes by establishing a framework which incorporates improved measurements of parasitemia, a novel gametocyte dynamics model and model fitting using Bayesian hierarchical inference. We found that the model provides an excellent fit to the clinical data from 17 volunteers infected with  (3D7 strain) and reliably predicts observed gametocytemia. We estimated the sexual commitment rate and gametocyte sequestration time to be 0.54% (95% credible interval: 0.30-1.00%) per asexual replication cycle and 8.39 (6.54-10.59) days respectively. We used the data-calibrated model to investigate human-to-mosquito transmissibility, providing a method to link within-human host infection kinetics to epidemiological-scale infection and transmission patterns.© 2019, Cao et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651237>RNA-Seq based transcriptome analysis during bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) infection.</a></h2><p>Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the member of the genus Pestivirus within the Flaviviridae family and responsible for severe economic losses in the cattle industry. BVDV can employ 'infect-and-persist' strategy and 'hit-and-run' strategy to remain associated with hosts and thus contributes to BVDV circulation in cattle herds. BVDV have also evolved various strategies to evade the innate  of host. To further understand the mechanisms by which BVDV overcomes the host cell innate immune response and provide more clues for further understanding the BVDV-host interaction, in this descriptive study, we conducted a investigation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the host during BVDV infection by RNA-Seq analysis.Our analysis identified 1297, 1732, 3072, and 1877 DEGs in the comparison groups mock vs. MDBK cells infected with BVDV post 2 h (MBV2h), mock vs. MBV6h, mock vs. MBV12h, and mock vs. MBV24h, respectively. The reproducibility and repeatability of the results were validated by RT-qPCR. Enrichment analyses of GO annotations and KEGG pathways revealed the host DEGs that are potentially induced by BVDV infection and may participate in BVDV-host interactions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses identified the potential interactions among the DEGs. Our findings suggested that BVDV infection induced the upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The expression of genes that have antiviral roles, including ISG15, Mx1, OSA1Y, were found to be downregulated and are thus potentially associated with the inhibition of host innate immune system during BVDV infection. The expression levels of F3, C1R, KNG1, CLU, C3, FB, SERPINA5, SERPINE1, C1S, F2RL2, and C2, which belong to the complement and coagulation signalling cascades, were downregulated during BVDV infection, which suggested that the complement system might play a crucial role during BVDV infection.In this descriptive study, our findings revealed the changes in the host transcriptome expression profile during BVDV infection and suggested that BVDV-infection induced altering the host's metabolic network, the inhibition of the expression of antiviral proteins and genes within the complement system might be contributed to BVDV proliferation. The above findings provided unique insights for further studies on the mechanisms underlying BVDV-host interactions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661479>[Mouse Models of Sepsis and Septic Shock].</a></h2><p>An extensive network of regulation of systemic inflammation makes development of a reproducible experimental model of sepsis a complex task.

Such a method is still used to measure potency of live Oral Poliovirus Vaccine during vaccine development and production and in some clinical trials. However, the conventional method is not suited to identify and titrate virus in the large numbers of fecal samples generated during clinical trials. Determining titers of each of the three Sabin strains co-existing in Oral Poliovirus Vaccine presents an additional challenge.A new assay using quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction as an endpoint instead of cytopathic effect was developed to overcome these limitations. In the multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay, cell cultures were infected with serial dilutions of test samples, lysed after two-day incubation, and subjected to a quantitative multiplex one-step reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All three serotypes of poliovirus were identified in single samples and titers calculated. The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was reproducible, robust and sensitive. Its lower limits of titration for three Sabin strains were 1-5 cell culture 50% infectious doses per ml. We prepared different combinations of three Sabin strains and compared titers obtained with conventional and multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assays. Results of the two assays correlated well and showed similar results and sensitivity. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration assay was completed in two to 3 days instead of 10 days for the conventional assay.The multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based titration (MPBT) is the first quantitative assay that identifies and titrates each of several different infectious viruses simultaneously in a mixture. It is suitable to identify and titrate polioviruses rapidly during the vaccine manufacturing process as a quality control test, in large clinical trials of vaccines, and for environmental surveillance of polioviruses. The MPBT assay can be automated for high-throughput implementation and applied for other viruses including those with no cytopathic effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660405>Risk Factors for Asymptomatic Enteric Pathogen Detection Among Men Who Have Sex With Men.</a></h2><p>Improved knowledge of factors that promote outbreaks of enteric pathogens among men who have sex with men (MSM) could enable targeted public health interventions.

To avoid this, the response is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The ubiquitin system represents a powerful PTM machinery that allows for the reversible linkage of ubiquitin to activate and deactivate a target's function. A precise enzymatic cascade of ubiquitin-activating, conjugating and ligating enzymes facilitates ubiquitination. Viruses have evolved to take advantage of the ubiquitin pathway either by targeting factors to dampen the antiviral response or by hijacking the system to enhance their replication. The tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases has garnered attention as a major contributor to innate . Many TRIM family members limit viruses either indirectly as components in innate immune signalling, or directly by targeting viral proteins for degradation. In spite of this, TRIMs and other ubiquitin ligases can be appropriated by viruses and repurposed as valuable tools in viral replication. This duality of function suggests a new frontier of research for TRIMs and raises new challenges for discerning the subtleties of these pro-viral mechanisms. Here, we review current findings regarding the involvement of TRIMs in host-virus interactions. We examine ongoing developments in the field, including novel roles for unanchored ubiquitin in innate , the direct involvement of ubiquitin ligases in promoting viral replication, recent controversies on the role of ubiquitin and TRIM25 in activation of the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, and we discuss the implications these studies have on future research directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649050>A compendium of the apoA-I biological effects.</a></h2><p>Obesity is the result of an energy imbalance, i.e. excess caloric consumption, leading to weight gain and metabolic disturbances characterised by a prolonged exposure to adipose tissue inflammation and hyperglycemic conditions resulting in sustained exposure to glucolipotoxicity, low-grade inflammation, and increased oxidative stress.

Additionally, recent data uncover new therapeutic applications of this sHDL-apoA-IM. This review provides an overview of all potential application of sHDL-apoA-IM in some inflammatory-based disease.   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A recent study demonstrated that the delivery of therapeutic apoA-IM full-length proteins via oral administration of rice seeds protein extracts proved effective in reducing atherosclerosis development in Apoe-deficient mice. Moreover, the rice milk-apoA-IM preserved both in-vitro and in-vivo anti-inflammatory properties, as already observed when sHDL-apoA-IM were given by intravascular infusion. In addition, various studies suggested that sHDL-apoA-IM could positively affect other inflammatory-based disease.

APOL1 is expressed in renal cells, however, the pathogenic events that lead to renal cell damage and kidney disease are not fully understood. The podocyte function of APOL1-G0 versus APOL1-G2 in the setting of a known disease stressor was assessed using transgenic mouse models. Transgene expression, survival, renal pathology and function, and podocyte density were assessed in an intercross of a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26) with two mouse models that express either APOL1-G0 or APOL1-G2 in podocytes. Mice that expressed HIV genes developed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, and had significant losses in podocyte numbers and reductions in podocyte densities. Mice that co-expressed APOL1-G0 and HIV had preserved podocyte numbers and densities, with fewer morphologic manifestations typical of HIVAN pathology. Podocyte losses and pathology in mice co-expressing APOL1-G2 and HIV were not significantly different from mice expressing only HIV. Podocyte hypertrophy, a known compensatory event to stress, was increased in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G0, but absent in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G2. Mortality and renal function tests were not significantly different between groups. APOL1-G0 expressed in podocytes may have a protective function against podocyte loss or injury when exposed to an environmental stressor. This was absent with APOL1-G2 expression, suggesting APOL1-G2 may have lost this protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649497>Peripheral Humoral Immune Response Is Associated With the Non-motor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and can even be used as part of the supportive criteria for diagnosis. Chronic inflammation is involved in every stage of PD. Disorders of the immune system affect the peripheral blood.

Multiple regression models were conducted to assess the associations among these indicators of humoral  and the clinical features of PD patients.Male PD patients had lower levels of C3 and C4 than healthy controls [0.87 (0.22) vs. 0.96 (0.19); 0.19 (0.06) vs. 0.22 (0.07), respectively, Pc < 0.01] and lower levels of C3 than female PD patients [0.87 (0.22) vs. 1.02 (0.23), Pc < 0.01].

The exosome markers, cluster of differentiation 63 (CD63) and tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), were positively expressed in intestinal villi during turtle hibernation. The distribution and formation processes of MVBs and exosomes in turtle MRCs, GCs, and ACs were further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. During hibernation, abundantly secreted early endosomes (ees) were localized in the luminal and basal cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs, and late endosomes (les) were dispersed with the supranuclear parts of the MRCs and ACs. Many "heterogeneous" MVBs were identified throughout the cytoplasm of the MRCs and ACs. Interestingly, the ees, les, and MVBs were detected in the cytoplasm of the GCs during hibernation; however, they were absent during nonhibernation. Furthermore, the exocytosis pathways of exosomes and autophagic vacuoles were observed in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. In addition, the number of different MVBs with intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and heterogeneous endosome-MVB-exosome complexes was significantly increased in the MRCs, GCs, and ACs during hibernation. All these findings indicate that intestinal epithelial cells potentially perform a role in the secretion of MVBs and exosomes, which are essential for mucosal , during hibernation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648992>Interferon-β corrects massive gene dysregulation in multiple sclerosis: Short-term and long-term effects on immune regulation and neuroprotection.</a></h2><p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), immune up-regulation is coupled to subnormal immune response to interferon-β (IFN-β) and low serum IFN-β levels. The relationship between the defect in IFN signalling and acute and long-term effects of IFN-β on gene expression in MS is inadequately understood.We profiled IFN-β-induced transcriptome shifts, using high-resolution microarrays on 227 mononuclear cell samples from IFN-β-treated MS Complete Responders (CR) stable for five years, and stable and active Partial Responders (PR), stable and active untreated MS, and healthy controls.IFN-β injection induced short-term changes in 1,200 genes compared to baseline expression after 4-day IFN washout. Pre-injection after washout, and in response to IFN-β injections, PR more frequently had abnormal gene expression than CR. Surprisingly, short-term IFN-β induced little shift in Th1/Th17/Th2 gene expression, but up-regulated immune-inhibitory genes (ILT, IDO1, PD-L1). Expression of 8,800 genes was dysregulated in therapy-naïve compared to IFN-β-treated patients. These long-term changes in protein-coding and long non-coding RNAs affect , synaptic transmission, and CNS cell survival, and correct the disordered therapy-naïve transcriptome to near-normal. In keeping with its impact on clinical course and brain repair in MS, long-term IFN-β treatment reversed the overexpression of proinflammatory and MMP genes, while enhancing genes involved in the oligodendroglia-protective integrated stress response, neuroprotection, and immunoregulation. In the rectified long-term signature, 277 transcripts differed between stable PR and CR patients.IFN-β had minimal short-term effects on Th1 and Th2 pathways, but long-term it corrected gene dysregulation and induced immunoregulatory and neuroprotective genes.

About 90% of all renal cancers are Renal Cell Carcinoma. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally. 17% of cases are advanced at the time of diagnosis. PDL1 being a trans-membrane cell surface protein is expressed on the tumor cells and is found to have a chief role to inhibit the T cell immune response. It is essential to improve the host  by targeting the PD1/PDL1 pathway, thereby destroying the tumor progression.The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of PDL1 in tumor cells and adjacent normal tissue among the renal cell carcinoma patients and assess the relation between the PDL1 expression and the tumor characters.This is a retrospective study. Ethical clearance was obtained from the institution. 150 histopathologically proven RCC cases were chosen. Immunohistochemistry using a PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody was performed on paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks. Q scoring was done to calculate the expression of PDL1.Chi square test was done to assess the comparison between the PDL1 expression in tumor cells and their characteristic features like histology, grade and stage. SPSS (version 20.0) was used for analysis. P value <0.05 was considered significant. It also explains the heterogenous nature of PDL1 as it expressed more in the aggressive pathologic characters like high grade.Positive PD-L1 expression was seen in 44% of tumors. Significant association was observed between high WWHO ISUP grading and positive PDL1 expression (p=0.028). It was expressed in 75% of the sarcomatous type of RCC and 46.8% of clear cell RCCs.Our study suggests that blocking PD1/PDL1 pathway may become an effective mode of treatment in cancer immunotherapy especially for Renal Cell Carcinomas.

However, little is known about how vaccination impacts the selective pressures acting on the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we use high-throughput sequencing of viral genomes to investigate evolutionary changes in virus populations following the challenge of naïve and vaccinated pigs with the highly virulent CSFV strain "Koslov". The challenge inoculum contained an ensemble of closely related viral sequences, with three major haplotypes being present, termed A, B, and C. After the challenge, the viral haplotype A was preferentially located within the tonsils of naïve animals but was highly prevalent in the sera of all vaccinated animals. We find that the viral population structure in naïve pigs after infection is very similar to that in the original inoculum. In contrast, the viral population in vaccinated pigs, which only underwent transient low-level viremia, displayed several distinct changes including the emergence of 16 unique non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detectable in the challenge inoculum. Further analysis showed a significant loss of heterogeneity and an increasing positive selection acting on the virus populations in the vaccinated pigs. We conclude that vaccination imposes a strong selective pressure on viruses that subsequently replicate within the vaccinated animal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661483>[Body's Own Epitopes among Foreign Ones: T Cells and Autoantigens].</a></h2><p>T cells play a key role in adaptive  reactions, recognizing antigens using variable TCRs. Functional TCR subunit genes are formed by somatic rearrangement, and some of the resulting TCRs recognize autoantigens, the body's own molecules. The autoreactive T cells that carry such TCRs pose a threat of inducing immune reactions against their own organism. In the course of the immune system's development, some autoreactive T lymphocytes are eliminated by apoptosis, some differentiate into immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which support immunological tolerance to autoantigens, and the rest fall into a non-functional state of anergy. Suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells is mediated by immunosuppressive cytokines and costimulatory molecules, depletion of stimulating IL-2, removal of autoreactive peptides together with MHC molecules, and in other ways. Impairment of self-tolerance leads to autoimmune diseases. However, the loss of immunological tolerance can be employed in tumor treatment, allowing immunotherapy and the use of the potential of autoreactive effector T cells. The fact that the efficacious immunotherapy of tumors is often accompanied by adverse autoimmune reactions currently seems to be the inevitable price paid by using this approach.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657119>CD154-expressing CMV-specific T cells associate with freedom from DNAemia and may be protective in seronegative recipients after liver or intestine transplantation.</a></h2><p>Cell-mediated  to CMV, if known, could improve antiviral drug therapy in at-risk children and young adults with LT and IT.

All T-cell subsets demonstrated similar between-group differences. In logistic regression analysis of 46 training set samples, 12 with DNAemia, all obtained between days 0 and 60 from transplant, CMV-specific T-cell frequencies ≥1.7% predicted freedom from DNAemia with NPV of 93%. Sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 83%, 74%, and 53%, respectively. Test performance was replicated in 99 validation samples.

However, GBM rapidly becomes refractory to anti-VEGF therapies. Myeloid cell infiltration is an important determinant of tumor progression. Given that VEGF is a modulator of the innate immune response we sought to analyze the dynamics of this response in a mouse model of GBM undergoing anti-VEGF therapy.We grafted GL261-DsRed cells in transgenic Thy1-CFP//LysM-EGFP//CD11c-EYFP reporter mice. We combined recurrent spectral two-photon imaging with multiparametric cytometry, immunostaining, and brain clearing to characterize at two critical stages of tumor development (day 21 and day 28 after tumor grafting) the nature and spatial distribution of the innate response in control and bevacizumab-treated mice.We report that at an early stage (21 day), VEGF blockade has a detectable effect on the number of microglial cells but only a mild effect on the number of infiltrating myeloid cells. At a later stage (day 28), the treatment resulted in a specific adjustment of dendritic cell subsets. In treated mice, the number of monocytes and their monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) progeny was increased by approximately twofold compared to untreated mice. In agreement, by in vivo quantitative imaging, we observed that treatment increased the number of LysM-EGFP cells traveling in tumor blood vessels and doubled the densities of both infiltrated LysM-EGFP monocytes and double-labeled EGFP/EYFP moDC. The treatment also led to an increased density of conventional cDCs2 subset together with a decrease of cDCs1 subset, necessary for the development of anti-tumor . Finally, we describe differential spatial cell distributions and two immune cell-traveling routes into the brain. LysM-EGFP cells distributed as a gradient from the meninges towards the tumor whereas CD11c-EYFP/MHCII cells were located in the basal area of the tumor. Brain clearing also revealed a flow of CD11c-EYFP cells following the corpus callosum.We uncovered new features in the dynamics of innate immune cells in GBM-bearing mice and deciphered precisely the key populations, i.e., DC subsets controlling immune responses, that are affected by VEGF blockade.

Here we have identified a novel STn-mAb that efficiently recognizes the EOC-associated STn antigen on CA125 when coated on Eu-NPs.CA125 from the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3, placental homogenate, and ascites fluid from patients with liver cirrhosis was captured by anti-CA125 antibody immobilized on microtitration wells and traced with anti-STn-mAb-Eu-NPs. Samples from EOC or patients with endometriosis with marginally increased conventional CA125 immunoassay (CA125; 35-200 U/mL) and healthy controls were analyzed.An analytically sensitive CA125 assay that specifically recognized the CA125 isoform produced by OVCAR-3 was achieved. Serum CA125 concentration was significantly higher in EOC patients than in those with endometriosis ( < 0.001). Furthermore, the sensitivity for detection of EOC with CA125 assay was 73.3% when 95% of endometriosis cases were undetectable.Our findings suggest that Eu-NPs-based CA125 assay could help reduce the false-positive rates of CA125 to improve differential diagnosis. The results encourage studying further the potential use of CA125 to detect EOC at earlier clinical stages. This approach warrants further investigation in other cancers as well.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654766>Characterization, subcellular localization and function analysis of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Pt-MyD88) in swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h2><p>Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a universal and essential adaptor protein required for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway activation in invertebrates as well as in vertebrates. Herein, we characterized a MyD88 (Pt-MyD88) cDNA sequence in the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). The Pt-MyD88 ORF is predicted to encode 469 peptides with an N-terminal death domain and a typical C-terminal TIR domain. Real-Time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the Pt-MyD88 transcriptions were constitutively expressed in hemocytes, gill, intestine, heart and muscle in normal crab. The expressions of Pt-MyD88 would be down-regulated by V. alginolyticus or LPS challenge, and be up-regulated by WSSV infection in hemocytes. Intracellular localization showed Pt-MyD88 was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm when it was over-expressed in human cell HEK293T or in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2). Functionally, over-expression of Pt-MyD88 could either activate the NF-κB in HEK293T cells or activate the promoters of Drosophila antimicrobial peptide genes (AMPs) in S2 cell. In primary cultured hemocytes of swimming crab, after Pt-MyD88 was knocked-down by specific long double strand RNA, the expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor1 (ALF1), hyastatin3, crustin1 and crustin3 have been significantly inhibited, while the expression of other AMPs is normal compared to non-specific dsRNA treated cells.Copyright © 2019.

We investigated CMV prevention strategies utilized among transplant centers in Thailand.A questionnaire on CMV prevention strategies for kidney transplant (KT) recipients was developed using a web-based electronic survey website (www.surveymonkey.com). The survey was delivered to 31 transplant centers in Thailand. One infectious disease physician (ID) and 1 nephrologist (NP) from each center were included.There were 43 respondents from 26 of the 31 transplant centers (84%), including 26 (60%) IDs and 17 (40%) NPs. Forty-one 95% (41/43) physicians agreed on the necessity of CMV prevention. Of these, 77% (33/43) physicians implemented prevention strategies for their patients. Interventions included preemptive approaches (48%), prophylaxis (45%), hybrid approaches; surveillance after prophylaxis (3%), and CMV-specific -guided approaches (3%). For CMV-seropositive KT recipients, use of preemptive approaches (84%) exceeded prophylaxis (12%). However, 81% of the former preferred targeted prophylaxis in patients receiving antithymocyte globulin therapy. Sixty-five percent and 93% of physicians started preemptive therapy when plasma CMV DNA loads reached 2000 and 3000 copies/mL (1820 and 2730 IU/mL), respectively. A significantly greater percentage of NPs initiated preemptive therapy at a plasma CMV DNA load of 1820 IU/mL compared with IDs (88% vs 50%;  = .02). The most common barrier to prevention strategy implementation was financial inaccessibility of oral valganciclovir (67%) and quantitative CMV DNA testing (12%).Most physicians agreed on a need for preemptive approaches, although prophylaxis was targeted in those receiving intense immunosuppression. The financial implication is the main barrier for CMV prevention in Thailand.© The Author(s) 2019.

Here, we performed an in silico based proteome-wide screening for antigenic B-cell derived T-cell epitopes and their following use to design a multi-epitope peptide vaccine that can effectively engage the host immune system against Acinetobacter nosocomialis SSA3 strain. Epitopes of the fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher FimD protein: YQQGINNYL and YRTNYTTVG were revealed appropriate for multi-epitope peptide construct designing. This protein has no homology to the host, essential to the pathogen survival and is localized at the pathogen surface. The predicted epitopes have high affinity for the highly expressed DRB*0101 allele in humans based on the lowest IC50 value in MHCPred and have an exo-membrane topology for efficient immune system recognition. The designed multi-epitope peptide vaccine is composed of the mentioned shortlisted antigenic epitopes linked to each other through a GPGPG linker, and an EAAAK linker that joined the multi-epitope peptide to the Cholera B subunit from Vibrio cholera as an adjuvant to increase vaccine construct antigenicity. The vaccine construct was docked and simulated with a transmembrane toll-like receptor (TLR4) that revealed construct stable binding with the TLR4 through the adjuvant, allowing the epitopes exposed to the host immune system essential for generating effective innate and long-lasting adaptive . The designed multi-epitope peptide vaccine may prompt the development of a vaccine to control refractory and deleterious A. nosocomialis infections.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In vertebrates, HSCs derive from the transition of the hemogenic endothelium (HE) in the floor of the embryonic dorsal aorta. Most recently, a series of proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and Toll-like receptor 4, have been confirmed to play a key role in HSC specification. However, the full complement of necessary signaling inputs remains unknown to date. Here, we show that interleukin-6R (IL6R) via IL6 is required and sufficient for HSC generation. We found that Notch activates IL6R by regulating its expression in the HE and in HSCs. The secretion of IL6 mainly originates from HSC-independent myeloid cells, but not from HSCs and their adjacent vascular endothelial cells. In addition, blocking IL6 signaling does not affect vascular development or the production of primitive erythrocytes. Taken together, our results uncover a previously obscure relationship between IL6 signaling and HSC production and provide new insights into HSC regeneration using proinflammatory factors in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658957>-infected dendritic cells communicate with NK cells via exosomes to activate anti-bacterial .</a></h2><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) and Natural killer (NK) cells are critically involved in the early response against various bacterial microbes.

Therefore, in our present study, we investigated the functional interplay between -infected DCs and NK cells. Our biochemical and cell biological experiments show that -infected dendritic cells (DCs) display enhanced exosome release. We find that such extracellular vesicles (referred to as dexosomes) do not contain infectious bacterial material but strongly induce IFN-γ production by NK cells. This directly affects  growth in infected target cells. Furthermore, NK cell-released IFN-γ in cooperation with TNF-α and/or dexosomes augments apoptosis of non-infected as well as infected epithelial cells. Thus, the combined effect of dexosomes and pro-inflammatory cytokines restricts  growth and attenuates bacterial subversion of apoptotic host cell death. In conclusion, this provides new insights into the functional cooperation between DCs, dexosomes and NK cells in the early steps of anti-chlamydial defense.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657480>Preschool wheezing diagnosis and management - survey of physicians' and caregivers' perspective.</a></h2><p>Preschool children with wheezing disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and consume disproportionately large amounts of healthcare resources .

These proteins have widespread intracellular localization and play an important role in many biological processes. Rab7 plays a crucial role in the innate immune system of crustaceans. In the present study, we cloned and characterized Rab7 from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), designated EsRab7. The full-length of the EsRab7 cDNA sequence is 1,257 bp and contains a 618-bp open reading frame encoding a 205-amino acid polypeptide. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the Rab7 protein was highly conserved during evolution. Quantitative real-time PCR showed the highest tissue expression in muscle, followed by hepatopancreas. EsRab7 was significantly upregulated in hemocytes after stimulation by Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Further studies showed that EsRab7 knockdown during bacterial stimulation resulted in decreased bacterial phagocytosis. In addition, EsRab7 regulated the expression of antimicrobial peptides via the Toll signaling pathway. Collectively, these results demonstrate that EsRab7 plays critical roles in antimicrobial function in the Chinese mitten crab.Copyright © 2019.

Samples from non-migrant individuals, Danish-born from Danish parents, were included as comparison. Analysis was carried out using multivariate logistic regression.14,561 first time urine samples were included, with E. coli being the most prevalent bacterial pathogen. Of the identified isolates 4,686/11,737 were E. coli among non-migrants and 1,032/2,824 among migrants.Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim resistance was found in 34.3% (350/1020) of E. coli isolates among migrants and 23.2% (1070/4619) among non-migrant patients (Odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95%CI: 1.47-2.03). Ciprofloxacin resistance was found in 5.8% (36/618) of isolates among migrants and 2.2% (67/3092) among non-migrants (OR 2.20, 95%CI:1.37-3.53). Gentamicin resistance was seen in 10.8% (61/565) and 4.7% (110/2328) of isolates (OR 2.33, 95%CI:1.63-3.34), Cefuroxime resistance in 8.5% (87/1019) and 3.4% (158/4618) (OR 2.40, 95%CI:1.77-3.24), Ampicillin resistance in 51.4% and 40.8% (OR 1.65, 95%CI: 1.42-1.92), and Piperacillin-Tazobactam resistance in 6.9 % (30/432) and 4.2% (65/1532) for migrant and non-migrant patients respectively. When stratifying according to migrant status, family-reunited had higher odds of resistance than refugees for Sulfamethoxazol-Trimethoprim, Gentamicin, and Ampicillin.Prevalence of antibiotic resistance was significantly higher in E. coli isolates among migrants, both refugees and family reunited, than non-migrant patients. Differences could not be explained by comorbidity or income. The results emphasise the importance of urine sample testing in both local-born and migrants before antibiotic start-up and points to the benefit of considering migration to secure individual treatment and equal health outcomes.© International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

However, DC vaccination is characterized by a robust safety profile, making this treatment a potential candidate for effective combination cancer immunotherapy. To explore this possibility, understanding changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon DC vaccination is required. In this line, quantitative and qualitative changes in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) induced by vaccination with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate loaded DCs were investigated in a series of 16 patients with metastatic melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, Foxp3, Granzyme B (GZMB), PDL1, and HLA class I was performed in tumor biopsies collected before and after DC vaccination. The density of each marker was quantified by automated digital pathology analysis on whole slide images. Co-expression of markers defining functional phenotypes, i.e., Foxp3 regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) and GZMB cytotoxic CD8 T cells, was assessed with sequential immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of CD8 TILs was found in post-vaccine biopsies of patients who were not previously treated with immune-modulating cytokines or Ipilimumab. Interestingly, along with a maintained tumoral HLA class I expression, after DC vaccination we observed a significant increase of PDL1 tumor cells, which significantly correlated with intratumoral CD8 T cell density. This observation might explain the lack of a significant concurrent cytotoxic reactivation of CD8 T cell, as measured by the numbers of GZMB T cells. Altogether these findings indicate that DC vaccination exerts an important role in sustaining or  inducing a T cell inflamed TME. However, the strength of the intratumoral T cell activation detected in post-DC therapy lesions is lessened by an occurring phenomenon of adaptive immune resistance, yet the concomitant PDL1 up-regulation. Overall, this study sheds light on DC immunotherapy-induced TME changes, lending the rationale for the design of smarter immune-combination therapies.Copyright © 2019 Bulgarelli, Tazzari, Granato, Ridolfi, Maiocchi, de Rosa, Petrini, Pancisi, Gentili, Vergani, Piccinini, Carbonaro, Leone, Foschi, Ancarani, Framarini and Guidoboni.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649668>The Roles of Peyer's Patches and Microfold Cells in the Gut Immune System: Relevance to Autoimmune Diseases.</a></h2><p>Microfold (M) cells are located in the epithelium covering mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as the Peyer's patches (PPs) of the small intestine. M cells actively transport luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response. The molecular machinery of M-cell differentiation and function has been vigorously investigated over the last decade. Studies have shed light on the role of M cells in the mucosal immune system and have revealed that antigen uptake by M cells contributes to not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses. However, M-cell studies usually focus on infectious diseases; the contribution of M cells to autoimmune diseases has remained largely unexplored. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is implicated in multiple systemic diseases, including autoimmune diseases. This implies that the uptake of microorganisms by M cells in PPs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We provide an outline of the current understanding of M-cell biology and subsequently discuss the potential contribution of M cells and PPs to the induction of systemic autoimmunity, beyond the mucosal immune response.Copyright © 2019 Kobayashi, Takahashi, Takano, Kimura and Hase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654611>Application of a novel FAM-conjugated activity-based probe to determine cathepsin G activity intracellularly.</a></h2><p>Cathepsin G (CatG) is responsible for several distinct immune processes of adaptive and innate  depending on extra- or intracellular occurrence of CatG. Recently, we established a method to detect CatG activity at the cell surface of natural killer cells by using the activity-based probe MARS116-Bt in flow cytometry. MARS116-Bt consists of biotin, spacer, amino acid sequence, and a phosphonate warhead which binds covalently to the serine amino acid residue within the active center of CatG. Herein, MARS116 was conjugated to 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) in order to limit non-specific signal-to-noise ratio generally resulting from binding of fluorescein-labelled avidin (avidin-FAM) to biotinylated, intracellular proteins; since MARS116-Bt is incubated with avidin-FAM in a second labelling step. MARS116-FAM was capable to detect intracellular CatG activity, in contrast to the control compound MARS116*-FAM which lacks the functional phosphonate warhead crucial for binding to the active-site of CatG and contains a carboxyl group instead. Furthermore, intracellular CatG activity was determined in CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells as well as in T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets. Thus, MARS116-FAM is a convenient activity-based probe to detect intracellular CatG activity in a flow cytometry approach.Copyright © 2019.

New data are necessary to understand the key factors involved in the immune system regulation. Six dairy cows were sampled during transition period to investigate the leukocyte transcriptome changes and its relationship with blood biomarkers. Blood samples were collected at - 20 ± 2, - 3 ± 1, 3, and 7 days from parturition (DFP). Leukocyte transcriptome was analyzed by deep sequencing technology (Hiseq1000 Illumina, USA). Plasma was analyzed for metabolic biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were used to run an enrichment analysis through the Dynamic Impact Approach (DIA). Considering - 20 DFP as references time, the main KEGG impacted pathways were activated before calving (- 3 DFP) and were connected to lipid metabolism, lipid transport in plasma, and phagosome. The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to  and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to lipid and amino acid metabolism were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy metabolism. Overall, this study confirmed that many changes in lipid metabolism and immune competence of the circulating leukocytes occurred in dairy cow around calving.

The excessive use of synthetic agrochemicals, declining soil nutrients, and water-use issues, amongst others, are threats to the ecosystem. Additionally, environmental degradation and an increasing global population that will reach 9 billion by 2030 are further considerations. These issues mean a decline in the volume of food resources available to feed the world. Therefore, sustainably increasing agricultural productivity is a necessity for restoring soil fertility, feeding the populace, and improving the ecosystem. A way to achieve this is by using eco-friendly microbial inoculants. Endophytes inhabit the tissues of plants asymptomatically without causing adverse effects. Bacterial and fungal endophytes benefit plants by promoting growth, suppressing pathogens, and improving the stress tolerance and  of plants. Despite this vital role played by endophytes in their interactions with host plants, there is still a paucity of relevant review data. More importantly, the prospective use of endophytes as an alternative to synthetic agrochemicals to ensure agro-ecological crop productivity has not been well reviewed in the literature.

Genetic variation of enhancer sequences is known to influence phenotypes, but the effect of enhancer variation upon enhancer functional activity and downstream phenotypes has barely been examined in any species. In the African malaria vector, Anopheles coluzzii, we identified candidate enhancers in the proximity of genes relevant for , insecticide resistance, and development. The candidate enhancers were functionally validated using luciferase reporter assays, and their activity was found to be essentially independent of their physical orientation, a typical property of enhancers. All of the enhancers segregated genetically polymorphic alleles, which displayed significantly different levels of functional activity. Deletion mutagenesis and functional testing revealed a fine structure of positive and negative regulatory elements that modulate activity of the enhancer core. Enhancer polymorphisms segregate in wild A. coluzzii populations in West Africa. Thus, enhancer variants that modify target gene expression leading to likely phenotypic consequences are frequent in nature. These results demonstrate the existence of naturally polymorphic A. coluzzii enhancers, which may help explain important differences between individuals or populations for malaria transmission efficiency and vector adaptation to the environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661047>Genetic and phenotypic intrastrain variation in herpes simplex virus type 1 Glasgow strain 17 syn+-derived viruses.</a></h2><p>The Glasgow s17 syn+ strain of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) is arguably the best characterized strain and has provided the reference sequence for HSV1 genetic studies. Here we show that our original s17 syn+ stock was a mixed population from which we have isolated a minor variant that, unlike other strains in the laboratory, fails to be efficiently released from infected cells and spreads predominantly by direct cell-to-cell transmission. Analysis of other s17-derived viruses that had been isolated elsewhere revealed a number with the same release phenotype. Second-generation sequencing of 8 plaque-purified s17-derived viruses revealed sequences that vary by 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including approximately 10 coding SNPs. This compared to interstrain variations of around 800 SNPs in strain Sc16, of which a quarter were coding changes. Amongst the variations found within s17, we identified 13 variants of glycoprotein C within the original stock of virus that were predominantly a consequence of altered homopolymeric runs of C residues. Characterization of seven isolates coding for different forms of gC indicated that all were expressed, despite six of them lacking a transmembrane domain. While the release phenotype did not correlate directly with any of these identified gC variations, further demonstration that nine clinical isolates of HSV1 also fail to spread through extracellular release raises the possibility that propagation in tissue culture had altered the HSV1 s17 transmission phenotype. Hence, the s17 intrastrain variation identified here offers an excellent model for understanding both HSV1 transmission and tissue culture adaptation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653482>Genome-wide Analyses of Chromatin State in Human Mast Cells Reveal Molecular Drivers and Mediators of Allergic and Inflammatory Diseases.</a></h2><p>Mast cells (MCs) are versatile immune cells capable of rapidly responding to a diverse range of extracellular cues. Here, we mapped the genomic and transcriptomic changes in human MCs upon diverse stimuli. Our analyses revealed broad H3K4me3 domains and enhancers associated with activation. Notably, the rise of intracellular calcium concentration upon immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated crosslinking of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) resulted in genome-wide reorganization of the chromatin landscape and was associated with a specific chromatin signature, which we term Ca-dependent open chromatin (COC) domains. Examination of differentially expressed genes revealed potential effectors of MC function, and we provide evidence for fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) as an MC mediator with potential relevance in chronic spontaneous urticaria. Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped onto cis-regulatory regions of human MCs suggest that MC function may impact a broad range of pathologies.

Nevertheless, the phytoalexins of Asian pine trees are ineffective against B. xylophilus. The anti-phytoalexin genes of B. xylophilus disable almost all Asian pine phytoalexins, which has allowed B. xylophilus to devastate pine forests in eastern Asia over the last four decades. However, to date, the factors that stimulate anti-phytoalexin gene expression and the mechanisms by which these genes act are not well understood.Here, we described anti-phytoalexin genes in B. xylophilus using transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses. The genes that were induced by both Pinus massoniana and carvone and had similarly elevated expression trends were considered anti-phytoalexin genes. Altogether, 187 anti-phytoalexin genes were identified, including 4 cathepsin genes. KEGG pathway enrichment indicated that those cathepsins were related to the Lysosome pathway. Since cathepsins help to maintain metabolic homeostasis by participating in the degradation of heterophagic and autophagic material, the lysosomal cathepsin gene Bx-cathepsin W was cloned and characterized.

The major post-splenectomy immune-defects against CMV are: weakened, delayed or absent anti-CMV IgM, and compensatory marked IgG response; severely impaired B-cell and CD4, CD8 T-cells function responses; and post-splenectomy, bone marrow compensates for the absence of spleen's immune responses against CMV, mimicking a monoclonal T-cell lymphoproliferative process.The puzzled diagnosis of the CMV syndrome post-splenectomy is of the most challenging and misleading, resulting in risky and costly interventions and a subsequent prolonged hospitalization (2 months). The mounting multi-disciplinary literature evidence renders us to suggest that splenectomized individuals are not only prone to encapsulated bacteria but also behave as immunocompromised to CMV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648909>Case report of delayed seroprotection rather than non-response after primary three-dose hepatitis B vaccination.</a></h2><p>We describe a delayed hepatitis B seroprotection 12 weeks after the primary vaccination schedule in a 57-year-old male with smoldering multiple myeloma. Based on undetectable anti-HBs antibodies 6 weeks after the third vaccination, the index person was previously considered to be a hepatitis B vaccine non-responder. Because hepatitis B vaccination started in the 1980s, many hepatitis B vaccine non-responders have received a revaccination regimen. If more cases of genuine delayed hepatitis B seroprotection surface in patients with hematologic malignancies, delayed seroprotection should be considered before the commencement of hepatitis B revaccination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, macaques infected with a barcoded SIVmac239 virus received cART beginning between 4- and 27-days post-infection, leading to the establishment of different levels of viral dissemination and persistence. Later treatment initiation led to higher SIV DNA levels maintained during treatment, which was significantly associated with an increased frequency of SIV reactivation and production of progeny capable of causing rebound viremia following treatment interruption. However, a 100-fold increase in SIV DNA in PBMCs was associated with only a 2-fold increase in the frequency of reactivation. These data suggest that the RCR can be established soon after infection, and that a large fraction of persistent viral DNA that accumulates after this time makes relatively little contribution to viral rebound.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658677>The Interplay between Dengue Virus and the Human Innate Immune System: A Game of Hide and Seek.</a></h2><p>With 40% of the world population at risk, infections with dengue virus (DENV) constitute a serious threat to public health. While there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. In order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during DENV infection. The activation of the innate  through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. This triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. However, DENV has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. This review elaborates on the interplay between DENV and the innate immune system. A special focus is given on the viral countermeasure mechanisms reported over the last decade which should be taken into consideration during vaccine development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655345>Adaptation of the metabolomics profile of rice after Pyricularia oryzae infection.</a></h2><p>Pyricularia oryzae (P. oryzae), one of the most devastating fungal pathogens, is the cause of blast disease in rice. Infection with a blast fungus induces biological responses in the host plant that lead to its survival through the termination or suppression of pathogen growth, and metabolite compounds play vital roles in plant interactions with a wide variety of other organisms. Numerous studies have indicated that rice has a multi-layered plant immune system that includes pre-developed (e.g., cell wall and phytoanticipins), constitutive and inducible (phytoalexins) defence barriers against stresses. Significant progress towards understanding the basis of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defence responses of rice to P. oryzae has been achieved. Nonetheless, even though the important metabolites in the responses of rice to pathogens have been identified, their exact mechanisms and their contributions to plant  against blast fungi have not been elucidated. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss recent advances towards the understanding of the integrated metabolite variations in rice after P. oryzae invasion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here we show that TCR signaling induces expression of amino acid transporters, and renders amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1 in aT reg cells. T reg cell-specific ablation of the Rag family small GTPases RagA and RagB impairs amino acid-induced mTORC1 signaling, causing defective amino acid anabolism, reduced T reg cell proliferation, and a rampant autoimmune disorder similar in severity to that triggered by T reg cell-specific TCR deficiency. Notably, T reg cells in peripheral tissues, including tumors, are more sensitive to Rag GTPase-dependent nutrient sensing. Ablation of RagA alone impairs T reg cell accumulation in the tumor, resulting in enhanced antitumor . Thus, nutrient mTORC1 signaling is an essential component of TCR-initiated T reg cell reprogramming, and Rag GTPase activities may be titrated to break tumor immune tolerance.© 2019 Do et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650942>[The Use of Glucocorticoid in the Management of Adverse Effects Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitors].</a></h2><p>Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activated the patients' tumor  to kill the tumor cell, and brought new hope to patients with tumor.

Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate  pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut microbiota can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut microbiota and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut microbiota through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649625>An iPSC-Derived Myeloid Lineage Model of Herpes Virus Latency and Reactivation.</a></h2><p>Herpesviruses undergo life-long latent infection which can be life-threatening in the immunocompromised. Models of latency and reactivation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) include primary myeloid cells, cells known to be important for HCMV latent carriage and reactivation . However, primary cells are limited in availability, and difficult to culture and to genetically modify; all of which have hampered our ability to fully understand virus/host interactions of this persistent human pathogen. We have now used iPSCs to develop a model cell system to study HCMV latency and reactivation in different cell types after their differentiation down the myeloid lineage. Our results show that iPSCs can effectively mimic HCMV latency/reactivation in primary myeloid cells, allowing molecular interrogations of the viral latent/lytic switch. This model may also be suitable for analysis of other viruses, such as HIV and Zika, which also infect cells of the myeloid lineage.Copyright © 2019 Poole, Huang, Forbester, Shnayder, Nachshon, Kweider, Basaj, Smith, Jackson, Liu, Shih, Kiskin, Roche, Murphy, Wills, Morrell, Dougan, Stern-Ginossar, Rana and Sinclair.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656088>Gene-gene interaction and association of Wnt/&Beta;-catenin signalling pathway gene polymorphisms with ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility in the Chinese Han population.</a></h2><p> To explore the genetic interaction between Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway genes and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Chinese population.

AML with mutated NPM1 is recognised as a separate entity in the World Health Organisation 2016 classification, and carries a relatively favourable prognosis. NPM1 mutations are predominantly 4 bp duplications or insertions in the terminal exon that arise through an unknown mechanism. Here we analyse 2430 NPM1 mutations from 2329 adult and 101 pediatric patients to address their origin. We show that NPM1 mutations display the hallmarks of replication slippage, but lack suitable germline microhomology available for priming. Insertion mutations display G/C-rich N-nucleotide tracts, with a significant bias towards polypurine and polypyrimidine stacking (p < 0.001). These features suggest terminal deoxyucleotidyl transferase (TdT) primes replication slippage through N-nucleotide addition, with longer syntheses manifesting as N-regions. The recurrent Type A, Type D and Type B mutations require 1, 2 and 3 N-nucleotide extensions of T, CC and CAT respectively, with the last nucleotide used as occult microhomology. This TdT-mutator model successfully predicts the relative incidence of the 256 potential 4bp insertion/duplication mutations at position c.863_864 over four orders of magnitude (rho = 0.484, p < 0.0001). Children have a different NPM1 mutation spectrum to adults, including a shift away from Type A mutations and towards longer N-regions, consistent with higher TdT activity in pediatric myeloid stem cells. These findings complement our FLT3-ITD data, suggesting illegitimate TdT activity contributes to around half of AMLs.

This includes tumor mutations that generate neo-antigenic epitopes that elicit cytotoxic T-cell activity and subsequent pressure to select for genetic loss of antigen presentation. Most studies have focused on how tumor missense mutations can drive tumor , but frameshift mutations have the potential to create far greater antigenic diversity. However, expression of this antigenic diversity is potentially regulated by Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) and NMD has been shown to be of variable efficiency in cancers. Here we studied how mutational changes influence global NMD and cytolytic immune responses. Using TCGA datasets, we derived novel patient-level metrics of 'NMD burden' and interrogated how different mutation and most importantly NMD burdens influence cytolytic activity using machine learning models and survival outcomes. We find that NMD is a significant and independent predictor of immune cytolytic activity. Different indications exhibited varying dependence on NMD and mutation burden features. We also observed significant co-alteration of genes in the NMD pathway, with a global increase in NMD efficiency in patients with NMD co-alterations. Finally, NMD burden also stratified patient survival in multivariate regression models in subset of cancer types. Our work suggests that beyond selecting for mutations that elicit NMD in tumor suppressors, tumor evolution may react to the selective pressure generated by inflammation to globally enhance NMD through coordinated amplification and/or mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655797>Overexpression of steroid sulfotransferase genes is associated with worsened prognosis and with immune exclusion in clear cell-renal cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Steroid sulfotransferase (SULT) plays physiological roles but its role in clear cell-renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear. We therefore investigated genetic alteration of steroid SULT genes in ccRCC.Overexpression of any of SULT genes occurred in ~8% of ccRCC patients. Overexpression of steroid SULT genes was associated with worsened prognosis. Steroid SULT gene-upregulated ccRCC cases showed mutual exclusivity with mutations of VHL, SETD2 and PBRM1, and with focal deletions of 3p and 9p, respectively. Expressions of SULT genes were negatively correlated with that of VHL, SETD2 and PBRM1, respectively.

However, many novel "non-canonical" functions, alternative substrates, and regulatory mechanisms have been described and are being continuously elucidated. The activity of LOXs, therefore, appears to be integrated into a complex network of signals regulating many cell functions, including survival/proliferation/differentiation. Among these signaling pathways, TGF-β and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in particular, cross-talk extensively with each other and with LOXs also initiating complex feedback loops which modulate the activity of LOXs and direct the remodeling of the ECM. A growing body of evidence indicates that LOXs are not only important in the homeostasis of the normal structure of the ECM, but are also implicated in the establishment and maturation of the tumor microenvironment. LOXs' association with advanced and metastatic cancer is well established; however, there is enough evidence to support a significant role of LOXs in the transformation of normal epithelial cells, in the accelerated tumor development and the induction of invasion of the premalignant epithelium.

Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups.

Studies have evaluated the safety, feasibility, and expedited neutrophil recovery associated with the transplantation of CD34+ HSPCs from ex vivo expansion cultures using the aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonist StemRegenin-1 (SR1). In a phase 1/2 study of 17 patients who received combined SR1-expanded and unexpanded UCB units, a considerable advantage for enhancing T-cell chimerism was not observed. We previously showed that progenitor T (proT) cells generated in vitro from HSPCs accelerated T-cell reconstitution and restored  after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To expedite immune recovery, we hypothesized that SR1-expanded HSPCs together with proT cells could overcome the known T-cell immune deficiency that occurs post-HSCT. Here, we show that SR1-expanded UCB can induce >250-fold expansion of CD34+ HSPCs, which can generate large numbers of proT cells upon in vitro differentiation. When compared with nonexpanded naive proT cells, SR1 proT cells also showed effective thymus-seeding and peripheral T-cell functional capabilities in vivo despite having an altered phenotype. In a competitive transfer approach, both naive and SR1 proT cells showed comparable thymus-engrafting capacities. Single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral CD3+ T cells from mice injected with either naive or SR1 proT cells revealed functional subsets of T cells with polyclonal T-cell receptor repertoires.

However, the antileukemia effect of DS-5272 is markedly attenuated in immunodeficient mice, indicating the critical impact of systemic immune responses that drive p53-mediated leukemia suppression. In relation to this, DS-5272 triggers immune-inflammatory responses in MLL-AF9 cells including upregulation of Hif1α and PD-L1, and inhibition of the Hif1α-PD-L1 axis sensitizes AML cells to p53 activation.

These range from microbial deposit and filter feeders, micro and macrophagous algal feeders, omnivores to herbivorous leaf litter and wood feeders. Endo-β-1,4-glucanase from glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) digests cellulose like β-1,4-glucans from a range of materials. As it hydrolyses crystalline cellulose very slowly, it is a poor cellulase. Where tested, the enzyme has dual endo-β-1,4-glucanase and lichenase activity. Its presence does not necessarily indicate the ability of an animal to digest cellulose. It only indicates the ability to digest β-1,4-glucans and its function, which is discussed in this review, should be considered with reference to the substrates present in the diet. β-1,3-glucanase (laminarinase) belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GH16) and hydrolyses β-1.3-glucans. These polysaccharides are present in the cell walls of algae, protozoans and yeast, and they also occur as storage polysaccharides within protozoans and algae. Depending on their site of expression, these enzymes may function as a digestive enzyme or may be involved in innate . Enzymes present in the digestive fluids or tissues, would be digestive. Haemolymph GH16 proteins may be involved in innate  through the activation of the phenol oxidase system. Insect GH16 proteins expressed within the haemolymph have lost their catalytic residues and function as β-glucan binding proteins. In contrast, crustacean GH16 proteins expressed within the same tissue, have retained the catalytic residues and thus possibly their β-1,3-glucanase activity. The potential function of which is discussed. Endo-β-1,4-mannase from glycosyl hydrolase family 5, subfamily 10 (GH5_10) hydrolyses mannan, glucomannan and galactomannan.

They are digestive enzymes whose high expression in some species suggests they are a major contributor to hemicellulose digestion. They may also provide the animal with substantial amounts of monosaccharides for energy.Copyright © 2019.

The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion protein is targeted by the most broadly reactive HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Here, we examine the structural and molecular mechansims of neutralization by anti-MPER bnAb, LN01, which was isolated from lymph-node-derived germinal center B cells of an elite controller and exhibits broad neutralization breadth. LN01 engages both MPER and the transmembrane (TM) region, which together form a continuous helix in complex with LN01. The tilted TM orientation allows LN01 to interact simultaneously with the peptidic component of the MPER epitope and membrane via two specific lipid binding sites of the antibody paratope. Although LN01 carries a high load of somatic mutations, most key residues interacting with the MPER epitope and lipids are germline encoded, lending support for the LN01 epitope as a candidate for lineage-based vaccine development.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

However, nothing is known about the potential interplay between Tregs and HCV. In this pilot study, we have investigated the ability of Tregs to hang HCV on and the subsequent effect on their suppressive function and phenotype. Moreover, we have evaluated how HCV could promote the recruitment of Tregs by infected primary human hepatocytes.Tregs of healthy donors were incubated with JFH-1/HCVcc. Viral inoculation was assessed using adapted assays (RT-qPCR, Flow Citometry (FACS) and Western Blot (WB). Expression of Tregs phenotypic (CD4, CD25, CD127 and Foxp3) and functional (IL-10, GZMB, TGF-β1 and IL-2) markers was monitored by RT-qPCR, FACS and ELISA. Suppressive activity was validated by suppressive assays. Tregs recruitment by infected primary hepatic cells was evaluated using Boyden Chamber.Tregs express the classical HCV receptors (CD81, CLDN1 and LDLR) and some co-receptors (CD5). HCV inoculation significantly increases the suppressive phenotype and activity of Tregs, and raises their anergy by inducing an unexpected IL-2 production. Moreover, HCV infection induces the expression of chemokines (CCL17, CXCL16, and CCL20) by primary hepatic human hepatocytes and chemokine receptors (CCR4, CXCR6 and CCR6) by Tregs. Finally, infected hepatocytes have a significantly higher potential to recruit Tregs in a seemingly CCL20-dependent manner.Direct interaction between HCV and Tregs represents a newly defined mechanism that could potentiate HCV immune evasion and favor intratumoral recruitment contributing to HCC progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649621>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Pathway Networks and Mitochondrial Dynamics in the Pathogenesis of Pituitary Adenomas.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrion is a multi-functional organelle, which is associated with various signaling pathway networks, including energy metabolism, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, cell cycles, autophagy, and  process.

This article reviews the latest experimental evidence and potential biological roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial dynamics in pituitary adenoma progression, potential molecular mechanisms between mitochondria and pituitary adenoma progression, and current status and perspectives of mitochondria-based biomarkers and targeted drugs for effective management of pituitary adenomas.Copyright © 2019 Li and Zhan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657345>[Progress in programmed death-1 signaling pathway in sepsis].</a></h2><p>Sepsis includes a highly diverse and dynamic mixture of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). In the past, drugs produced to block the early inflammatory response had little effect on reversing the development of sepsis. Recent studies have shown that the mortality and prognosis of patients are significantly correlated with the immunosuppression of sepsis and the overexpression of co-inhibitory molecules. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a recently focused co-inhibitory molecule, which can regulate the functions of a variety of immune cells and participate in innate  and acquired . It has important value in risk stratification and prognosis prediction of patients with sepsis, and can be used as one of the intervention targets for immune regulation in sepsis in the future. The role of PD-1 signaling pathway in immunosuppression and its effect on patients' prognosis is reviewed in this article, providing new directions for the treatment of sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653122>Effects of Regulatory T Cell Depletion on NK Cell Responses against  in Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Cats.</a></h2><p>Regulatory T cells (Treg) are key players in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases and restraining chronic inflammatory diseases. Evidence suggests Treg cells and NK cells have important roles in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) pathogenesis; however, in vivo studies investigating the interplay between these two cell populations are lacking. We previously described innate immune defects in FIV-infected cats characterized by cytokine deficits and impaired natural killer cell (NK) and NK T cell (NKT) functions. In this study, we investigated whether in vivo Treg depletion by treatment with an anti-feline CD25 monoclonal antibody would improve the innate immune response against subcutaneous challenge with  (Lm). Treg depletion resulted in an increased overall number of cells in Lm-draining lymph nodes and increased proliferation of NK and NKT cells in FIV-infected cats. Treg depletion did not normalize expression of perforin or granzyme A by NK and NKT cells, nor did Treg depletion result in improved clearance of Lm. Thus, despite the quantitative improvements in the NK and NKT cell responses to Lm, there was no functional improvement in the early control of Lm. CD1a+ dendritic cell percentages in the lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats were lower than in specific-pathogen-free control cats and failed to upregulate CD80 even when Treg were depleted. Taken together, Treg depletion failed to improve the innate immune response of FIV-infected cats against Lm and this may be due to dendritic cell dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649152>Conservation of cell-intrinsic immune responses in diverse nonhuman primate species.</a></h2><p>Differences in immune responses across species can contribute to the varying permissivity of species to the same viral pathogen. Understanding how our closest evolutionary relatives, nonhuman primates (NHPs), confront pathogens and how these responses have evolved over time could shed light on host range barriers, especially for zoonotic infections. Here, we analyzed cell-intrinsic  of primary cells from the broadest panel of NHP species interrogated to date, including humans, great apes, and Old and New World monkeys. Our analysis of their transcriptomes after poly(I:C) transfection revealed conservation in the functional consequences of their response. In mapping reads to either the human or the species-specific genomes, we observed that with the current state of NHP annotations, the percent of reads assigned to a genetic feature was largely similar regardless of the method. Together, these data provide a baseline for the cell-intrinsic responses elicited by a potent immune stimulus across multiple NHP donors, including endangered species, and serve as a resource for refining and furthering the existing annotations of NHP genomes.© 2019 Gaska et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652599>Additional Evidence on Serological Correlates of Protection against Measles: An Observational Cohort Study among Once Vaccinated Children Exposed to Measles.</a></h2><p>To assess correlates of protection against measles and against subclinical measles virus (MV) infection, we recruited once-vaccinated children from geographic regions associated with increased MV circulation and/or at schools with low vaccination coverage in the Netherlands. Paired blood samples were collected shortly after onset of the measles outbreak and after the outbreak. A questionnaire was used to document the likelihood of exposure to MV and occurrence of measles-like symptoms. All blood samples were tested for MV-specific antibodies with five different assays. Correlates of protection were assessed by considering the lowest neutralizing antibody levels in children without MV infection, and by ROC analyses. Among 91 participants, two seronegative children (2%) developed measles, and an additional 19 (23%) experienced subclinical MV infection. The correlate of protection against measles was lower than 0.345 IU/mL. We observed a decreasing attack rate of subclinical MV infection with increasing levels of specific antibodies until 2.1 IU/mL, above which no subclinical MV infections were detected. The ROC analyses found a correlate of protection of 1.71 IU/mL (95% CI 1.01-2.11) for subclinical MV infection. Our correlates of protection were consistent with previous estimates.

In wild populations of some species, including murid rodents, lifespans are substantially modified by environmental signals that affect an individual's response to such challenges as unfavourable climatic conditions, parasitic load etc. But the real impact of ageing on natural mortality of most species remains obscure. To clarify how age affects the responsiveness of organisms to environmental challenges, we performed longitudinal laboratory observations of wild-derived northern red-backed voles (Myodes rutilus). We fixed individual longevity and measured metabolic indexes (basal and maximal metabolic rates), ability to maintain body temperature under acute cooling, plasma corticosterone, indexes of acquired and innate  in the same individuals of 3-4, 6-7 and 9-10 months old. The maximum estimated lifespan was about 2 years 8 months, which is considerably older than in nature, but less than 30% of individuals passed the one-year milestone. Regardless of the intense mortality, in the first year of life, animals did not demonstrate any age-related deterioration in physiological functions, except leucocyte number. No consistency in any individual physiological index was found. As the individual longevity of red-backed voles varied between years of captivity, we suggest that the welfare and lifespan of wild animals in captivity may be affected by the environmental conditions in the period preceding removal of the animal from the wild.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657973>Inflammatory bowel diseases: interrelationships between dietary vitamin D, exposure to UV radiation and the faecal microbiome.</a></h2><p>: Environmental factors and an altered faecal microbiome are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome, with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut microbiome and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive  through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal microbiome either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal , fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host  and the gut microbiome. Further research and increased understanding of environment-host interactions is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of preventing and curing IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653097>Special Issue "IFN-Independent ISG Expression and its Role in Antiviral Cell-Intrinsic Innate ".</a></h2><p>Over the last few decades, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that numerous Interferon(IFN) stimulate genes (ISGs) can be directly upregulated following virus infection independent ofIFN signaling [...].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658667>Revising PTEN in the Era of Immunotherapy: New Perspectives for an Old Story.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has emerged as the new therapeutic frontier of cancer treatment, showing enormous survival benefits in multiple tumor diseases. Although undeniable success has been observed in clinical trials, not all patients respond to treatment. Different concurrent conditions can attenuate or completely abrogate the usefulness of immunotherapy due to the activation of several escape mechanisms. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has an almost full immunosuppressive profile, creating an obstacle to therapeutic treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) governs a plethora of cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival/apoptosis, migration, and metabolism. The repertoire of PTEN functions has recently been expanded to include regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immune system, leading to a drastic reevaluation of the canonical paradigm of PTEN action with new potential implications for immunotherapy-based approaches. Understanding the implication of PTEN in cancer immunoediting and immune evasion is crucial to develop new cancer intervention strategies. Recent evidence has shown a double context-dependent role of PTEN in anticancer .

Although phototherapy and some chemotherapy can trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) for T cell-mediated antitumor immune response, their immunotherapy efficacy is severely restricted by insufficient phototherapeutic capability and severe multidrug resistance (MDR). Inspired by both the hypersensitivity to phototherapy and the key role in MDR for mitochondria, a rationally engineered  amplifier via mitochondria-targeted photo-chemotherapeutic nanoparticles was, for the first time, achieved to fight against low-immunogenic breast cancer without additional immune agent. The newly synthesized task-specific mitochondria-targeted IR780 derivative (T780) was integrated with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to form multifunctional nanoparticles via assembling strategy along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as biomimetic corona (BSA@T780/DOX NPs). The in situ enhancement in both phototherapy and MDR reversal by targeting mitochondria with BSA@T780/DOX NPs boosted high-efficient ICD toward excellent antitumor immune response. The newly developed strategy not only eradicated the primary tumor, but also eliminated the bilateral tumors efficiently, as well as preventing metastasis and postsurgical recurrence, demonstrating great interest for fighting against low-immunogenic breast cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659021>An onboard checking mechanism ensures effector delivery of the type VI secretion system in .</a></h2><p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal yet energetically costly weapon in gram-negative bacteria. Through contraction of a long sheath, the T6SS ejects a few copies of effectors accompanied by hundreds of structural carrier proteins per delivery. The few ejected effectors, however, dictate T6SS functions. It remains elusive how the T6SS ensures effector loading and avoids futile ejection. Here, by systemically mutating the active sites of 3  effectors, TseL, VasX, and VgrG3, we show that the physical presence but not their activities is crucial for T6SS assembly. We constructed catalytic mutants of TseL and VgrG3 and truncated VasX mutants. These mutations abolished the killing of the effector-cognate  mutants. We determined that the VasX-mediated antimicrobial activity is solely dependent on the C-terminal colicin domain. Removal of the colicin domain abolished VasX secretion and reduced T6SS assembly, while deletion of the colicin internal loop abolished its toxicity but had little effect on secretion and assembly. The triple effector-inactive mutant maintains an active T6SS that is capable of delivering chimeric VgrG, PAAR, and TseL proteins fused with a cargo nuclease, indicating effector activities are not required for T6SS assembly or penetration into the cytosol of recipient cells. Therefore, by recruiting effectors as critical components for T6SS assembly, it represents an effective onboard checking mechanism that ensures effectors are loaded in place to prevent futile secretion. Our study also demonstrates a detoxified secretion platform by inactivating native effector activities that could translocate engineered cargo proteins via multiple routes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657805>The clinical utility of three visual attention tests to distinguish adults with ADHD from normal controls.</a></h2><p>Adult patients with ADHD may go unrecognised and undiagnosed.

ADHD was diagnosed with Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (n=14) and were matched for gender and age against normal controls (n=30). Three computer-based tasks, Stroop test, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity test were completed. Accuracy (%) and response time (ms) were measured. Generalized Estimating Equations method was used to analyse those repeated measurements data. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each test.Mean age of cases was 47.29 (SD 9.03), 9 males. Mean age of controls was 41.57 (SD 11.42), 13 males. Individuals with ADHD had significantly worse performances in both accuracy and response time in all the tests. The best discriminate ability was the Stroop test (accuracy and response time), followed by the Perceptual Selectivity test (response time). Comparisons of AUCs of the tests did not show any significant differences. Age had a significant effect on the Stroop and Stroop Plus tests but not in the Perceptual Selectivity test.Adults with ADHD have a longer response time and perform less accurately than controls. Thus, these data suggest that there is a use for objective visual attention tests in the diagnosis of adult ADHD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661636>The Extra-pulmonary Effects of CFTR Modulators in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>The effects of CFTR modulators on lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life have been well documented. However, CF is a multi-organ disease and therefore an evidence base is emerging on the systemic effects of CFTR modulators beyond the pulmonary system. This is of great clinical importance as many of these studies provide proof-of-concept that CFTR modulators might be used one day to prevent or treat extra-pulmonary manifestations stemming from CFTR dysfunction.

To date, the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation for immunomodulation in healthy adults without disease has not been evaluated in a systematic review.The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation on circulating immune and inflammatory markers of healthy adults compared to placebo.PubMed, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Science, ProQuest, and Cochrane databases were searched for English articles up to May 15, 2019. Additional papers were identified by checking references of relevant papers. Only randomized controlled trials studying the administration of probiotic supplements compared to placebo on immune and inflammatory markers in healthy adults (aged 18 to 65 years), without acute or chronic disease, and in generally good health were examined. Independent extraction of articles was conducted by two authors using predefined search terms and restrictions/filters. The methodologic quality of each study was appraised using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library Quality Rating Worksheet and the body of evidence was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Grade Definitions and Conclusion Grading Table.Eighteen articles, including 819 subjects, met eligibility criteria and were included in the present systematic review. Five articles were rated neutral in quality and 13 were rated high in quality. Eight articles reported a significant effect on immune and/or inflammatory parameters including increases in natural killer cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes, and decreases in proinflammatory cytokine concentrations.Based on the 18 articles extracted in this systemic review, probiotic supplementation was concluded to have a limited effect on immune and inflammatory markers in healthy adults. Overall, the evidence was heterogenous, precluding a meta-analysis, and difficult to aggregate and conclude on effect size.PROSPERO ref CRD42018110856.Copyright © 2019 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Among 25,952 patients with IE (62.2 ± 18·6 years; 65.9% men), 45.9% had NIE. The incidence of IE increased from 2.83 to 3.73 due to the NIE incidence increment with a decline in CIE. Patients with NIE were older (63.8 years vs. 60.8 years,  < 0·001), presented a higher Charlson index (1.22 vs. 1.03,  < 0.001), a greater history of implanted cardiac devices (8.7% vs. 4.6%,  < 0.001), and higher mortality (31.5% vs. 21.7%,  < 0.001). The most frequent microorganism for both NIE and CIE was  ( < 0.001), and the North reported a higher incidence ( < 0.001). Risk factors of mortality for NIE were age, Charlson index, hemodialysis, shock, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors for CIE included female sex, renal disease, and cardiac-device carriers.

A prospective multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone HSCT compared with healthy age-matched controls. Participants were vaccinated between 2013 and 2016 according to Australian guidelines. Influenza-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres were performed prior to each vaccination and 4 weeks following the final vaccination. A nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was performed on participants that developed influenza-like illness. There were 86 children recruited; 43 who had undergone HSCT and 43 controls.

In other peripheral tissues such as the skeletal muscle, anti-transgene immune response can result in partial or complete clearance of the transduced fibers. Here, we characterized liver-induced transgene tolerance after simultaneous transduction of liver and muscle. A clinically relevant transgene, α-sarcoglycan, mutated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D, was fused with the SIINFEKL epitope (hSGCA-SIIN) and expressed with adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV-hSGCA-SIIN). Intramuscular delivery of AAV-hSGCA-SIIN resulted in a strong inflammatory response, which could be prevented and reversed by concomitant liver expression of the same antigen. Regulatory T cells and upregulation of checkpoint inhibitor receptors were required to establish and maintain liver-mediated peripheral tolerance. This study identifies the fundamental role of the synergy between Tregs and upregulation of checkpoint inhibitor receptors in the liver-mediated control of anti-transgene  triggered by muscle-directed gene transfer.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653702>Structural and computational examination of the Arabidopsis profilin-Poly-P complex reveals mechanistic details in profilin-regulated actin assembly.</a></h2><p>Profilins are abundant cytosolic proteins that are universally expressed in eukaryotes and regulate actin filament elongation by binding to both monomeric actin (G-actin) and formin proteins. The atypical profilin Arabidopsis AtPRF3 has been reported to cooperate with canonical profilin isoforms in suppressing formin-mediated actin polymerization during plant innate  responses. AtPRF3 has a 37-amino-acid-long N terminal extension (NTE), and its suppressive effect on actin assembly is derived from enhanced interaction with the poly-proline (Poly-P) of the formin AtFH1. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structures of AtPRF3Δ22 and AtPRF3Δ37, as well as AtPRF2 apo form and in complex with AtFH1 Poly-P at 1.5-3.6 Å resolutions. By combining these structures with molecular modeling, we found that AtPRF3Δ22 NTE has high plasticity, with a primary "closed" conformation that can adopt an open conformation that enables Poly-P binding. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulation and free-energy calculations of protein-protein binding, along with experimental validation, we show that the AtPRF3Δ22 binds to Poly-P in an adaptive manner, thereby enabling different binding modes that maintain the interaction through disordered sequences. Together, our structural and simulation results suggest that the dynamic conformational changes of the AtPRF3 NTE upon Poly-P binding modulate their interactions to fine-tune formin-mediated actin assembly.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647987>Thymosin-β12 characteristics and function in Urechis unicinctus.</a></h2><p>β-thymosin family comprise a series of heat-stable multifunctional polypeptides involved in actin regulation, anti-inflammation, wound healing, cell migration, angiogenesis, cardiac protection, antimicrobial processes and antiviral .

In this study, we cloned the Tβ12 gene with an ORF of 126 bp coding 41 amino acids from Urechis unicinctus. Tissue distribution analysis by qRT-PCR used TBP as reference gene showed that Tβ12 was widely expressed in all tissues, and the transcript levels were the highest in the body wall, followed by the coelomic fluid, and the lowest in the intestines and anal sacs. After LPS (lipopolysaccharides) injection, Tβ12 expression in the body was first elevated significantly at 3 h (p < 0.05), indicating that the body wall was the first defense line of the innate immune system; in the coelomic fluid, the Tβ12 mRNA levels increased after LPS injection, with a significant increase occurring at 6 h, showing that coelomic fluid functioned as the second defense line of the innate immune system. In the midgut and anal sacs, a significant increase in the Tβ12 level occurred at 24 h, suggesting that the midgut and anal sacs may act as accessory organs for the innate immune system. Moreover, U. unicinctus Tβ12 recombinants can effectively inhibit the growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. These results indicate that U. unicinctus Tβ12 plays important roles in innate antibacterial immune responses, which can deepen our understanding of Tβ12 in marine invertebrates.Copyright © 2019.

Brucella canis is a rare source of human brucellosis in China, and its public health significance remains under debate. Moreover, data pertaining to the epizootiological characteristics and geographical origin of B. canis on a nationwide scale are limited, and the risk to public safety posed by B. canis infections is unknown. The MLVA (multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis) assay can be helpful to analyze epidemiological correlations among Brucella isolates and to track their geographic origins.

Sixty-three B. canis strains were sorted into three large clusters (A, B, and C) and 50 different genotypes (GT1-50), and 43 unique genotypes were represented by single isolates, suggesting that these strains had no obvious epidemiological links and that canine brucellosis is predominantly sporadic in China. The other seven shared genotypes (among a total of 20 isolates) were each represented by two to eight isolates, indicating that strains from each shared genotype were epidemiologically correlated. Five of the shared genotypes were from 16 strains obtained from Beijing, indicating that canine brucellosis in Beijing originates from multipoint outbreaks with multiple sources of infection. Based on comprehensive case analysis of clinical B. canis infection, we preliminarily suggest that human B. canis infections are associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection that results in decreased patient . B. canis may have limited epidemiological significance for the healthy population, but it remains a significant threat to the canine breeding industry and to humans who come into close contact with dogs. Based on MLVA-11 data, B. canis strains were clustered into 16 genotypes and divided into five evolutionary branches; these data confirm that this population covers an extensive geographic area and exhibits characteristics of the origin and evolution of co-existing introduced and locally native lineages. We believe this study will contribute to strengthening efforts to prevent and control canine brucellosis and to improve public understanding of the health risks posed by B. canis.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660257>Antibacterial immune functions of subadults and adults in a semelparous spider.</a></h2><p>Although capacity to mount an efficient immune response plays a critical role in individuals' survival, its dynamics across ontogenetic stages is still largely unexplored. Life stage-dependent variation in the encountered diversity and prevalence of parasites were proposed to contribute to stage-dependent changes in , but differences in life history objectives between developmental stages may also lead to stage-specific changes in efficiency of given immune mechanisms. The reason for this is that juveniles and subadults are unable to reproduce, therefore they invest resources mainly into survival, while adults have to partition their resources between survival and reproduction. The general trade-off between somatic maintenance and reproductive effort is expected to impair immune function. Especially so in semelparous organisms that only reproduce once throughout their lifetime, hence they do not face the trade-off between current and future reproduction. We hypothesised that in a semelparous species individuals would be characterised by decreased investment into somatic maintenance after maturation, in order to maximise their reproductive output. Accordingly, we predicted that (1) elements of somatic maintenance, such as , should be relatively weaker in adults in comparison to subadults, and (2) increased reproductive investment in adults should be associated with lower immune efficiency. We quantified two markers of  in subadult and adult individuals of the semelparous wolf spider  (Westring, 1861), namely bacterial growth inhibition power and bacterial cell wall lytic activity. We found that subadults showed significantly higher cell wall lytic activity than adults, but the two life stages did not differ in their capacity to inhibit bacterial growth. Also, we found weaker immune measures in mated females compared to virgins. Furthermore, in mated females bacterial growth inhibition power was negatively associated with fecundity.© 2019 Rádai et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653676>Strengthening Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children: The Role of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648530>Bioanalysis of adeno-associated virus gene therapy therapeutics: regulatory expectations.</a></h2><p>The number of gene therapy (GTx) modality therapies in development has grown significantly in the last few years.

In cells, release from the C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) of FHOD1 stimulates the protein into the active form. However, the cellular physiological relevance of active form FHOD1 and the phenotypic regulation by FHOD1 depletion are not completely understood. Here, we show that in contrast with the cytosolic diffused expression of auto-inhibited FHOD1, active FHOD1 by C-terminal truncation was recruited into all three types of actin stress fibers in human osteosarcoma cells. Notably, the recruited active FHOD1 was more incorporated with myosin II than α-actinin, and associated with both naïve and mature focal adhesions. Active FHOD1 displayed faster turnover than actin molecules on ventral stress fibers. Moreover, we witnessed the emergence of active FHOD1 from the cell periphery, which subsequently moved centripetally together with transverse arcs. Furthermore, FHOD1 knockdown resulted in defective maturation of actomyosin bundles and subsequently longer non-contractile dorsal stress fibers, whereas the turnover of both actin and myosin II were maintained normally. Importantly, the loss of FHOD1 led to slower actin centripetal flow, resulting in abnormal cell spreading and migration defects. Taken together, these results reveal a critical role of FHOD1 in temporal- and spatial- control of the morphology and dynamics of functional actin stress fibers during variable cell behavior.© 2019 The Author(s).

Cow urine has not been investigated for the presence of these peptides using MALDI-TOF-MS.The aim of this study is to isolate, identify and assess the antimicrobial activity of urinary antimicrobial peptides from healthy normal cycling cows.We analyzed the urine sample using diafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE) coupled with identification through peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The in-vitro antimicrobial effects of purified fractions were assessed using radial diffusion assay (RDA) and microtitre broth dilution assay against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.Proteins corresponding to the peaks were identified using SWISSPROT protein database. This study revealed constitutive expression of β-Defensin-1 (DEFB1), β-Defensin-4A (DFB4A), Neutrophil Defensin-1 (DEF1), Neutrophil Defensin-3 (DEF3) in cow urine. The identified peptides are cationic antimicrobial peptides of the defensin family.

In England, there has been a long-standing national vaccination programme, with vaccination of at-risk groups and children offering partial protection against infection. Transmission models have been a fundamental component of analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. Here, we amalgamate multiple data sources to calibrate a susceptible-latent-infected-recovered type transmission model for seasonal influenza, incorporating the four main strains and mechanisms linking prior season epidemiological outcomes to  at the beginning of the following season. Data pertaining to nine influenza seasons, starting with the 2009/10 season, informed our estimates for epidemiological processes, virological sample positivity, vaccine uptake and efficacy attributes, and general practitioner influenza-like-illness consultations as reported by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). We performed parameter inference via approximate Bayesian computation to assess strain transmissibility, dependence of present season influenza  on prior protection, and variability in the influenza case ascertainment across seasons. This produced reasonable agreement between model and data on the annual strain composition. Parameter fits indicated that the propagation of  from one season to the next is weaker if vaccine derived, compared to natural  from infection. Projecting the dynamics forward in time suggests that while historic  plays an important role in determining annual strain composition, the variability in vaccine efficacy hampers our ability to make long-term predictions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661176>New insights into the mycobacterial PE and PPE proteins provide a framework for future research.</a></h2><p>The PE and PPE proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been studied with great interest since their discovery.

I discuss how the different subgroups (PE_PGRS, PPE-PPW, PPE-SVP and PPE-MPTR) are defined and why this classification is of paramount importance to understand PE/PPE proteins as individuals and or groups. The goal of this MicroReview is to summarize and structure existing information on this gene family into a simplified framework of thinking about PE/PPE proteins and genes.

Resistance to the causal agent Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) could result from alleles of the adaptive immune system. During metamorphosis, however, immune systems may not be fully functional, implying that an effective immune response to Bd may be life-stage dependent. We evaluated the susceptibility of the relict leopard frog (Rana onca) sourced from two areas where Bd was present or absent, and where the populations appeared to show differences in pathogen resistance. We evaluated whether population-level resistance manifested across life stages using challenge experiments with late-stage tadpoles (Gosner stage 31-38), metamorphs (stage 45-46), and juvenile frogs. We used three different Bd isolates including one from wild R. onca to challenge juvenile frogs and focused on the isolate from R. onca to challenge tadpoles and resulting metamorphs. We found that juveniles from the Bd exposed population were 5.5 times more likely to survive Bd infection and 10 times more likely to clear infections than those from the area without Bd. In contrast, and regardless of the source area, we observed 98% survivorship of tadpoles, but only 19% survivorship of resulting metamorphs following re-exposure. Given the low survivorship of exposed metamorphs in the laboratory, we speculate on how resistance characteristics, whether adaptive or innate, that do not manifest at each life stage could develop in the wild. We suggest that seasonal high temperatures during times when metamorphosis appears common may modulate the effects of the pathogen during this most susceptible life stage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652350>Oral Cancer-associated Tertiary Lymphoid Structures: Gene-Expression Profile and Prognostic Value.</a></h2><p>Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) provides a local and critical microenvironment for both cellular and humoral  and supports effective antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation.

The presence of intratumoral TLSs, but not peritumoral TLSs, was significantly associated with decreased P53 and Ki67 scores (P = 0.027 and 0.047, respectively). The survival analyses revealed that oral cancer patients with higher grade of TLSs was associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.037 and 0.031, respectively).

This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner. Consequently, local activation of cutaneous MAIT cells promotes wound healing. Together, our work uncovers a privileged interaction between defined members of the microbiota and MAIT cells, which sequentially controls both tissue-imprinting and subsequent responses to injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal microbiome. The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal microbiota, the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's  (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut colonization, facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic.

How differences in the acute immune response affect the CNS immune response is unknown. To address this question, we used two persistent Toxoplasma strains (type II and type III) and examined the CNS immune response at 21 days post infection (dpi). Contrary to acute infection studies, type III-infected mice had higher numbers of total CNS T cells and macrophages/microglia but fewer alternatively activated macrophages (M2s) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) than type II-infected mice. By profiling splenocytes at 5, 10, and 21 dpi, we determined that at 5 dpi type III-infected mice had more M2s while type II-infected mice had more pro-inflammatory macrophages and that these responses flipped over time. To test how these early differences influence the CNS immune response, we engineered the type III strain to lack ROP16 (IIIΔrop16), the polymorphic effector protein that drives the early type III-associated M2 response. IIIΔrop16-infected mice showed a type II-like neuroinflammatory response with fewer infiltrating T cells and macrophages/microglia and more M2s and an unexpectedly low CNS parasite burden. At 5 dpi, IIIΔrop16-infected mice showed a mixed inflammatory response with more pro-inflammatory macrophages, M2s, T effector cells, and Tregs, and decreased rates of infection of peritoneal exudative cells (PECs). These data suggested that type III parasites need the early ROP16-associated M2 response to avoid clearance, possibly by the -Related GTPases (IRGs), which are IFN-γ- dependent proteins essential for murine defenses against Toxoplasma. To test this possibility, we infected IRG-deficient mice and found that IIIΔrop16 parasites now maintained parental levels of PECs infection. Collectively, these studies suggest that, for the type III strain, rop16III plays a key role in parasite persistence and influences the subacute CNS immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655002>Next generation serology: integrating cross-sectional and capture-recapture approaches to infer disease dynamics.</a></h2><p>Two approaches have been classically used in disease ecology to estimate epidemiological parameters from field studies: cross-sectional sampling from unmarked individuals and longitudinal capture-recapture setups, which generally involve more limited numbers of marked individuals due to cost and logistical constrains. Although the benefits of longitudinal setups are increasingly acknowledged in the disease ecology community, cross-sectional data remain largely over-represented in the literature, probably because of the inherent costs of longitudinal surveys. In this context, we used simulated data to compare the performances of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs to estimate the force of infection (i.e., the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected). Then, inspired from recent method developments in quantitative ecology, we explore the benefits of integrating both cross-sectional (seroprevalences) and longitudinal (individuals histories) datasets. In doing so, we investigate the effects of host species life history, antibody persistence and degree of a priori knowledge and uncertainty on demographic and epidemiological parameters, as those are expected to affect in different ways the level of inference possible from the data. Our results highlight how those elements are important to consider to determine optimal sampling designs. In the case of long-lived species exposed to infectious agents resulting in persistent antibody responses, integrated designs are especially valuable as they benefit from the performances of longitudinal designs even with relatively small longitudinal sample sizes. As an illustration, we apply this approach to a combination of empirical and simulated data inspired from a case of bats exposed to a rabies virus. Overall, this work highlights that serology field studies could greatly benefit from the opportunity of integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal designs.© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p>Inflammation substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor  is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis.

Currently, the efficacy and safety of treatment is limited by difficulties in achieving and sustaining adequate tissue antibiotic concentrations while limiting systemic drug exposure to tolerable levels. Here we show that nanoparticles generated from a polymer-antibiotic conjugate ('nanobiotics') deliver sustained release of active drug upon hydrolysis in acidic environments, found within Mtb-infected macrophages and granulomas, and can, by encapsulation of a second antibiotic, provide a mechanism of synchronous drug delivery. Nanobiotics are avidly taken up by infected macrophages, enhance killing of intracellular Mtb, and are efficiently delivered to granulomas and extracellular mycobacterial cords in vivo in an infected zebrafish model. We demonstrate that isoniazid (INH)-derived nanobiotics, alone or with additional encapsulation of clofazimine (CFZ), enhance killing of mycobacteria in vitro and in infected zebrafish, supporting the use of nanobiotics for Mtb therapy and indicating that nanoparticles generated from polymer-small molecule conjugates might provide a more general solution to delivering co-ordinated combination chemotherapy.Copyright © 2019.

The South African Thoracic Society, based on these findings, and those from several international guidelines, recommend that annual LDCT should be offered to patients between 55-74 years of age who are current or former smokers (having quit within the preceding 15 years), with at least a 30-pack year smoking history and with no history of lung cancer. Patients should be in general good health, fit for surgery, and willing to undergo further investigations if deemed necessary. Given the high local prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) infection and post-TB lung disease, which can radiographically mimic lung cancer, a conservative threshold (nodule size ≥6 mm) should be used to determine whether the baseline LDCT screen is positive (thus nodules <6 mm require no action until the next annual screen). If a non-calcified, solid or partly solid nodule is ≥6 mm, but <10 mm with no malignant features (e.g., distinct spiculated margins), the LDCT should be repeated in 6 months. If a solid nodule or the largest component of a non-solid nodule is ≥10 or ≥6 mm and enlarging or with additional malignant features present, definitive action to exclude lung cancer is warranted. Patients should be screened annually until 15 years have elapsed from date of smoking cessation, they turn 80, become unfit for a curative operation or significant changes are observed.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

We report an outbreak of hepatitis E in Shimla, India, in 2015-2016.ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, received two batches of water samples from Shimla in January 2016 to test for the presence of enterically transmitted hepatitis viruses. Subsequently, 57 icterus patients were tested for various markers of hepatotropic viruses, i.e. anti-HEV IgM/IgG, anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) IgM/IgG antibodies and HEV RNA. Water samples were screened for HEV and HAV RNA followed by phylogenetic analysis.Overall, 48/57 patients availing municipal water had evidence of HEV infection, detected by serology and RT-PCR. All the water samples tested positive for HEV and HAV RNA, while the patients were negative for anti-HAV IgM antibody, indicating no recent HAV infection. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the aetiological agent of the current outbreak to be HEV genotype 1.Serology and RT-PCR confirmed HEV as the aetiology of the outbreak. The absence of new cases of hepatitis A, despite the presence of HAV in the water supply, could be due to previously acquired . Sewage contamination of water leading to faecal-oral transmission of HEV still remains a concern, thus emphasising the need for a vaccination/control strategy.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the relationship between IRF9 and STAT1 in teleost fish remains largely unknown. The previous study has elucidated that two STAT1 isoforms (bcSTAT1a and bcSTAT1b) of black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) play an important role during the innate immune activation initiated by grass carp reovirus (GCRV). In this paper, black carp IRF9 (bcIRF9) has been identified and characterized. bcIRF9 was distributed majorly in the nucleus and the linker domain (LD) of bcIRF9 was vital for its nuclear localization. bcIRF9 showed ISRE-inducing activity in reporter assay and presented antiviral activity against GCRV in plaque assay, in which both DNA binding domain (DBD) and LD of bcIRF9 were essential for its antiviral signaling. bcIRF9 was identified to interact with both bcSTAT1a and bcSTAT1b in the co-immunoprecipitation assay. It was interesting that bcIRF9-mediated antiviral signaling was up-regulated by bcSTAT1a; however, down-regulated by bcSTAT1b. Thus, our data support the conclusion that bcIRF9 plays an important role in the innate immune defense against GCRV, in which two STAT1 proteins function differently.Copyright © 2019.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family are promising targets for development of agonist formulations for use as vaccine adjuvants. Combinations of co-delivered TLR4 and TLR7/8 ligands have been demonstrated to have synergistic effects on innate and adaptive immune response. Here, we create liposomes which stably co-encapsulate, CRX-601, a TLR4 agonist, and UM-3004, a lipidated TLR7/8 agonist, within the liposomal bilayer in order to achieve co-delivery, allow tunable physical properties, and induce in vitro and in vivo immune synergy. Co-encapsulation demonstrates a synergistic increase in IL-12p70 cytokine output in vitro from treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Further, co-encapsulated formulations give significant improvement of early IgG2a antibody titers in BALB/c mice following primary vaccination when compared to single agonist or dual agonists delivered in separate liposomes. This work demonstrates that co-incorporation of TLR4 and lipidated TLR7/8 agonists within the liposomal bilayer leads to innate and adaptive immune synergy which biases a Th1 immune response. Thus, liposomal co-encapsulation may be a useful and flexible tool for vaccine adjuvant formulation containing multiple TLR agonists.Copyright © 2019.

To develop an effective yet simple process for enhancing its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, turmeric was gun-puffed at various pressures. Puffed turmeric exhibited an increase in its brown color and porous structures, indicating the occurrence of the Maillard reaction and vaporization during the process. Proximal analysis revealed that puffing did not alter the major constituents, although a very small decrease in crude fat extraction was observed under some circumstances. Total phenolic compounds in the extract were significantly increased after puffing, and subsequent assessment of antioxidant capacity, as determined using independent 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays, demonstrated enhanced antioxidant capacity in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. Turmeric extract was further tested for the regulation of inflammatory responses in the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced macrophages was amplified using puffed-turmeric extracts compared to the control extract. Furthermore, macrophage-activation assessment revealed downregulated expression of inflammation-relevant cluster of differentiation (CD)80 and CD86 using puffed-turmeric extract in a puffing-pressure-dependent manner. However, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, which controls adoptive , was not affected by treatment with any of the turmeric extracts.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a complex pathogenic process that involves angiogenesis, inflammation, cellular , and other factors. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of GV1001 on laser-induced CNV in a rat model. Brown Norway rats were subcutaneously administered GV1001 (0.1 nM, 1 nM, and 10 nM) daily, beginning 3 days prior, and ending 14 days after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, choroidal flat mount, and histologic analysis were performed to analyze CNV. The protein level of IκB-α and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) was analyzed via immunohistochemistry of p65. Multiplex immunoassay was performed to evaluate the interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels. The GV1001-treated group had significantly lower CNV thickness, smaller CNV area, and lower proportion of CNV lesions with clinically significant fluorescein leakage than vehicle-treated group. GV1001 treatment inhibited IκB-α degradation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. At 1 nM concentration, GV1001 had highest inhibitory effect on CNV and NF-κB signaling activation; moreover, it suppressed the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF significantly. The present study demonstrates that GV1001 treatment led to significant suppression of laser-induced CNV, alongside inhibition of inflammatory processes including NF-κB activation and subsequent upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this provides molecular evidence of potential validity of GV1001 treatment as a therapeutic strategy for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.Copyright © 2019.

Altered  status during pregnancy and challenges fully vaccinating newborns contribute to this medical reality. Maternal immunization is a strategy to protect pregnant women and their newborns. This study aimed to find out how patient-provider relationships affect maternal vaccine uptake, particularly in the context of a lower middle- income country where limited research in this area exists.We conducted semi-structured, in-depth narrative interviews of both providers and pregnant women from four sites in Kenya: Siaya, Nairobi, Mombasa, and Marsabit. Interviews were conducted in either English or one of the local regional languages.We found that patient trust in health care providers (HCPs) is integral to vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Kenya. The HCP-patient relationship is a fiduciary one, whereby the patients' trusts is primarily rooted in the provider's social position as a person who is highly educated in matters of health. Furthermore, patient health education and provider attitudes are crucial for reinstating and fostering that trust, especially in cases where trust was impeded by rumors, community myths and misperceptions, and religious and cultural factors.Patient trust in providers is a strong facilitator contributing to vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Kenya. To maintain and increase immunization trust, providers have a critical role in cultivating a positive environment that allows for favorable interactions and patient health education.

To prevent and control this bacterial disease, antagonistic bacteria have become a new research hotspot. This study evaluated the probiotic potential of Bacillus velezensis LF01 strain, which is antagonistic to S. agalactiae. The active compounds produced by LF01 showed antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of fish pathogens, including S. agalactiae, Streptococcus iniae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Aeromonas schubertii, Aeromonas veronii, Aeromonas jandaei, and Vibrio harveyi. The antimicrobial compounds were heat stable, pH stable, UV stable, resistant to proteases, and could be stored for a long time. To evaluate the probiotic function of LF01 in Nile tilapia, juveniles were divided into three treatment groups: a control group, an interval feeding group, and a continuous feeding group. Tilapia fed with LF01-supplemented diets (1.0 × 10 CFU/g) showed significantly better growth performances than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Tilapia fed with LF01-supplemented diets significantly increased lysozyme (LZY) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. The expression of three immune-related genes (C3, lyzc, and MHC-IIβ) was higher in the intestine, head kidney, and gill of tilapia from the continuous feeding group than in those from the control group (P < 0.05). Tilapia fed with LF01-supplemented diets showed remarkably improved survival rates after S. agalactiae infection, and analysis of their intestinal tract pathogens revealed that the abundance of Edwardsiella and Plesiomonas had significantly decreased compared with the control group. Our findings demonstrate that LF01 is an effective antagonist against various fish pathogens and has potential for controlling infections by Streptococcus spp. and other pathogens in tilapia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650297>Association between rainfall and readmissions of rheumatoid arthritis patients: a time-stratified case-crossover analysis.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that local weather is associated with the symptoms of joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and many people believe their pain becomes worse when facing rainy days. However, limited studies explored the effects of weather on RA patients' healthcare-seeking behavior. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between rainfall and readmission behavior of patients with RA in Hefei, China, based on hospitalization data from the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine from May 2012 to June 2016 and weather data from National Meteorological Information Center during the same study period. Using a time-stratified case-crossover study design and conditional logistic regression, we found a negative association between current day rainfall and readmission (unadjusted: OR = 0.82, p < 0.05; adjusted: OR = 0.83, p < 0.1), which is contrary to our common belief. In lagged models, we observed that rainfall was significantly and positively associated with readmissions at lag 6 days (unadjusted: OR = 1.12, p < 0.1; adjusted: OR = 1.17, p < 0.05) and lag 7 days (unadjusted: OR = 1.13, p < 0.05; adjusted: OR = 1.21, p < 0.01).

The identification of broadly protective antibodies and cross-reactive T cells directed to influenza viral targets present a promising prospect for the development of a UIV. Multiple targets for cross-protection have been identified in the stalk and head of hemagglutinin (HA) to develop a UIV. Recently, neuraminidase (NA) has received significant attention as a critical component for increasing the breadth of protection. The HA stalk-based approaches have shown promising results of broader protection in animal studies, and their feasibility in humans are being evaluated in clinical trials. Mucosal immune responses and cross-reactive T cell  across influenza A and B viruses intrinsic to live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) have emerged as essential features to be incorporated into a UIV. Complementing the weakness of the stand-alone approaches, prime-boost vaccination combining HA stalk, and LAIV is under clinical evaluation, with the aim to increase the efficacy and broaden the spectrum of protection. Preexisting  in humans established by prior exposure to influenza viruses may affect the hierarchy and magnitude of immune responses elicited by an influenza vaccine, limiting the interpretation of preclinical data based on naive animals, necessitating human challenge studies. A consensus is yet to be achieved on the spectrum of protection, efficacy, target population, and duration of protection to define a "universal" vaccine.

TLR4 is a membrane-bound highly sialylated glycoprotein predominantly having α2,3-linked sialic acids. It is one of the most important client molecules in the anti-leishmanial innate immune arm. Here, we initiated a comprehensive study on the modulation of TLR4 sialylation in  ()-infected macrophages by a mammalian sialidase/neuraminidase-1 (Neu1) having substrate specificity toward α2,3-linked sialic acids. We observed reduced membrane-associated Neu1 with its decreased enzyme activity in infected macrophages. Moreover, we demonstrated reduced association of Neu1 with TLR4 leading to enhanced sialylation of TLR4 in these infected cells. Conversely, Neu1 over expression exhibited enhanced association of TLR4 with Neu1 leading to reduced sialylation which possibly linked to increased association of TLR4 with its downstream adaptor protein, MyD88. This, in turn, activated downstream MAP kinase signaling pathway, with enhanced nuclear translocation of NFκB that resulted in increased genetic and protein levels expression of Th1 cytokines and effector molecule nitric oxide secretion which ultimately leads to reduced parasite burden in macrophages. This was further validated by Neu1 silencing in infected macrophages which reversed such a situation. Such events strongly confirm the importance of Neu1 in modulation of TLR4 sialylation during parasite infection resulting in impairment of innate immune response. Furthermore, decreased membrane-bound Neu1 in infected macrophages could be attributed to its reduced tyrosine-phosphorylation as well as diminished association with cathepsin A. Both these phenomenon possibly play significant roles in inhibiting translocation of the sialidase from cytosol to membrane. Taken together, our study first time demonstrated impaired translocation of cytosolic Neu1 to the membrane of -infected macrophages due to impaired phosphorylation of this enzyme. This novel finding establishes a link between enhanced α2,3-linked sialic acids on TLR4 and reduced membrane-bound Neu1 which plays a significant role for inhibiting downstream signaling to establish successful infection in the host cells.Copyright © 2019 Karmakar, Roy and Mandal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649670>Structure-Function Implications of the Ability of Monoclonal Antibodies Against α-Galactosylceramide-CD1d Complex to Recognize β-Mannosylceramide Presentation by CD1d.</a></h2><p>iNKT cells are CD1d-restricted T cells recognizing lipid antigens. The prototypic iNKT cell-agonist α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) alongside compounds with similar structures induces robust proliferation and cytokine production of iNKT cells and protects against cancer . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that detect CD1d-α-GalCer complexes have provided critical information for understanding of antigen presentation of iNKT cell agonists. Although most iNKT cell agonists with antitumor properties are α-linked glycosphingolipids that can be detected by anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAbs, β-ManCer, a glycolipid with a β-linkage, induces strong antitumor  via mechanisms distinct from those of α-GalCer. In this study, we unexpectedly discovered that anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAbs directly recognized β-ManCer-CD1d complexes and could inhibit β-ManCer stimulation of iNKT cells. The binding of anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAb with β-ManCer-CD1d complexes was also confirmed by plasmon resonance and could not be explained by α-anomer contamination. The binding of anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAb was also observed with CD1d loaded with another β-linked glycosylceramide, β-GalCer (C26:0). Detection with anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAbs indicates that the interface of the β-ManCer-CD1d complex exposed to the iNKT cell TCR can assume a structure like that of CD1d-α-GalCer, despite its disparate carbohydrate structure. These results suggest that certain β-linked monoglycosylceramides can assume a structural display similar to that of CD1d-α-GalCer and that the data based on anti-CD1d-α-GalCer binding should be interpreted with caution.Copyright © 2019 Clark, Yau, Bloom, Wang, Venzon, Suzuki, Pasquet, Compton, Cardell, Porcelli, Painter, Zajonc, Berzofsky and Terabe.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649664>The Central Nervous System Contains ILC1s That Differ From NK Cells in the Response to Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue resident cells with organ-specific properties. Here, we show that the central nervous system (CNS) encompasses ILCs. In particular, CD3NK1.1 cells present in the murine CNS comprise natural killer (NK) cells, ILC1s, intermediate ILC1s (intILC1s) and ex-ILC3s. We investigated the properties of CNS-ILC1s in comparison with CNS-NK cells during steady state and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ILC1s characteristically express CXCR3, CXCR6, DNAM-1, TRAIL, and CD200R and display heightened TNF-α production upon stimulation. In addition, ILC1s express perforin and are able to degranulate, although in a lesser extent than NK cells. Within the CNS compartments, ILC1s are enriched in the choroid plexus where very few NK cells are present, and also reside in the brain parenchyma and meninges. During EAE, ILC1s maintain stable IFN-γ and TNF-α levels while in NK cells the production of these cytokines increases as EAE progresses. Moreover, the amount of ILC1s and intILC1s increase in the parenchyma during EAE, but in contrast to NK cells, they show no signs of local proliferation. The upregulation in the inflamed brain of chemokines involved in ILC1 migration, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL16 may lead to a recruitment of ILC1s from meninges or choroid plexus into the brain parenchyma. In sum, CNS-ILC1 phenotype, distribution and moderate inflammatory response during EAE suggest that they may act as gatekeepers involved in the control of neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2019 Romero-Suárez, Del Rio Serrato, Bueno, Brunotte-Strecker, Stehle, Figueiredo, Hertwig, Dunay, Romagnani and Infante-Duarte.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653827>Invariant NKT cells facilitate cytotoxic T-cell activation via direct recognition of CD1d on T cells.</a></h2><p>Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a major subset of NKT cells that recognize foreign and endogenous lipid antigens presented by CD1d. Although iNKT cells are characteristically autoreactive to self-antigens, the role of iNKT cells in the regulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) has been elucidated using α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), a strong synthetic glycolipid that is presented by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells.

CTL-mediated iNKT cell activation in turn enhanced IFN-γ production and the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CTLs.

It is currently used as an anchor disease, modifying anti-rheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis. Many viruses-including old world alphaviruses, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis B/C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-have been associated with arthritogenic diseases and reminiscent of RA. MTX may provide benefits although with the potential risk of attenuating patients' immune surveillance capacities. In this review, we describe the emerging mechanisms of action of MTX as an anti-inflammatory drug and complementing its well-established immunomodulatory activity. The mechanisms involve adenosine signaling modulation, alteration of cytokine networks, generation of reactive oxygen species and HMGB1 alarmin suppression. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of MTX toxic effects. Lastly, we discussed the efficacy, as well as the safety, of MTX used in the management of viral-related rheumatic syndromes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658543>[Clinical randomized controlled trial on influence of recombinant human growth hormone on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries].</a></h2><p> To preliminarily investigate the influence of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on the immune function of younger children with severe burn injuries.  A total of 30 younger children with severe burn injuries, conforming to the study criteria, were admitted to our hospital from July 2016 to July 2018. They were enrolled in the prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial and divided into group rhGH [=15, 10 boys and 5 girls, aged (22±10) months] and control group [=15, 8 boys and 7 girls, aged (21±7) months] according to the random number table. The patients in control group received anti-shock, anti-infection, and wound caring therapies, etc. On the basis of above-mentioned treatment, the patients in group rhGH were subcutaneously injected with rhGH once every night before bedding, with a dosage of 0.2 IU·kg(-1)·d(-1), from the 3rd day post injury for 7 consecutive days. Before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatments, the fasting peripheral venous blood was collected from patients in both groups. Blood glucose level was detected by glucometer. Percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes, CD8(+) T lymphocytes, CD3(+) T lymphocytes, CD19(+) B lymphocytes, and ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometer. Mass concentration of serum immune globulin (Ig) A, IgG, and complement C3 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were processed with Fisher's exact probability test, independent sample  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement and Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney  test.  (1) The blood glucose levels of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=0.474, 1.652, 1.997, >0.05). The glucose levels of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment [(6.9±1.0) and (7.7±1.1) mmol/L] were significantly higher than (5.9±0.9) mmol/L before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The glucose level of children in control group on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (2) The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH before rhGH treatment and on the 7th day of rhGH treatment were (35.1±2.0)% and (38.5±2.2)%, which were close to (36.2±2.0)% and (33.6±2.2)% in control group, respectively (=0.371, 1.553, >0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment[(44.7±2.2)%] was significantly higher than (36.5±2.2)% in control group (=2.624, <0.05). The percentage of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment (<0.05). The percentages of CD4(+) T lymphocytes of children in control group on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were both close to the percentage before rhGH treatment (>0.05). (3) The percentage of CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd day of rhGH treatment was significantly lower than that in control group (=2.107, <0.05). (4) The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment (2.36±0.20) was significantly higher than 1.72±0.20 in control group (=2.285, <0.05). The ratio of CD4(+) T lymphocytes to CD8(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than 2.04±0.19 before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (5) The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD19(+) B lymphocytes of children in the two groups were similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=1.913, 0.552, 1.327, 1.465, 1.587, 0.407, >0.05). The percentages of CD3(+) T lymphocytes of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment were significantly higher than the percentage before rhGH treatment (<0.05). (6) The mass concentration of serum IgA, complement C3, and IgG of children in the two groups was similar before and on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment (=-1.596, -0.100, 1.263, -0.220, 1.378, 1.631, =0.228, 0.519, 1.182, >0.05). The mass concentration of serum IgA and complement C3 of children in group rhGH on the 3rd and 7th day of rhGH treatment was significantly higher than that before rhGH treatment(<0.05).  rhGH has little effect on humoral  of younger children with severe burn injuries with limited influence on CD19(+) B lymphocyte, mass concentration of serum IgA, IgG, and complement C3. It may improve the cellular  function mainly through promoting the release of CD4(+) T lymphocyte, reducing the release of CD8(+) T lymphocyte. It can be used in clinical treatment of younger children with severe burn injuries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649248>Occurrence and repair of alkylating stress in the intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus.</a></h2><p>It is assumed that intracellular pathogenic bacteria have to cope with DNA alkylating stress within host cells. Here we use single-cell reporter systems to show that the pathogen Brucella abortus does encounter alkylating stress during the first hours of macrophage infection. Genes encoding direct repair and base-excision repair pathways are required by B. abortus to face this stress in vitro and in a mouse infection model. Among these genes, ogt is found to be under the control of the conserved cell-cycle transcription factor GcrA.

More recently, with the advent of coronary stents, there has been an increased use of more potent antiplatelet agents to prevent stent occlusion. Since these drugs are antithrombotic, it is not unusual for them to be associated with serious bleeding, particularly intracranial and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. There are no robust guidelines on how to manage these clinical situations, although there have been some important studies published recently in this area. Similarly, there is very limited evidence on how to manage urgent surgery in patients receiving these medications. In this review, we provide updated guidance on the management of bleeding and surgery on antiplatelet drugs while stressing the need for further studies to provide evidence-based guidelines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Br. is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that has been widely used for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases such as hepatitis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism about the hepatoprotective effects of S. plebeia remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the antioxidant activities and anti-inflammatory effects of ethanol extracts of S. plebeia (SPEE) in the zebrafish model. Firstly, we determined the chemical compositions of SPEE and identified three major constituents by using GC-MS analysis. After that, SPEE exhibited significantly antioxidant properties in the LPS-induced zebrafish embryos, and the enzyme activities of ROS, CAT and SOD were obviously inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Secondly, SPEE greatly reduced fat vacuoles (HE staining), lipid accumulation (Oil O staining) and hepatocyte fibrosis (Gemori staining) in the thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatocyte injury of adult zebrafish. Meanwhile, the NO contents and lipid metabolism-related genes were substantially down-regulated after SPEE exposure. Thirdly, we used RNA-Seq analysis to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after SPEE exposure in adult zebrafish liver. The results showed that 1289 DEGs including 558 up-regulated and 731 down-regulated were identified between the TAA + SPEE and TAA groups. KEGG pathway and GO functional analysis revealed that steroid biosynthesis, oxidation-reduction and innate  were significantly enriched. Mechanistically, SPEE can considerably reduce the cell apoptosis of hepatocytes and promote the translocation of Nrf2 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in TAA-induced zebrafish. Moreover, SPEE can modulate various inflammatory cytokines and immune genes both in the control and HO-stimulated conditions. The pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α was markedly up-regulated but the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β was greatly down-regulated after SPEE treatment. In addition, some key genes in the TLR signaling were also activated in the HO-stimulated conditions. In summary, our results suggested that SPEE had an important role in the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in zebrafish. Some of the components identified in this study may be served as potential sources of new hepatoprotective compounds for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Forty-days-old female quails were divided into three treatments: T1 (Control) received a basal diet without P. pastoris; T2 (Pichia Effluent) received a basal diet supplemented with P. pastoris grown in parboiled rice effluent and biodiesel glycerol, and T3 (Pichia YPD) received a basal diet supplemented with P. pastoris produced in YPD. The birds were vaccinated against Newcastle Disease (NDV), Avian Infectious Bronchitis (IBV), and Gumboro Disease on days 1 and 28. The following parameters were analyzed: performance, egg quality, humoral immune response to the vaccines, organ weight, and intestinal morphometry. P. pastoris grown in YPD increased egg weight (p < 0.05). The lowest liver weight on day 14 was obtained in Pichia Effluent, whereas both P. pastoris supplemented groups had the lowest duodenum weights on day 14. Besides that, livers and duodenums presented no morphological changes in any of the three treatments. Supplementation of P. pastoris modulated the immune system of the birds, increasing anti-IBV, anti-NDV, and anti-Gumboro antibodies levels compared to the Control (p < 0.05). In conclusion, quail's immune response was improved by Pichia pastoris X-33, either it was grown in YPD or industrial residues, and the egg weight increased with Pichia pastoris X-33 grown in YPD, thereby demonstrating to be a promising probiotic for poultry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657935>Sustained delivery of carfilzomib by tannic acid-based nanocapsules helps develop antitumor .</a></h2><p>A group of chemotherapeutic drugs has gained increasing interest in cancer immunotherapy due to the potential to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). A critical challenge in using the ICD inducers in cancer immunotherapy is the immunotoxicity accompanying their antiproliferative effects. To alleviate this, a nanocapsule formulation of carfilzomib (CFZ), an ICD-inducing proteasome inhibitor, was developed using interfacial supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and iron, supplemented with albumin coating. The albumin-coated CFZ nanocapsules (CFZ-pTA-alb) attenuated CFZ release, reducing toxicity to immune cells. Moreover, due to the adhesive nature of TA assembly, CFZ-pTA-alb served as a reservoir of damage-associated molecular patterns released from dying tumor cells to activate dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral administration, CFZ-pTA-alb prolonged tumor retention of CFZ and showed consistently greater antitumor effects than cyclodextrin-solubilized CFZ (CFZ-CD) in B16F10 and CT26 tumor models. Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8+ T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon- response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), which support that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor . This study demonstrates that sustained delivery of ICD inducers by TA-based nanocapsules is an effective way of translating local ICD induction to systemic antitumor .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648626>Cochlear implantation in the era of genomic medicine.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651363>Systemic and local  following adoptive transfer of NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells in synovial sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Gene-modified autologous T cells expressing NY-ESO-1, an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific HLA-A*02-restricted peptide SLLMWITQC (NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells; GSK 794), have demonstrated clinical activity in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (SS). The factors contributing to gene-modified T-cell expansion and the changes within the tumor microenvironment (TME) following T-cell infusion remain unclear. These studies address the immunological mechanisms of response and resistance in patients with SS treated with NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cells.Four cohorts were included to evaluate antigen expression and preconditioning on efficacy. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1. Engineered T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR. Serum cytokines were evaluated by immunoassay. Transcriptomic analyses and immunohistochemistry were performed on tumor biopsies from patients before and after T-cell infusion. Gene-modified T-cells were detected within the TME via an RNAish assay.Responses across cohorts were affected by preconditioning and intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Of the 42 patients reported (data cut-off 4June2018), 1 patient had a complete response, 14 patients had partial responses, 24 patients had stable disease, and 3 patients had progressive disease. The magnitude of gene-modified T-cell expansion shortly after infusion was associated with response in patients with high intra-tumoral NY-ESO-1 expression. Patients receiving a fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen experienced increases in serum IL-7 and IL-15. Prior to infusion, the TME exhibited minimal leukocyte infiltration; CD163 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were the dominant population. Modest increases in intra-tumoral leukocytes (≤5%) were observed in a subset of subjects at approximately 8 weeks. Beyond 8 weeks post infusion, the TME was minimally infiltrated with a TAM-dominant leukocyte infiltrate. Tumor-associated antigens and antigen presentation did not significantly change within the tumor post-T-cell infusion. Finally, NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T cells trafficked to the TME and maintained cytotoxicity in a subset of patients.Our studies elucidate some factors that underpin response and resistance to NY-ESO-1 SPEAR T-cell therapy. From these data, we conclude that a lymphodepletion regimen containing high doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is necessary for SPEAR T-cell persistence and efficacy. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that non-T-cell inflamed tumors, which are resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, can be treated with adoptive T-cell based immunotherapy.ClinicalTrials.gov,  , Registered 27 April 2011.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661465>U3-1402 sensitizes HER3-expressing tumors to PD-1 blockade by immune activation.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) induces durable antitumor efficacy in many types of cancer. However, such clinical benefit is limited because of the insufficient reinvigoration of antitumor  with the drug alone; therefore, rational therapeutic combinations are required to improve its efficacy. In our preclinical study, we evaluated the antitumor effect of U3-1402, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3)-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, and its potential synergism with PD-1 inhibition. Using a syngeneic mouse tumor model that is refractory to anti-PD-1 therapy, treatment with U3-1402 exhibited an obvious antitumor effect via direct lysis of tumor cells. Disruption of tumor cells by U3-1402 enhanced the infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells. Chemotherapy with exatecan derivative (Dxd: the drug payload of U3-1402) revealed that the enhanced antitumor  produced by U3-1402 was associated with the induction of alarmins including HMGB-1 via tumor-specific cytotoxicity. Notably, U3-1402 significantly sensitized the tumor to PD-1 blockade, as a combination of U3-1402 and the PD-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced antitumor . Further, clinical analyses indicated that tumor-specific HER3 expression was frequently observed in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-resistant solid tumors. Overall, U3-1402 is a promising candidate as a partner of immunotherapy for such patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657672>Dominant, Heritable Resistance to Stewart's Wilt in Maize Is Associated with an Enhanced Vascular Defense Response to Infection with .</a></h2><p>Vascular wilt bacteria such as , the causal agent of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (SW), are destructive pathogens that are difficult to control. These bacteria colonize the xylem, where they form biofilms that block sap flow leading to characteristic wilting symptoms. Heritable forms of SW resistance exist and are used in maize breeding programs but the underlying genes and mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we show that seedlings of maize inbred lines with  mutations are highly resistant to SW. However, current evidence suggests that other genes introgressed along with  are responsible for resistance. Genomic analyses of  lines were used to identify candidate resistance genes. In-depth comparison of  interaction with susceptible and resistant maize lines revealed an enhanced vascular defense response in  lines characterized by accumulation of electron-dense materials in xylem conduits visible by electron microscopy. We propose that this vascular defense response restricts  spread through the vasculature, reducing both systemic bacterial colonization of the xylem network and consequent wilting.

Surprisingly, activation of plant intracellular immune receptor NLR genes, while enhancing whole plant disease resistance, were sometimes linked to a defective stomatal defense in autoimmune mutants. Here we report the use of high temperature and genetic chimera to investigate the inter-dependence of stomatal and apoplastic defenses in autoimmunity. High temperature inhibits both stomatal and apoplastic defenses in the wild type, and it suppresses constitutive apoplastic defense responses and rescues the deficiency of stomatal closure response in autoimmune mutants. Chimeric plants have been generated to activate NLR only in guard cells or the non-guard cells. NLR activation in guard cells inhibits stomatal closure defense response in a cell autonomous manner likely through repressing ABA responses. At the same time, it leads to increased whole plant resistance accompanied by a slight increase in apoplastic defense. In addition, NLR activation in both guard and non-guard cells affects stomatal aperture and water potential. This study thus reveals that NLR activation has a differential effect on  in a cell type specific matter, which adds another layer of immune regulation with spatial information.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656949>Inflammation induced PD-L1-specific T cells.</a></h2><p>PD-L1-specific T cells are a natural part of the T-cell repertoire in humans. Hence, we have previously described spontaneous CD8 and CD4 T-cell reactivity against PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with various cancers as well as in healthy donors. It is well described that the expression of the PD-L1 protein is introduced in cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IFN-γ. In the current study, we were able to directly link inflammation with PD-L1-specific T cells by showing that inflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ generate measurable numbers of PD-L1-specific T cells in human PBMCs as well as in  models. These PD-L1-specific T cells can vigorously modulate the cell compartments of the local environment. PD-L1-specific T cells may be important for immune homeostasis by sustaining the ongoing inflammatory response by the suppression of regulatory cell function both directly and indirectly.Copyright: © 2019 Munir et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653831>Dietary tryptophan links encephalogenicity of autoreactive T cells with gut microbial ecology.</a></h2><p>The interaction between the mammalian host and its resident gut microbiota is known to license adaptive immune responses. Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino acid - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut microbiota. Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut microbiota, which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut microbiota, dietary tryptophan and adaptive  may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656948>Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP): the elusive 'hunger factor' linking autophagy to food intake.</a></h2><p>The best-known appetite-regulating factors identified in rodents are leptin, an appetite inhibitor, and ghrelin, an appetite stimulator. Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human obesity, apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human obesity. Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in obesity.Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657115>PGC-1α inhibits polyamine metabolism in Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancer (OvCa) is characterized with metabolic shift.

Candidate metabolic pathway was validated using in vitro and in vivo assays.From TCGA database, we found that polyamine metabolism was significantly enriched in Cyclin E1-driven OvCa. Expressions of SMS, SRM, and ODC1 were positively correlated with that of CCNE1, respectively. ODC1 and SMS expressions were significantly correlated with decreased immune infiltrates. PGC-1α silencing significantly decreased invasion and migration in both OvCa cell lines. Both spermidine and spermine levels were significantly increased when PGC-1α was silenced. Targeting SRM significantly decreased spermine level in OVCAR3 cells, which was rescued when PGC-1α was silenced. Silencing of PGC-1α resulted in increased SRM in both OvCa cells. Dinaciclib significantly decreased invasion and migration of OVCAR3 cells. Expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were predominantly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Dinaciclib showed no notable effect of PD-1 yet substantially induced the increased levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2.Cyclin E1-driven OvCa is characterized with activated polyamine synthesis, which is associated with decreased cancer .

Studies show, however, that DC vaccine priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires the activity of endogenous DC, suggesting that exogenous DC stimulate anti-tumor  by transferring antigen (Ag) to endogenous DC. Such Ag transfer functions are most commonly ascribed to monocytes, implying that undifferentiated monocytes would function equally well as a vaccine modality and need not be differentiated to DC to be effective. Here, we used several murine cancer models to test the anti-tumor efficacy of undifferentiated monocytes loaded with protein or peptide Ag. Intravenously injected monocytes displayed anti-tumor activity superior to DC vaccines in several cancer models, including aggressive intracranial glioblastoma. Ag-loaded monocytes induced robust CTL responses via Ag transfer to splenic CD8+ DC in a manner independent of monocyte APC activity. Ag transfer required cell-cell contact and the formation of connexin 43-containing gap junctions between monocytes and DC. These findings demonstrate the existence of an efficient gap junction-mediated Ag transfer pathway between monocytes and CD8+ DC and suggest that administration of tumor Ag-loaded undifferentiated monocytes may serve as a simple and efficacious immunotherapy for the treatment of human cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648814>The Editor's I on Disease Development.</a></h2><p>Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of RNA leads to deamination of adenosine to inosine.

PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor , allowing tumors to escape immune surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on CTLs and colon tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, co-silencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independently of adaptive immune response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of PD-1 or PD-L1 single silencing alone, co-silencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in colon cancer.

The interactions of ZIKV with many different pathways in the human host ultimately determine successful virus replication and ZIKV-induced pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms of such host-ZIKV interactions have just begun to be elucidated. Here, we summarize the recent advances that defined the mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, with a particular focus on evasion of the type I interferon response in the human host. Furthermore, we describe emerging evidence that indicated the contribution of several cell-intrinsic mechanisms to an effective restriction of ZIKV infection, such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, stress granule formation, and "reticulophagy", a type of selective autophagy. Finally, we summarize the recent work that identified strategies by which ZIKV modulated these intrinsic antiviral responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659299>HIV-2/SIV Vpx targets a novel functional domain of STING to selectively inhibit cGAS-STING-mediated NF-κB signalling.</a></h2><p>Innate  is the first line of host defence against pathogens. Suppression of innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses. However, the interplay between innate  and HIV/SIV is only poorly characterized. We have discovered Vpx as a novel inhibitor of innate immune activation that associates with STING signalosomes and interferes with the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the induction of innate immune genes. This new function of Vpx could be separated from its role in mediating degradation of the antiviral factor SAMHD1, and is conserved among diverse HIV-2/SIV Vpx. Vpx selectively suppressed cGAS-STING-mediated nuclear factor-κB signalling. Furthermore, Vpx and Vpr had complementary activities against cGAS-STING activity. Since SIV lacking both Vpx and Vpr was less pathogenic than SIV deficient for Vpr or Vpx alone, suppression of innate  by HIV/SIV is probably a key pathogenic determinant, making it a promising target for intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655128>Proteomic insights into the immune response of the Colorado potato beetle larvae challenged with Bacillus thuringiensis.</a></h2><p>Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins constitute effective, environmentally safe biopesticides. Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting . To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut microbiota might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.Copyright © 2019.

Although NiV provokes serious diseases in numerous mammalian species, the infection seems to be asymptomatic in NiV natural hosts, the fruit bats, which provide a continuous virus source for further outbreaks. Consecutive human-to-human transmission has been frequently observed during outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. NiV was shown to interfere with the innate immune response and interferon type I signaling, restraining the anti-viral response and permitting viral spread. Studies of adaptive  in infected patients and animal models have suggested an unbalanced immune response during NiV infection. Here, we summarize some of the recent studies of NiV pathogenesis and NiV-induced modulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic approaches, necessary to control this highly lethal emerging infection.Copyright: © 2019 Pelissier R et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652531>The Role of Glutamine in the Complex Interaction between Gut Microbiota and Health: A Narrative Review.</a></h2><p>The scientific literature has demonstrated that glutamine is one of the main beneficial amino acids.

The transcription of nisin structural genes can be induced by derivatives of nisin. NisR activation leads to the activation of nisA/Z transcription, which encodes the nisin maturation machinery, nisin regulation and activation of the nisFEG operon to confer . The aim of this study was to express the Lactococcus lactis histidine phosphokinase NisK and response regulator NisR in E. coli, and to perform activity assays and in silico analysis. In silico methods were applied to study the properties and structures of the NisK and NisR proteins, including prediction of physicochemical characteristics, secondary and tertiary structure, stability and ligand-receptor interactions.pET32a and pET28a vectors containing synthetic nisK and nisR genes were transformed into E. coli followed by IPTG induction. SDS-PAGE and western blotting methods were applied to confirm the presence and identity of the amplified proteins. Following purification, the proteins were dialyzed and then prepared for activity assay. The CAI index showed that the genes was compatible with the E. coli host and that the proteins have effective expression. Also, the mRNA prediction results suggest that there is enough mRNA stability for efficient translation in the new host. NisK and NisR recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli with half - lives of around 10 h and were confirmed with molecular weights of 27 kDa and 69 kDa, respectively, by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The secondary structure of the recombinant proteins as predicted by circular dichroism spectroscopy was similar to the in silico protein structures. Activity assay of recombinant NisK was performed by measuring the amount of consumed ATP according to the light produced by luciferase. Because NisK and NisR have a direct impact on each other, they have an essential role in increasing the production of nisin and they can be used in different research fields. Our results demonstrated that recombinant proteins NisK and NisR preserved their structure and function after expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649677>Neutrophils in Psoriasis.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells. The pathogenic roles of neutrophils are related to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting ~2-3% of the world population. The abundant presence of neutrophils in the psoriatic skin lesions serves as a typical histopathologic hallmark of psoriasis.

Recurrence occurs in higher grade meningiomas and a small subset of Grade I meningiomas with benign histology. Currently, there are no established circulating tumor markers which can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in a non-invasive way for meningiomas. Here, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers of meningioma in patient sera. For this purpose, we collected preoperative ( = 30) serum samples from the meningioma patients classified as Grade I ( = 23), Grade II ( = 4), or Grade III ( = 3). We used a high-throughput, multiplex immunoassay cancer panel comprising of 92 cancer-related protein biomarkers to explore the serum protein profiles of meningioma patients. We detected 14 differentially expressed proteins in the sera of the Grade I meningioma patients in comparison to the age- and gender-matched control subjects ( = 12). Compared to the control group, Grade I meningioma patients showed increased serum levels of amphiregulin (AREG), CCL24, CD69, prolactin, EGF, HB-EGF, caspase-3, and decreased levels of VEGFD, TGF-α, E-Selectin, BAFF, IL-12, CCL9, and GH. For validation studies, we utilized an independent set of meningioma tumor tissue samples (Grade I,  = 20; Grade II,  = 10; Grade III,  = 6), and found that the expressions of amphiregulin and Caspase3 are significantly increased in all grades of meningiomas either at the transcriptional or protein level, respectively. In contrast, the gene expression of VEGF-D was significantly lower in Grade I meningioma tissue samples. Taken together, our study identifies a meningioma-specific protein signature in blood circulation of meningioma patients and highlights the importance of equilibrium between tumor-promoting factors and anti-tumor .Copyright © 2019 Erkan, Ströbel, Dorfer, Sonntagbauer, Weinhäusel, Saydam and Saydam.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649662>Bacille Calmette-Guérin Vaccine Strain Modulates the Ontogeny of Both Mycobacterial-Specific and Heterologous T Cell  to Vaccination in Infants.</a></h2><p>Differences in Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunogenicity and efficacy have been reported, but various strains of BCG are administered worldwide. Since BCG immunization may also provide protection against off-target antigens, we sought to identify the impact of different BCG strains on the ontogeny of vaccine-specific and heterologous vaccine immunogenicity in the first 9 months of life, utilizing two African birth cohorts. A total of 270 infants were studied: 84 from Jos, Nigeria (vaccinated with BCG-Bulgaria) and 187 from Cape Town, South Africa (154 vaccinated with BCG-Denmark and 33 with BCG-Russia). Infant whole blood was taken at birth, 7, 15, and 36 weeks and short-term stimulated (12 h)  with BCG, Tetanus and Pertussis antigens. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, CD4+ T cell memory subset polyfunctionality was measured by analyzing permutations of TNF-α, IL-2, and IFN-γ expression at each time point. Data was analyzed using FlowJo, SPICE, R, and COMPASS. We found that infants vaccinated with BCG-Denmark mounted significantly higher frequencies of BCG-stimulated CD4+ T cell responses, peaking at week 7 after immunization, and possessed durable polyfunctional CD4+ T cells that were in a more early differentiated memory stage when compared with either BCG-Bulgaria and BCG-Russia strains. The latter responses had lower polyfunctional scores and tended to accumulate in a CD4+ T cell naïve-like state (CD45RA+CD27+). Notably, BCG-Denmark immunization resulted in higher magnitudes and polyfunctional cytokine responses to heterologous vaccine antigens (Tetanus and Pertussis). Collectively, our data show that BCG strain was the strongest determinant of both BCG-stimulated and heterologous vaccine stimulated T cell magnitude and polyfunctionality. These findings have implications for vaccine policy makers, manufacturers and programs worldwide and also suggest that BCG-Denmark, the first vaccine received in many African infants, has both specific and off-target effects in the first few months of life, which may provide an immune priming benefit to other EPI vaccines.Copyright © 2019 Kiravu, Osawe, Happel, Nundalall, Wendoh, Beer, Dontsa, Alinde, Mohammed, Datong, Cameron, Rosenthal, Abimiku, Jaspan and Gray.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660582>Circulating β-cell-specific CD8+ T cells restricted by high risk HLA class I molecules show antigen experience in children with and at risk of type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoreactive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are implicated in the destruction of insulin-producing β-cells.

By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-κB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658786>Dose Effects of Recombinant Adenovirus Immunization in Rodents.</a></h2><p>Recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd) has been used as a vaccine platform against many infectious diseases and has been shown to be an effective vaccine vector. The dose of the vaccine varies significantly from study to study, making it very difficult to compare immune responses and vaccine efficacy. This study determined the immune correlates induced by serial dilutions of rAd vaccines delivered intramuscularly (IM) and intranasally (IN) to mice and rats. When immunized IM, mice had substantially higher antibody responses at the higher vaccine doses, whereas, the IN immunized mice showed a lower response to the higher rAd vaccine doses. Rats did not show dose-dependent antibody responses to increasing vaccine doses. The IM immunized mice and rats also showed significant dose-dependent T cell responses to the rAd vaccine. However, the T cell  plateaued in both mice and rats at 10 and 10 vp/animal, respectively. Additionally, the highest dose of vaccine in mice and rats did not improve the T cell responses. A final vaccine analysis using a lethal influenza virus challenge showed that despite the differences in the immune responses observed in the mice, the mice had very similar patterns of protection. This indicates that rAd vaccines induced dose-dependent immune responses, especially in IM immunized animals, and that immune correlates are not as predictive of protection as initially thought.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649660>A Comparison of the Innate and Adaptive Immune Systems in Cartilaginous Fish, Ray-Finned Fish, and Lobe-Finned Fish.</a></h2><p>The immune system is composed of two subsystems-the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the first to respond to pathogens and does not retain memory of previous responses. Innate immune responses are evolutionarily older than adaptive responses and elements of innate  can be found in all multicellular organisms. If a pathogen persists, the adaptive immune system will engage the pathogen with specificity and memory. Several components of the adaptive system including immunoglobulins (Igs), T cell receptors (TCR), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC), are assumed to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates-the Gnathostomata. This review will discuss and compare components of both the innate and adaptive immune systems in Gnathostomes, particularly in Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) and in Osteichthyes [bony fish: the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) and the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish)]. While many elements of both the innate and adaptive immune systems are conserved within these species and with higher level vertebrates, some elements have marked differences. Components of the innate immune system covered here include physical barriers, such as the skin and gastrointestinal tract, cellular components, such as pattern recognition receptors and immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils, and humoral components, such as the complement system. Components of the adaptive system covered include the fundamental cells and molecules of adaptive : B lymphocytes (B cells), T lymphocytes (T cells), immunoglobulins (Igs), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

Ly6/Plaur domain-containing 8 (Lypd8), a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein selectively expressed on colonic enterocytes, promotes this segregation by inhibiting bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer and colonic epithelia. However, it remains unclear whether Lypd8 prevents infection with enteric bacterial pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Lypd8 strongly contributes to early-phase defense against Citrobacter rodentium, which causes colitis by inducing attachment and effacement (A/E) lesions on colonic epithelia. Lypd8 inhibits C. rodentium attachment to intestinal epithelial cells by binding to intimin, thereby suppressing the interaction between intimin and translocated intimin receptor. Lypd8 deficiency leads to rapid C. rodentium colonization in the colon, resulting in severe colitis with Th17-cell and neutrophil expansion in the lamina propria.

In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of probiotics. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of probiotics on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, , inflammation and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK).

We have previously shown that antigen-specific, IL-17-producing CD4 T cells can provide capsular antibody-independent protection against nasal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae; but whether pneumococcus-responsive T are localized within the nasal mucosa and are sufficient for protection from carriage has not been determined. Here, we show that intranasal administration of live or killed pneumococci to mice generates pneumococcus-responsive IL-17A-producing CD4 mucosal T Furthermore, we show that these cells are sufficient to mediate long-lived, neutrophil-dependent protection against subsequent pneumococcal nasal challenge. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the prevailing paradigm, we found that parenteral administration of killed pneumococci also generates protective IL-17ACD4 T in the nasal mucosa. These results demonstrate a critical and sufficient role of T in prevention of pneumococcal colonization, and further that these cells can be generated by parenteral immunization.

The study aimed to evaluate the long-term persistence of protective anti-HBs antibody levels in healthcare students and resident doctors at risk for occupational exposure to HBV at 15 years after primary vaccination course. Further objective was to evaluate the anamnestic response observed in non-seroprotected subjects receiving a booster dose. Data were collected from the clinical documentation filled in during the occupational medical check of medical students and resident doctors undergoing Occupational Health Surveillance by the University of Ferrara. Of the 621 included individuals, 27.7% had an anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL. Subjects vaccinated during infancy had more frequently a concentration < 10 mIU/mL than those vaccinated during adolescence (42.7% vs 6.9%; p-value < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the statistical significance of the vaccination age. 94 subjects who had an anti-HBs concentration < 10 mIU/mL received a booster dose. The proportion of subjects who had an anamnestic response was higher in those vaccinated in infancy rather than during adolescence (94.1% vs 77.8% respectively). These findings suggest that the anti-HBs concentration decreases below 10 mIU/mL more frequently in subjects vaccinated during infancy. Immunological memory seems to persist after the decline of the anti-HB titer, as observed in response to a booster dose. In conclusion, vaccinated subjects at increased risk of HBV infection should be monitored and a booster dose administered if anti-HBs titer is below 10 mIU/mL.©2019 Pacini Editore SRL, Pisa, Italy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654988>Total Glucosides of Paeony protects against collagen-induced mouse arthritis via inhibiting follicular helper T cell differentiation.</a></h2><p>The development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to germinal center (GC) response and autoreactive T cells, which mediate adaptive  and play an important role in stimulating the production of autoantibodies and pro-inflammatory cytokines by B cells and macrophages. Total Glucosides of Paeony (TGP) has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and analgesic effects and is widely used to treat RA. However, few studies investigated whether the therapeutic effect of TGP is associated with the inhibition of autoimmune response.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of TGP on RA.Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was used, and TGP and paeoniflorin were intragastrically treated.DBA/1 mice were divided into 5 groups: control, model, positive drug (paeoniflorin) and high- and low-dose TGP group. After 21 days of intragastric administration, the pathological change, inflammation expression and molecular mechanism of each group of mice were detected by Micro-CT, histochemical analysis, ELLSA, Western blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry.Our study found that TGP treatment effectively improved inflammation and joint destruction in CIA mice. It reduced the production of serum IgG2a and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including serum interleukin (IL)-21, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and STAT3 in a dose-dependent manner. More importantly, TGP could suppress the frequency of germinal center B cells and Tfh cells in the spleen.TGP can not only improve symptoms, but also inhibit bone destruction. The therapeutic effect of TGP on CIA is mainly achieved by inhibiting spleen Tfh cell differentiation and GC formation through STAT3 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
