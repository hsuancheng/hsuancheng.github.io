Our aim was to investigate the potential of α-ionone, a naturally occurring flavoring agent, in preventing muscle atrophy and to delineate the mechanisms involved. We found that α-ionone not only stimulated myogenesis but also attenuated -induced atrophy of cultured skeletal myotubes, as evidenced by an increased myotube diameter and length, fusion index, and cellular protein content. These beneficial actions of α-ionone were abrogated by cAMP inhibitor. The antiatrophic effects of α-ionone on cultured myotubes were confirmed in a corresponding mouse model. The skeletal muscle mass, muscle protein content, myofiber diameter, and muscle strength were greater in α-ionone-treated mice than in untreated animals fed high- diet. Furthermore, α-ionone increased cAMP concentration and enhanced its downstream PKA-CREB signaling in skeletal muscle of mice fed high- diet. Thus, α-ionone is a promising agent that may enhance skeletal muscle mass and strength.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834410>Dietary zerumbone from shampoo ginger: new insights into its antioxidant and anticancer activity.</a></h2><p>The dietary sesquiterpene dienone zerumbone (ZER) selectively targets cancer cells, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, and protects non-cancerous cells towards oxidative stress and insult. This study examines the in vitro effects of ZER on  peroxidation in biological systems (cholesterol and phospholipid membrane oxidation) and explores its antitumor action in terms of its ability to modulate cancer cell  profile. Evaluation of the antioxidant activity of ZER showed that this compound is unable to trap lipoperoxyl radicals per se. ZER significantly modulated the total  and fatty  profiles in cancer cells, inducing marked changes in the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio, with significant decreases in the levels of oleic and  acids and a marked increase of stearic . Cell-based fluorescent measurements of intracellular membranes and  droplets using the Nile Red staining technique showed that in cancer cells, ZER induced significant accumulation of cytosolic  droplets and altered cell membrane organization/protein dynamics, depolarizing the mitochondrial membranes and inducing apoptosis and alteration of nuclear morphology. The modulatory activity of ZER on the total  and fatty  profiles and  droplets may therefore represent another possible mechanism of its anticancer properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284614>Overexpression of Acyl-ACP Thioesterases,  and , Induce Distinct Gene Expression Reprogramming in Developing Seeds of .</a></h2><p>We examined the substrate preference of  acyl-ACP thioesterases,  and , and gene expression changes associated with the modification of  composition in the seed, using  transgenic plants overexpressing  or  under the control of a seed-specific promoter.  seeds contained a higher level of total saturated fatty  (FA) content, with 4.3 times increase in 16:0 , whereas  seeds showed approximately 3% accumulation of 10:0 and 12:0 medium-chain FAs, and a small increase in other saturated FAs, resulting in higher levels of total saturated FAs. RNA-Seq analysis using entire developing pods at 8, 25, and 45 days after flowering (DAF) showed up-regulation of genes for β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I/II, stearoyl-ACP desaturase, oleate desaturase, and linoleate desaturase, which could increase unsaturated FAs and possibly compensate for the increase in 16:0  at 45 DAF in  transgenic plants. In  transgenic plants, many putative chloroplast- or mitochondria-encoded genes were identified as differentially expressed.

Irisin is a recently identified adipomyokine with protective effects on metabolic homeostasis and inflammation-suppressing effects in hepatic and vascular cells. The present study examined the effects of irisin on  and inflammation in β cells under glucolipotoxic conditions.Rat INS-1E β cells and islets isolated from C57BL/6 mice were incubated in glucolipotoxic conditions with or without irisin. Intracellular  contents and lipogenic gene expression were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays and real-time PCR, respectively. Inflammatory status was evidenced by Western blot analysis for the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and real-time PCR analysis for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.Irisin reversed glucolipotoxicity-induced intracellular non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and triglyceride accumulation, suppressed associated elevations in lipogenic gene expression, and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) in INS-1E cells. These demonstrated effects were dependent on irisin-activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, AMPK signaling mediated the protective effects of irisin on INS-1E cell insulin secretory ability and survival as well. Additionally, irisin inhibited phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 while decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Moreover, irisin also improved insulin secretion, inhibited apoptosis, and restored β-cell function-related gene expression in isolated mouse islets under glucolipotoxic conditions.Irisin attenuated excessive lipogenesis in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic state through activation of AMPK. Irisin also suppressed overnutrition-induced inflammation in INS-1E cells. Our findings implicate irisin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of islet  metabolic disorder and islet inflammation in T2DM.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline (5 mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to  and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in body-weight gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated insulin resistance. Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty  synthesis genes, while increased fatty  oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by  (PA). The effect was enhanced by AICAR.Our data suggest that compound C is a potent NAFLD suppressor and an attractive therapeutic target for hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30550084>[The becoming of reactions of lipolysis in phylogenesis. The  and oleic triglycerides as substrates. Insulin, condition of normolipemia and formation of hyper lipoproteinemia type IIb, IV and V].</a></h2><p>According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology, when living in ocean all were carnivorous (piscivorous) fatty acids transferring to cells in form of non-polar triglycerides nitially began apoB-48 chylomicrons, continued lipoproteins of very low and low density and fnalized its apoB-100 endocytosis. The fatty acids are transferred by chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density and non-polar triglycerides are hydrolyzed by hepatic glycerolhydrogenase and co-enzyme apoC-III; according WHO classifcation, hyperlipoproteinemia corresponds to type V. On land, in herbivorous who are not yet synthesized insulin, apoB-48 and chylomicrons left process of non-polar triglycerides transferring. In lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density, the carnivorous transfer exogenous  non-polar triglycerides. The herbivorous also transfer  non-polar triglycerides though synthesized by hepatocytes from glucose endogenically. In herbivorous, transferring of  non-polar triglycerides prior to synthesis of insulin is forming apoB-100 in composition of lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density. The hydrolysis of  non-polar triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density is activated by hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-III; cells absorb lipoproteins of low density by means of apoB-100 endocytosis. The content on lipoproteins in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins corresponds to hepatic glycerol hydrogenase type IIb. In frst and second types of fatty acids transferring in form of triglycerides to lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density predominate  fatty , triglycerides of the same name and   of fatty acids in vivo. The insulin initiated the third type of transferring of oleic fatty  by now to insulin-depended cells only in oleic lipoproteins of very low density; hydrolysis of oleic triglycerides is activated by late in phylogenesis post-heparin hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-II cofactor. The dynamic apoE is actively bound by apoB-100 forming apoE/B-100 ligand. At later stages of phylogenesis insulin formed fatty acids transferring in form of oleic triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density of the same name without forming of oleic lipoproteins of low density; the electrophoregram of lipoproteins reﬂects absence of hepatic glycerol hydrogenase. In phylogenesis three types of fatty acids transferring to triglycerides in composition of lipoproteins formed sequentially: 1) chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low and density + lipoproteins of low density; 2) lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density; 3) only in lipoproteins of very low density. The frst one is specifc to piscivorous (carnivorous) while living in ocean. The second one is implemented by herbivorous while they didn't begin to synthesize insulin and hepatocytes not yet transform all endogenous  fatty  into oleic fatty . Insulin initiated: a) transferring of oleic fatty acids to lipoproteins of very low density without forming oleic lipoproteins of low density; b) highly effective oleic  of fatty acids in vivo: c) becoming of biological function of locomotion. The aphysiological induction by substrate, surplus of  fatty acids in food initiate negative alterations in composition of lipoproteins in opposite direction than in case of phylogenesis. When homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begins to misuse carnivorous (meat) food then instead of normolipoproteinemia in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins one can initially detect transitory hyperlipoproteinemia type IV and then prolonged hyperlipoproteinemia type IIb. If patient factually passes on to carnivorous diet then hyperlipoproteinemia type V is developing. If content of exogenous  fatty  in food surpasses physiological capacities of its transferring in oleic triglycerides as palmitoyl-oleyl-palmitate glycerol,  triglycerides as oleyl-palmitoyl-palmitate glycerol begin to form and epigenetically aphysiological non-ligand  lipoproteins of very low density → lipoproteins of low density are formed. Their circulation in blood is a cause of hypertriglyceridemia, higher level of cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density, compensatory increasing of apoC-III. Then occurs induced by substrate formation of hyperlipoproteinemia initially of type IV, then of type IIb and fnally of type V. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and atheromotosis is activated when homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begin to misuse carnivorous food affecting biological functions of trophology, reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), function of homeostasis, endoecology and function of adaptation. The formation of   if fatty acids instead of oleic one is a cause of chronic defciency of energy and ATP synthesis in vivo. Insulin activates absorption of glucose by cells with purpose to use it for synthesis of oleic fatty acids.

Bioassay-guided fractionation of this bioactive extract yielded five previously undescribed flavonoid glycosides and one previously undescribed flavonolignan glycoside along with seven known flavonoid glycosides. The chemical structures of these compounds were elucidated by a combination of extensive spectroscopic analysis, including MS, NMR and UV techniques. Eight compounds of all isolated compounds showed inhibitory effects on the  accumulation induced by high concentrations of  and glucose in HepG2 cells. Four selected compounds were tested for  content in a dose-dependent manner (10, 20 and 40 μM), and among those compounds, kaempferol 3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside showed the strongest inhibition of hepatic  production in HepG2 cells. In an oil-red O staining assay, five compounds were shown to reduce hepatic  accumulation better than what was observed in the vehicle control group.

However, their ability to utilize the AA in canola products might be different from each other. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in broiler chickens and growing pigs fed FFCS, CM, and CE. Three diets were prepared to contain FFCS, CM, or CE as a sole source of nitrogen. A nitrogen-free diet was prepared. In Exp. 1, a total of 272 twenty-one-day-old male broiler chickens with an initial BW of 932 ± 80.6 g were assigned to diets in a randomized complete block design with BW as a blocking factor. After 5 d of feeding, birds were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital, and ileal digesta samples were collected from distal two-third of the ileum. In Exp. 2, 16 barrows were surgically fitted with T-cannulas at the distal ileum. After 8-d recovery period, pigs (initial BW = 18.9 ± 1.17 kg) were divided into 4 blocks based on BW and assigned to a quadruplicate 4 × 2 incomplete Latin Square design with 4 diets and 2 periods. Each period consisted of 5-d adaptation and 2-d ileal digesta collection periods. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement with effects of species (broiler chickens or pigs) and diets (FFCS, CM, or CE). There were interactions (P < 0.05) between species and experimental diets in the AID of all indispensable AA except for Lys. The AID of indispensable AA in FFCS for broiler chickens was greater (P < 0.05) than for pigs. Broiler chickens also had greater (P < 0.05) AID of Arg, His, Leu, Phe, and Val in CM compared with pigs; however, there were no differences in the AID of indispensable AA in CE between broiler chickens and pigs. The basal ileal endogenous losses of CP and AA, except Trp, in pigs were greater (P < 0.05) than in broiler chickens. There were also interactions (P < 0.05) between species and experimental diets in the SID of all indispensable AA except for Lys. Broiler chickens fed the diet containing FFCS had greater (P < 0.05) SID of indispensable AA compared with pigs fed the same diet; however, the SID of indispensable AA in CM or CE were not different between broiler chickens and pigs. In conclusion, differences in digestibility of AA in canola products were affected by nonruminant animal species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354245>Palmitoylethanolamide Promotes a Proresolving Macrophage Phenotype and Attenuates Atherosclerotic Plaque Formation.</a></h2><p>Objective- Palmitoylethanolamide is an endogenous fatty  mediator that is synthetized from membrane phospholipids by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D. Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial inflammation, such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high- diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569770>Dietary sn-2  triacylglycerols reduced faecal lipids, calcium contents and altered  in Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, the impact of dietary sn-2  triacylglycerol (sn-2 PTAG) on faecal lipids, calcium excretion and  metabolic alternation was investigated in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats fed with high- diet containing either palm olein (PO, sn-2  (PA) of 14.8%), sn-2 PTAG50 (sn-2 PA of 56.4%) or sn-2 PTAG70 (sn-2 PA of 72.4%), respectively. After 4-week feeding period, SD rats fed with sn-2 PTAGs showed reduced faecal soap fatty acids, neutral  and calcium excretion compared to those of PO-fed rats, whereas a significant difference was only observed for the sn-2 PTAG70-fed rats (p < .05). Moreover, dietary sn-2 PTAG70 also showed a significant effect on decreasing serum triacylglycerol (TAG) level, reducing perirenal adipocyte size and regulating  in small intestine and perirenal adipose tissue of SD rats. Significantly increased mRNA levels of genes involved in intestinal  anabolism as well as  catabolism were both observed in the sn-2 PTAG70-fed rats (p < .05). Meanwhile, dietary sn-2 PTAG70 also significantly up-regulated lipolysis, mitochondrial fatty  oxidation and thermogenesis-related gene and protein levels in perirenal adipose tissue, which might be correlated with the reduced perirenal adipocyte size.

Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other  classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In both experiments, 6 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 duplicated Latin square design (21-d periods). Cows were fed a total mixed ration at a restricted level to meet their nutrient requirements. In experiment 1, 169 g dry matter (DM) of OT or 56 g DM of HP was included separately in the control diet (C1). In experiment 2, the additives were included together (OT-HP) in the control diet (C2) similar to C1. Diet C2 was compared with a control without linseed (C0). In experiment 1, the supplementation of the control diet with OT decreased urinary N excretion by 12%. In experiment 2, the combination of OT and HP decreased urinary N by 7%. Oak tannin extracts and HP alone or in combination did not influence the daily enteric CH production of cows. Cows fed diet C0 produced 17% more enteric CH daily than those fed diet C2. Intake of diet C2, which contained 6.7% extruded linseed on a DM basis (experiment 2), decreased the sum of 6:0 to 14:0 fatty acids (-16%) and  (-26%) and increased the stearic  (+50%), oleic  (+36%), vaccenic  (trans-11 18:1; +285%), rumenic  (cis-9,trans-11 18:2; +235%), and α-linolenic  (+100%) in milk . The supplementation of diet C2 with the OT-HP mixture further improved the milk's fatty  composition. Intake of the OT alone increased α-linolenic  by 17.7% (experiment 1). The results of this study show that at the economically acceptable dose we tested, hops had no effect on urinary N excretion, CH emission, milk production, and milk composition. By contrast, supplementation of diets with oak tannin extract can be considered for reducing urinary N excretion. The combination of oak tannin and hops had no more effect than oak tannin alone except on the milk fatty  profile, which was favorably influenced from a nutritional point of view.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, using human non‑small cell lung cancer A549 cells, it was determined that CsA (0.1 or 1 µM) promoted cell proliferation with glucose alone as the energy source. CsA treatment increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and consequently the expression of Cyclin D1. Inhibiting Akt signaling with the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase inhibitor wortmannin prevented this effect. Mechanistically, CsA treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and the intracellular ROS scavenger N‑acetyl‑cysteine (NAC) attenuated CsA‑induced cell proliferation as well as the activation of Akt/Cyclin D1 signaling. However, notably, it was demonstrated that CsA treatment decreased cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation under normal  loading. Further investigation indicated that  induced excessive generation of ROS, while CsA treatment further stimulated this ROS production.

The profile of fatty acids was measured in the membranes of erythrocytes and analyzed by gas chromatography. The dietary compliance was evaluated using 72-diary questionnaires, anthropometric measurements.With the reduction of fatty liver (p<0.01), the patients' biochemical and anthropometric parameters were significantly improved. A significant decrease in the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and asparagine aminotransferase (p<0.01) was observed, along with a decrease in the amount of insulin (p<0.05) and insulin resistance (p<0.05). Significant changes in terms of the fatty  profile were observed among patients who followed the dietary intervention. There was a noticeable tendency in terms of the reduction  (p<0.055) and a significant reduction of stearic  (p<0.05).

Genome microarray of NRCMs was performed to further reveal the mechanism underlying cardiac dysfunction. induced hypertrophy in NRCMs that upregulated 11β-HSD1 expression in cardiomyocytes, which led to a significant enlargement in the cell size and expression of cardiac hypertrophy-specific genes. Conversely, a remarkable decrease in cardiomyocytes size was detected in either BVT.2733 (a selective inhibitor of 11β-HSD1)-treated or 11β-HSD1-deficient NRCMs. Furthermore, both glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone markedly attenuated the 11β-HSD1-induced cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. Genome microarray revealed that cAMP and calcium signaling pathways are potential downstream signaling pathways regulated by 11β-HSD1 in cardiomyocytes hypertrophy. Similar to in vitro results, BVT.2733 strikingly attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and improved cardiac function in HFD-fed rats.11β-HSD1 acts as an important regulator that controls the cardiac remolding via both GR and MR and the pharmacological inhibition of 11β-HSD1 could be a new therapeutic approach in preventing HFD-induced cardiac hypertrophy.Copyright © 2018.

During storage, no differences in synchrotron XRD spectra were seen. However, laboratory SAXS measurements showed a second lamellar structure, identified as polymorph B. Synchrotron SAXS temperature scans confirmed that polymorph B did not affect the morphology of the encapsulated drug or the shape of NLC. These results highlight the unique capabilities of laboratory and synchrotron X-ray Scattering and Diffraction for improved structural characterization of  nanoparticles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers  droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy . However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high- diet fed mice and P/O ( and oleic  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30458418>Relationship between selenium removal efficiency and production of  and hydrogen by Chlorella vulgaris.</a></h2><p>In our previous studies, Chlorella vulgaris had proven highly efficient in removing selenium (Se) from water, while the disposal of Se containing in algal biomass was still an issue of concern.

In addition, compared with the Se free algae, hydrogen production rate was 2.1- and 4.3-fold higher for the selenate and selenite treated algae, respectively. Se removal efficiency achieved by the selenite treated algae through accumulation and volatilization was 2.3-fold higher than the selenate treatment under hypoxic condition with S deprived, which is in contrast to the results obtained under aerobic conditions.Copyright © 2018.

Our previous studies found that mangiferin could decrease serum FFA levels in obese rats induced by a high- diet. Our research was to determine the effects and mechanism of mangiferin on improving IR by regulating FFA  in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. The model was used to quantify PA-induced  accumulation in the two cell lines treated with various concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h. We found that mangiferin significantly increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, via phosphorylation of protein kinase B (P-AKT), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein expressions, and markedly decreased glucose content, respectively, in HepG2 and C2C12 cells induced by PA. Mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake and decreased intracellular FFA and triglyceride (TG) accumulations. The activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) protein and its downstream proteins involved in fatty  translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the fatty  -oxidation rate corresponding to FFA  were also markedly increased by mangiferin in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. Furthermore, the effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of PPAR. Mangiferin ameliorated IR by increasing the consumption of glucose and promoting the FFA oxidation via the PPAR pathway in HepG2 and C2C12 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866181>Single Cell Oil Production from Undetoxified  L. hydrolysate by .</a></h2><p>The use of low-cost substrates represents one key issue to make single cell oil production sustainable.

PA in PO is esterified predominantly at the SN-1,3 position of triacylglycerol (TAG), and infant formulas are now available in which a greater proportion of PA is in the SN-2 position (typical configuration in human milk). As there are some concerns about the use of PO, we aimed to review literature on health effects of PO and SN-2-palmitate in infant formulas.PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched for relevant studies on possible beneficial effects or harms of either PO or SN-2-palmitate in infant formula on various health outcomes.We identified 12 relevant studies using PO and 21 studies using SN-2-palmitate. Published studies have variable methodology, subject characteristics, and some are underpowered for the key outcomes. PO is associated with harder stools and SN-2-palmitate use may lead to softer stool consistency. Bone effects seem to be short-lasting. For some outcomes (infant colic, faecal microbiota, ), the number of studies is very limited and summary evidence inconclusive. Growth of infants is not influenced. There are no studies published on the effect on markers of later diseases.There is insufficient evidence to suggest that PO should be avoided as a source of  in infant formulas for health reasons.

However, no studies to date have examined the use of high-oleic (HO) peanut cultivars as a feed ingredient for laying hens and determined the impact of feeding HO peanuts on performance and egg nutritive qualities. This project aimed to examine the use of HO peanuts as a feed ingredient for layer hens to determine the effect on performance, egg  chemistry, and quality of the eggs produced. Forty-eight 40-wk-old layer hens were fed a conventional soybean meal + corn control diet or a HO peanut + corn diet for 10 wk in conventional battery cages. Body and feed weights were collected weekly. Pooled egg samples were analyzed for quality,  analysis, and peanut protein allergenicity. There were no significant differences in hen performance or egg quality as measured by USDA grade quality, egg albumen height, or egg Haugh unit between the treatment groups. However, eggs produced from layer hens fed the HO peanut + corn diet had reduced egg weights relative to the controls (P = 0.0001). Eggs produced from layer hens fed the HO peanut diet had greater yolk color scores (P < 0.0001), HO fatty  (P < 0.0001), and β-carotene (P < 0.0001) levels in comparison to the controls. Eggs produced from hens fed the control diet had greater  and stearic saturated fatty acids (P < 0.0001), and trans  (P < 0.0001) content compared to eggs produced from hens fed the HO peanut diet. All egg protein extracts from all treatments at each time point were non-reactive with rabbit anti-peanut agglutinin antibodies. This study identifies HO peanuts as an abundant commodity that could be used to support local agricultural markets of peanuts and poultry within the southeastern United States and be of economic advantage to producers while providing a potential health benefit to the consumer with improved egg nutrition.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Poultry Science Association 2018.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115809>Comparison of monoculture and mixed culture (Scenedesmus obliquus and wild algae) for C, N, and P removal and  production.</a></h2><p>This study compared the efficiency of nutrient removal and  accumulation by a monoculture of Scenedesmus obliquus and mixed cultures of microalgae.

We aimed to investigate the effect of miR-181a in  and find new treatments for NAFLD. The expression level of miR-181a in NAFLD patient serum and a  (PA)-induced NAFLD cell model was examined by Q-PCR. Oil red O staining and triglyceride assays were used to assess  accumulation in hepatocytes. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and the fatty  β-oxidation-related genes. Direct interactions were validated by dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. MiR-181a expression was significantly upregulated in the serum of NAFLD patients and PA-induced hepatocytes. Inhibition of miR-181a expression resulted in the increased expression of PPARα and its downstream genes, and PA-induced  accumulation in hepatocytes was also inhibited. Upregulation of miR-181a resulted in the downregulation of its direct target PPARα and downstream gene expression of PPARα as well as aggravated  accumulation in hepatocytes. At the same time, the increased expression of PPARα can offset  accumulation in hepatocytes induced by miR-181a mimics. This study demonstrates that reducing the expression of miR-181a may improve  in NAFLD. The downregulation of miR-181a expression can be a therapeutic strategy for NAFLD by modulating its target PPARα.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In AD hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is one of the first types of memory to be impaired. Previous studies have shown that in mice fed a high- diet (HFD) episodic memory is rapidly but reversibly impaired.In this study we use hippocampal proteomics to investigate the effects of HFD in the hippocampus. Mice were fed either a low- diet (LFD) or HFD containing either 10% or 60% (Kcal) from  for 3 days, 1 week or 2 weeks. One group of mice were fed the HFD for 1 week and then returned to the LFD for a further week. Primary hippocampal cultures were challenged with  (PA), the most common long-chain saturated FA in the Western diet, and with the anti-inflammatory, n-3 polyunsaturated FA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), or a combination of the two to ascertain effects of these fatty acids on dendritic structure.HFD-induced changes occur in hippocampal proteins involved in , inflammation, cell stress, cell signalling, and the cytoskeleton after 3 days, 1 week and 2 weeks of HFD. Replacement of the HFD after 1 week by a low- diet (LFD) for a further week resulted in partial recovery of the hippocampal proteome. Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), one of the earliest proteins changed, was used to investigate the impact of fatty acids (FAs) on hippocampal neuronal morphology. PA challenge resulted in shorter and less arborised dendrites while DHA had no effect when applied alone but counteracted the effects of PA when FAs were used in combination. Dendritic morphology recovered when PA was removed from the cell culture media.This study provides evidence for the rapid and reversible effects of diet on the hippocampal proteome and the impact of PA and DHA on dendritic structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30708325>Mst1 inhibition attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease via reversing Parkin-related mitophagy.</a></h2><p>Obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is connected with mitochondrial stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Parkin-related mitophagy sustains mitochondrial homeostasis and hepatocyte viability. However, the contribution and regulatory mechanisms of Parkin-related mitophagy in NAFLD are incompletely understood. Macrophage stimulating 1 (Mst1) is a novel mitophagy upstream regulator which excerbates heart and cancer apoptosisn via repressing mitophagy activity. The aim of our study is to explore whether Mst1 contributes to NAFLD via disrupting Parkin-related mitophagy. A NAFLD model was generated in wild-type (WT) mice and Mst1 knockout (Mst1-KO) mice using high- diet (HFD). Cell experiments were conducted via  (PA) treatment in the primary hepatocytes. The results in our study demonstrated that Mst1 was significantly upregulated in HFD-treated livers. Genetic ablation of Mst1 attenuated HFD-mediated hepatic injury and sustained hepatocyte viability. Functional studies illustrated that Mst1 knockdown reversed Parkin-related mitophagy and the latter protected mitochondria and hepatocytes against HFD challenge. Besides, we further figured out that Mst1 modulated Parkin expression via the AMPK pathway; blockade of AMPK repressed Parkin-related mitophagy and recalled hepatocytes mitochondrial apoptosis. Altogether, our data identified that NAFLD was closely associated with the defective Parkin-related mitophagy due to Mst1 upregulation.

Actually, inadequate dietary habits together with physical inactivity are primary determinants of obesity and cancer risk. Changes in  play a crucial role in different types of cancer and key enzymes involved in -metabolic pathways, such as stearoyl-coA-desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues.Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were analyzed by Winfood software. FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically  (p = 0.0042) and stearic  (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular oleic  (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the metabolic pathways.

Activation of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) can promote the browning of white . 9-PAHSA, an endogenous mammalian , which is acting as the ligand of GPR120 to enhance glucose uptake and exert anti-inflammatory effect. In the study, we would like to investigate the biological effects of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning. Here, we show that 9-PAHSA induces browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via enhanced expression of brown  specific genes. 9-PAHSA-induced browning in white adipocytes of WT mice and ob/ob mice was investigated by determining expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific genes/proteins by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunoblot analysis and immunochemical staining. The effects of 9-PAHSA on brown  markers in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased when GPR120 gene was silenced. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was conducted. 9-PAHSA treatment abolished LPS-induced NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. But these anti-inflammatory effects of 9-PAHSA were attenuated by GPR120 knockdown. Our finding demonstrated that the browning of adipocyte was induced by 9-PAHSA through activating GPR120 and inhibiting the LPS/NF-κB pathway.

However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and  in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and  in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and . We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic  and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased  oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty  synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions.

It has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of obesity and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high  (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of insulin secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM ) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an obesity rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662. In conclusion, the protective effect of telmisartan was mediated by an anti-ER stress-induced apoptotic and anti-oxidative pathway. SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder worldwide pathologically characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high -induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the insulin secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673191>[Biological role of insulin: transformation of carnivores leaving in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land.

Our previous studies suggested that resveratrol (RSV) supplement could improve hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanism, particularly which related to LD accumulation, has not yet been elucidated.A high- diet (HFD) and  were used to induce hepatic steatosis in mouse liver and hepatocytes, respectively. The effects of RSV on LD accumulation were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. The effects of RSV on the expression levels of LD-associated genes (ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1) were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot assays, followed by KD or overexpression of SIRT1 and ATF6 with small interfering RNAs or overexpressed plasmids, respectively. The dual luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay were utilized to clarify the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and possible interaction between SIRT1 and ATF6.There was a significant increase in the accumulation of LDs in liver and hepatocytes during the process of HFD-induced steatosis, respectively, which was significantly inhibited by RSV supplementation. RSV notably activated SIRT1 expression and decreased the expression levels of ATF6, Fsp27β/CIDEC, CREBH, and PLIN1, which are associated with LD accumulation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of RSV on LD accumulation and the associated expression of genes in hepatocytes were abrogated or strengthened with SIRT1 silencing or overexpression, respectively. On the contrary, the benefits of RSV in hepatocytes were eliminated or aggravated when transfected with the overexpressed ATF6 or ATF6 siRNA, respectively. Furthermore, we found that RSV stimulated SIRT1 expression significantly, which was followed by increased deacetylation and inactivation of ATF6, resulting in a positive feedback loop for SIRT1 transcription associated with ATF6 binding to the SIRT1 promoter region.Taken together, these findings indicate that RSV supplementation improves hepatic steatosis by ameliorating the accumulation of LDs, and this might be partially mediated by a SIRT1/ATF6-dependent mechanism.© 2018 The Author(s).

In the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, fatty acids (FAs) are synthesized from acetyl-CoA in the stroma of the plastid, producing . FAs are elongated and desaturated to form very-long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in domains of the endomembrane system that need to be identified. Synthesis of VLC-PUFAs is coupled with their import to the core of the plastid via the so-called "omega" pathway. The biosynthesis of sterols in diatoms is likely to be localized in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as using precursors deriving from the mevalonate pathway, using acetyl-CoA as initial substrate. These metabolic modules can be characterized functionally by genetic analyzes or chemical treatments with appropriate inhibitors. Some 'metabolic modules' are characterized by a very low level of metabolic intermediates. Since some chemical treatments or genetic perturbation of  induce the accumulation of these intermediates, channeling processes are possibly involved, suggesting that protein-protein interactions might occur between enzymes within large size complexes or metabolons. At the junction of these modules, metabolic intermediates might therefore play dramatic roles in directing carbon fluxes from one direction to another.

Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced  accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced  deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell  accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

The objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the associations between milk  content of de novo FA, with (1) diet composition, and (2) milk production and composition. Milk FA data from 96 peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2016 that included 324 treatment means from 83 bovine experiments, 36 treatment means from 12 caprine experiments, and 40 treatment means from 12 ovine experiments were used in this analysis. Individual species models including the fixed effect of experiment were fitted using multiple regression to explain milk content of de novo FA as a function of diet composition and milk production and composition variables. We also evaluated replacing the effect of the experiment by the effect of the experiment nested in the laboratory at which the research had been conducted, and the effect of the laboratory. Butyric  content in milk  was positively but weakly related to dietary ether extract in does and ewes. Lauric, myristic, and  contents in milk  were negatively related to dietary ether extract in does and to a somewhat lesser extent in cows and ewes. The results confirm that the inclusion of lipids in the diet may not only affect the availability of preformed FA but also the profile of FA synthesized de novo in the mammary gland. Most of the variation in all prediction models was explained by the experiment or by the laboratory if the latter was included in the model. The ample variation in analytical methods reported by the different research groups suggests that differences in analytical protocols might explain a substantial proportion of the variation in de novo FA profile. A main conclusion of this study is the potential influence of differences in analytical procedures to explain the variation in de novo FA profile. Standardization of methods of FA analysis to improve reproducibility seems to be an aspect of importance to this area of research.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high- diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% ), FO diet (NY, 10% ), HFD (60% ), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% ) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness, energy absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155812>Anthocyanins ameliorate palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Increased adiposity has been associated with adipose tissue low-grade inflammation leading to insulin resistance. Adipocyte differentiation inhibitors are expected to be effective in preventing obesity and related diseases. Anthocyanins (ACNs) are associated to enhanced adipocyte function and protection from metabolic stress. Herein, we evaluated the in vitro protective effects of an ACN rich extract against  (PA)-induced hypertrophy, inflammation, and insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ACN extract pretreatment reduces  accumulation and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ protein levels induced by PA. In addition, PA induces inflammation with activation of NF-κB pathway, whereas ACN extract pretreatment dose-dependently inhibited this pathway. Furthermore, adipocyte dysfunction associated with hypertrophy induces insulin resistance by affecting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/Akt axis, GLUT-1, and adiponectin mRNA levels. ACN extract pretreatment reverts these effects induced by PA and moreover was able to induce insulin pathway with levels higher than insulin control cells, supporting an insulin sensitizer role for ACNs. This study demonstrates a prevention potential of ACNs against obesity comorbidities, due to their protective effects against inflammation/insulin resistance in adipocytes. In addition, these results contribute to the knowledge and strategies on the evaluation of the mechanism of action of ACNs from a food source under basal and insulin resistance conditions related to obesity.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340817>1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D regulates  and glucose utilization in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.</a></h2><p>It is well established that adipose tissue can both store and metabolize vitamin D. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)D], regulates adipocyte differentiation and inflammation, highlighting the multifaceted role that vitamin D plays in adipose tissue physiology. However, there is limited evidence regarding vitamin D regulation of mature adipocyte . We hypothesize that 1,25(OH)D alters  and glucose  in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to reduce triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. In this study, 1,25(OH)D (10 nmol/L) stimulated a 21% reduction in TAG accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after 4 days (P = .01) despite a significant increase in fatty  uptake (P < .01). Additionally, 1,25(OH)D stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in CO production from [1-C]  (P < .01), indicative of an elevated rate of fatty  β-oxidation, while stimulating a 9% reduction in de novo fatty  synthesis (P = .03). Interestingly, d-[U-C]glucose incorporation into fatty acids was reduced by 30% in response to 1,25(OH)D (P < .01), indicating a reduced contribution of glucose as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis. Consistent with these findings, mRNA expression of the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase was reduced by 41% (P < .01). In summary, 1,25(OH)D stimulated fatty  oxidation and reduced TAG accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. Furthermore, 1,25(OH)D reduced glucose utilization as a substrate for fatty  synthesis potentially by downregulating pyruvate carboxylase and stimulating glucose disposal as glycerol. Collectively, these 1,25(OH)D-induced changes in  and glucose utilization may contribute to the reduction in TAG accumulation and be protective against excessive  mass accumulation and associated metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Obese and/or diabetic patients have elevated levels of free fatty acids, increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal symptoms and are suggested to have altered vitamin D balance. The enteric nervous system is pivotal in regulating gastrointestinal activity and high  diet (HFD) has been shown to cause loss of enteric neurons in ileum and colon. This study investigates the effect of vitamin D on HFD- and -induced enteric neuronal loss in vivo and in vitro.Mice were fed either a normal diet (ND) or HFD supplemented with varying levels of vitamin D (from 0x to 20x normal vitamin D level) for 19 weeks. Ileum and colon were analyzed for neuronal numbers and remodeling. Primary cultures of myenteric neurons from mouse small intestine were treated with  (4x10M) and/or 1α,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (VD, 10- 10M) with or without modulators of  and VD pathways. Cultures were analyzed by immunocyto- and histochemical methods.Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on enteric neuronal survival in the ND group. HFD caused substantial loss of myenteric neurons in ileum and colon. Vitamin D supplementation between 0-2x normal had no effect on HFD-induced neuronal loss. Supplementation with 20x normal, prevented the HFD-induced neuronal loss. In vitro supplementation of VD prevented the -induced neuronal loss. The VD receptor (VDR) was not identified in enteric neurons. Enteric glia expressed the alternative VD receptor, protein disulphide isomerase family A member 3 (PDIA3), but PDIA3 was not found to mediate the VD response in vitro. Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and immune neutralization of isocitrate lyase prevented the VD mediated neuroprotection to  exposure.Results show that VD protect enteric neurons against HFD and  induced neuronal loss. The mechanism behind is suggested to be through activation of PPARγ leading to improved neuronal peroxisome function and  of neuronal  intermediates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240928>Protocatechuic -Ameliorated Endothelial Oxidative Stress through Regulating Acetylation Level via CD36/AMPK Pathway.</a></h2><p>As one of the main metabolites of anthocyanin, protocatechuic  (PCA) possesses strong antioxidant activity. In the present study, we explored the capacity of PCA on the alleviation of endothelial oxidative stress and investigated the underlying mechanisms using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). In comparison with  (PA)-treated cells, PCA (100 μM) significantly decreased the generations of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (0.82 ± 0.01 vs 1.16 ± 0.05 and 0.80 ± 0.01 vs 1.48 ± 0.15, respectively, p < 0.01), two biomarkers of oxidative damage, and restored the levels of nitric oxide (NO) (0.97 ± 0.04 vs 0.54 ± 0.02, p < 0.01) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (0.96 ± 0.03 vs 0.86 ± 0.02, p < 0.01) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Palmitoylation is the most-studied protein lipidation, which consists of the attachment of a molecule of  to residues of proteins. -palmitoylation is a reversible cysteine modification finely regulated by palmitoyl-transferases and acyl-thioesterases that is involved in the regulation of protein trafficking and activity. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that diet-dependent molecules such as insulin and fatty acids may affect protein palmitoylation. Here, we examine the role of protein palmitoylation on the regulation of gene expression focusing on the impact of this modification on the activity of chromatin remodeler enzymes, transcription factors, and nuclear proteins.

However, the underlying mechanism in pancreatic β cells remains unclear. To explore the potential link between GPR120 and β-cell function, its agonists docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and GSK137647A were used in  (PA)-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, coupled with GPR120 knockdown (KD) in MIN6 cells and GPR120 knockout (KO) mice to identify the underlying signaling pathways.  and  treatments of MIN6 cells and islets isolated from wild-type (WT) mice with DHA and GSK137647A restored pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) expression levels and β-cell function via inhibiting PA-induced elevation of proinflammatory chemokines and activation of nuclear factor κB, c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinases1/2 and p38MAPK signaling pathways. On the contrary, these GPR120 agonism-mediated protective effects were abolished in GPR120 KD cells and islets isolated from GPR120 KO mice. Furthermore, GPR120 KO mice displayed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance relative to WT littermates, and β-cell functional related genes were decreased while inflammation was exacerbated in islets with increased macrophages in pancreas from GPR120 KO mice. DHA and GSK137647A supplementation ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as improved  expression and islet inflammation in diet-induced obese WT mice, but not in GPR120 KO mice. These findings indicate that GPR120 activation is protective against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, via the mediation of PDX1 expression and inhibition of islet inflammation, and that GPR120 activation may serve as a preventative and therapeutic target for obesity and diabetes.© 2019 The Author(s).

However, microalgae have not been largely exploited in this field as a potential source of plant bio stimulants. This study investigated the biostimulatory effects of microalgae polysaccharides on different metabolomic and biochemical pathways related to plant defense. 0.2 mg mL of crude polysaccharides extracted from four green microalgae strains was injected into tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). β-1,3-glucanase activity,  remodeling, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), Lipoxygenase (LOX), and antioxidant enzyme (APX, POD and CAT) activities were evaluated 48 h after treatment. Plants treated with crude polysaccharides extracted from. C. vulgaris and C. sorokiniana exhibited a significant increase in β-1,3-glucanase activity. Accordingly, C. sorokiniana crude polysaccharides had a significant stimulatory effect on PAL activity with a percentage increase of 188.73% compared to the control. GC/MS quantitative lipidomics analysis revealed that treatment with D. salina, C. sorokiniana, and C. reinhardtii crude polysaccharides increased PUFA content by 50.37%, 34.46%, and 33.37% respectively. Microalgae polysaccharides also enhanced stearic , , and VLCFA content, the optimal value of which increased by 45.50%, 32.83%, and 60.60% respectively under treatment with C. reinhardtii crude polysaccharides compared with the control.

This study was aimed to investigate whether  would stimulate EV release from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Human and rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2 and NRK-52E, were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA-conjugated  (PA), and BSA-conjugated oleic  (OA) for 24-48 h. The EVs released into conditioned media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA). According to NTA, the size distribution of EVs was 30-150 nm with similar mode sizes in all experimental groups. Moreover, BSA-induced EV release was significantly enhanced in the presence of PA, whereas EV release was not altered by the addition of OA. In NRK-52E cells, PA-enhanced EV release was associated with an induction of cell apoptosis reflected by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein by Western blot and Annexin V positive cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of -induced EVs by recipient renal proximal tubular cells.

The putative actions of reduced insulin sensitivity and responsiveness and enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis spare glucose for the mammary synthesis of milk. However, severe insulin antagonism and body  mobilization may jeopardize hepatic health and lactation in dairy cattle. Interestingly, lipolysis- and dietary-derived fatty acids may impair insulin sensitivity in cows. The mechanisms are undefined yet have major implications for the development of postpartum fatty liver disease. In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide is a potent mediator of saturated -induced insulin resistance that defines in part the mechanisms of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In ruminants including the lactating dairy cow, the functions of ceramide had remained virtually undescribed. Through a series of hypothesis-centered studies, ceramide has emerged as a potential antagonist of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues in dairy cattle. Importantly, bovine data suggest that the ability of ceramide to inhibit insulin action likely depends on the lipolysis-dependent hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide during early lactation. Although these mechanisms appear to fade as lactation advances beyond peak milk production, early evidence suggests that  feeding is a means to augment ceramide supply. Herein, we review a body of work that focuses on sphingolipid biology and the role of ceramide in the dairy cow within the framework of hepatic and fatty  , insulin function, and lactation. The potential involvement of ceramide within the endocrine control of lactation is also considered.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-oleic  and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression.

We assessed associations between diabetogenic groups and plasma FAs in multivariate multinomial regressions (with Group 3 as the reference).Overall, 7.0% of study participants were in Group 1; 33.3% were in Group 2. Plasma concentrations of several individual FAs, including even-chain saturated FAs (SFAs; myristic, , stearic acids) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs; cis-vaccenic, oleic acids), were respectively associated with greater odds of Groups 1 and 2 status, adjusting for covariates. Higher concentrations of SFA and MUFA subgroups (highest compared with lowest quartile) were associated with increased odds of Group 2 status [SFAs adjusted OR (aOR): 1.51 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.18); MUFAs aOR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.85)].

Here, we report that the phosphorylation of SIRT6 is significantly increased after  (PA) treatment in colon cancer cells. PKCζ can physically interact with SIRT6 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction enhances following PA treatment. Further experiments show that PKCζ is the phosphorylase of SIRT6 and phosphorylates SIRT6 at threonine 294 residue to promote SIRT6 enrichment on chromatin. In the functional study, we find that the expression of ACSL1, CPT1, CACT, and HADHB, the genes related to fatty  β-oxidation, increases after PA stimulation. We further confirm that PKCζ mediates the binding of SIRT6 specifically to the promoters of fatty  β-oxidation-related genes and elicits the expression of these genes through SIRT6 phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate the mechanism of PKCζ as a new phosphorylase of SIRT6 on maintaining tumor fatty  β-oxidation and define the new role of PKCζ in  homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

This study investigated the hepatoprotective effects in high- diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-like C57BL/6J mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups ( = 10/group): the normal diet group, the HFD group, the arazyme group (HFD with 0.025% arazyme), and the milk thistle (MT) group (HFD with 0.1% MT).

Rosiglitazone (RSG) is a member of the thiazolidinedione family and is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist. It has been reported that RSG protects various types of cells from fatty -induced damage. However, whether RSG serves a protective role in Sertoli cells against  (PA)-induced toxicity remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of RSG on PA-induced cytotoxicity in Sertoli cells. MTT assay and Oil Red O staining revealed that RSG ameliorated the PA-induced decrease in TM4 cell viability, which was accompanied by an alleviation of PA-induced  accumulation in cells. In primary mouse Sertoli cells, RSG also showed similar protective effects against PA-induced lipotoxicity. Knockdown of PPARγ verified that RSG exerted its protective role in TM4 cells through a PPARγ-dependent pathway. To evaluate the mechanism underlying the protective role of RSG on PA-induced lipotoxicity, the present study analyzed the effects of RSG on PA uptake, and the expression of genes associated with both fatty  oxidation and triglyceride synthesis. The results demonstrated that although RSG did not affect the endocytosis of PA, it significantly elevated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)-1A, a key enzyme involved in fatty  oxidation, which indicated that the protective effect of RSG may have an important role in fatty  oxidation. On the other hand, the expression of CPT1B was not affected by RSG. Moreover, the expression levels of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT)-1 and DGAT2, both of which encode enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of triglycerides, were not suppressed by RSG. The results indicated that RSG reduced PA-induced  accumulation by promoting fatty  oxidation mediated by CPT1A. The effect of RSG in protecting cells from lipotoxicity was also found to be specific to Sertoli cells and hepatocytes, and not to other cell types that do not store excess  in large quantities, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These findings provide insights into the cytoprotective effects of RSG on Sertoli cells and suggest that PPARγ activation may be a useful therapeutic method for the treatment of Sertoli cell dysfunction caused by dyslipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496314>Increased triacylglycerol - Fatty  substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells exposed to eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>It has previously been shown that pretreatment of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) promoted increased uptake of fatty acids and increased triacylglycerol accumulation, compared to pretreatment with oleic  (OA) and  (PA). The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty   was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled oleic  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA.  distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral  metabolic process" and "Regulation of  storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261289>Involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the development of non-alcoholic steatosis and steatohepatitis in mice and humans.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity are important risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is involved in the development of IR and obesity in vivo. However, its possible contribution to NAFLD and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of its role on IR or  mass accretion has not been explored. Here, we used wild-type (WT) or GRK2 hemizygous (GRK2±) mice fed a high- diet (HFD) or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) as a model of NASH independent of adiposity and IR. GRK2± mice were protected from HFD-induced NAFLD. Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to-body weight ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and -uptake markers and less signs of inflammation in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered  accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis. GRK2 protein and mRNA levels were increased in human liver biopsies from simple steatosis or NASH patients in two different human cohorts. Our results describe a functional relationship between GRK2 levels and hepatic  accumulation and implicate GRK2 in the establishment and/or development of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral  cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with  type of FA  into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type  of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus.

The oxidized tallow (OT) and unoxidized tallow were characterized for oxidation parameters and fatty  composition using GC-MS. Tallow samples were fed to rabbits along with 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day of ellagic  (EA) for three weeks. Results revealed that the peroxide value (PV) and thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) significantly increased, while radical scavenging activity (RSA) of the tallow decreased significantly with oxidation. GC-MS analysis showed eight fatty acids in the tallow samples, where  (48.5-49.7 g/100 g), linoleic  (18.7-23.7 g/100 g), stearic  (13.5-15.6 g/100 g), and margaric  (6.32-6.42 g/100 g) were the major fatty acids. Animal studies showed that oxidized tallow (OT) alone or in combination with EA significantly altered the body weight of the rabbits. Serum biochemical parameters and renal function tests were affected by OT and ameliorated by EA. The toxic effects of OT on haematological indices were minimized by EA. The supplementation of OT alone had significant effects on the liver structure and functions. The coadministration of EA reduced the toxic properties of OT on the liver, by increasing the antioxidant (GSH) system. The rabbit heart was also affected by the OT, which was ameliorated by EA supplementation. These results suggested that the supplementation of EA was beneficial against the OT-induced oxidative stress and may be considered for foods containing oxidized lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802511>The effect of enterolactone on liver  precursors of inflammation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of enterolactone (ENL) on  fractions fatty acids composition affecting hepatocyte inflammation development.The experiments were conducted in HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or  (16 h).

Its signaling activity is terminated through degradation by -acylethanolamine  amidase (NAAA), a cysteine hydrolase expressed at high levels in immune cells. Pharmacological inhibitors of NAAA activity exert profound analgesic and antiinflammatory effects in rodent models, pointing to this protein as a potential target for therapeutic drug discovery. To facilitate these efforts and to better understand the molecular mechanism of action of NAAA, we determined crystal structures of this enzyme in various activation states and in complex with several ligands, including both a covalent and a reversible inhibitor. Self-proteolysis exposes the otherwise buried active site of NAAA to allow catalysis. Formation of a stable substrate- or inhibitor-binding site appears to be conformationally coupled to the interaction of a pair of hydrophobic helices in the enzyme with  membranes, resulting in the creation of a linear hydrophobic cavity near the active site that accommodates the ligand's acyl chain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005715>Rare ginsenosides ameliorate  overload-induced myocardial insulin resistance via modulating metabolic flexibility.</a></h2><p>Rare ginsenosides are found in ginseng and notoginseng, two medicinal plants widely used in China for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes.

In vivo, mice were fed with HFD and received RGSE, metformin or DCA for 6 weeks. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), glucose uptake and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by fluorescence labeling. Other assessments including oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were also performed.RGSE prevented PA-induced decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) expression, and ameliorated insulin-mediated glucose uptake and utilization in H9c2 cells. Metformin and mildronate exhibited similar effects. In vivo, RGSE counteracted HFD-induced increase in myocardial expression of p-PDH and CPT1 and ameliorated cardiac insulin signaling. Metformin and DCA also showed beneficial effects. Further study showed that RGSE decreased OCR and mitochondrial complex I activity in PA-treated H9c2 cells, reduced ROS production and relieved mitochondrial oxidative stress, thus decreased serine phosphorylation in IRS-1.RGSE ameliorated myocardial insulin sensitivity under conditions of  overload, which was tightly associated with the decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress via modulating glucose and fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2018.

It is believed that resveratrol (RSV), one of the most extensively studied plant-derived polyphenols, and its interaction with sphingolipid  may constitute one of the major therapeutic targets for cancer and metabolic diseases treatment.The aim of this study was to ascertain, whether resveratrol may affect sphingolipid metabolic pathways, enzymes and transporters in a  overload state.The experiments were conducted on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) incubated with RSV and/or  (PA) at the concentration of 0.5 mM and 50 µM, respectively for 16h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas liquid chromatography.

Yet, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. The Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) member JunD was recently identified as a key modulator of hepatic  in obese mice. The present study investigates the role of JunD in obesity-induced MC.JunD transcriptional activity was increased in hearts from diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and was associated with myocardial TG accumulation and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Obese mice lacking JunD were protected against MC. In DIO hearts, JunD directly binds PPARγ promoter thus enabling transcription of genes involved in TG synthesis, uptake, hydrolysis, and storage (i.e. Fas, Cd36, Lpl, Plin5). Cardiac-specific overexpression of JunD in lean mice led to PPARγ activation, cardiac steatosis, and dysfunction, thereby mimicking the MC phenotype. In DIO hearts as well as in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes exposed to , Ago2 immunoprecipitation, and luciferase assays revealed JunD as a direct target of miR-494-3p. Indeed, miR-494-3p was down-regulated in hearts from obese mice, while its overexpression prevented lipotoxic damage by suppressing JunD/PPARγ signalling. JunD and miR-494-3p were also dysregulated in myocardial specimens from obese patients as compared with non-obese controls, and correlated with myocardial TG content, expression of PPARγ-dependent genes, and echocardiographic indices of LV dysfunction.miR-494-3p/JunD is a novel molecular axis involved in obesity-related MC. These results pave the way for approaches to prevent or treat LV dysfunction in obese patients.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author(s) 2019.

NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between liver cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from liver tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and  to mimic metabolic syndrome. Accumulation of  droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo lipogenesis in PCLSs cultured under these conditions. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 expression was reduced, which indicates impaired fatty  transport and disrupted mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, steatosis was successfully induced in PCLSs with modified culture medium.

The results showed that COS pretreatment for 12 h significantly ameliorated  accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to PA for 24 h, accompanied by a reversing of the upregulated mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α) and glucolipid -related regulators (SCD-1, ACC1, PCK1-α). In addition, COS treatment alleviated glucolipid  disorder in mice fed with HFD for five months, including reduction in body weight and fasting glucose, restoration of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, and suppression of overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and glucolipid -related regulators. Furthermore, our study found that COS pretreatment significantly reversed the downregulation of PPARγ at transcriptional and translational levels in both PA-induced HepG2 cells and liver tissues of HFD-fed mice.

Hepatic TG, TCH levels, and fatty  synthase activity were also decreased (P < 0.05) in chickens fed diets containing perilla oil. Abdominal  percentage was significantly decreased in birds fed the PG compared to CT diets. Birds fed the PA or PG diets had increased (P < 0.05) hepatic total SOD, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase than in chickens given PO alone. In addition, the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in breast muscle was lower (P < 0.05) in birds fed PO compared with those given PG, and the reverse was true for content of malondialdehyde. Compared with the CT diet, the PO diet decreased breast muscle shear values and increased yellowness (b*) of breast muscle (P < 0.05). Birds fed the PA or PG diets had meat with better overall acceptability than those fed the CT diet. Chickens fed perilla oil diets exhibited higher contents of α-linolenic  (C18:3n-3), DHA (22:6n-3), polyunsaturated fatty acids, and n-3 fatty acids, together with a lower content of myristic  (C14:0),  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0), total saturated fatty acids, and n-6/n-3 ratio compared to controls (P < 0.05).

In addition, MDV-infected cells contained high levels of fatty acids and showed increased numbers of  droplets (LDs). Chemical inhibitors of the FAS pathway (TOFA and C75) reduced MDV titers by approximately 30-fold. Addition of the downstream metabolites, including malonyl-coenzyme A and , completely restored the inhibitory effects of the FAS inhibitors. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that MDV infection activates the COX-2/prostaglandin E (PGE) pathway, as evident by increased levels of arachidonic , COX-2 expression, and PGE synthesis. Inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway by chemical inhibitors or knockdown of COX2 using short hairpin RNA reduced MDV titers, suggesting that COX-2 promotes virus replication. Exogenous PGE completely restored the inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway in MDV replication. Unexpectedly, exogenous PGE also partially rescued the inhibitory effects of FAS inhibitors on MDV replication, suggesting that there is a link between these two pathways in MDV infection. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the FAS and COX-2/PGE pathways play an important role in the replication of this deadly pathogen. Disturbances of the  in chickens infected with MDV contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However, the role of  in MDV replication remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDV infection activates FAS and induces LD formation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that MDV replication is highly dependent on the FAS pathway and the downstream metabolites.

Previously, we found that a 5/6th nephrectomy model of CKD leads to an upregulation of miR-21-5p in the left ventricle, targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and altering the expression of numerous transcripts involved with fatty  oxidation and glycolysis. In the present study, we evaluated the potential for knockdown or overexpression of miR-21-5p to regulate  content,  peroxidation, and mitochondrial respiration in H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-21-5p (40 nM), pre-miR-21-5p (20 nM), or the appropriate scrambled oligonucleotide controls before  treatment in culture or as part of the Agilent Seahorse XF fatty  oxidation assay. Overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuated the -induced increase in cellular  content, whereas suppression of miR-21-5p augmented it. The abundance of malondialdehyde, a product of  peroxidation, was significantly increased with  treatment in control cells but attenuated in pre-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. This suggests that miR-21-5p reduces oxidative stress. The cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was increased in both pre-miR-21-5p- and anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. Levels of intracellular ATP were significantly higher in anti-mR-21-5p-transfected cells. Pre-miR-21-5p blocked additional increases in OCR in response to etomoxir and . Conversely, anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells exhibited reduced OCR with both etomoxir and , and the glycolytic capacity was concomitantly reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuates both  content and  peroxidation in H9C2 cells. This likely occurs by reducing cellular  uptake and utilization, shifting cellular  toward reliance on the glycolytic pathway. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Both overexpression and suppression of miR-21-5p augment basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration. Our data suggest that reliance on glycolytic and fatty  oxidation pathways can be modulated by the abundance of miR-21-5p within the cell. miR-21-5p regulation of mitochondrial respiration can be modulated by extracellular lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892088>Novel hypolipidemic conjugates of fatty  and bile  with lysine for linkage.</a></h2><p>Novel fatty -bile  conjugates (1a-1k) were designed and synthesized by coupling of the fatty acids to the 3-OH of bile acids using lysine for linkage.

Thus, compounds 1c and 1 g are promising hypolipidemic agents with hepatocyte protective effects against HFD-induced liver damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060359>The mTORC1/4EBP1/PPARγ Axis Mediates Insulin-Induced Lipogenesis by Regulating Lipogenic Gene Expression in Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells.</a></h2><p>4EBP1 is a chief downstream factor of mTORC1, and PPARγ is a key lipogenesis-related transcription factor. mTORC1 and PPARγ are associated with . However, it is unknown which effector protein connects mTORC1 and PPARγ. This study investigated the interaction between 4EBP1 with PPARγ as part of the underlying mechanism by which insulin-induced  synthesis and secretion are regulated by mTORC1 in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells (pBMECs). Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTORC1, downregulated 4EBP1 phosphorylation and the expression of PPARγ and the following lipogenic genes: lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS. Rapamycin also decreased the levels of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG); 10 types of fatty ; and the accumulation of TAG,  (PA), and stearic  (SA) in the cell culture medium. Inactivation of mTORC1 by shRaptor or shRheb attenuated the synthesis and secretion of TAG and PA. In contrast, activation of mTORC1 by Rheb overexpression promoted 4EBP1 phosphorylation and PPARγ expression and upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS, whereas the levels of intracellular and extracellular TAG, PA, and SA also rose. Further, 4EBP1 interacted directly with PPARγ. Inactivation of mTORC1 by shRaptor prevented the nuclear location of PPARγ. These results demonstrate that mTORC1 regulates  synthesis and secretion by inducing the expression of lipin 1, DGAT1, ACC, and FAS, which is likely mediated by the 4EBP1/PPARγ axis. This finding constitutes a novel mechanism by which  synthesis and secretion are regulated in pBMECs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384366>Shengmai San Alleviates Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Through Improvement of Mitochondrial  Metabolic Disorder.</a></h2><p>Shengmai San (SMS), prepared from Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Schisandra chinensisin, has been widely used to treat ischemic disease. In this study, we investigated whether SMS may exert a beneficial effect in diabetic cardiomyopathy through improvement of mitochondrial .A leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model was utilized, and lean age-matched C57BLKS mice served as non-diabetic controls. Glucose and  profiles, myocardial structure, dimension, and function, and heart weight to tibial length ratio were determined. Myocardial ultrastructural morphology was observed with transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex were assessed using western blotting and microplate assay kits. We also observed cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, OXPHOS complex activity, and cellular ATP level in -stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Changes in the sirtuin (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) pathway and mitochondrial uncoupling signaling were assessed using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR.Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by distinct myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS at a dose of 3 g/kg body weight contributed to a recovery of diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS administration led to an effective restoration of mitochondrial structure and function both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, SMS markedly enhanced SIRT1 and p-AMPKα protein levels and decreased the expression of acetylated-PGC-1α and uncoupling protein 2 protein. SMS also restored the depletion of NRF1 and TFAM levels in diabetic hearts and H9C2 cardiomyocytes.The results indicate that SMS may alleviate diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction by improving mitochondrial .© 2018 The Author(s).

Clarification of the molecular mechanism of metabolic disorder and exploration of drug targets are crucial for the treatment of T2DM.  We examined miR-125a-5p levels in -induced AML12 cells and the livers of type 2 diabetic rats and mice, and then validated its target gene. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, the effects of miR-125a-5p via targeting of STAT3 on regulating glycolipid  were further illustrated  and .  We found that miR-125a-5p was significantly decreased in the livers of diabetic mice and rats, and STAT3 was identified as the target gene of miR-125a-5p. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p in C57BL/6 mice decreased STAT3 level and downregulated the expression levels of p-STAT3 and SOCS3. Consequently, SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis pathway was inhibited, and PI3K/AKT pathway was activated. Moreover, silencing of miR-125a-5p significantly increased the expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3 and SOCS3, thus activating SREBP-1c pathway and suppressing PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and decreased liver glycogen appeared in C57BL/6 mice. In -induced AML12 cells, miR-125a-5p mimic markedly increased glucose consumption and uptake and decreased the accumulation of  droplets by regulating STAT3 signaling pathway. Consistently, miR-125a-5p overexpression obviously inhibited STAT3 expression in diabetic KK-Ay mice, thereby decreasing blood glucose and  levels, increasing hepatic glycogen content, and decreasing accumulation of hepatic  droplets in diabetic mice. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-125a-5p in KK-Ay mice aggravated glycolipid  dysfunction through regulating STAT3.  Our results confirmed that miR-125a-5p should be considered as a regulator of glycolipid  in T2DM, which can inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis and elevate glycogen synthesis by targeting STAT3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30820969>Dual Specificity Phosphatase 12 Regulates Hepatic  Through Inhibition of the Lipogenesis and Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase 1 Pathways.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after /oleic  treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high- diet (HFD)-induced and high- high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic . DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high- conditions. Conclusion: DUSP12 acts as a positive regulator in hepatic steatosis and offers potential therapeutic opportunities for NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated- diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy  and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced tight junction proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to metabolic diseases are still less understandable.Previously, we screened a group of spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys. Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143  species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and arachidonic  (C20:4), FFA especially  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys. Conversely, the levels of most PE species were obviously reduced in the obese monkeys.Collectively, our work suggests that lipids such as FFA C16:0 and 16:0-LPA may be potential candidates for the diagnosis and study of obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373170>Cyclophilin D participates in the inhibitory effect of high- diet on the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein.</a></h2><p>The high- diet (HFD)-induced obesity is responsible for the testosterone deficiency (TD). However, the mechanism remains unknown. Mitochondrial homeostasis is proved to be important for maintaining the function of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), the first rate-limiting enzyme in testosterone synthesis. As the key regulator of mitochondrial membrane permeability, cyclophilin D (CypD) plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of CypD in the expression of StAR affected by HFD.To analyse the influence of CypD on StAR in vivo and in vitro, mouse models of HFD, CypD overexpression and CypD knockout (Ppif ) as well as Leydig cells treated with  (PA) and CypD overexpression plasmids were examined with an array of metabolic, mitochondrial function and molecular assays.Compared with the normal diet mice, consistent with reduced testosterone in testes, the expressions of StAR in both mRNA and protein levels in HFD mice were down-regulated, while expressions of CypD were up-regulated. High- intake impaired mitochondrial function with the decrease in StAR in Leydig cells. Overexpression of CypD inhibited StAR expressions in vivo and in vitro. Compared with C57BL/6 mice with HFD, expressions of StAR were improved in Ppif mice with HFD.Mitochondrial CypD involved in the inhibitory effect of HFD on StAR expression in testes.© 2019 The Authors.

Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental  transport and  remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA, oleic  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in  classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls. Decreased syncytiotrophoblast POA synthesis may contribute to insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation in the mother, placenta, or fetus (or a combination of the 3) in pregnancies complicated by obesity.-Ferchaud-Roucher, V., Barner, K., Jansson, T., Powell, T.

In 3T3-L1 cells, the cytotoxicity of QWTX was tested by CKK-8, and glucose uptake and   oxidation were assessed by 2-deoxy-D-[H] glucose and [1-C] , respectively. The expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), liver X receptor α (LXRα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), ikappa B α (IκBα), and AKT were determined by PCR and western blot. NAFLD was established by the administration of  emulsion and sucrose for 9 weeks.

In NAFLD, QWTX attenuated liver steatosis,  vacuoles and inflammation from the HE staining and electron micrograph tests. For the oxidative stress biomarkers, serum FFA level was reduced and serum NO level was enhanced after QWTX treatment. In liver tissue, SOD was decreased and MDA was significantly increased in NAFLD, and both of them were restored by QWTX. NF-κB and CYP2E1 were also upregulated in NAFLD, while downregulated by QWTX.

Because the APOE is central to the transport and  of lipids, we examined associations between plasma fatty acids and the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and mortality by APOE-ε4 genotype. Methods- We included 943 FHS (Framingham Heart Study) and 1406 3C (Three-City) Bordeaux Study participants. Plasma docosahexaenoic, linoleic, arachidonic, and  fatty acids were measured at baseline by gas chromatography. All-cause stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality events were identified prospectively using standardized protocols. Each cohort used Cox models to separately relate fatty  levels to the risk of developing each event during ≤10 years of follow-up adjusting for potential confounders and stratifying by APOE genotype (ε4 carriers versus noncarriers). We then meta-analyzed summary statistics using random-effects models. Results- On average, participants had a mean age of 74 years, 61% were women, and 21% (n=483) were APOE-ε4 carriers. Meta-analysis results showed that, only among APOE-ε4 carriers, every SD unit increase in linoleic  was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.38-0.78]), ischemic stroke (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.33-0.71]), and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.85]). In contrast, every SD unit increase in  was related to an increased risk of all-cause stroke (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.16-2.17]), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.26-2.45]), and coronary heart disease (HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.09-2.01]), also in APOE-ε4 carriers only. Results for docosahexaenoic  and arachidonic  were heterogeneous between cohorts. Conclusions- These exploratory results suggest that APOE-ε4 carriers may be more susceptible to the beneficial or adverse impact of fatty acids on cardiovascular disease and mortality. In this subgroup, higher linoleic  was protective for stroke and mortality, whereas  was a risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease.

The gut microbiota is involved in the host energy  through the regulation of body  storage, and a link between diet, FFA and the intestinal microbiota seems to exist. Our aim was to explore the interaction among serum FFA levels, gut microbiota, diet and obesity through a model regression tree in 66 subjects (age 52.7 ± 11.2 y) classified according to Body Mass Index (BMI). Total and individual FFA were analyzed by colorimetric enzymatic assay and methyl-tert-butylether-based extraction protocol (MTBE), respectively. Microbiota was determined by qPCR and diet through a food frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed, and predictive factors for obesity were obtained via classification by decision trees using machine learning methods. An obese-linked FFA profile was characterized by decreased eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and increased linoleic, gamma-linolenic and  acids levels simultaneously. Serum EPA and gender were identified as the most significant variables with 100% and 80% of importance, respectively. , Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium explained >30%, followed by Bacteroides group with 20% and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) almost with 15% of importance.

Western blot method was conducted to detect the protein expression of intracellular nuclear factor( NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation( p-p65),nonphosphorylated protein( p65),and transforming factor TGF-β1. Result showed that as compared with the model group,intracellular TG and TC levels,the cell supernatant ALT and AST levels,proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were decreased( P < 0. 01,P <0. 05); the p-p65/p65 ratio and TGF-β1 protein expression were also significantly decreased( P< 0. 01,P< 0. 05) in psoralen intervention group.

We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on insulin release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.HFD increased body weight and ectopic  accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of -related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and insulin secretion in co-cultures.These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of , suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, elastica-van Gieson (EVG) and Mito-Tracker green FM staining showed that collagen and elastic fibers were highly, respectively, distributed in connective tissues and mitochondria in red muscle. An electron micrographic analysis indicated that red muscle had a relatively higher number of mitochondria and longer sarcomere lengths and Z-line widths, while myofibril diameters were thicker in white muscle. Myofibrillar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE showed that the major giant protein, titin, was highly expressed in white muscle than in red muscle. Furthermore, ratios of titin to myosin heavy chain (MHC) (titin/MHC) were about 1.3 times higher in white muscle than red muscle.

However, even 3 days of HFD consumption has been linked to inflammation within the key homeostatic brain region, the hypothalamus.Mice were fed either a low- diet (LFD) or HFD containing 10% or 60% (Kcal) respectively from  for 3 days. Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with  (PA) and oleic  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose  and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation. Changes in N42 cells show an effect of PA but not OA on DRP-2 and on mitochondrial morphology indicating that long-chain saturated fatty acids damage neuronal function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063536>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep. IV. Effect of calcium salts with eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  in the maternal and finishing diet on lamb liver and adipose tissue during the lamb finishing period1.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation to ewes during late gestation on finishing lamb liver and adipose tissue fatty  (FA) profile and gene expression. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in  and oleic  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary management and caloric restriction are beneficial in reducing the complications of diabesity. Studies have suggested that increased availability of energy metabolites like glucose and saturated fatty acids induces metabolic, oxidative, and mitochondrial stress, accompanied by inflammation that may lead to chronic complications in diabetes. In the present study, we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of high glucose (25 mM) and high  (up to 0.3 mM) on metabolic-, inflammatory-, and redox-stress-associated alterations in these cells. Our results showed increased , protein, and DNA damage, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glucolipotoxicity increased ROS production and redox stress appeared to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetics. Our results also demonstrate the enhanced ability of cytochrome P450s-dependent drug  and antioxidant adaptation in HepG2 cells treated with , which was further augmented with high glucose. Altered NF-kB/AMPK/mTOR-dependent cell signaling and inflammatory (IL6/TNF-α) responses were also observed. Our results suggest that the presence of high-energy metabolites enhances apoptosis while suppressing autophagy by inducing inflammatory and oxidative stress responses that may be responsible for alterations in cell signaling and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31061309>Adverse Effects in Skeletal Muscle Following the Medicinal Use of Nicotiana glauca.</a></h2><p>Nicotiana glauca is a cosmopolitan shrub, used in medicine to treat swellings, wounds, sores and cancer. However, its users lack of knowledge of the adverse effects. We seek to evaluate the effects of  extracts from N. glauca on myoblasts, identifying the compounds which cause undesirable effects. Myoblasts are important in muscle homeostasis, thus a high death rate of them cause myopathies. We performed an ethanolic extraction from leaves of N. glauca and the extract was successively partitioned with hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate. The effects of extracts in C2C12 cells were analysed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL), Mitotracker and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Western blotting, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assays. Caspase activity was studied. The fraction with the highest apoptotic effects was analysed by chromatography, NMR and GC-MS spectrometry were used to identify the apoptotic agent, after which its biological activity was evaluated. The extracts from N. glauca induced apoptosis in C2C12 cells involving caspase-3/7. We found that the extracts trigger a defence response in muscle through Akt and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). We identified an apoptotic agent as . These data suggest that the use of N. glauca in hormone replacement therapy, or in other therapies affects skeletal muscle homeostasis, worsening the negative effects of the menopause. Thus, the relevance of this work lies in the fact that it is the first time that a report about the molecular mechanism responsible for the side effects of medicinal use of N. glauca, has been shown. Moreover the compound responsible for these effects has been identified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147443>Human cytochrome P450 enzymes bind drugs and other substrates mainly through conformational-selection modes.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes are major catalysts involved in the oxidations of most drugs, steroids, carcinogens, -soluble vitamins, and natural products. The binding of substrates to some of the 57 human P450s and other mammalian P450s is more complex than a two-state system and has been proposed to involve mechanisms such as multiple ligand occupancy, induced-fit, and conformational-selection. Here, we used kinetic analysis of binding with multiple concentrations of substrates and computational modeling of these data to discern possible binding modes of several human P450s. We observed that P450 2D6 binds its ligand rolapitant in a mechanism involving conformational-selection. P450 4A11 bound the substrate lauric  via conformational-selection, as did P450 2C8 with . Binding of the steroid progesterone to P450 21A2 was also best described by a conformational-selection model. Hexyl isonicotinate binding to P450 2E1 could be described by either a conformational-selection or an induced-fit model. Simulation of the binding of the ligands midazolam, bromocriptine, testosterone, and ketoconazole to P450 3A4 was consistent with an induced-fit or a conformational-selection model, but the concentration dependence of binding rates for varying both P450 3A4 and midazolam concentrations revealed discordance in the parameters, indicative of conformational-selection. Binding of the P450s 2C8, 2D6, 3A4, 4A11, and 21A2 was best described by conformational-selection, and P450 2E1 appeared to fit either mode. These findings highlight the complexity of human P450-substrate interactions and that conformational-selection is a dominant feature of many of these interactions.© 2019 Guengerich et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31540694>Mechanisms of electrical remodeling in lipotoxic guinea pig heart.</a></h2><p>To develop an adult guinea pig model of lipotoxicity and explore the underlying mechanisms associated with changes in the expression of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I).Lipotoxicity may represent a common link among metabolic disorders and a higher vulnerability to arrhythmias.Whole-cell patch clamp, and  (PA, a potent inducer of lipotoxicity), were used to assess mechanisms of short-term (∼50 days) high- diet (HFD) feeding on atrial electrophysiology in guinea pig hearts and myocytes.HFD fed guinea pigs were significantly heavier, displayed hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia; but no signs of hyperglycemia or inflammation compared to low- diet fed controls. Increasing cardiac PA levels, resulted in shortened atrial action potential duration, and increased I density. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevented increases in I due to PA. Acute (≥1hr) exposure of atrial myocytes to exogenous PA (1 mM) increased the density of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current I, while it was decreased with the unsaturated oleic  (OA, 1 mM). Serine-threonine protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A) inhibition with cantharidin reversed the effect of OA on I.Our data provide evidence of a novel lipotoxic guinea pig model with signs of vulnerability to arrhythmias. Inhibition of PA/PI3K/I and/or activation of the OA/PP2A/I pathways may be therapeutically beneficial for lipotoxic arrhythmias.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Obesity-related nephropathy (ORN) is a common kidney complication of obesity. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases-1, (ACSL1), is a key enzyme in the oxidative  of fatty acids in mitochondria and ACSL1 may play a direct role in renal  deposition and promote the progress of ORN. In this study, we focus on the renoprotective role of ACSL1 in ORN.  Electron microscopy, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blot, and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of ACSL1and Nrf2 in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and  (PA)-treated HK-2 cells. Oil red staining and Elisa Kit were used to detect the intracellular FFA and TG contents in ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and the MDA/SOD measurement were used to detect the ROS production. In order to demonstrate the role of ACSL1 and the interaction between ACSL1 and Nrf2 in ORN, related siRNA and plasmid were transfected into HK-2 cells.  More ROS production and renal  deposition have been found in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. Compared with control, all the expression of ACSL1and Nrf2 were down-regulated in ORN patients, ob/ob mice and PA-treated HK-2 cells. The Nrf2 could regulate the expression of ACSL1 and the ACSL1 played the direct role in renal  deposition.  The Nrf2 is inhibited in ORN, resulting more ROS production and oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress will suppress the expression of ACSL1, which could increase the intracellular FFA and TG contents, ultimately leading to renal  deposition in renal tubulars and accelerating the development of ORN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804206>Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase attenuates a high- diet-mediated renal injury by activating PAX2 and AMPK.</a></h2><p>A high- diet (HFD) causes obesity-associated morbidities involved in macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). AMPK, the mediator of macroautophage, has been reported to be inactivated in HFD-caused renal injury. However, PAX2, the mediator for CMA, has not been reported in HFD-caused renal injury. Here we report that HFD-caused renal injury involved the inactivation of Pax2 and Ampk, and the activation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), in a murine model. Specifically, mice fed on an HFD for 2, 4, and 8 wk showed time-dependent renal injury, the significant decrease in renal Pax2 and Ampk at both mRNA and protein levels, and a significant increase in renal sEH at mRNA, protein, and molecular levels. Also, administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea, significantly attenuated the HFD-caused renal injury, decreased renal sEH consistently at mRNA and protein levels, modified the renal levels of sEH-mediated epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) as expected, and increased renal Pax2 and Ampk at mRNA and/or protein levels. Furthermore,  (PA) treatment caused significant increase in , and decrease in both Pax2 and Ampk in murine renal mesangial cells (mRMCs) time- and dose-dependently. Also, 14(15)-EET (a major substrate of sEH), but not its sEH-mediated metabolite 14,15-DHET, significantly reversed PA-induced increase in , and PA-induced decrease in Pax2 and Ampk. In addition, plasmid construction revealed that Pax2 may positively regulate Ampk transcriptionally in mRMCs.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral  cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of , an increase in oleic , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049862>Outdoor cultivation of the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris under stress conditions as a feedstock for biofuel.</a></h2><p>The present work investigated the potential of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris to produce high-quality biofuel under culture stress conditions. The cultivation was carried out in a 1000 l open plate tank system, which provides biomass yields comparable to open pond systems, but with less area needed. Algal biomass and  content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest  yield (15.8 ± 0.174). Volumetric biomass and  productivity were 0.201 g l day and 31.71 mg l day, respectively, whereas areal biomass and  productivity were 25.73 g m day and 4.066 g m day, respectively. The fatty  profile by means of gas chromatography resulted in seven fatty acids from C to C. The most abundant fatty  methyl esters (FAMES) were  (C16:0), oleic (C18:1), and stearic (C18:0) acids.  synthesis enhanced by optimizing the Kuhl growth medium with replacing nitrate by urea (50% N compared to the original recipe) increased salt content (10 g/l NaCl), ferrous sulfate (0.5 g/l), and sodium acetate addition (1 g/l).

PQ poisoning model was challenged by one-time gavage of 30 mg/kg PQ solution. The NS group received the same amount of NS by gavage. The HMH group was given 100 mg/kg of HMH immediately after the model was made and continued to be gavaged. Mice in each group were sacrificed 1 day after HMH gavage and heart blood and renal tissue were harvested for examination. The morphological changes of renal tissue were observed under light microscope by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in renal tissue were detected according to the instructions of the kit. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in renal tissues were detected by Western Blot.

In PQ group, some glomeruli atrophy and necrosis, capillary congestion in glomeruli, infiltration of inflammatory cells around glomeruli, swelling of renal tubular epithelial cells, slight stenosis of lumen, and occasional necrosis and exfoliation of epithelial cells occurred. The degree of kidney injury in HMH group was significantly less than that in PQ group. Compared with the NS group, the content of MDA in the PQ group was significantly increased (nmol/g: 6.70±0.84 vs. 2.70±0.43, P < 0.01) and the activity of SOD was significantly decreased (kU/L: 33.30±4.66 vs. 50.20±3.23, P < 0.05), the protein expression of HO-1 and IL-1β were significantly increased (HO-1/β-actin: 1.11±0.12 vs. 0.61±0.13, IL-1β/β-actin: 0.93±0.13 vs. 0.32±0.06, both P < 0.05).

However, the mechanism underlying the effect of BBR is not fully understood. Stearyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) mediates  in liver. Therefore, we hypothesized that SCD1 mediated the beneficial effect of BBR on NAFLD.The expression of SCD1 was measured in the liver of NAFLD patients and ob/ob mice. The effect of BBR on NAFLD was evaluated in C57BL/6 J mice on high  diet (HFD). The effect of BBR was also investigated in HepG2 and AML12 cells exposed to high glucose and . Oil red O staining was performed to detect triglyceride (TG) level. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to detect the messenger ribonucleic  (mRNA) and protein expression of target genes. The activity of SCD1 promoter was measured by dual-luciferase reporter assay.The expression of SCD1 was increased in the liver of NAFLD patients and ob/ob mice. BBR reduced hepatic TG accumulation and decreased the expressions of hepatic SCD1 and other TG synthesis related genes both in vivo and in vitro. Knockdown of SCD1 expression mimicked the effect of BBR decreasing TG level in steatotic hepatocytes, whereas overexpression of SCD1 attenuated the effect of BBR. Mechanistically, BBR promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in HepG2 cells and the liver of HFD-fed mice. Activation of the AMPK-SREBP-1c pathway and sterol regulatory element (SRE) motif in SCD1 promoter (-920/-550) was responsible for the BBR-induced suppression of SCD1.BBR reduces liver TG synthesis and attenuates hepatic steatosis through the activation of AMPK-SREBP-1c-SCD1 pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies indicate that PA accumulates in the hypothalamus following consumption of HFDs; in addition, HFDs consumption inhibits autophagy and reduces insulin sensitivity. Whether malfunction of autophagy specifically in hypothalamic neurons decreases insulin sensitivity remains unknown. PA does activate the Free Fatty  Receptor 1 (FFAR1), also known as G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40); however, whether FFAR1 mediates the effects of PA on hypothalamic autophagy and insulin sensitivity has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to PA inhibits the autophagic flux and reduces insulin sensitivity in a cellular model of hypothalamic neurons (N43/5 cells). Furthermore, we show that inhibition of autophagy and the autophagic flux reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of the autophagic flux, and the reduction in insulin sensitivity are prevented by pharmacological inhibition of FFAR1. Our findings show that dysregulation of autophagy reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. In addition, our data suggest FFAR1 mediates the ability of PA to inhibit autophagic flux and reduce insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. These results reveal a novel cellular mechanism linking PA-rich diets to decreased insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and suggest that hypothalamic autophagy might represent a target for future T2DM therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121855>Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Stimulates Pancreatic Islet Autophagy via Inhibition of AMPK-mTOR Signaling.</a></h2><p>Islet autophagy plays a role in glucose/ in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

This study aimed to explore the physiological roles and signaling pathways involved in FGF21-stimulated islet autophagy under glucolipotoxic conditions.C57/BL6J mice were fed a standard diet or high- diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, and islets were isolated from normal and  knockout (KO) mice. Isolated islets and INS-1E cells were exposed to normal and high-concentration glucose and  with/without FGF21 or AMPK inhibitor compound C. Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry/transmission electron microscopy were performed for the expression of targeted genes/proteins.HFD-treated mice showed increases in fasting plasma glucose, body weight and impaired glucose tolerance; islet protein expression of FGF21 was induced after HFD treatment. Protein expression levels of FGF21 and LC3-II (autophagy marker) were induced in mouse islets treated with high concentrations of  and glucose, while phosphorylation of AMPK was reduced, compared with controls. In addition, induction of LC3-II protein expression was reduced in islets isolated from  KO mice. Furthermore, exogenous administration of FGF21 diminished phosphorylation of AMPK and stimulated protein expression of LC3-II. Consistently, compound C significantly induced increased expression of LC3-II protein.Our data indicate that glucolipotoxicity-induced FGF21 activation mediates islet autophagy via AMPK inhibition, and further consolidate the evidence for the FGF21/analog being a pharmacotherapeutic target for obesity and its related T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483636>Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Response of  Seed Oil on  Disorder Induced by Excess Alcohol Consumption.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the modulatory effects of  seed oil (DISO), which was rich in palmitoleic  (55.25%),  (12.25%), and oleic  (28.74%), on alcohol-induced  disorder in mice.

In recent years, research has made significant advances in terms of understanding the impact of dietary components on metabolic-inflammation, within the context of obesity, type-2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD risk. Our work demonstrated that different fatty acids differentially modulate metabolic-inflammation, initially focusing on Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing three protein (NLRP3) inflammasome mediated IL-1β biology and insulin signalling. However, the paradigm is more complex, wherein data from the immunology field clearly show that nature of cellular energy  is a key determinant of inflammation. Whilst metabolic-inflammation is a critical biological interaction, there is a paucity of data in relation to the nature and the extent to which nutritional status affects metabolic-inflammation. The complex paradigm will be discussed within the context of if/how dietary components, in particular fatty acids, may modulate obesity, T2D and CVD risk, via inflammatory and metabolic processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659489>Influence of nutrient formulations on growth,  yield, carbon partitioning and biodiesel quality potential of Botryococcus sp. and Chlorella sp.</a></h2><p>The study was conducted to analyse the influence of three nutrient formulations, namely BG-11 medium, BBM and TAP medium, on growth potential and  yield of two microalgal genera (Botryococcus sp. and Chlorella sp.) and to study the roles of N, P and other major nutrients. The study focussed on the general patterns of starch and  synthesis and storage and to further assess how photosynthetic carbon partitioning into starch and  is altered by conditions in growth media such as N and C presence as seen in BG11 medium which are known to induce neutral  production and the lack of it in BBM and TAP medium. BG-11 medium performed better as compared to BBM and TAP medium in terms of biomass productivity and  yield. The  yield was highest in Botryococcus sp. (63.03% dry wt.) and Chlorella sp. (50.27% dry wt.) at 30th day of incubation. Mean biomass productivity was highest for Botryococcus in BBM medium (6.14 mg/L/day) and for Chlorella in BG-11 medium (4.97 mg/L/day). Mean  productivity (50.78% and 39.36%) was highest in BG11 medium for both Botryococcus and Chlorella species, respectively. A sharp decline in sugar content was observed in the late stationary phase of growth from 30th day to 45th day. Fatty  methyl ester (FAME) profile of the extracted lipids showed predominantly oleic , followed by  and stearic  in both the strains when grown in BG-11 medium. The other biodiesel quality parameters were in accordance with the international standards. A complex relationship was found between chemical composition and biodiesel properties. Proximity analysis indicated that the fuel properties of biodiesels are determined by a number of parameters and by the combination of different chemical compositions. The results provide an insight into organic carbon partitioning into  compounds and how the organism's  changes due to N-deplete culturing in TAP medium and inorganic carbon source availability as seen in BG-11 and BBM medium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649558>Obesity Mediates Apoptosis and Extracellular Matrix Metabolic Imbalances via MAPK Pathway Activation in Intervertebral Disk Degeneration.</a></h2><p>Obesity may promote intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) by non-mechanical means, by influencing levels of free fatty acids which could impair cell . This study aims to establish metabolic factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with obesity-related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum  levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high- diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk  and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (, PA) to gauge its effects on cell  and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585412>Pex11a deficiency causes dyslipidaemia and obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes play a central role in . We previously demonstrated that Pex11a deficiency impairs peroxisome abundance and fatty  β-oxidation and results in hepatic triglyceride accumulation. The role of Pex11a in dyslipidaemia and obesity is investigated here with Pex11a knockout mice (Pex11a ). Metabolic phenotypes including tissue weight, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, fatty  profile, oxygen consumption, physical activity were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Pex11a fed with a high- diet. Molecular changes and peroxisome abundance in adipose tissue were evaluated through qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence. Pex11a showed increased  mass, decreased skeletal muscle, higher cholesterol levels, and more severely impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Pex11a consumed less oxygen, indicating a decrease in fatty  oxidation, which is consistent with the accumulation of very long- and long-chain fatty acids. Adipose  (C16:0) levels were elevated in Pex11a , which may be because of dramatically increased fatty  synthase mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Pex11a deficiency increased ventricle size and macrophage infiltration, which are related to the reduced physical activity. These data demonstrate that Pex11a deficiency impairs physical activity and energy expenditure, decreases fatty  β-oxidation, increases de novo lipogenesis and results in dyslipidaemia and obesity.© 2018 The Authors.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a pleiotropic cytokine frequently featured in stem cell therapy with distinct renotropic benefits. This study aims to define the potential link between human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPS-MSCs)/bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and ER stress in lipotoxic kidney injury induced by  (PA) in renal tubular cells and by high- diet (HFD) in mice. iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs alleviated ER stress (by preventing induction of Bip, chop, and unfolded protein response), inflammation (Il6, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2), and apoptosis (Bax/Bcl2 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells) in renal cortex of animals exposed to HFD thus mitigating histologic damage and albuminuria, via activating HGF/c-Met paracrine signaling that resulted in enhanced HGF secretion in the glomerular compartment and c-Met expression in the tubules. Coculture experiments identified glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) to be the exclusive source of glomerular HGF when incubated with either iPS-MSCs or BM-MSCs in the presence of PA. Furthermore, both GEC-derived HGF and exogenous recombinant HGF attenuated PA-induced ER stress in cultured tubular cells, and this effect was abrogated by a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody. Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate that MSCs ameliorate lipotoxic kidney injury via a novel microenvironment-dependent paracrine HGF/c-Met signaling mechanism to suppress ER stress and its downstream pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic consequences.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis B, but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high--diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in  (PA) induced L02 human liver cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic inflammation,  peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced  accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca]. By computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays, Mat was shown to influence [Ca] via direct inhibition of SERCA.The results showed that the bi-directional regulation of Mat to endoplasmic reticulum at different doses was based on the inhibition of SERCA. In addition, the results also provide a theoretical basis for Mat as a potential therapeutic strategy in NAFLD/NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30361530>Adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with low levels of the novel  Hydroxystearic Acids.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue dysfunction is considered an important contributor to systemic insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recently, a novel family of endogenous lipids,  hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), was discovered. These have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice and are reduced in serum and adipose tissue of insulin resistant humans. In the present study, we investigate if adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with reduced PAHSA levels in human subjects and if PAHSAs influence adipocyte differentiation. Our results show that low expression of adipocyte GLUT4 and adipocyte hypertrophy, markers of adipose tissue dysfunction, are associated with reduced expression of key enzymes for de novo lipogenesis and adipose tissue levels of PAHSAs in human subjects. We also show that GLUT4 is not only a marker of adipose tissue dysfunction, but may be causally related to the observed impairments. PAHSAs may also act locally in the adipose tissue to improve adipogenesis through a mechanism bypassing direct activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ). The discovery of PAHSAs and our current results provide novel insights into positive effects of  species in adipose tissue and mechanisms by which dysfunctional adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance and risk of developing T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262993>Polydatin attenuates diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice.</a></h2><p> Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by  accumulation in hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration. In view of the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of polydatin, the current study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects of polydatin on NASH and its related fibrosis.  C57BL/6 mice were fed with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet to induce NASH and liver fibrosis, and treated with or without polydatin (5 mg/kg, every other day, i.p) for 4 weeks. HepG2 cells induced by  (PA) were treated with polydatin.  The elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), active caspase-3, TUNEL-positive cells, and triglyceride content were decreased by polydatin treatment. In addition, administration of polydatin to MCD-fed mice reduced oxidative stress by down-regulating NOX4 enzymes. Furthermore, the reduction in inflammation and CD68 macrophage activation correlated with inhibition of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway by polydatin treatment. Polydatin also attenuated  accumulation, inflammation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells challenged by  (PA) combined with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, the reduction of hepatic fibrosis by polydatin treatment corresponded to a reduction in hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers.  These results suggest that polydatin prevents NASH and fibrosis via inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting polydatin as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214287>Free fatty -induced histone acetyltransferase activity accelerates  accumulation in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common metabolic disease triggered by epigenetic alterations, including lysine acetylation at histone or non-histone proteins, affecting the stability or transcription of lipogenic genes. Although various natural dietary compounds have anti-lipogenic effects, their effects on the acetylation status and  in the liver have not been thoroughly investigated.Following oleic- (OPA)-induced  accumulation in HepG2 cells, the acetylation status of histone and non-histone proteins, HAT activity, and mRNA expression of representative lipogenic genes, including γ, , , and , were evaluated. Furthermore, correlations between  accumulation and HAT activity for 22 representative natural food extracts (NExs) were evaluated.Non-histone protein acetylation increased following OPA treatment and the acetylation of histones H3K9, H4K8, and H4K16 was accelerated, accompanied by an increase in HAT activity. OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between HAT activity and  accumulation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.604) using 22 NExs.Our results suggest that NExs have novel applications as nutraceutical agents with HAT inhibitor activity for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31261803>Chronic Heat Stress Induces Acute Phase Responses and Serum Metabolome Changes in Finishing Pigs.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) is a main environmental challenge affecting the animal welfare and production efficiency in pig industry. In recent years, numerous reports have studied the alterations in gene expressions and protein profiles in heat-stressed pigs. However, the use of metabolome to unravel adaptive mechanisms of finishing pig in response to chronic HS have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to investigate the effects of chronic HS on serum metabolome in finishing pigs, and to identify the biomarkers of heat stress. Pigs (n = 8 per treatment) were exposed to either thermal neutral (TN; 22 °C) or heat stress (HS, 30 °C) conditions for three weeks. Serum metabonomics of TN- and HS-treated pigs were compared using the GC-MS approach. Metabonomics analysis revealed that twenty-four metabolites had significantly different levels in TN compared to HS (variable importance in the projection values >1 and  < 0.05). These metabolites are involved in carbohydrate, amino , fatty , amines , and gut microbiome-derived . Three serum monoses (glucose, mannose 2, and galactose) and 6-phosphogluconic  were decreased, indicating insufficient source of fuel for energy supply, resulting in negative energy balance (NEB) in heat-stressed pigs. Increased levels of non-esterified fatty  (myristic , , and linoleic ) and short-chain fatty acids (3-hydroxybutanoic  and maleic ) suggested  decomposition compensating for energy shortage, which was an adaptive response to NEB. Increased concentrations of fluorine, lyxose 1, and D-galacturonic  were significantly correlated with the levels of acute phase proteins (HP, LBP, α2-HSG, and Lysozyme), suggesting acute phase response in HS-stressed pigs. These metabolites are expected to be novel biomarkers of chronic HS in pigs, yet the use of which awaits further validation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402655>Novel Fluorescence-Based Method To Characterize the Antioxidative Effects of Food Metabolites on  Droplets in Cultured Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>A fluorescence microscopic method for characterizing size, quantity, and oxidation of  droplets (LDs) in HepG2 cells was developed. LDs were induced by  (PA), oleic (OA), or linoleic acids (LA) and stained with two fluorescent probes for neutral lipids and  peroxides. Each fatty  increased the number of LDs and oxidized LDs (oxLDs) and the degree of LD oxidation time dependently, as well as increased intracellular triglyceride hydroperoxides. LDs induced by LA without 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) showed the most significant oxidation degree over PA and OA, especially in large LDs (area ≥ 3 μm, oxLD/LD = 52.3 ± 21.7%). Under this condition, two food-derived antioxidants were evaluated, and both of them significantly improved the LD characteristics. Moreover, chlorogenic  reduced the quantity of large LDs by 74.0-87.6% in a dose-dependent manner. The proposed method provides a new approach to evaluate the effect of dietary antioxidants on LD characteristics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920585> of 13C-Labeled Fatty Acids in Term Human Placental Explants by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Placental  transport and  are poorly understood despite the importance for fetal development and lifelong health. We aimed to explore fatty  (FA) processing in human villous placental explants from seven uncomplicated term singleton pregnancies delivered by elective cesarean section. Explants were treated with stable isotope-labeled  (13C-PA), oleic  (13C-OA), or docosahexaenoic  (13C-DHA) for 3, 24, or 48 hours. Stable isotope-labeled lipids synthesized by placental explants from labeled FA were quantified, alongside endogenous unlabeled placental lipids, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylethanolamines were detected in explants, whereas labeled lysophosphatidylcholines were found in both explants and conditioned media. 13C-PA was primarily directed into PC synthesis (74% of 13C-PA-labeled lipids), whereas 13C-OA was directed almost equally into PC and TAG synthesis (45% and 53%, respectively, of 13C-OA-labeled lipids). 13C-DHA was only detectable in TAGs. TAGs demonstrated the highest isotopic enrichment for all 13C-FAs with 13C-OA-TAGs comprising >50% of total OA-TAGs (unlabeled and labeled), consistent with TAGs being a labile and accessible reservoir for FA storage. Variations in  incorporation were correlated to maternal glycemia and body mass index, suggesting that this experimental model could be used to investigate the effect of maternal factors on placental . We conclude that  metabolic partitioning of freshly imported FAs into labile and less labile  reservoirs in placenta is FA dependent. This process may partly mediate the physiological preferential transplacental transfer of particular FAs to the fetus, but may also be implicated in the fetoplacental pathophysiology of maternal metabolic dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650453>Triterpenoids from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. with PPARδ/γ Dual Agonist Action: In Vivo, In Vitro and In Silico Studies.</a></h2><p> is a medicinal plant consumed as a diuretic and anti-obesity remedy.

Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds that have been studied in the case of metabolic disorders treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain whether enterolactone (ENL), a commonly known phytoestrogen, may affect sphingolipid  and decrease hepatic insulin resistance development in a  overload state.The study was conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or  (PA) for 16 h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes, apoptosis and insulin signaling pathway proteins and glucose  regulators were evaluated by Western Blot.In HepG2 cells, a considerable augmentation of intracellular ceramide and sphingosine concentration in ENL with PA group were indicated with simultaneous increase in extracellular ceramide concentration. The ENL treatment increased expression of selected enzymes from de novo ceramide synthesis pathway with lower expression of ceramide transfer protein. We also observed a decreased expression of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK after exposure to ENL with PA. Our research demonstrated that ENL with PA resulted in an increased expression of caspase-3.Enterolactone, in a higher fatty acids availability, led to the development of hepatic IR in HepG2 cells. This phenomenon may be the result of elevated intracellular ceramide accumulation caused by increased de novo synthesis pathway what led to enhanced apoptosis of HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several  molecules. We extracted the  molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish (, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the  fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and oleic  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing.

Likewise, the combined  and TNFα treatment of PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 cell cultures revealed 154, 1238 and 278 differentially expressed genes. Although genomic responses differed among in-vitro systems, commonalities were ascertained by filtering the data for LD associated gene regulations. Among others the LD-growth and fusion associated cell death inducing DFFA like effector C (CIDEC), perilipins (PLIN2, PLIN3), the synaptosome-associated-protein 23 and the vesicle associated membrane protein 3 were strongly up-regulated. Likewise, the PPAR targets pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-4 and angiopoietin-like-4 were up-regulated as was hypoxia-inducible  droplet-associated (HILPDA), flotilin and FGF21. Their inhibition ameliorates triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation. TNFα treatment elicited strong induction of the chemokine CXCL8, the kinases MAP3K8, MAP4K4 and negative regulators of cytokine signaling, i.e. SOCS2&SOCS3. Live cell imaging of DsRED calreticulin plasmid transfected HuH7 cells permitted an assessment of LD growth and fusion and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy evidenced induced LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, HIF1α, HILPDA, JAK1, PDK4 and ROCK2 expression. Notwithstanding, CPT1A protein was repressed to protect mitochondria from  overload. Pharmacological inhibition of the GTPase-dynamin and the fatty  transporter-2 reduced  uptake by 28.5 and 35%, respectively. Finally, a comparisons of in-vitro/NAFLD patient biopsy findings confirmed common gene regulations thus demonstrating clinical relevance.The genomics of -laden hepatocytes revealed LD-associated gene regulations and perturbed metabolic pathways. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed expression of coded proteins to provide a rationale for therapeutic intervention strategies.

Lipids are the primary components of elaiosomes.  is a well-known plant, the seeds of which are dispersed by ants. Previous studies have identified the presence of primary fatty acids in its elaiosomes and seeds. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fatty  biosynthesis in elaiosomes remain unknown.In order to gain a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the elaiosomes and seeds of , and understand the expression patterns of genes associated with fatty  biosynthesis, four different developmental stages, including the flower-bud (Ch01), flowering (Ch02), young seed (Ch03), and mature seed (Ch04) stages, were chosen to perform whole-transcriptome profiling through the RNA-seq technology (Illumina NGS sequencing).A total of 63,064 unigenes were generated from 12 libraries. Of these, 7,323, 258, and 11,540 unigenes were annotated with 25 Cluster of Orthologous Groups, 43 Gene Ontology terms, and 373 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, respectively. In addition, 322 genes were involved in  transport and , and 508 genes were involved in the  pathways. A total of 41 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the  pathways were identified, most of which were upregulated in Ch03 compared to Ch02, indicating that fatty  biosynthesis primarily occurs during the flowering to the young seed stages. Of the DEGs, acyl-ACP thioesterases, acyl carrier protein desaturase (), and malonyl CoA-ACP transacylase were involved in  synthesis; stearoyl-CoA desaturase and  were involved in oleic  synthesis, and acyl- omega-6 desaturase was involved in linoleic  synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30416522> Downregulates Thyroglobulin (Tg), Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS), and Thyroperoxidase (TPO) in Human Primary Thyrocytes: A Potential Mechanism by Which Lipotoxicity Affects Thyroid?</a></h2><p>Our previous studies suggested that the thyroid might be a target organ affected by lipotoxicity, which might be partially related to the increasing prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet clearly established. This study aimed to assess the effect of  stimulation on thyrocyte function. Upon  stimulation, intracellular contents of lipids, as well as the expression and activity of three key molecules in thyroid hormone synthesis (i.e., thyroglobulin, sodium iodide symporter, and thyroperoxidase), were determined in human primary thyrocytes. The contents of BODIPY® FL C16 (the fluorescently labeled  analogue) entering into the thyrocytes were gradually increased with time extending. Accordingly, the intracellular accumulation of both triglyceride and free fatty acids increased in dose- and time-dependent manners. The effect of  stimulation on thyroid hormone synthesis was then determined. Both the mRNA and protein levels of thyroglobulin, sodium iodide symporter, and thyroperoxidase were decreased following  stimulation. Consistently, upon  stimulation, the secreted thyroglobulin levels in supernatants, I uptake, and extracellular thyroperoxidase activity were all decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Our results demonstrated that upon  stimulation, the expressions of the key molecules (thyroglobulin, sodium iodide symporter, and thyroperoxidase) were reduced and their activities were suppressed, which might lead to impaired thyroid hormone synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095939>PAQR3 regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells via NF-κB signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is a significant feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and glucose and  disorders. Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in the formation of insulin resistance. FoxO1 plays a major role in regulating glucose and , as well as insulin signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 3 (PAQR3) suppresses the activity of PI3K/Akt, which is an upstream pathway of FoxO1, and additionally promotes the pathological process of diabetic renal inflammatory fibrosis via activating NF-κB pathway. On this basis, it has caused us great concern whether NF-κB is involved in PAQR3 regulation of FoxO1 under insulin resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PAQR3 regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 via NF-κB pathway in  (PA)-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, thereby causing glucose and  disorders. We found that PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of glucokinase (GCK) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), in addition, promoted the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway increased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR which were downregulated by PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression. Taken together, in PA-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, PAQR3 might regulate the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR through NF-κB pathway, thereby regulating the glucose and  disorders induced by insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial energy supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in  during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of  and oleic  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing  and oleic  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin . We further demonstrated the impact of cellular , and particularly cardiolipin , during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis.

Once activated, it promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, increased levels of FFAs lead to lipotoxicity, inducing loss of β-cell function. FFAR1 plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and previous studies have indicated the importance of developing anti-diabetic therapies against FFAR1, although its role in the regulation of β-cell function remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of FFAR1 under lipotoxic conditions using  (PA). The rat insulinoma 1 clone 832/13 (INS-1 832/13) cell line was used as a model as it physiologically resembles native pancreatic β-cells. Key players of the insulin signaling pathway, such as mTOR, Akt, IRS-1, and the insulin receptor (INSR1β), were selected as candidates to be analyzed under lipotoxic conditions.We revealed that PA-induced lipotoxicity affected GSIS in INS-1 cells and negatively modulated the activity of both IRS-1 and Akt. Reduced phosphorylation of both IRS-1 S636/639 and Akt S473 was observed, in addition to decreased expression of both INSR1β and FFAR1. Moreover, transient knockdown of FFAR1 led to a reduction in IRS-1 mRNA expression and an increase in INSR1β mRNA. Finally, PA affected localization of FFAR1 from the cytoplasm to the perinucleus.In conclusion, our study suggests a novel regulatory involvement of FFAR1 in crosstalk with mTOR-Akt and IRS-1 signaling in β-cells under lipotoxic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30652079>Uncommon properties of  biosynthesis of isolated plastids in the unicellular red alga .</a></h2><p>Red algae are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that diverged from green algae over one billion years ago, and have various traits distinct from those of both green algae and land plants. Although most red algae are marine species (both unicellular and macrophytic), the Cyanidiales class of red algae includes unicellular species which live in hot springs, such as , which is a model species for biochemical and molecular biological studies.  in red algae has previously been studied in intact cells. Here, we present the results of radiolabeling and stable isotope labeling experiments in intact plastids isolated from the unicellular red alga . We focused on two uncommon features: First, the galactose moiety of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol was efficiently labeled with bicarbonate, indicating that an unknown pathway for providing UDP-galactose exists within the plastid. Second, saturated fatty acids, namely,  and stearic acids, were the sole products of fatty  synthesis in the plastid, and they were efficiently exported. This finding suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is the sole site of desaturation. We present a general principle of red algal  biosynthesis, namely, 'indigenous C18 fatty acids are neither desaturated nor directly utilized within the plastid'. We believe that this is valid in both  lacking polyunsaturated fatty acids and marine red algae with a high content of arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879815>Milk production and nutrient digestibility responses to triglyceride or fatty  supplements enriched in .</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of feeding triglyceride and fatty  (FA) supplements enriched in  (PA; C16:0) on production and nutrient digestibility responses of mid-lactation dairy cows. Fifteen Holstein cows (137 ± 49 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a control diet (CON; no added PA) or 1.5% FA added as either a FA supplement (PA-FA) or a triglyceride supplement (PA-TG). The PA supplements replaced soyhulls, and diets were balanced for glycerol content. Periods were 21 d in length with sample and data collection occurring during the final 5 d. Compared with CON, PA treatments increased dry matter (66.5 vs. 63.9%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) apparent digestibility (42.0 vs. 38.2%). Although PA treatments tended to increase 18-carbon FA apparent digestibility (79.1 vs. 77.9%), PA treatments decreased 16-carbon (63.1 vs. 75.8%) and total FA (72.0 vs. 76.5%) apparent digestibilities compared with CON. The PA treatments increased milk  content (3.60 vs. 3.41%), milk  yield (1.70 vs. 1.60 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (570 vs. 471 g/d), 3.5% -corrected milk (47.6 vs. 46.5 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (47.4 vs. 46.6 kg/d) compared with CON. The PA treatments did not affect dry matter intake (28.5 vs. 29.2 kg/d), milk yield (47.0 vs. 47.4 kg/d), milk protein yield (1.42 vs. 1.45 kg/d), milk lactose yield (2.29 vs. 2.31 kg/d), yield of <16-carbon milk FA (360 vs. 370 g/d), yield of >16-carbon milk FA (642 vs. 630 g/d), body weight (720 vs. 723 kg), or body condition score (3.14 vs. 3.23). We did not observe differences in digestibilities of dry matter, NDF, and 18-carbon FA between PA-TG and PA-FA. In contrast, PA-FA increased 16-carbon (68.6 vs. 57.6%) and total FA apparent digestibility (73.8 vs. 70.1%) compared with PA-TG. This resulted in PA-FA supplementation increasing the apparent digestibility of the PA supplement by ∼10 percentage points compared with PA-TG. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased 16-carbon FA intake by 60 g/d, absorbed 16-carbon FA by 86 g/d, and absorbed total FA by 85 g/d. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased dry matter intake (29.1 vs. 27.8 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (596 vs. 545 g/d), and tended to increase milk yield (47.6 vs. 46.4 kg/d), milk  yield (1.70 vs. 1.66 kg/d), and 3.5% -corrected milk (48.1 vs. 47.2 kg/d). In conclusion, the production response of dairy cows to PA tended to be greater for a FA supplement compared with a triglyceride supplement. Overall, PA increased NDF digestibility, milk  yield, energy-corrected milk, and feed efficiency in mid-lactation dairy cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

These studies on Mp1p-LBD1 support the idea that the highly expressed Mp1p is an effective AA-capturing protein. Each Mp1p can bind up to 4 AA molecules. The crystal structure of Mp1p-LBD1-LBD2 has also been solved, showing that both LBDs are likely to function independently with a flexible linker between them.  and potentially other pathogens highly expressing and secreting proteins similar to Mp1p can severely disturb host signaling cascades during proinflammatory responses by reducing the availabilities of important paracrine signaling molecules.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536033>Gibberellin Promotes Cell Growth and Induces Changes in Fatty  Biosynthesis and Upregulates Fatty  Biosynthetic Genes in Chlorella vulgaris UMT-M1.</a></h2><p>Microalgae lipids and oils are potential candidates for renewable biofuels and nutritional inventions. Recent studies from our lab have shown that two plant hormones, auxin and jasmonic , influence microalgae growth and fatty  accumulation. Therefore, in this study, a high oil-producing strain Chlorella vulgaris UMT-M1 was selected for hormonal study using gibberellin (GA). Exogenous GA was applied to early stationary culture of C. vulgaris UMT-M1. Results showed that GA gradually increases the cell density of C. vulgaris to up to 42% on days after treatment (DAT)-8 and also capable of delaying the algal senescence. However, the increment in cell density did not enhance the total oil production albeit transient modification of fatty  compositions was observed for saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids. This illustrates that GA only promotes cell division and growth but not the oil accumulation. In addition, application of GA in culture medium was shown to promote transient increment of  (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids from DAT-4 to DAT-6 and these changes are correlated with the expression of β-ketoacyl ACP synthase I (KAS I) gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30298839>[The involvement of NOX1/NADPH oxidase in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis].</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to play a critical role in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To clarify the source of ROS, we examined the expression of superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase isoforms in the liver of high- and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet-fed mice. The mRNA expression of NOX1 was significantly elevated in mice on HFC diet for 8 weeks. Increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly ameliorated in mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1-KO). Increased nitrotyrosine adduct formation, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury, was observed in hepatic sinusoids of WT, which was significantly suppressed in NOX1-KO. NOX1 mRNA was mainly expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and it was significantly up-regulated in primary cultured LSECs treated with  (PA). The production of nitric oxide by LSECs and LSECs-dependent relaxation of hepatic stellate cells were significantly attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, these effects of PA were not observed in cells isolated from Nox1-KO. Taken together, the up-regulation of NOX1 in LSECs may elicit peroxynitrite-mediated cellular injury and impair hepatic microcirculation through reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide.

We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric -derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily . Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low  diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic  accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) arachidonic  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

These starch lipids are composed of lysophospholipids, especially lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) and free fatty acids that strongly impact the assembly and properties of cereal starches. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with this specific  routing have never been investigated. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging revealed decreasing gradients in starch LysoPC concentrations from the periphery to the center of developing maize endosperms. This spatiotemporal deposition of starch LysoPC was similar to that previously observed for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-synthesized storage proteins, i.e. zeins, suggesting that LysoPC might originate in the ER, as already reported for chloroplasts. Furthermore, a decrease of the palmitate concentration of amyloplast galactolipids was observed during endosperm development, correlated with the preferential trapping of palmitoyl-LysoPC by starch carbohydrates, suggesting a link between LysoPC and galactolipid synthesis. Using microarray, the homologous genes of the Arabidopsis ER-chloroplast  trafficking and galactolipid synthesis pathways were also expressed in maize endosperm. These strong similarities suggest that the encoded enzymes and transporters are adapted to managing the differences between chloroplast and amyloplast  homeostasis. Altogether, our results led us to propose a model where ER-amyloplast  trafficking directs the LysoPC towards one of two routes, the first towards the stroma and starch granules and the other towards galactolipid synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619336>Hepatocyte-Derived Lipotoxic Extracellular Vesicle Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Induces Macrophage Chemotaxis.</a></h2><p> The pathophysiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis involves hepatocyte lipotoxicity due to excess saturated free fatty acids and concomitant proinflammatory macrophage effector responses. These include the infiltration of macrophages into hepatic cords in response to incompletely understood stimuli. Stressed hepatocytes release an increased number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are known to participate in intercellular signaling and coordination of the behavior of immune cell populations via their cargo. We hypothesized that hepatocyte-derived lipotoxic EVs that are enriched in sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are effectors of macrophage infiltration in the hepatic microenvironment.  Lipotoxic EVs were isolated from palmitate treated immortalized mouse hepatocytes and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Lipotoxic EV sphingolipids were quantified using tandem mass spectrometry. Wildtype and S1P receptor knockout bone marrow-derived macrophages were exposed to lipotoxic EV gradients in a microfluidic gradient generator. Macrophage migration toward EV gradients was captured by time-lapse microscopy and analyzed to determine directional migration. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting along with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were utilized to characterize the cell surface expression of S1P receptor on intrahepatic leukocytes and hepatic expression of S1P receptor, respectively.  Palmitate treatment induced the release of EVs. These EVs were enriched in S1P. Palmitate-induced S1P enriched EVs were chemoattractive to macrophages. EV S1P enrichment depended on the activity of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, such that, pharmacological inhibition of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 resulted in a significant reduction in EV S1P cargo without affecting the number of EVs released. When exposed to EVs derived from cells treated with palmitate in the presence of a pharmacologic inhibitor of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, macrophages displayed diminished chemotactic behavior. To determine receptor-ligand specificity, we tested the migration responses of macrophages genetically deleted in the S1P receptor toward lipotoxic EVs. S1P receptor knockout macrophages displayed a marked reduction in their chemotactic responses toward lipotoxic palmitate-induced EVs. Palmitate-induced lipotoxic EVs are enriched in S1P through sphingosine kinases 1 and 2.

Evidence suggests that BBR ameliorates palmitate-induced  deposition and apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which tracks in tandem with the enhancement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). The study aim was to investigate the roles of BBR in renal lipotoxicity in vitro, and investigate whether PPAR-alpha was the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human TECs (HK-2 cells) were injured with  (PA), and then treated with BBR, BBR+PPAR-alpha inhibitor (GW6471), and PA+PPAR-alpha agonist (fenofibrate). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was assessed by measuring the expression of prospective evaluation of radial keratotomy (PERK), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78).  was assessed by determining  anabolism-associated genes, including fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as  catabolism-associated gene, including carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Inflammatory response of HK-2 cells was evaluated by measuring interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Cell apoptosis and protein levels of cleaved-caspase-3 were evaluated. RESULTS PA downregulated PPAR-alpha and induced server lipotoxicity in HK-2 cells by ER stress, increasing  deposition, and elevating inflammatory response of HK-2 cells accompanied with inducting cell apoptosis and cleaved-caspase-3, which were obviously reversed by additional treatment of BBR or PPAR-alpha agonist. However, the protective effect of BBR in PA-induced lipotoxicity in HK-2 cells was significantly ameliorated by PPAR-alpha inhibitor.

Furthermore, AA decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and target genes expression, regulated PPARα and PPARγ expressions, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis markers, enhanced hepatic FXR and LXR, and regulated AMPK-LKB1 and SIRT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, AA attenuated  accumulation via FXR and LXR activation in steatotic AML-12 cells, which was confirmed by guggulsterones (FXR antagonist) or GW3965 (LXR agonist). Activation of FXR and LXR signaling caused by AA might increase AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and then contribute to modulating  accumulation and fatty  synthesis, which suggested that activated FXR-LXR axis by AA represented an effective strategy for relieving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the fatty  (FA) profile in red blood cells (RBC) from patients with liver fibrosis remains unexplored.

We aim to characterize the hepatoprotective effects of Leonurine hydrochloride (LH) and the possible pathway in a cell and rodent model of diet-induced steatohepatitis (NASH).For in vitro studies,  (PA) and free fatty  (FFA) induced HepG2 and HL7702 steatosis cell models were used. For in vivo studies, NASH was induced by feeding mice MCD diet. These mice received either placebo or LH at three different doses (50、100、200 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Histological staining's, and commercially available kits for ALT and AST and hepatic contents of TG, TC, MDA, SOD, and GSH were used to assess NASH. Furthermore, relative liver protein and gene expression levels were determined by Western Blot and qPCR, respectively.After establishing NASH models, LH treatment improved  accumulation, hepatic contents of TG, TC, and expression levels of ALT and AST in dose-dependent manner. Also, LH improved MDA, SOD, and GSH expression levels. The results of RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that LH upregulated the expression of AMPK phosphorylation and downregulated SREBP-1c and its target genes expression level.Our data reveal the promising role of Leonurine hydrochloride in the prevention and treatment of NASH, in vitro and in vivo. This effect may be partially mediated by the AMPK/SREBP1 pathway. These findings provide a novel therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In this study the microalgal growth and chlorophyll, , and fatty acids content; along with the expression of some genes implicated in the biosynthesis of lipids were examined in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii subjected to pH values of 7.0, 7.8, and 8.5. At pH 7.8 an increase in cell growth was observed with a significant accumulation of chlorophyll (1.75-fold) when compared with growth at pH 7, while at pH 8.5 a sharp decrease in both parameters was observed when compared with the other pH values tested.  content increased 3.0 (14.81% of dry cell weight, dcw) and 2.3 times (11.43% dcw) at pH 7.8 and 8.5, respectively, when compared with the experiment at pH 7 (4.97% dcw). The compositions of major fatty acids in the strains growing at pH 7.0, 7.8, or 8.5 were 25.7, 28.0, and 32.1% for ; 17.3, 14.7, and 25.7% for oleic ; and 9.8, 12.1, and 4.6% for linoleic ; respectively. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcripts of ß-carboxyltransferase, Acyl carrier protein 1, acyl-ACP thiolase 1, acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and diacylglycerol acyl transferase isoform 3 were significantly induced at pH 7.8 when compared with the other two pH conditions. These results indicate that the induction of genes implicated in the early and final steps of  biosynthesis contributes to their accumulation in the stationary phase. Our research suggests that a pH of 7.8 might be ideal to maximize growth and  accumulation.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066268>d- chiro-Inositol Ameliorates High  Diet-Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance via PKCε-PI3K/AKT Pathway.</a></h2><p>d- chiro-Inositol (DCI) is a biologically active component found in tartary buckwheat, which can reduce hyperglycemia and ameliorate insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effects of DCI remains largely unclear. This study investigated the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of DCI on hepatic gluconeogenesis in mice fed a high  diet and saturated -treated hepatocytes. DCI attenuated free fatty  uptake by the liver via  trafficking inhibition, reduced diacylglycerol deposition, and hepatic PKCε translocation. Thus, DCI could improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis. Subsequent analyses revealed that DCI decreased hepatic glucose output and the expression levels of PEPCK and G6 Pase in insulin resistant mice through PKCε-IRS/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Likewise, such effects of DCI were confirmed in HepG2 cells with palmitate-induced insulin resistance. These findings indicate a novel pathway by which DCI prevents hepatic gluconeogenesis, reduces  deposition, and ameliorates insulin resistance via regulation of PKCε-PI3K/AKT axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593897>Fatty acids uptake and oxidation are increased in the liver of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis.</a></h2><p>Severe rheumatoid cachexia is associated with pronounced loss of muscle and  mass in patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis. This condition is associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) have not yet been consistently defined in severe arthritis. Similarly, the  of these lipids in the arthritic liver has not yet been clarified. Aiming at filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating  profile and of the fatty acids uptake and  in perfused livers of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and liver (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and oxidation of  and oleic acids was higher in arthritic livers. The phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic liver. Indeed, NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, which additionally presented higher activities of the citric  cycle driven by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced synthesis of fatty acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the  hepatic  in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100% oxygen inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs:  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05), alpha linolenic  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the  profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high- diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice. Moreover, chronic PAHSA treatment augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle and heart in HFD-fed mice. The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and liver. PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free fatty acids during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors. Thus, this study advances our understanding of PAHSA biology and the physiologic mechanisms by which PAHSAs exert beneficial metabolic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389499>GCN2 deficiency ameliorates cardiac dysfunction in diabetic mice by reducing lipotoxicity and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Excessive myocardial  accumulation is a major feature of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Although general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) has been identified as a sensor of amino  availability, it also functions as an important regulator of hepatic . Our previous studies have reported that GCN2 promotes pressure overload or doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction by increasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial oxidative stress. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of DCM remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of GCN2 on DCM in type 1 and type 2 diabetes animal models. After streptozotocin (STZ) or high- diet (HFD) plus low-dose STZ treatments, GCN2 mice developed less cardiac dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis,  accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In diabetic hearts, GCN2 deficiency attenuated the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as the reduction of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, high glucose or -induced cell death, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress and  accumulation in H9C2 cells. Collectively, our data provide evidence that GCN2 deficiency protects cardiac function by reducing  accumulation, oxidative stress and cell death. Our findings suggest that strategies to inhibit GCN2 activity in the heart may be novel approaches for DCM therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo-weight and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma  classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar  (stearic :  C-SA; :  C-PA; oleic :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a body mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a body mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma  classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)- and oleic -and high- diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of , inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460699>Unsaturated Fatty Acids Increase the Expression of Hepassocin through a Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3-Dependent Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Hepassocin (HPS) is a hepatokine that regulates hepatocyte proliferation. It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Fatty acids, such as oleic  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by fatty acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different fatty acids, including linoleic  (LNA), oleic , , and stearic . The intracellular  accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated fatty acids significantly induced intracellular  accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated fatty -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated fatty -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499>Evidence for an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.</a></h2><p>Most tumours have an aberrantly activated  that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty   and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  . Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired.

Studies have demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation, including regulating the expression of inflammatory factors. The purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the role of mTOR in obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial inflammation. In the clinical study, obese and healthy subjects were recruited for physical examination, as well as the collection of blood and urine samples. Further study was performed on a high  diet (HFD)‑induced obese rat model and a cultured human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK‑2). The clinical study demonstrated that the participants with obesity had increased serum lipids, creatinine (Cr), urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and urinary neutrophil gelatinase‑associated lipocalin (u‑NGAL). Moreover, the level of urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 (u‑MCP‑1) was increased in the participants with obesity, and it was positively correlated with free fatty  (FFA), UACR and u‑NGAL. In the in vivo study, the results indicated that the levels of serum lipids, Cr and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as 24 h urine protein and u‑NGAL, were signiﬁcantly increased in the HFD‑fed obese rats. In addition, the infiltration of CD68+ cells into the renal interstitial area and the release of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) was observed in the kidneys of obese rats. Meanwhile, the supernatant from HK‑2 cells treated with  stimulated THP‑1 monocyte migration. The upregulation of MCP‑1, phosphorylated forkhead boxO1 (p‑FOXO1), and phosphorylated mTOR (p‑mTOR) was observed in vivo and in vitro. However, inhibition of mTOR was able to alleviate the above effects. Overall, these results demonstrated that activated mTOR induced FOXO1 phosphorylation, which mediates renal MCP‑1 release, causes tubulointerstitial inflammation and ultimately leads to pathological renal changes and dysfunction. However, inhibition of mTOR may play a renoprotective role during the progression of obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572061>Cellular toxicity of dietary trans fatty acids and its correlation with ceramide and diglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>High fatty  (FA) levels are deleterious to pancreatic β-cells, largely due to the accumulation of biosynthetic  intermediates, such as ceramides and diglycerides, which induce ER stress and apoptosis. Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of  intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important metabolic characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether liraglutide improves high- diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice through inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver. After daily intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide (0.6 mg/kg body weight) for four weeks, the liver, liver/body weight, serum levels of ALT, AST, total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL were significantly decreased in a high- diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. The hepatic steatosis among sections of H&E and Oil Red O staining was also markedly reduced after treatment with liraglutide. The expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome components (including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1) in the liver of mice after treatment with liraglutide were decreased substantially. In vitro studies found that the mitochondrial dysfunction in Kupffer cells induced by  was attenuated, and the protein levels of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 were also decrease markedly. These results demonstrate that liraglutide was able to alleviate high- diet-induced hepatic steatosis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that liraglutide is a potent drug that can reverse the pathological hallmarks of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we used a C to C diet shift experiment and compound-specific δC analysis to estimate the turnover rates of FAs in the polar and neutral fractions of flight muscle lipids (corresponding to membranes and  droplets) of exercised and sedentary zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Turnover was fastest for linoleic  (LA; 18:2n6) and  (PA; 16:0), with 95% replacement times of 10.8-17.7 d in the polar fraction and 17.2-32.8 d in the neutral fraction, but was unexpectedly slow for the long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs) arachidonic  (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n3) in the polar fraction, with 95% replacement in 64.9-136.5 d. Polar fraction LA and PA turnover was significantly faster in exercised birds (95% replacement in 8.5-13.3 d). Our results suggest that FA turnover in intramuscular  droplets is related to FA tissue concentrations and that turnover does not change in response to exercise. In contrast, we found that muscle membrane FA turnover is likely driven by a combination of selective LC-PUFA retention and consumption of shorter-chain FAs in energy . The unexpectedly fast turnover of membrane-associated FAs in muscle suggests that songbirds during migration could substantially remodel their membranes within a single migration stopover, and this may have substantial implications for how the FA composition of diet affects energy  of birds during migration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095863>Trimethylamine N-Oxide Aggravates Liver Steatosis through Modulation of Bile   and Inhibition of Farnesoid X Receptor Signaling in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the metabolite of choline generated by gut microbiota, is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and could influence bile  (BA) . However, whether TMAO aggravates liver steatosis by modulating BA  and the related mechanisms has not been investigated.A case-control study including biopsy-proven NAFLD patients (n = 34) and controls (n = 14) is conducted to determine the correlation between TMAO and BA . Serum levels of total BA and the percentage of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-antagonistic BA species are markedly higher in NAFLD patients than in the controls. Serum levels of TMAO positively correlated with the serum levels of total BA and hepatic mRNA expression of cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase (CYP7A1). In a murine model, it is found that 18 weeks administration of TMAO impairs liver function and increases hepatic triglyceride accumulation and lipogenesis in mice fed with a high- diet. TMAO increases BA synthesis and shifted hepatic BA composition toward FXR-antagonistic activity. Knockdown of CYP7A1 via small interfering RNA or activation of FXR by GW4064 blocks the effect of TMAO-induced lipogenesis in -treated HepG2 cells.TMAO aggravates liver steatosis by suppressing BA-mediated hepatic FXR signaling.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Subjects with hyperlipidemia (n=22) and age-matched healthy controls (n=19) were included in this study. Results showed that plasma levels of Gla-Gas6 protein and VK were significantly lower in hyperlipidemic subjects compared to control. Moreover, Gla-Gas6 levels were significantly and positively correlated with VK (P=.034, r=0.452) and negatively with triglyceride (P=.022, r=-0.485) and total cholesterol (P=.043, r=-0.435) in hyperlipidemic subjects, which suggest that VK supplementation may have a positive effect in activating Gas6 protein and thereby reducing the aberrant plasma  levels. Further studies with high- diet (HFD)-fed animal model of hyperlipidemia demonstrated that VK supplementation (5 μg/kg body weight, 8 weeks) reduced the plasma  levels, stimulated both the plasma levels and the hepatic protein expression of Gla-Gas6 protein, and regulated the AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα signaling pathways of hepatic  in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, by using  (PA, 0.75 mM)-treated both control and GGCX knockdown hepatocytes, this study dissected the direct role of Gla-Gas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on preventing the PA-induced impaired hepatic  via regulating AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα pathways.

We recently generated a novel fusion peptide INSR-IgG4Fc, Yiminsu (YMS), to facilitate the high-affinity binding and transportation of insulin. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the novel recombinant peptide, YMS, could contribute to restoring insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in insulin resistance models and revealing its underlying mechanism.  (PA)-treated LO2 cells and high  diet (HFD)-fed mice were treated with YMS. Therapeutic effects of YMS were measured using Western blotting, ELISA, qPCR, Histology and transmission electron microscopy. We observed that YMS treatment effectively improved insulin signaling in PA-treated LO2 cells and HFD-fed mice. Notably, YMS could significantly reduce serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol without affecting the serum insulin levels. Moreover, our data demonstrated that YMS could restore glucose and  homeostasis via facilitating insulin transportation and reactivating PI3K/Akt signaling in both PA-treated cells and liver, gastrocnemius and brown  of HFD-fed mice. Additionally, we noticed that the therapeutic effects of YMS was similar as rosiglitazone, a well-recognized insulin sensitizer. Our findings suggested that YMS is a potentially candidate for pharmacotherapy for metabolic disorders associated with insulin resistance, particularly in T2DM.Copyright © 2018.

However, the molecular mechanism of GLP-1 on NAFLD is remained unclear. The present study was to detect whether the effect of GLP-1 on triglyceride (TG) content in hepatocytes is dependent on Foxos.  HepG2 cells were treated with /oleic  for 24 h. The knockdown of Foxo1, Foxo3 was conducted through small interfering RNA (siRNA). Real time PCT (RT-PCR) was used to detect the changes of the SREBP1c and Aco genes in HepG2 cells after Foxo1/3 knockdown.  As expected, /oleic  increased TG concentration in HepG2 cells [(12.65 ± 1.32) μg/mg vs. (4.32±0.54) μg/mg, 0.05]. Addition of GLP-1 dose (10, 50, 100nmol/L) dependently lowered the TG content and reached plateau at 100 nmol/L of GLP-1 [TG(8.38±1.47) μg/mg]. The GLP-1 effect on TG remained after knocking down either Foxo1 [(9.09±1.34)μg/mg] or Foxo3 [(8.90±1.60) μg/mg] alone, but not when knocking down Foxo1 and Foxo3 (Foxo1/3) together [(14.66±1.77)μg/mg]. Moreover, knocking down Foxo1/3 also abolished GLP-1 effect on SREBP1c and Aco expression.  GLP-1 can inhibit the synthesis of TG in hepatocytes depending on Foxo1 and Foxo3. Further studies are needed to explore the specific mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777461>Encapsulation of soybean meal with fats enriched in  and stearic acids: effects on rumen-undegraded protein and in vitro intestinal digestibility.</a></h2><p> coating of soybean meal (SBM) can reduce its protein degradability in the rumen, but the encapsulation of SBM with  (PA) and stearic acids (SA) has not yet been investigated, despite both fatty acids are common energy sources in dairy cow diets. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of applying a novel method, using either 400 or 500 g /kg (treatments FL40 and FL50, respectively), which was enriched in PA and SA at different ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100), on physical and chemical characteristics, ruminal degradability, solubility and in vitro intestinal protein digestibility (IVIPD) of the obtained products. Encapsulation of SBM in  resulted in greater mean particle size and lower bulk density and protein solubility than unprotected SBM (USBM). Treatment FL50 resulted in increased (p < 0.01) rumen-undegraded protein (RUP) compared to USBM. There were no differences in RUP of SBM when different PA: SA ratios were used. The mean RUP content of treatments FL40 and FL50 (306 and 349 g/kg, respectively) was greater compared to USBM (262 g/kg, p < 0.05), but lower than that for a standard heat-treated SBM (431 g/kg). Values of IVIPD did not differ among SBM, heat-treated SBM and FL40 and FL50 samples, all being greater than 97.8%. In conclusion, encapsulation of SBM with fats enriched in PA and SA proved to be effective in reducing protein solubility and increasing RUP without depressing protein digestibility in the intestine. For validation of the method, in vivo research to investigate the effects of these products on the production of dairy cows is warranted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404911>Myo-inositol alters 13C-labeled fatty   in human placental explants.</a></h2><p>We postulate that myo-inositol, a proposed intervention for gestational-diabetes, affects transplacental  supply to the fetus. We investigated the effect of myo-inositol on fatty- processing in human placental-explants from uncomplicated pregnancies. Explants were incubated with 13C-labeled , 13C-oleic- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- across a range of myo-inositol concentrations for 24 h and 48 h. The incorporation of labeled-fatty-acids into individual lipids was quantified by liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. At 24 h, myo-inositol increased the amount of 13C- and 13C-oleic- labeled lipids (median fold-change relative to control=1). Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol (physiological) for 13C--lysophosphatidylcholines (1.26) and 13C--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.17). At 48 h, myo-inositol addition increased 13C-oleic--lipids but decreased 13C- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- lipids. Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol for 13C-oleic--phosphatidylcholines (1.25), 13C-oleic--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.37) and 13C-oleic--triacylglycerols (1.32) and with 100 µM myo-inositol for 13C-docosahexaenoic--triacylglycerols (0.78). Lipids labeled with the same 13C-fatty- showed similar responses when tested at the same time-point, suggesting myo-inositol alters upstream processes such as fatty- uptake or activation.

Karst, a traditional Chinese medicine, is a biologically active substance reported to possess anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and neurological protection. However, it is unknown whether GLP have any protective effect against high- constituents-induced epithelial cell injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the protection and molecular mechanism of GLP on injury induced by  (PA) in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). First, we tested whether the treatment of GLP attenuate PA-induced IPEC-J2 cell death. GLP markedly blocked PA-caused cytotoxicity and apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. Moreover, GLP recovered the decreased mitochondrial function and inhibited activation of caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, PA promoted cell apoptosis and autophagy through stimulation of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which was reversed by GLP. Taken together, this study revealed a protective effect of GLP against PA-evoked IPEC-J2 cell death through anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576936>Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate ameliorates hepatic steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis and inflammation.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming an epidemic disease in adults and children worldwide. Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited  accumulation in oleic  (OA) and  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed lipogenesis by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced inflammation in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased  accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for STS in the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

In this study, we combined PET, desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (DESI-MS), nonimaging MS, and transcriptomic analyses to interrogate changes in  in a transgenic zebrafish model of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia progression. Exogenous fatty  uptake was detected in melanoma tumor nodules by PET using the  surrogate tracer 14(R,S)-18F-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic  ([18F]-FTHA), consistent with upregulation of genes associated with fatty  uptake found through microarray analysis. DESI-MS imaging revealed that FTHA uptake in tumors was heterogeneous. Transcriptome and lipidome analyses further highlighted dysregulation of glycerophospholipid pathways in melanoma tumor nodules, including increased abundance of phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl choline species, corroborated by DESI-MS, which again revealed heterogeneous phospholipid composition in tumors. Overexpression of the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which was upregulated in zebrafish melanocyte tumor nodules and expressed in the majority of human melanomas, accelerated progression of oncogenic RAS-driven melanocyte neoplasia in zebrafish. Depletion or antagonism of LPL suppressed human melanoma cell growth; this required simultaneous fatty  synthase (FASN) inhibition when FASN expression was also elevated. Collectively, our findings implicate fatty  acquisition as a possible therapeutic target in melanoma, and the methods we developed for monitoring fatty  uptake have potential for diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring pharmacologic response. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the translational potential of monitoring fatty  uptake and identify lipoprotein lipase as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408938>Resveratrol Maintains  Homeostasis via One of the Mechanisms Associated with the Key Circadian Regulator Bmal1.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol (RES) possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, and it can prevent liver  disorders in obese and diabetic individuals. This study elucidated the mechanisms of brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) in the protective effects of RES against liver  disorders. The results indicated that RES ameliorated free fatty  (FFA)-induced (oleic  (OA):  (PA) = 2:1) glycolipid metabolic disorders in hepatocytes. Simultaneously, RES partially reverted the relatively shallow daily oscillations of FFA-induced circadian clock gene transcription and protein expression in HepG2 cells. RES also attenuated FFA-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion and restored mitochondrial membrane potential consumption, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. This study provides compelling evidence that RES controls intracellular  metabolic imbalance in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, RES may serve as a promising natural nutraceutical for the regulation of  metabolic disorders relevant to the circadian clock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519174>Diosgenin ameliorates -induced  accumulation via AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A and SREBP-1c/FAS signaling pathways in LO2 cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is characterized by excessive hepatic  accumulation. Many studies have suggested that  overload is the key initial factor that contributes to hepatic steatosis. Our previous study indicated that diosgenin (DSG) has a beneficial effect on energy , but the underlying mechanism remains unclear.Human normal hepatocytes (LO2 cells) were incubated with  to establish the cell model of nonalcoholic fatty liver. The effects of DSG on , glucose uptake and mitochondrial function were evaluated. Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress,  consumption and  synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that  induced obvious  accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular  content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of  synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty  synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive oxygen species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular  accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty  β-oxidation and decreasing  synthesis. The above changes might be mediated by the activation of the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A pathway and inhibition of the SREBP-1c/FAS pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215273>Vascular endothelial growth factor B inhibits  accumulation in C2C12 myotubes incubated with fatty acids.</a></h2><p>To investigate (1) the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) on  accumulation and the alteration of fatty acids and fatty -related enzymes in C2C12 myotubes incubated with fatty acids and (2) the regulatory effect of VEGFB on skeletal muscle . Mouse C2C12 myotubes were incubated with oleic  (OA) and  (PA), and differentiated mature C2C12 myotubes were treated with VEGFB.

In atherosclerosis this is associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, but mechanisms linking these phenomena to macrophage activation remain incompletely understood.  To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific metabolic pathways.  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell metabolic studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high  diet showed similar metabolic changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA  to oxidative stress from the mitochondria, which drives chronic inflammation. Thus, targeting to CD36 and its downstream effectors may serve as potential new strategies against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30509266>Soluble epoxide hydrolase derived  mediators are elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory multi-organ disease almost always affecting the lungs. The etiology remains unknown, but the hallmark of sarcoidosis is formation of non-caseating epithelioid cells granulomas in involved organs. In Scandinavia, > 30% of sarcoidosis patients have Löfgren's syndrome (LS), an acute disease onset mostly indicating a favorable prognosis. The impact of dysregulation of  mediators, which has been investigated in other inflammatory disorders, is still unknown.Using three different liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry targeted platforms (LC-MS/MS), we quantified a broad suite of  mediators including eicosanoids, sphingolipids and endocannabinoids in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from pulmonary sarcoidosis patients (n = 41) and healthy controls (n = 16).A total of 47  mediators were consistently detected in BAL fluid of patients and controls.

Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are , oleic, and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine energy and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross energy intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated energy retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk  yield and milk energy output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable energy intake, increased milk  yield and milk energy output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on energy retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable energy intake, and total milk, , protein, and lactose yields. Milk energy output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total energy retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted energy retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra energy intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is well known that SCs can phagocyte and degrade apoptotic germ cells (AGCs) resulting in increasing  content and ATP levels. A relationship between the regulation of  storage and of  oxidation in SC might be envisaged. The aim of this study was to analyze whether AGCs and FAs are able to simultaneously regulate molecular mechanisms involved in  storage and in FA oxidation in SC. The experimental model utilized in this study consisted in SC cultures obtained from 20-day-old rats that were co-cultured with AGC or treated with  (PA, 500 μM) for 24 and 48 h. AGC and PA increase LD, triacylglycerol (TAG) content and mRNA levels of Plin1, Plin2, Plin3 (proteins involved in TAG storage). Simultaneously, AGC and PA rise the extent of FA oxidation and mRNA levels of Cpt1 and Lcad (proteins involved in FA degradation). Results also show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) transcriptional activity, transcription factor which participate in  regulation, increases by AGC and PA treatment in SC. Additionally, the presence of a PPARg antagonist decreases the upregulation of LD content and Plin1 expression. Similarly, the presence of a PPARb/d antagonist reduces the increase in FA oxidation and Cpt1 mRNA levels. Altogether these results suggest that AGC and FA, which probably generate PPAR ligands, regulate  storage and fatty  utilization, contributing to the energy homeostasis in the seminiferous tubules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639268>Chronic intake of moderate -enriched diet induces fatty liver and low-grade inflammation without obesity in rabbits.</a></h2><p>Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the cause of chronic liver disease. Even though NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, there is a proportion of patients who develop this condition in the absence of obesity and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated early events in the pathogenesis of non-obese NAFLD, analyzing the impact of the chronic intake of a moderate -enriched diet on hepatic  accumulation and their relationship with inflammation. Rabbits fed with a moderate Fatty-- Enriched Diet 3%  (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and liver function. Liver samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure  accumulation, the expression of inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4. Chronic consumption by 6-months of FAED did not generate metabolic changes, but it induced fatty liver. We also observed the development of low-grade inflammation characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of -enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of metabolic disorders, such as overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of metabolic alterations. Rabbits fed with FAED can be used as a model of NAFLD in non-obese and obese groups, especially at early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2019.

To correlate the  profiles with cellular lipotoxicity, we utilized  (C16:0)- and especially unprecedented palmitoleic  (C16:1)-induced  overload HepG2 cell models coupled with lipidomic technology involving labeling with stable isotopes. C16:0 induced inflammation and cell death, whereas C16:1 induced significant  droplet accumulation. Moreover, inhibition of de novo sphingolipid synthesis by myriocin (Myr) aggravated C16:0 induced lipoapoptosis.  profiles are different in C16:0 and C16:1-treated cells. Stable isotope-labeled lipidomics elucidates the roles of specific fatty acids that affect  and cause lipotoxicity or  droplet formation.

The effect of interesterified fats containing  or stearic acids on  and inflammatory signaling pathways in adipose and hepatic tissues was evaluated. Male LDLr-KO mice were fed a high- diet containing polyunsaturated (PUFA),  (PALM),  interesterified (PALM INTER), stearic (STEAR), or stearic interesterified (STEAR INTER) fats for 16 weeks. The expression of genes and protein levels involved in  and inflammatory processes in liver and white adipose tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and by Western blot, respectively. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in hepatic and adipose tissues was determined by eosin and hematoxylin, while liver collagen content was determined by Sirius Red staining. Both interesterified fats increased liver collagen content and JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, the STEAR INTER group developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with higher neutrophil infiltration.

This study determined the fatty  profile of Spanish lacto-ovo vegetarians (LO-vegetarians) and vegans. Participants were 104 healthy adults, LO-vegetarians ( = 49) and vegans ( = 55). Lifestyle habits and consumption of food and omega-3 supplements were estimated by questionnaires. BMI, blood pressure, and abdominal and body  were determined. Serum was collected to analyze fatty acids, glucose, lipids, homocysteine, insulin, and leptin. Volunteers were classified according to serum omega-6 to omega-3 (-6/-3) ratio into three groups: -6/-3 < 10, -6/-3 ≥ 10 to 20, and -6/-3 > 20. Results showed low cardiovascular risk and high insulin sensitivity with negligible differences between diet types. Linoleic  (C18:2-6) was the major serum fatty , followed by oleic (C18:1-9) and  (C16:0) acids. In contrast, serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6-3) were (median, interquartile range) 0.27, 0.18% and 1.59, and 0.93%, respectively. Users of -3 supplements (<10% of total vegetarians) had significantly higher EPA than non-users, while frequent consumption of flax-seeds was associated with increased α-linolenic  (C18:3-3). However, neither -3 supplementation nor food consumption affected DHA levels in this vegetarian population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30880233>Berberine attenuates sodium palmitate-induced  accumulation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in grass carp(Ctenopharyngodon idella)hepatocyte in vitro.</a></h2><p>The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of berberine (BBR) on the Cell viability,  accumulation, apoptosis, cytochrome c, caspase-9 and caspase-3 in  accumulation-hepatocytes induced by sodium palmitate in vitro. The  accumulation-hepatocytes (induced by 0.5 mM sodium palmitate for 24 h) were treated with 5 μM berberine for 12 h. Then, the Cell viability, intracellular triglyceride (TG) content,  peroxide (LPO), malonaldehyde (MDA) content, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and apoptosis were detected. Sodium palmitate decreased Cell viability and increased intracellular TG content,  droplet accumulation, LPO and MDA concentrations, caused caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation, then led to apoptosis accompanied by cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Beberine could improve intracellular  droplet accumulation and oxidative stress, while reduce apoptosis induced by sodium palmitate.Copyright © 2019.

Silibinin, the main component of Silybum marianum fruit extract (silymarin), is reported to have anti-diabetic effect. This study is designed to determine the protective effect of silibinin on -induced damage in a rat pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that silibinin improves cell viability, enhances insulin synthesis and secretion, and resumes normal mitochondrial function in -treated INS-1 cells. An accumulating body of evidence has shown that the estrogen receptors are key molecules involved in glucose and . Our results suggest that silibinin upregulates ERα signaling pathway from the finding that ERα-specific inhibitors abolish the anti-lipotoxic effect of silibinin. In conclusion, these findings suggest that silibinin protects INS-1 cells against apoptosis and mitochondrial damage through upregulation of ERα pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30431065>lncRNA MEG3 promotes hepatic insulin resistance by serving as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-214 to regulate ATF4 expression.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA (miR)‑214 has been demonstrated to suppress gluconeogenesis by targeting activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which regulates gluconeogenesis by affecting the transcriptional activity of forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). Our previous study revealed that the upregulation of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a long noncoding RNA, enhanced hepatic insulin resistance via increased FoxO1 expression. The present study aimed to explore whether miR‑214 and ATF4 were involved in the MEG3‑mediated increase of FoxO1 expression. MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 expression were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The interaction among MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 was analysed using the luciferase reporter assay. MEG3‑targeting small interference RNAs were injected into high‑ diet (HFD)‑fed mice to verify the role of MEG3 in hepatic insulin resistance in vivo. MEG‑3 and ATF4 were demonstrated to be upregulated and miR‑214 was indicated to be downregulated in the livers of HFD‑fed and ob/ob mice. In mouse primary hepatocytes, palmitate time‑dependently increased MEG3 and ATF4 but decreased miR‑214 expression levels. Furthermore, MEG3 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression, while miR‑214 inhibition and ATF4 overexpression reversed the MEG3 knockdown‑mediated decrease in the expression of FoxO1 and FoxO1‑downstream targets phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose‑6‑phosphatase catalytic subunit. In HFD‑fed mice, MEG3 knockdown substantially improved impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, while downregulating HFD‑induced ATF4 expression and upregulating HFD‑suppressed miR‑214 expression. In conclusion, MEG3 promoted hepatic insulin resistance by serving as a ceRNA of miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression. These data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of MEG3 involvement in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527983>Effects of timing of  supplementation during early lactation on nutrient digestibility, energy balance, and  of dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of timing of  (C16:0) supplementation during early lactation on nutrient digestibility, energy intake and balance, and metabolic responses of dairy cows. Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh (FR) period (1-24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental  (CON) or a C16:0-supplemented diet [PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter (DM)]. During the peak (PK) period (25-67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA diet (1.5% of diet DM) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, compared with CON, PA increased DM digestibility by 3.0 percentage units and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility by 4.4 percentage units, and the increase in these variables was consistent over time. Although PA did not affect 18-carbon fatty  (FA) digestibility, it decreased 16-carbon FA digestibility by 10.8 percentage units and total FA digestibility by 4.7 percentage units compared with CON. We observed a tendency for an interaction between treatment and time for total FA digestibility and 16-carbon FA digestibility due to the difference in FA digestibility between PA and CON reducing over time. Compared with CON, PA increased digestible energy intake by 3.9 Mcal/d, metabolizable energy intake by 3.5 Mcal/d, and net energy for lactation intake by 2.5 Mcal/d. The PA diet also increased milk energy output, negative energy balance, and plasma nonesterified fatty  concentration and reduced plasma insulin concentration. We also observed a tendency for an interaction between treatment and time for energy balance due to cows receiving the PA treatment being in a greater negative energy balance over time. During the PK period, PA increased DM digestibility by 2.9 percentage units and NDF digestibility by 3.5 percentage units compared with CON. Although PA decreased 16-carbon FA digestibility by 7.0 percentage units, PA did not affect 18-carbon FA digestibility or total FA digestibility. Feeding PA during the PK period increased energy intake and milk energy output and did not affect energy balance. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased DM and NDF digestibilities and energy intake compared with a control diet containing no supplemental . Feeding C16:0 markedly increased milk energy output in both the FR and PK periods but increased negative energy balance only in the FR period.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

This indicates that the related two algae would have different enzyme systems or substrate composition. To carry out more in-depth discussions on the metabolic pathway of eicosanoids between the two algae, we investigated the characteristics of glycerolipids, which are the substrates of eicosanoids production, of  and compared them to the reported values of . In , monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were the major  classes and accounted for 44.4% of the total  extract. The predominant fatty acids were arachidonic  (20:4n-6), an eicosanoids precursor, and  (16:0). The 20:4n-6 content was extremely high in MGDG and PC (>70%), and the 16:0 content was extremely high in DGDG and SQDG (>40%). A chiral-phase HPLC analysis showed that fatty acids were esterified at the -1 and -2 positions of those lipids. The glycerolipid molecular species were determined by reversed-phase HPLC⁻ESI⁻MS analysis. The main glycerolipid molecular species were 20:4n-6/20:4n-6 (-1/-2) for MGDG (63.8%) and PC (48.2%), 20:4n-6/16:0 for DGDG (71.1%) and SQDG (29.4%).

VDW was cultured under different conditions in medium containing varying concentrations of NHCl. Response surface methodology (RSM) was then used to build a predictive model of the combined effects of independent variables (pH, inoculum size, ammonium concentration). At the optimum conditions of initial pH 7.4, inoculum size 0.17 (OD730) and ammonium concentration 10.5 mg L, the maximum ammonium removal and biomass productivity were about 95% and 34 mg Ld, respectively, after seven days of cultivation. The result of fatty  methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed that the major fatty acids were  (C16:0), linoleic  (C18:2 n6 cis), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and oleic  (C18:1 n9 cis), which accounted for more than 80% weight of total fatty acids.

Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh period (FR; 1-24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental  (CON) or a diet supplemented with C16:0 (, PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter). During the peak (PK) period (25-67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA (1.5% of diet dry matter) diet in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, we did not observe treatment differences for dry matter intake or milk yield. Compared with CON, PA increased the yield of 3.5% -corrected milk by 5.30 kg/d, yield of energy-corrected milk (ECM) by 4.70 kg/d, milk  content by 0.41% units, milk  yield by 280 g/d, and protein yield by 100 g/d. The increase in milk  associated with the PA treatment during the FR period occurred due to an increase in yield of 16-carbon milk fatty acids (FA) by 147 g/d (derived from both de novo synthesis and extraction from plasma) and preformed milk FA by 96 g/d. Compared with CON, PA decreased body weight (BW) by 21 kg and body condition score (BCS) by 0.09 units and tended to increase BW loss by 0.76 kg/d. Although PA consistently increased milk  yield and ECM over time, a treatment × time interaction was observed for BW and BCS due to PA inducing a greater decrease in BW and BCS after the second week of treatments. Feeding PA during the PK period increased milk yield by 3.45 kg/d, yield of 3.5% -corrected milk by 4.50 kg/d, yield of ECM by 4.60 kg/d, milk  content by 0.22% units, milk  yield by 210 g/d, protein yield by 140 g/d, and lactose yield by 100 g/d but tended to reduce BW by 10 kg compared with CON. Also, during the PK period we observed an interaction between diet fed in the FR and PK periods for milk  yield due to feeding PA during the PK period increasing milk  yield to a greater extent in cows that received the CON diet (+240 g/d) rather than the PA diet (+180 g/d) during the FR period. This difference was associated with the yield of preformed FA because feeding PA during the PK period increased the yield of preformed milk FA only in cows that received the CON diet during the FR period. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased the yield of ECM in both the FR and PK periods compared with a control diet. For some variables, the effect of feeding C16:0 was affected by timing of supplementation because milk yield increased only during the PK period and BW decreased to a greater extent in the FR period. Regardless of diet fed in the FR period, feeding a C16:0 supplement during the PK period increased yields of milk and milk components.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac insulin signaling are not fully understood. The regulatory role of tafazzin in the hearts of HF-diet-fed mice is investigated.Mice are fed a HF diet or low  (LF) diet for up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, it is found that HF-diet-induced cardiac dysfunction is linked to overexpression of the mitochondrial protein tafazzin. Increased tafazzin promotes mitochondrial fission and impairs insulin signaling, which is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Furthermore, knockdown of tafazzin with siRNA inhibits -induced mitochondrial fission and restores insulin sensitivity. Moreover, miR-125b-5p as an upstream regulator targeting tafazzin is identified and palmitate-induced insulin resistance further rescued.In HF-diet-fed mouse hearts, increased tafazzin contributes to insulin resistance via mediating Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria, and a small non-coding RNA, miR-125b-5p, at least partially regulates this signaling pathway and alleviates insulin resistance.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high- diet (HFD; 60 kcal% ) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular  contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic .LLE significantly decreased the intracellular  accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative pathways, including reduction of cAMP catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie non-cholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of disruption of fatty  signaling as a mechanism of toxicity,  and fatty  profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses (10, 20, and 40 μg/L). While lethality was noted higher doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 μg/L (nominal concentration 10 μg/L) significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines (16:0; 18:0, 18:1, and 22:6) derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids ( acid16:0; Linolenic acid18:3; Eicosadienoic  20:2; Arachidonic  20:4; and Docosahexaenoic  22:6) were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the  of selected phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations. These results indicate that in addition to AChE inhibition, environmentally relevant chlorpyrifos exposure alters serine lipase activity and  metabolites in the trout brain, which may compromise neuronal signaling and impact neurobehavioral responses in aquatic animals.© The Author(s) 2019.

Fatty acids incorporate into membrane and storage glycerolipids through a series of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzymes, but how these enzymes are regulated is not well understood. Here, using a combination of CRISPR-based genetic screens and unbiased lipidomics, we identified calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a major regulator of ER glycerolipid synthesis. Loss of CHP1 severely reduces fatty  incorporation and storage in mammalian cells and invertebrates. Mechanistically, CHP1 binds and activates GPAT4, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis. GPAT4 activity requires CHP1 to be N-myristoylated, forming a key molecular interface between the two proteins. Interestingly, upon CHP1 loss, the peroxisomal enzyme, GNPAT, partially compensates for the loss of ER  synthesis, enabling cell proliferation. Thus, our work identifies a conserved regulator of glycerolipid  and reveals plasticity in  synthesis of proliferating cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We analysed ACE2 expression using Western-blotting analyses. ER stress-related proteins were detected in ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice by immunofluorescence or Western-blotting analyses. In ACE2-overexpression HepG2 cells, the triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and glycogen content were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins (ACCα, SREBP-1c, FAS, and LXRα), enzymes for gluconeogenesis (PEPCK, G6Pase, and IRS2), and IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway were analysed by Western-blotting analyses.ACE2 was significantly increased in Tg/PA-induced cultured hepatocytes. Additionally, ACE2 knockout mice displayed elevated levels of ER stress, while Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice showed reduced ER stress in liver. Furthermore, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress, accompanied by decreased TG content, increased intracellular glycogen, and downregulated expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for gluconeogenesis in Tg/PA-induced hepatocytes. As a consequence of anti-ER stress, the activation of ACE2 led to improved glucose and  through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway.This is the first time documented that ACE2 had a notable alleviating role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose  via the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt-mediated pathway.

Wild-type mice were fed a high  diet (HFD) rich in PA or a standard diet (SD) and subjected to bleomycin-induced lung injury. Lung fibrosis was determined by hydroxyproline content. Mouse lung epithelial cells were treated with PA. ER stress and cell death were assessed by Western blotting, TUNEL staining and cell viability assays. IPF lungs had a higher level of PA compared to controls. Bleomycin-exposed mice fed a HFD had significantly increased pulmonary fibrosis associated with increased cell death and ER stress compared to those fed a SD. PA increased apoptosis and activation of the unfolded protein response in lung epithelial cells. This was attenuated by genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of CD36, a fatty  transporter. In conclusion, consumption of a HFD rich in saturated  increases susceptibility to lung fibrosis and ER stress and PA mediates lung epithelial cell death and ER stress via CD36. These findings demonstrate that lipotoxicity may have a significant impact on the development of lung injury and fibrosis by enhancing pro-death ER stress pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355732>-Enriched Diet Induces Hepatic Steatosis and Injury in Adult Zebrafish.</a></h2><p> (PA) is the most abundant saturated fatty  in fast foods and is known to induce inflammation and cellular injury in various tissues. In this study, we investigated whether a PA-enriched diet can induce hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish. The adult zebrafish exhibited increased body weight, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and steatosis and a hepatic injury phenotype after being fed with a PA-enriched diet for 6 weeks. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that genes associated with hepatic injury were all significantly increased in the liver. Furthermore, livers from the PA-fed group showed an increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression associated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. We also found significant upregulation of genes involved in  and triacylglyceride accumulation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed mitochondrial cristae injury and a dilated ER phenotype in the PA-fed hepatocytes, which can be causes of hepatic injury. PA-enriched diet induced hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish that recapitulated typical metabolic changes and pathophysiological changes as well as increased oxidative stress and ER stress observed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732887>Fatty  levels alterations in THP-1 macrophages cultured with lead (Pb).</a></h2><p>As cardiovascular events are one of the main causes of death in developed countries, each factor potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease deserves special attention. One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0),  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1), oleic  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic  (C18:3n6), arachidonic  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving , antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high  high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of NASH. The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved  homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As, mitochondria are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of , we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti-NASH potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of oleic  (OA) or  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive oxygen species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of mitochondria, immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of the present study may provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer types with IDH mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572539>Apigenin reduces the excessive accumulation of lipids induced by  via the AMPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to diseases caused by excessive accumulation of lipids in the liver with therapeutic agents derived from natural products offering an alternative treatment to conventional therapies. Among these therapeutic agents, apigenin, a natural flavonoid, has been proven to exert various beneficial biological effects. In the present study, the antiadipogenic effects of apigenin in HepG2 cells was investigated. It was demonstrated that the treatment of cells with different concentrations of apigenin for 24 h significantly decreased the -induced increases in total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels as well as intracellular  accumulation. In addition, apigenin increased the phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels but decreased the expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty  synthase, and SREBP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The present findings suggested that apigenin might improve  by activating the AMPK/SREBP pathway to reduce  accumulation in the liver.Copyright: © Lu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30317760>[Comparison of effects of oleic  and  on  deposition and mTOR / S6K1 / SREBP-1c pathway in HepG2 cells].</a></h2><p> To explore the effects of oleic  and  on  deposition and mTOR/S6K1/SREBP-1c pathways in HepG2 cells.  The model of steatosis was established with induction of oleic  and  and was intervened by rapamycin. The changes in  droplets were observed after staining the cells with oil Red O. Intracellular triglyceride (TG) contents in cells were measured by TG kit. mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c mRNA expression levels were detected using QRT-PCR. Western blot was used to determine protein expression levels of mTOR, S6K1 and SREBP-1c.  Both fatty acids increased  droplets in HepG2 cells. Fatty degeneration with elevated TG occurred with significant changes in oleic  group lipids. Rapamycin alleviated  deposition caused by oleic  and  and inhibited their induction of increased expression of mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c. QRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that mRNA and protein expressions of mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c in oleic  and  group were significantly higher than the control group ( < 0.05). The increase was more pronounced in the  group ( < 0.05); however, after rapamycin intervention, the expression of mRNA and protein in the three groups were significantly lower ( < 0.05), and the change in  group was more pronounced ( < 0.05).  Oleic  and  can induce  deposition in HepG2 cells and increase expression of every component of mTOR/S6K1/SREBP-1c pathway; however, Oleic -induced  deposition is more pronounced, and the mTOR, S6K1, and SREBP-1c pathway change is more obvious in . Rapamycin has high potent inhibitory effect on -induced  deposition. These results specify that  synthesis involved in the mTOR/S6K1/SREBP-1c pathways are mainly associated to  in HepG2 cells, whereas other signaling pathway may mediate oleic -induced  synthesis.</p></html>
