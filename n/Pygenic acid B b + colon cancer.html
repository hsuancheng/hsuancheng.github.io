Food intake and growth were unaffected by the dietary treatment. Supplemental dietary vitamin (6) significantly reduced the production of a fecal secondary bile , lithocholic  (the most toxic secondary bile  and a risk factor for  ), and markedly reduced the ratio of lithocholic  to deoxycholic  (a less toxic secondary bile ) in feces (p<0.05). Increasing dietary vitamin (6) increased fecal mucin levels (a marker of intestinal barrier function) in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05) but did not affect fecal immunoglobulin A levels (an index of intestinal immune function). Cecal levels of organic acids were not significantly affected by supplemental dietary vitamin (6). These results suggest the possibility that dietary vitamin (6) affects the colonic luminal environment by altering the production of secondary bile acids and mucins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25173531>Fatty  synthase/oxidized low-density lipoprotein as metabolic oncogenes linking obesity to   via NF-kappa  in Egyptians.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a major health problem which heightens the risk of several chronic illnesses including  development particularly  . The underlying pathophysiology of obesity associated   remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this current study was to determine fatty  synthase (FASN) activity/expression, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) level and redox status under the context of anthropometric measurements and lipid profile to find their potential role as interacting biomarkers relating obesity to   initiation and progression via nuclear factor kappa- (NF-κ) signaling. This study was conducted upon Egyptian individuals; 30 obese subjects with  , 11 nonobese and 11 obese subjects without  . FASN gene expression, NF-κ immunoreactivity, and serum ox-LDL level were estimated by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunoassay, respectively. FASN activity, glycemic status, obesity, and oxidative stress indices were also assessed. It was found that FASN expression and activity were statistically increased in obese with   (P=0.021 and 0.018, respectively), with statistically significant increase in patients with advanced grading. Moreover, NF-κ immunoreactivity and serum ox-LDL level were significantly increased in obese   patients with significantly higher levels in those with advanced grading (all P<0.05). Dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress indices were worsened in obese patients with  . These results revealed that FASN and ox-LDL as well as oxidative stress may increase the risk of obesity related  , particularly via NF-κ signaling and could be used as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers for obesity complicated with  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234211>Inhibition of NF-kappa  augments sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil/folinic  in  .</a></h2><p>5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the most common antimetabolite used for the treatment of colorectal , exerts its cytotoxic effects through the induction of apoptosis. Folinic  potentiates the effect of 5-FU. Drug activity is currently limited as a result of inducible chemoresistance. Limited research suggests that the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa- (NF-kappaB), which has antiapoptotic properties, may play a major role in inducible chemoresistance.SW48   cells were used for all experiments. Cell growth was determined by cell proliferation assay. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring caspase 3 activity. Activation of NF-kappaB was ascertained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, luciferase reporter assay, and Western blot analysis.Treatment with 5-FU (0.001-10 mm), not only inhibited growth and induced apoptosis but significantly activated NF-kappaB in SW48 cells. Folinic  alone (0.01-100 mg/L) did not inhibit growth but improved the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, folinic  alone did not activate NF-kappaB or induce apoptosis but enhanced 5-FU-mediated NF-kappaB activation and cell apoptosis. Transfection with adenovirus IkappaBalpha super-repressor strongly inhibited constitutive activation of NF-kappaB and significantly enhanced 5-FU and 5-FU/Folinic -mediated growth inhibition (P < 0.05).Treatment with 5-FU activates NF-kappaB. Folinic  enhances 5-FU-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Inhibition of NF-kappaB enhances the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU with or without Folinic  in   cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845279>Salvianolic   reverses multidrug resistance in nude mice bearing human   stem cells.</a></h2><p>Salvianolic   (SalB) is a water‑soluble phenolic compound, extractable from Salvia miltiorrhiza, and has previously been demonstrated to reverse tumor multidrug resistance (MDR) in   cells.  stem cells (CSCs) are closely associated with drug resistance. Therefore, establishing a nude mouse model bearing human  CSCs is important for the study of the mechanisms underlying   drug resistance as well as the reversal of drug resistance. The present study aimed to establish a nude mouse model bearing human  CSCs and to investigate the effects of SalB on the drug resistance exhibited by the nude mouse model as well as determine its underlying mechanism. Cells from two   cell lines (LoVo and HCT‑116) were cultured in serum‑free medium to obtain CSCs‑enriched spheroid cells. Following this, nude mice were transplanted with LoVo and HCT‑116  CSCs to establish the CSC nude mouse model, which was subsequently demonstrated to exhibit MDR. The results of the present study revealed that following treatment with SalB, the chemotherapeutic drug resistance of xenografts was reversed to a certain extent. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the expression levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)44, CD133, transcription factor sox‑2 (SOX2) and ATP‑binding cassette sub‑family G member 2 (ABCG2) proteins, and the results demonstrated that treatment with SalB downregulated the expression of CD44, SOX2 and ABCG2 proteins in both LoVo and HCT‑116  CSCs xenografts. In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed that a serum‑free suspension method can be performed to successfully isolate  CSCs. In addition, a nude mice bearing  CSCs animal model was successfully established, and associated tumors were confirmed to exhibit MDR. Furthermore, SalB was demonstrated to successfully reverse MDR in nude mice bearing LoVo and HCT‑116  CSCs, as well as suppress the expression of CD44, SOX2 and ABCG2 proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10847122>[Comparison of fluorouracil + folinic , fluorouracil + levamisole and fluorouracil + folinic  + levamisole in Dukes'  and C  : NSABP Trial C-04].</a></h2><p></p></html>
