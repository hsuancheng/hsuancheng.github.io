Lipoxygenase pathway, catalyzing the first two steps of the transformation of  into leukotrienes is implicated in several processes such as cell differentiation, inflammation and carcinogenesis. Development of drugs that interfere with the formation or effects of these metabolites would be important for the treatment of various diseases like asthma, , ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and blood vessel disorders. Till now, asthma consists of the only pathological case in which improvement has been shown by lipoxygenase LO inhibitors. Thus, the research has been directed towards the development of drugs that interfere with the formation of leukotrienes. In order to explore the anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of antioxidant acrylic/cinnamic acids a series of derivatives bearing the appropriate moieties have been synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation and evaluated for their biological activities. The compounds have shown important antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity and very good inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase while some of them were tested for their anticancer activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31135881>The leukotriene receptors as therapeutic targets of inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes (LTs) are inflammatory mediators derived from . LTs include the di-hydroxy  LT (LTB4) and the cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs; LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), all of which are involved in both acute and chronic inflammation. We and other groups identified a high-affinity LTB4 receptor, BLT1; the LTC4 and LTD4 receptors, CysLT1 and CysLT2; and the LTE4 receptor, GPR99. Pharmacological studies have shown that BLT1 signaling stimulates degranulation, chemotaxis and phagocytosis of neutrophils, whereas CysLT1 and CysLT2 signaling induces airway inflammation by increasing vascular permeability and the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle. Recently, we and other groups suggested that the LTB4-BLT1 axis and the cysteinyl LTs-CysLT1/2 axis are involved in chronic inflammatory diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis, , atherosclerosis, arthritis, obesity, cancer and age-related macular degeneration using animal models for disease and gene knockout mice. This review describes the classical and novel functions of LTs and their receptors in several inflammatory diseases and discusses the potential clinical applications of antagonists for LT receptors and inhibitors of LT biosynthesis.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019.

Almost all of them present a number of unwanted, often serious, side effects as a consequence of interference with the  cascade. In search for new drugs to avoid side effects, while maintaining high potency over inflammation, scientists turned their interest to the synthesis of dual COX/LOX inhibitors, which could provide numerous therapeutic advantages in terms of anti-inflammatory activity, improved gastric protection and safer cardiovascular profile compared to conventional NSAIDs. Τhiazole and thiazolidinone moieties can be found in numerous biologically active compounds of natural origin, as well as synthetic molecules that possess a wide range of pharmacological activities. This review focuses on the biological activity of several thiazole and thiazolidinone derivatives as COX-1/COX-2 and LOX inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624122>Docking, steered molecular dynamics, and QSAR studies as strategies for studying isoflavonoids as 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenases (LOX) are enzymes that catalyze polyunsaturated fatty  peroxidation and have a non-heme iron atom located in their active site. They are implicated in the  pathway and involved in inflammation, fever, pain production, and in the origins of several diseases such as cancer, asthma, and . The search for inhibitors of these enzymes has emerged in the last years, and isoflavonoids have a broad spectrum of biological activity with low cytotoxicity. Our previous results have shown that isoflavonoids inhibited different LOX isoforms in vitro. For this reason, we studied the most important interactions that govern the potency and selectivity of some isoflavones and isoflavans toward different LOX isoforms using computational methods. The docking results have shown that all the molecules can be located in different zones in the LOX active site. Steered molecular dynamics indicated that selectivity was present at the cavity entry, but not at its exit. We also observed the correlation between the potential mean force and the best (HIR-303) and worst inhibitors (IR-213) in 5-LOX. Finally, structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies showed a good correlation between theoretical IC values and experimental data for 5-LOX and 12-LOX with 96 and 95%, respectively, and a lower correlation for 15-LOX (79%). Conclusively, pharmacophore analysis showed that our proposed molecules should possess a donor-acceptor and aromatic centers to encourage interactions in the active site.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24975552>Lack of association of ALOX12 and ALOX15B polymorphisms with  despite altered urinary excretion of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic .</a></h2><p>Pro- and anti-inflammatory metabolites of  - eicosanoids - participate in skin homeostasis, affecting the growth and differentiation of keratinocytes. Alterations of 12-lipoxygenase (LOX) and 15-LOX and their metabolites have been described in the epidermis of patients with , but systemic production of 12-LOX and 15-LOX eicosanoids has not been studied in the disease.To ascertain the frequencies of the genetic variants ALOX12 rs1126667 and ALOX15 rs11568070 in cases and controls, and to compare urinary metabolites of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE) between patients with  and healthy controls.Patients with  (n = 200) were stratified depending on the severity of their dermal lesions. Genotyping was performed using a 5'-nuclease real-time assay. The concentrations of 12(S)-HETE, its metabolites and 15(S)-HETE were determined in urine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Tetranor-12(S)-HETE metabolite excretion was significantly higher in urine of patients with , while excretion of 12(S)-HETE was decreased. Neither 12(S)-HETE nor tetranor-12(S)-HETE correlated with the type of disease or severity score. No difference in urinary 15(S)-HETE was found between the study groups. Genotype distribution of the ALOX12 rs1126667 or ALOX15 rs11568070 polymorphisms did not discriminate for the disease or its severity.Systemic metabolism of 12(S)-HETE is accelerated in  because excretion of the tetranor-12(S)-HETE inactivation product is elevated. No correlation with the severity or extent of  is detectable. We propose that in patients with , 12(S)-HETE to tetranor-12(S)-HETE conversion could be at least a marker for this disease, in which inflammation of the skin can induce microsomal beta-oxidation of this eicosanoid.© 2014 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31115022>Identification of  vulgaris biomarkers in human plasma by non-targeted metabolomics based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the endogenous metabolites of patients with  vulgaris which will be helpful for the diagnosis of the disease and to provide the evidence of pathogenesis and the formulation for the individualized dosage regimen.This study investigated the plasma metabolomic profiling between the  vulgaris patients (N=12) and the healthy volunteers (N=12) using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) metabolomic techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to identify and visualize the metabolic data clusters.A total of 22 differential metabolites contributing to the clusters were identified, among which the levels of threonine (p<0.001), leucine (p<0.001), phenylalanine (p<0.001), tryptophan (p=0.018), palmitamide (p<0.001), Linoleic amide (p<0.001), oleamide (p<0.001), stearamide (p<0.001), cis-11- eicosenamide (p< 0.001), trans-13-Docosenamide (p<0.001), uric  (p=0.034), LysoPC (16:0) (p<0.001), LysoPC (18:3) (p<0.001), LysoPC (18:2) (p=0.024), LysoPC (18:1) (P=0.012) and LysoPC (18:0) (p=0.002) were significantly higher in the plasma of  vulgaris patients compared with the healthy controls, whereas oleic  (p<0.001),  (p<0.001) and N-linoleoyl taurine (p<0.001) were significantly lower. These biomarkers are related to glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino  metabolism, nucleic  metabolism and so on.The data suggest that  vulgaris patients may have disrupted lipid and amino  metabolism, as well as inflammation and functional lesions in the liver and kidney.

An untargeted high-throughput metabonomics method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was applied to study the serum metabolic changes in  vulgaris patients, and to discover serum potential biomarkers for identification, diagnosis and exploring pathogenesis of . The serum metabolic profiles from 150 subjects (75  patients and 75 healthy controls) were acquired, the raw spectrometric data were processed by multivariate statistical analysis, and 44 potential biomarkers were screened out and identified. The potential biomarkers were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism,  metabolism, bile  biosynthesis, indicated the pathogenesis of  may be related to the disturbed metabolic pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454560>Bioactive Lipid Mediator Profiles in Human  Skin and Blood.</a></h2><p> is a chronic immune-mediated disease that represents a unique model for investigating inflammation at local and systemic levels. Bioactive lipid mediators (LMs) are potent compounds reported to play a role in the development and resolution of inflammation. Currently, it is not known to what extent these LMs are involved in  pathophysiology and related metabolic dysfunction. Here, we use targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approaches to quantify LMs in skin and peripheral blood from  patients and compared them with those of healthy individuals. Lesional  skin was abundant in  metabolites, as 8-, 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic , compared with adjacent nonlesional and skin from healthy individuals. Additionally, a linoleic -derived LM, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic , was significantly increased compared with healthy skin (607.9 ng/g vs. 5.4 ng/g, P = 0.001). These  skin differences were accompanied by plasma decreases in antioxidant markers, including glutathione, and impaired lipolysis characterized by lower concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids. In conclusion, our study shows that  skin and blood have disease-specific phenotype profiles of bioactive LMs represented by omega-6 fatty -oxidized derivatives. These findings provide insights into  pathophysiology that could potentially contribute to new biomarkers and therapeutics.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Some plants belonging to the genus  L. are characterized by biological activity. Therefore, studies were conducted to determine the dependence of biological activity on the chemical composition of various parts of the evening primrose, mainly leaves, stems, and seeds. Common components of all parts of the  plants are fatty acids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. In contrast, primrose seeds also contain proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Therefore, it is believed that the most interesting sources of biologically active compounds are the seeds and, above all, evening primrose seed oil. This oil contains mainly aliphatic alcohols, fatty acids, sterols, and polyphenols. Evening primrose oil (EPO) is extremely high in linoleic  (LA) (70⁻74%) and γ-linolenic  (GLA) (8⁻10%), which may contribute to the proper functioning of human tissues because they are precursors of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. EPO supplementation results in an increase in plasma levels of γ-linolenic  and its metabolite dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA). This compound is oxidized by lipoxygenase (15-LOX) to 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic  (15-HETrE) or, under the influence of cyclooxygenase (COX), DGLA is metabolized to series 1 prostaglandins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties. Furthermore, 15-HETrE blocks the conversion of  (AA) to leukotriene A₄ (LTA₄) by direct inhibition of 5-LOX. In addition, γ-linolenic  suppresses inflammation mediators such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cytokine - tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The beneficial effects of EPO have been demonstrated in the case of atopic dermatitis, , Sjögren's syndrome, asthma, and anti-cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648709>INHIBITORS OF LEUKOTRIENES SYNTHESIS: NOVEL AGENTS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes (LTs) belong to pro-inflammatory mediators that are biosynthesized from  (AA), inter alia, by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme in association with 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP). An activation of LTs synthesis pathway occurs during the development and maintenance of numerous diseases such as asthma, anaphylactic shock, allergic rhinitis, , rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, as well as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and certain types of cancer. The main goal of this review was to present recent advances on the new compounds influencing the LOX pathway, which are under-going clinical studies. The mechanisms of action and possible implementations of these molecules in a treatment of asthma, cancer and cardiovascular diseases are discussed.</p></html>
