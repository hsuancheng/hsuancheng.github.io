Several members have been implicated in neuronal development, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. We previously observed that mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of the ZDHHC5 gene are impaired in context-dependent learning and memory. To identify potentially relevant protein substrates of DHHC5, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of stable isotope-labeled neuronal stem cell cultures from forebrains of normal and DHHC5-GT (gene-trapped) mice using the bioorthogonal palmitate analog . We identified ∼300 -modified and hydroxylamine-sensitive proteins, of which a subset was decreased in abundance in DHHC5-GT cells. Palmitoylation and oligomerization of one of these proteins (flotillin-2) was abolished in DHHC5-GT neuronal stem cells. In COS-1 cells, overexpression of DHHC5 markedly stimulated the palmitoylation of flotillin-2, strongly suggesting a direct enzyme-substrate relationship. Serendipitously, we found that down-regulation of DHHC5 was triggered within minutes following growth factor withdrawal from normal neural stem cells, a maneuver that is used to induce neural differentiation in culture. The effect was reversible for up to 4 h, and degradation was partially prevented by inhibitors of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. These findings suggest that protein palmitoylation can be regulated through changes in DHHC PAT levels in response to differentiation signals.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21839852> improves contractile response to angiotensin II by releasing vasocontrictor prostaglandins.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the role of CYP-enzymes in the modulation of vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II in rabbit aortae. In arteries with the endothelium-intact (E+) the CYP-inhibitor,  (17 ODYA), increased the efficacy to angiotensin II (17-ODYA-effect) as well as simultaneous incubation with miconazole (epoxygenase-inhibitor) and CAY 10434 (ω-hydroxylase-inhibitor). The removal of endothelium (E-) caused potentiation of the 17 ODYA-effect. Therefore, endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms would be involved. 17-ODYA and miconazole reduced Ach-relaxation. Indomethacin blocked the 17-ODYA-effect in E+ and E- arteries but blunted the response to angiotensin II only in E+ arteries. NS 398 (cyclooxygenase-2-inhibitor) blocked the 17-ODYA-effect and reduced angiotensin II affinity as well as SQ 29548 (thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptor-inhibitor). In E- arteries, CAY 10434 enhanced angiotensin II response as well as 17-ODYA. SC 560 (cyclooxygenase-1-inhibitor) and NS 398 partially blocked the 17-ODYA-effect. In conclusion, 17-ODYA induced endothelial dysfunction by inhibiting CYP-epoxygenase and thus improves vasoconstrictor cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites release acting through TP receptors. The endothelium-independent mechanism of 17-ODYA-effect may involve increase of vasoconstrictor cyclooxygenase-metabolites induced by prostaglandin-ω-hydroxylase-inhibition.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Since its implication in inflammatory diseases is well recognized, many tools to regulate its biosynthesis have been developed and showed promising results in vitro and in vivo, but mixed results in clinical trials. Recently, the mTOR pathway component p70S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) has been linked to LTC4 synthase and the biosynthesis of cysteinyl-leukotrienes. In this respect, we investigated if p70S6K1 could also play a role in LTB4 biosynthesis. We thus evaluated the impact of the p70S6K1 inhibitors PF-4708671 and LY2584702 on LTB4 biosynthesis in human neutrophils. At a concentration of 10 μM, both compounds inhibited S6 phosphorylation, although neither one inhibited the thapsigargin-induced LTB4 biosynthesis, as assessed by the sum of LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, and 20-COOH-LTB4. However, PF-4708671, but not LY2584702, inhibited the ω-oxidation of LTB4 into 20-OH-LTB4 by intact neutrophils and by recombinant CYP4F3A, leading to increased LTB4 levels. This was true for both endogenously biosynthesized and exogenously added LTB4. In contrast to that of , the inhibitory effect of PF-4708671 was easily removed by washing the neutrophils, indicating that PF-4708671 was a reversible CYP4F3A inhibitor. At optimal concentration, PF-4708671 increased the half-life of LTB4 in our neutrophil suspensions by 7.5 fold, compared to 5 fold for . Finally, Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots indicate that PF-4708671 is a mixed inhibitor of CYP4F3A. In conclusion, we show that PF-4708671 inhibits CYP4F3A and prevents the ω-oxidation of LTB4 in cellulo, which might result in increased LTB4 levels in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29733200>Temporal Profiling Establishes a Dynamic S-Palmitoylation Cycle.</a></h2><p>S-palmitoylation is required for membrane anchoring, proper trafficking, and the normal function of hundreds of integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Previous bioorthogonal pulse-chase proteomics analyses identified Ras family GTPases, polarity proteins, and G proteins as rapidly cycling S-palmitoylated proteins sensitive to depalmitoylase inhibition, yet the breadth of enzyme regulated dynamic S-palmitoylation largely remains a mystery. Here, we present a pulsed bioorthogonal S-palmitoylation assay for temporal analysis of S-palmitoylation dynamics. Low concentration hexadecylfluorophosphonate (HDFP) inactivates the APT and ABHD17 families of depalmitoylases, which dramatically increases alkynyl-fatty acid labeling and stratifies S-palmitoylated proteins into kinetically distinct subgroups. Most surprisingly, HDFP treatment does not affect steady-state S-palmitoylation levels, despite inhibiting all validated depalmitoylating enzymes. S-palmitoylation profiling of APT1/APT2 mouse brains similarly show no change in S-palmitoylation levels. In comparison with hydroxylamine-switch methods, bioorthogonal alkynyl fatty acids are only incorporated into a small fraction of dynamic S-palmitoylated proteins, raising the possibility that S-palmitoylation is more stable than generally characterized. Overall, disrupting depalmitoylase activity enhances alkynyl fatty acid incorporation, but does not greatly affect steady state S-palmitoylation across the proteome.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21361680>-cell interactions in human monocytes investigated by doubly-resonant coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy.</a></h2><p>We demonstrate that doubly-resonant coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering can provide enhanced and highly specific contrast for molecules containing unique Raman-active small molecular groups. This combination provides contrast for molecules that can otherwise be difficult to discriminate by Raman spectroscopy. Here, human monocytes were incubated with either deuterated oleic acid or  (a fatty acid with an end terminal acetylene group). The carbon-deuterium stretching vibration of the deuterated fatty acid, as well as the unique alkyne stretching vibration of the alkyne-containing fatty acid, were used to provide contrast for these exogenous free fatty acids. The combination of these unique modes with the common aliphatic carbon-hydrogen stretching vibration inherent to all fatty acid allowed for doubly-resonant detection of these unique molecules and enabled us to detect the presence of these lipids in areas within a cell where each molecular resonance by itself did not generate sufficient signal.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615937>Proteomic analysis of S-acylated proteins in human B cells reveals palmitoylation of the immune regulators CD20 and CD23.</a></h2><p>S-palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification important for controlling the membrane targeting and function of numerous membrane proteins with diverse roles in signalling, scaffolding, and trafficking. We sought to identify novel palmitoylated proteins in B lymphocytes using acyl-biotin exchange chemistry, coupled with differential analysis by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In total, we identified 57 novel palmitoylated protein candidates from human EBV-transformed lymphoid cells. Two of them, namely CD20 and CD23 (low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor), are immune regulators that are effective/potential therapeutic targets for haematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases and allergic disorders. Palmitoylation of CD20 and CD23 was confirmed by heterologous expression of alanine mutants coupled with bioorthogonal metabolic labeling. This study demonstrates a new subset of palmitoylated proteins in B cells, illustrating the ubiquitous role of protein palmitoylation in immune regulation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058703>Role of S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 for the interaction with FKBP11 in osteoblast cells.</a></h2><p>Recently, one of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins, IFITM3, has become an important target for the activity against influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. In this study, we investigated the role played by S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in its interaction with FKBP11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression. Our investigations using an established reporter,  (17-ODYA), and an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), revealed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in addition to IFITM3. Specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the TM1 domain and in the CP loop were S-palmitoylated in IFITM5. Then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was inhibited in the presence of 2BP. The mutant lacking the S-palmitoylation site in the TM1 domain lost the interaction with FKBP11. These results indicate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the interaction with FKBP11. Finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP, because IFITM5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. The experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule. This also indicated that the S-palmitoylation contributes to bone formation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22056678>Global profiling of dynamic protein palmitoylation.</a></h2><p>The reversible thioester linkage of palmitic acid on cysteines, known as protein S-palmitoylation, facilitates the membrane association and proper subcellular localization of proteins. Here we report the metabolic incorporation of the palmitic acid analog  (17-ODYA) in combination with stable-isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and pulse-chase methods to generate a global quantitative map of dynamic protein palmitoylation events in cells. We distinguished stably palmitoylated proteins from those that turn over rapidly. Treatment with a serine lipase-selective inhibitor identified a pool of dynamically palmitoylated proteins regulated by palmitoyl-protein thioesterases. This subset was enriched in oncoproteins and other proteins linked to aberrant cell growth, migration and cancer. Our method provides a straightforward way to characterize global palmitoylation dynamics in cells and confirms enzyme-mediated depalmitoylation as a critical regulatory mechanism for a specific subset of rapidly cycling palmitoylated proteins.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17612649>Vascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetic TallyHo mice: role for an increase in the contribution of PGH2/TxA2 receptor activation and cytochrome p450 products.</a></h2><p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that spontaneously diabetic TallyHo (TH) mice, a novel polygenic model for type 2 diabetes, will exhibit endothelial dysfunction associated with an increased contribution from endothelium-derived contractile factors (EDCF). The cellular mechanisms underlying the increased contribution of EDCF were explored in 16 and 30-week-old male TH and age-matched male C57BL/6J mice (n=4-9). Blood glucose and serum  profiles were markedly increased in the TH mice. Superoxide generation, assessed with a lucigenin chemiluminescence assay, was markedly increased in the aortae of TH mice. Endothelium-dependent vascular relaxations and contractions to acetylcholine (ACh), but not endothelium-independent relaxations to sodium nitroprusside, were impaired and vascular contractions to phenylephrine were significantly enhanced in aortae from TH mice. Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester markedly increased the ACh-induced contractions in TH mice, whereas SQ29548, a thromboxane receptor antagonist, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors  and sulfaphenazole, the latter being specific for CYP2C6 and 2C9, decreased and (or) normalized the contractile response to ACh in TH mice. The present study indicates that enhanced contribution of prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor and CYP, likely CYP2C6 and 2C9, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of increased EDCF in the aortae of type 2 diabetic TH mice.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28565971>Monodora myristica (African nutmeg) modulates redox homeostasis and alters functional chemistry in sickled erythrocytes.</a></h2><p>The antioxidative effect of Monodora myristica seed acetone extract and its effect on chemical functional groups were investigated in sickled erythrocytes as well as molecular modeling of the antisickling potentials of its secondary metabolites. The extract was subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the compounds present, which were then docked into the allosteric-binding site of deoxy-hemoglobin. The extract was incubated with sickled erythrocytes at 37°C for 6, 12, and 24 h and were subjected to antioxidative analysis for reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Chemical functional group of the treated cells was analyzed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The predominant compounds identified were ; oleic acid, androstan-3-one, 17-hydroxy-2-methyl- (2.beta.,5.beta.,17.beta.)-; estran-3-one, 17-(acetyloxy)-2-methyl-, (2.alpha., 5.alpha., 17.beta.), and (+)-3-carene, 10-(acetylmethyl)-. They all fitted well within the active site of Hb with good binding affinity, as evidenced by the negative CDocker interaction energies of their complexes ranging between -54.4 and -26.7 kcal/mol. Treatment with the extract exacerbated SOD and catalase activities as well as GSH level, while LPO was suppressed. This antioxidative activity was time and/or dose dependent, with 6 and 12 h incubation showing the optimum activity. FTIR analysis of the treated cells showed the presence of hydrophobic functional groups. The synergetic molecular interaction of the major compounds of the extract with the α-dimer of Hb depicts an antisickling effect of M. myristica acetone extract.

C22:0 and 22-hydroxy-docosanoic acid (omega-hydroxy-C22:0) were used as substrates, and the reaction products were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, omega-oxidation of C22:0 produced not only the hydroxylated product, omega-hydroxy-C22:0, but also the dicarboxylic acid of C22:0, docosanedioic acid (C22:0-DCA). When rat liver microsomes were incubated with omega-hydroxy-C22:0 in the presence of either NAD+ or NADPH, C22:0-DCA was formed readily. Formation of C22:0-DCA from either C22:0 or omega-hydroxy-C22:0 with NADPH as cofactor was inhibited strongly by miconazole and disulfiram, whereas no inhibition was found with NAD+ as cofactor. Furthermore, omega-oxidation of C22:0 was reduced significantly when molecular oxygen was depleted. The high sensitivity toward the more specific cytochrome P450 inhibitors ketoconazole and  suggests that hydroxylation of C22:0 and omega-hydroxy-C22:0 may be catalyzed by one or more cytochrome P450 hydroxylases belonging to the CYP4A and/or CYP4F subfamily. This study demonstrates that C22:0 is a substrate for the omega-oxidation system in rat liver microsomes and that the product of the first hydroxylation step, omega-hydroxy-C22:0, may undergo further oxidation via two distinct pathways driven by NAD+ or NADPH.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9186856>Cytochrome P450-derived renal HETEs: storage and release.</a></h2><p>We have established an assay based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to profile and quantitate endogenous cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) exiting the isolated perfused rabbit kidney in response to hormonal stimulation. In response to angiotensin II (Ang II) P450-derived HETEs (16-, 17-, 18-, 19- and 20-) are released from the isolated Kreb's perfused rabbit kidney. Ang II produced a several-fold increase in the levels of P450-HETEs above basal levels in both urinary (such as for 20-HETE from 0.93 +/- 0.7 to 2.31 +/- 0.9 ng/min) and venous (from 0.1 +/- 0.05 to 0.3 +/- 0.05 ng/min) effluents. However, inhibition of P450, which reduced basal release, did not prevent Ang II-induced release of P450-AA products from the rabbit kidney; for example, urinary 20-HETE in the presence of 17-ODYA (1 microM) was undetectable and increased to 0.93 +/- 0.4 ng/min with Ang II and venous 20-HETE increased from 0.06 +/- 0.03 to 0.24 +/- 0.07 ng/min. Similar results were obtained with clotrimazole (1 microM). As 16-, 18-, 19- and 20-HETEs are vasodilators in the rabbit kidney and 16- and 17-HETEs inhibit proximal tubular ATPase activity, we investigated their possible sites of esterification. Cortical and medullary lipids were extracted, separated by HPLC and P450-HETEs quantitated following alkaline hydrolysis. The P450-HETEs were incorporated into both neutral lipids (NL) and phospholipids [phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)]. However, the assignment of a HETE to a specific phospholipid pool must be regarded as tentative as the appropriate standards containing P450-HETEs in the Sn-2 position (such as 20-HETE-PF., 20-HETE-PC, etc.) were not available. Esterified HETEs were found in larger quantities in the cortex as compared to the medulla (34.40 +/- 1.12 versus 22.76 +/- 0.53 ng/g). The PI fraction in the cortex yielded the largest quantity of HETEs and the PC fraction the lowest. In the medulla, the largest quantities of esterified HETEs were found in neutral lipids and only slightly lesser amounts in PE and PI. Esterified 18-HETE was localized only to the NI fraction. This fraction also contained the other HETEs, 19- and 20-HETE being the most abundant. Notably only 16- and 17-HETE were present in PF, whereas, 19- and 20-HETE were also present in PI, PS and PC. Thus, P450-HETEs, like EETs are stored in the kidney and are, presumably, subject to release by peptide activation of acylhydrolases.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7561014>Role of changes in renal hemodynamics and P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid in the reversal of one-kidney, one clip hypertension.</a></h2><p>To examine the role of changes in renal hemodynamics and P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid in the reversal of one-kidney, one clip (1-K,1C) hypertension in rats.The stimulus for the release of an antihypertensive  from the kidney is not known.

The renal  of arachidonic acid in control and in 1-K,1C hypertensive rats was assessed by incubating microsomes with [14C]-arachidonic acid, the metabolites formed being measured using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The antihypertensive effects of these P-450 metabolites of arachidonic acid were compared with those of medullipin I after intravenous administration in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).Cortical and papillary blood flow increased significantly and arterial pressure fell after unclipping the renal artery in the 1-K,1C hypertensive rats. 17-ODYA prevented the fall in blood pressure after unclipping. The production of epoxy- and dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids was elevated in microsomes prepared from the renal cortex of the 1-K,1C hypertensive rats. However, intravenous administration of these metabolites did not mimic the effect of medullipin I to lower arterial pressure in SHR.Elevations in renal cortical or papillary blood flow, or both, may stimulate the release of a P-450-derived antihypertensive  from the kidney after unclipping of the renal artery in 1-K,1C hypertensive rats.

To date, our knowledge of the post-translational modification of PMP22 is limited. Using the CSS-Palm 2.0 software we predicted that C85 (cysteine 85), a highly conserved amino acid located between the second and third transmembrane domains, is a potential site for palmitoylation. To test this, we mutated C85S (C85 to serine) and established stable cells lines expressing the WT (wild-type) or the C85S-PMP22. In Schwann and MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells mutating C85 blocked the palmitoylation of PMP22, which we monitored using 17-ODYA (). While palmitoylation was not necessary for processing the newly synthesized PMP22 through the secretory pathway, overexpression of C85S-PMP22 led to pronounced cell spreading and uneven monolayer thinning. To further investigate the functional significance of palmitoylated PMP22, we evaluated MDCK cell migration in a wound-healing assay. While WT-PMP22 expressing cells were resistant to migration, C85S cells displayed lamellipodial protrusions and migrated at a similar rate to vector control.

Our results show that 3T6 fibroblasts synthesized hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) such as 12-HETE through the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) pathway. However, 3T6 fibroblasts did not produce leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), and lipoxygenase inhibitors and LT antagonists failed to inhibit 3T6 fibroblast growth induced by FBS.

The impairment of DNA synthesis and 3T6 fibroblast growth induced by SKF-525A were reversed by exogenous addition of HETEs. Moreover, we report that 5-HETE, 12(S)-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE are mitogenic on 3T6 fibroblast in the absence of another growth factor, and this effect was dependent on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway.
