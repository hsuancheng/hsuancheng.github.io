Several models have been postulated for the initiation of this UVB-induced immune suppression and, although the complete mechanism is unclear, our early studies suggested that initiation is via the activation of a photoreceptor in the skin, identified as  (UCA). Recent preliminary data from our laboratory and others indicated that UVA (320-400 nm)-emitting broad-band sunlamps can also isomerize UCA but may not lead to immune suppression, in contrast to UVB-emitting sunlamps, which cause both effects. Although the reason for this inconsistency is unknown, the emission spectra of UVA lamps contain differing amounts of UVB, UVA-I (340-400 nm) and UVA-II (320-340 nm) from those of UVB sources. In this study we determined a detailed dose-response for the isomerization of UCA in mouse skin using the UVA-I, UVA-II and UVA-I+II wavelength ranges. The dose-response curves obtained were put on an equal  basis by quantum correction and the possibility of wavelength interaction for this effect investigated. A simple additive wavelength interaction between UVA-I, UVA-II, and UVA-I+II was observed for trans-UCA photoisomerization. This result indicates that the failure of UVA-I, UVA-II or UVA-I+II radiation to induce immune suppression of the CHS response in an animal model is not due to complex wavelength interactions and/or the presence of an in vivo endogenous photosensitizer of UCA isomerization. Other factors, such as downstream blocking by UVA of the cis-UCA generated signal, may be involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21523270>Microwave discharge electrodeless lamps (MDEL). Part VII. Photo-isomerization of trans- in aqueous media driven by UV light from a novel Hg-free Dewar-like microwave discharge thermally-insulated electrodeless lamp (MDTIEL). Performance evaluation.</a></h2><p>A novel mercury-free Dewar-like (double-walled structure) microwave discharge thermally-insulated electrodeless lamp (MDTIEL) was fabricated and its performance evaluated using the photo-isomerization of trans- (trans-UA) in aqueous media as a test process driven by the emitted UV light when ignited with microwave radiation. The photo-isomerization processes trans-UA → cis-UA and cis-UA → trans-UA were re-visited using light emitted from a conventional high-pressure Hg light source and examined for the influence of UV light irradiance and solution temperature; the temperature dependence of the trans → cis process displayed a negative activation energy, E(a) = -1.3 cal mol(-1). To control the photo-isomerization of  from the heat usually dissipated by a microwave discharge electrodeless lamp (single-walled MDEL), it was necessary to suppress the microwave-initiated heat. For comparison, the gas-fill in the MDEL lamp, which typically consists of a mixture of Hg and Ar, was changed to the more eco-friendly N(2) gas in the novel MDTIEL device. The dynamics of the photo-isomerization of  driven by the UV wavelengths of the N(2)-MDTIEL light source were compared to those from the more conventional single-walled N(2)-MDEL and Hg/Ar-MDEL light sources, and with those from the Hg lamp used to irradiate, via a fiber optic, the photoreactor located in the wave-guide of the microwave apparatus. The heating efficiency of a solution with the double-walled N(2)-MDTIEL was compared to the efficiency from the single-walled N(2)-MDEL device. Advantages of N(2)-MDTIEL are described from a comparison of the dynamics of the trans-UA → cis-UA process on the basis of unit surface area of the lamp and unit power consumption. The considerably lower temperature on the external surface of the N(2)-MDTIEL light source should make it attractive in carrying out photochemical reactions that may be heat-sensitive such as the photothermochromic  system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18359241>Theoretical investigation of the photosensitization mechanisms of .</a></h2><p>The photosensitization mechanisms of  (UA), the main skin chromophores of ultraviolet (UV) light, are investigated by means of theoretical calculations. The results indicate that the direct photooxidative damage to DNA bases by triplet state UA through electron transfer reaction is not favorable on thermodynamic grounds. However, UA can photogenerate various reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g., (1)O(2), O(2)(-)) theoretically and the ROS-generating mechanisms are illustrated as follows. Firstly, the (1)O(2)-generating pathway involves direct  transfer between triplet state UA and (3)O(2). Secondly, UA gives birth to O(2)(-) through two pathways: (i) direct electron transfer between triplet state UA and (3)O(2); (ii) electron transfer between anion radical of UA (generated through autoionization reactions) and (3)O(2).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26398811>Confocal Raman spectroscopy: In vivo biochemical changes in the human skin by topical formulations under UV radiation.</a></h2><p>A new approach to the study of the effects on human skin of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and gadusol (Gad) incorporated in polymer gel is proposed in this work. The depth profile and photoprotector effects of Pluronic F127® gels containing each of the natural actives were evaluated by in vivo confocal Raman spectroscopy aiming at the analysis of the biochemical changes on human skin. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that the data corresponding to different depths of the skin, from surface to 4 μm, and from 6 to 16 μm, remained in the same cluster. In vivo Raman spectra, classified into five different layers of epidermis according to their similarities, indicated that the amount of Gad gel increased by about 26% in the outermost layer of the stratum corneum (SC) and that MAAs gel at 2 μm depth was 103.4% higher than in the outermost layer of the SC. Variations in the SC of  at 1490-1515 cm(-1) and 1652 cm(-1) and histidine at 1318 cm(-1) were calculated, before and after UV exposure with or without gels. With the application of gels the vibrational modes that correspond to lipids in trans conformation (1063 and 1128 cm(-1)) increased with respect to normal skin, whereas gauche conformation (1085 cm(-1)) disappeared. Our studies suggest that gels protected the skin against the stress of the natural defense mechanism caused by high levels of UV exposure.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the process of examining the mechanism by which alpha-ketobutyrate serves in this capacity, various thermodynamic parameters and temperature effects on urocanate hydratase activity were determined. As the equilibrium constant at 15 degrees C for imidazooone propionate formation from urocanate is approximately 69, regardless of whether  or chemically synthesized imidazolone propionate is used as the initial substrate, it is concluded that the reaction is freely reversible. DeltaG degrees ', deltaH degrees ' and deltaS degrees ' were --2.5 kcal/mole, +5.2 kcal/mole and +26 cal/deg mole, respectively. Measurement of first-order reaction rates at various temperatures, in order to calculate the Arrhenius activation energy, showed a sharp break in the Arrhenius plot at 29 degrees C. Further examination of this phenomenon by determining s20,w values of urocanate hydratase as a function of temperature revealed a dramatic change at 31 degrees C. Since the enzyme in both experiments reverts to its original state when the temperature is lowered back below the transition point, it is proposed that urocanate hydratase undergoes a reversible conformational change or partial dissociation which affects its catalytic properties in the range of 29--31 degrees C.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11456631>Electronic spectroscopy and photoisomerization of trans- in a supersonic jet.</a></h2><p>trans- (trans-UA), a component of the epidermal layer of skin, exhibits wavelength-dependent photochemistry. The quantum efficiency of isomerization to cis-UA is greatest when the molecule is excited on the long wavelength tail of its absorption profile in solution (300-320 nm). However, exciting the molecule where it absorbs UV light most efficiently (260-285 nm) causes almost no isomerization. We have used fluorescence excitation and dispersed emission methods in a supersonic jet to investigate the electronic states involved in this complex and interesting photochemistry. Three distinct regions are present in the excitation spectrum. Region I, which is below the isomerization barrier, contains sharp, well-resolved peaks that upon excitation emit from the S(1) state of trans-UA. Region II exhibits peaks that increase in broadness and decrease in intensity with increasing excitation . Upon excitation these peaks produce dual emission from the S(1) states of both trans- and cis-UA. The trans to cis isomerization barrier is estimated to be 1400 cm(-1). Region III exhibits excitation to the S(2) electronic state and has a broad structure that spans 3000 cm(-1) and occurs 4000 cm(-1) above S(1). S(2) excitation results in essentially no trans to cis isomerization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11129077>Determination of histidine and  isomers in the human skin by high-performance capillary electrophoresis.</a></h2><p>Histidine was baseline separated from histamine, 1-methylhistamine and cis- and trans- using high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) on a fused-silica column (50 cm x 75 microm) with 0.05 M NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 5.0, and 12 kV. The detection limit of histidine, trans- and cis- was 10(-6) M at a wavelength of 214 nm. The detection limit of the  isomers was slightly enhanced to 5 x 10(-7) M at 267 nm. The transformation of the trans- standard in vitro into the cis-isomer was dependent on the time of exposure and the  of the light source. UVB light induced a significantly faster conversion than UVA light. The HPCE method was used for the characterization and measurement of histidine and  in human skin eluates. The concentrations of histidine, trans- or cis- in ethanol washes from the skin of healthy, non-allergic volunteers were 2.22+/-0.40 x 10(-5) 0.96+/-0.26 x 10(-5) and 1.04+/-0.30 x 10(-5) M, respectively, (mean+/-SEM, n=8).

Correlation coefficients of r2=0.981, r2=0.814 and r2=0.956 were found for histidine, trans- and cis-, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20361345> as an efficient hydroxyl radical scavenger: a quantum theoretical study.</a></h2><p>The photoisomerization of  (UCA)--which is present in human skin epidermis, where it acts as a sunscreen--from its trans isomer to its cis isomer upon exposure to UV-B radiation is known to cause immunosuppression. In recent years, the antioxidant properties of UCA (it acts as a hydroxyl radical scavenger) have also been recognized. In view of this, the mechanisms of stepwise reactions of trans-UCA with up to four hydroxyl radicals were investigated. The molecular geometries of the different species and complexes involved in the reactions (reactant, intermediate and product complexes, as well as transition states) were optimized via density functional theory in the gas phase. Solvation in aqueous media was treated with single point  calculations using DFT and the polarizable continuum model. Single point  calculations in the gas phase and aqueous media were also carried out using second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). The AUG-cc-pVDZ basis set was employed in all calculations. Corrections for basis set superposition error (BSSE) were applied. Vibrational frequency analysis was performed for each optimized structure to ensure the validity of the optimized transition states. It was found that the binding of the first OH· radical to UCA involves a positive  barrier, while subsequent reactions of OH· radicals are exergonic. Transition states were successfully located, even in those cases where the barrier energies were found to be negative. The cis-trans isomerization barrier  of UCA and that of the first OH· radical addition to UCA are comparable, meaning that both processes can occur simultaneously. It was found that UCA could serve as an antioxidant in the form of an efficient OH· radical scavenger.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9757593>The potential role for  and sunlight in the immune suppression associated with protein malnutrition.</a></h2><p>Irradiation of skin by sunlight or ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320 nm) brings about a downregulation of cell-mediated immunity. An action spectrum for photoimmune suppression in mice indicates that trans- absorbs UV photons and is isomerized to the cis-isomer in the stratum corneum. Cis- is subsequently shown to suppress cellular immunity in mice. When histidine is elevated in a mouse diet, a higher level of  is detected in mouse skin. These mice are more susceptible to photoimmune suppression. There is evidence that humans and animals experiencing protein malnutrition have very high levels of  and/or histidine.  is formed by deamination of histidine in one enzymatic step. We discuss the protein malnutrition of kwashiorkor patients. They experience suppressed immunity and disturbed histidine metabolism. Here, we present a testable hypothesis: one cause of the immune deficiency observed in humans with protein malnutrition is the photoconversion by UVB of increased levels of trans- in skin to cis-, which suppresses the cellular immune system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397532>Photochemical mechanisms of radiationless deactivation processes in .</a></h2><p> is a UV filter found in human skin that protects the skin from UV damage but has also been linked to the onset of skin cancer and to photoimmunosuppression. We report on ab initio investigations of two rotameric forms of each of the two tautomers of neutral (E)- and (Z)-. We have computed the vertical singlet excitation energies of eight isomers and have explored the singlet excited-state reaction paths of several photochemical processes for radiationless excited-state deactivation: the E/Z photoisomerization, an electron-driven proton transfer for an intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded Z isomer, as well as the hydrogen-atom detachment process and the ring-puckering process involving the NH group inherent to the imidazole moiety. We have optimized the S1/S0 conical intersections for each of these processes and located additional ππ*/nπ* conical intersections. Because of the reversed energetic order of the nπ* and ππ* states in the N3H and N1H tautomers, an energy window exists where the N3H tautomers can be excited to the nπ* state, from which only the photoisomerization process is accessible, while the N1H tautomers can be excited to the ππ* state, from which several deexcitation processes compete from the onset of the absorption. These results explain the unusual dependence of the quantum yield for E→Z photoisomerization on the excitation wavelength.

For UV-induced immune suppression to occur, electromagnetic  (i.e. UV radiation) must be converted to a biological signal. Two photoreceptors have been identified in the skin that serves this purpose, epidermal DNA and trans- (UCA). Although compelling evidence exists to support a role for each pathway (UV-induced DNA damage or photoisomerization of UCA) in UV-induced immune suppression, it is not clear what determines which photoreceptor pathway is activated. To address this question, we injected UV-irradiated mice with a monoclonal antibody with specificity for cis-UCA or applied liposomes containing DNA repair enzymes to the skin of UV-irradiated mice. The effect that each had on UV-induced suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity was measured. We asked whether the light source used (FS-40 sunlamps vs solar-simulated UV radiation) altered whichever pathway of immune suppression was activated. Different doses of UV radiation and the viability of the antigen were also considered. Neither the dose of UV nor the light source had any influence on determining which pathway was activated. Rather, we found that the viability of the antigen was the critical determinant. When live antigens were used, UV-induced immune suppression was blocked with monoclonal anti-cis-UCA but not with T4 endonuclease V-containing liposomes. The reverse was observed when formalin-fixed or killed antigens were used. Our findings indicate that antigen viability dictates which photoreceptor pathway predominates after UV exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11204225>Analysis of histidine and  isomers by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.</a></h2><p>The qualitative separation performance of a C18, C8 and C4 reversed-phase column was investigated for the separation of histidine and its metabolites histamine, 1-methyihistamine and trans- and cis-. Trans- and cis- were baseline separated from their precursor histidine on all three columns using isocratic elution with a mobile phase composed of 0.01 M aqueous TEAP pH 3.0 and acetonitrile at a ratio of 98:2 (v/v). However, histidine was not separated from histamine and 1-methyihistamine. Selecting the C8 column and introducing 0.005 M of the ion pairing reagent 1-octanesulfonic  sodium salt into the aqueous solution and acetonitrile at a ratio of 90:10 (v/v), significantly improved the separation. The separation was also followed by a change in the retention times and the order of elution. The sequence of elution was histidine, cis-, trans-, histamine and 1-methylhistamine with retention times of 5.58 +/- 0.07, 7.03 +/- 0.15, 7.92 +/- 0.18, 18.77 +/- 0.24 and 20.79 +/- 0.21 min (mean +/- SD; n=5). The separation on the C8 column in the presence of the ion-pairing reagent was further improved with gradient elution that resulted in a reduction in the retention times and elution volumes of histamine and 1-methylhistamine. The detection limits of histidine and trans- at a wavelength of 210 nm and an injection volume of 0.05 ml were 5 x 10(-8) mol l(-1) (n=3). The kinetic of the in-vitro conversion of trans- into the cis-isomer after UV irradiation was depending on the time of exposure and the  of the light source. UVB light induced a significantly faster conversion than UVA light. TUCA and cUCA samples kept at -25 degrees C were stable for up to 50 weeks.

To induce immune suppression, the electromagnetic  of UV radiation must be absorbed by an epidermal photoreceptor and converted into a biologically recognizable signal. Two photoreceptors have been recognized: DNA and trans- (UCA). Trans-UCA is normally found in the outermost layer of skin and isomerizes to the cis isomer upon exposure to UV radiation. Although UCA was identified as a UV photoreceptor years ago, and many have documented its ability to induce immune suppression, its exact mode of action remains elusive. Particularly vexing has been the identity of the molecular pathway by which cis-UCA mediates immune suppression. Here we provide evidence that cis-UCA binds to the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptor with relatively high affinity (Kd = 4.6 nM). Anti-cis-UCA antibody precipitates radiolabeled 5-HT, and the binding is inhibited by excess 5-HT and/or excess cis-UCA. Similarly, anti-5-HT antibody precipitates radiolabeled cis-UCA, and the binding is inhibited by excess 5-HT or excess cis-UCA. Calcium mobilization was activated when a mouse fibroblast line, stably transfected with the human 5-HT2A receptor, was treated with cis-UCA. Cis-UCA-induced calcium mobilization was blocked with a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. UV- and cis-UCA-induced immune suppression was blocked by antiserotonin antibodies or by treating the mice with 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. Our findings identify cis-UCA as a serotonin receptor ligand and indicate that the immunosuppressive effects of cis-UCA and UV radiation are mediated by activation of the 5-HT2A receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475370>Non-adiabatic dynamics investigation of the radiationless decay mechanism of trans- in the S2 state.</a></h2><p>The trans-, a UV chromophore in the epidermis of human skin, was found to exhibit a wavelength dependent isomerization property. The isomerization quantum yield to cis- is greatest when being excited to the S1 state, whereas exciting the molecule to the S2 state causes almost no isomerization. The comparative photochemical behavior of the trans- on the S1 and S2 states continues to be the subject of intense research effort. This study is concerned with the unique photo-behavior of this interesting molecule on the S2 state. Combining the on-the-fly surface hopping dynamics simulations and static electronic structure calculations, three decay channels were observed following excitation to the S2 state. An overwhelming majority of the molecules decay to the S1 state through a planar or pucker characterized minimum  conical intersection (MECI), and then decay to the ground state along a relaxation coordinate driven by a pucker deformation of the ring. A very small fraction of molecules decay to the S1 state by a MECI characterized by a twisting motion around the CC double bond, which continues to drive the molecule to deactivate to the ground state. The latter channel is related with the photoisomerization process, whereas the former one will only generate the original trans-form products. The present work provides a novel S2 state decay mechanism of this molecule, which offers useful information to explain the wavelength dependent isomerization behavior.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11332040>UVA exposure affects UVB and cis--induced systemic suppression of immune responses in Listeria monocytogenes-infected Balb/c mice.</a></h2><p>Ultraviolet radiation can inhibit immune responses locally as well as systemically. Such effects have been measured in animals and humans exposed to ultraviolet B (wavelength 280-315 nm) (UVB) and ultraviolet A (315-400 nm) (UVA). The precise wavelength dependence is important for the identification of possible molecular targets and for assessments of risk of different artificial UV sources and solar UV. In such analyses, it is commonly assumed that radiation  from each wavelength contributes to the effect independent of the other wavelengths. Here we show that this assumption does not hold good. In the present study, it was investigated whether exposure to broadband UVA or longwave ultraviolet A 1 (340-400 nm) (UVA 1) prior to the standard immunosuppressive UVB protocol might modulate the immunosuppressive effects induced by UVB. Preexposure to broadband UVA or longwave UVA 1, 1 day prior to the standard immunosuppressive UVB protocol, inhibited the UVB-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Listeria monocytogenes significantly. This effect was not associated with restoring the number of interleukin (IL-12)-positive cells in the spleen. Since isomerization of trans- (UCA) into the immunosuppressive cis-UCA isomer plays a crucial role in UVB-induced immunomodulation, in a second set of experiments it was investigated whether immunosuppression induced by cis-UCA might also be downregulated by preexposure to UVA. Animals were exposed to broad-band UVA or longwave UVA 1 prior to application of an immunosuppressive dose of cis- or trans-UCA as a control. Both UVA and UVA 1 appear to inhibit the cis-UCA-induced systemic immunosuppression (DTH and IL-12) to L. monocytogenes. These studies clearly show that UVA radiation modulates both UVB and cis-UCA-induced immunomodulation. In general, our studies indicate that both broadband UVA and longwave UVA 1 could induce modulation of UVB and cis-UCA-induced immunomodulation. As sunlight contains both UVA and UVB radiation the balance between these two radiations apparently determines the net immunomodulatory effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011348>-modified chitosan nanoparticles can confer anti-inflammatory effect by delivering CD98 siRNA to macrophages.</a></h2><p>CD98 plays an important role in the development and progression of . Here, CD98 siRNA (siCD98) was complexed with -modified chitosan (UAC) to form nanoparticles (NPs), which were transfected into Raw 264.7 macrophages in an effort to convey anti-inflammatory effects. Characterization showed that the generated NPs had a desirable particle size (156.0-247.1nm), a slightly positive zeta potential (15.8-17.5mV), and no apparent cytotoxicity against Raw 264.7 macrophages and colon-26 cells compared to control NPs fabricated by Oligofectamine (OF) and siRNA. Cellular uptake experiments demonstrated that macrophages exhibited a time-dependent accumulation profile of UAC/siRNA NPs. Further in vitro gene silencing experiments revealed that UAC/siCD98 NPs with a weight ratio of 60:1 yielded the most efficient knockdowns of CD98 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α. Indeed, the RNAi efficiency obtained with our NPs was even higher than that of the positive control OF/siCD98 NPs. These results suggest that UAC/siCD98 NPs might be a safe, efficient and promising candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, much interest has been directed towards defining the ageing processes in skin and excellent comprehensive reviews have been compiled. This review aims to highlight several areas of developing knowledge, and focuses on the potential importance of environmental changes as they influence skin ageing and carcinogenesis. Repeated reference to the effects of UV on the skin are inevitable in any review of skin ageing and this is scarcely surprising as the skin contains many cells as well as subcellular and extracellular chromophores which are capable of absorbing  within the UV spectrum.

Subcellular chromophores include keratin, melanin, collagen, elastin and a number of proteins, lipids and steroids (such as vitamin D). , a photoisomerization product of the amino- histidine, may provide some limited photoprotection and some believe it to be important in UV induced immunosuppression.
