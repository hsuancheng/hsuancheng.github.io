Abnormal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress participates in many heart diseases, but its role in viral myocarditis remains unsolved.We investigated the influence of ER stress in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis by dynamically detecting its activation in CVB3-infected hearts, analyzing its association with myocarditis severity, and exploring its impact on disease development by modulating the strength of ER stress with the chemical activator tunicamycin (Tm) or the inhibitor  (TUDCA). The underlying signal pathway of ER stress in CVB3-induced myocarditis was also deciphered.We found that myocardial expression of Grp78 and Grp94, 2 ER stress markers, was significantly increased after CVB3 infection and positively correlated with myocarditis severity. Consistently, Tm-augmented ER stress obviously aggravated myocarditis, as shown by more severe myocardial , reduced cardiac function, and a lower survival rate, whereas TUDCA decreased ER stress and obviously alleviated myocarditis. This pathologic effect of ER stress could be attributed to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) production through the IRE1-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) pathway.ER stress accentuated CVB3-induced myocardial  through the IRE1-associated NF-κB pathway. This study may help us understand the role of ER stress in viral myocarditis and promote the development of corresponding therapeutic strategies based on manipulating ER stress.Copyright © 2015 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

ER stress induces the unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway.  is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear which PRRs have a major role in inducing  during ER stress. Here we show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are important mediators of ER-stress-induced  in mouse and human cells. The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion.  and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor. The association of NOD1 and NOD2 with pro-inflammatory responses induced by the IRE1α/TRAF2 signalling pathway provides a novel link between innate immunity and ER-stress-induced .</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29844144>Vascular Nox (NADPH Oxidase) Compartmentalization, Protein Hyperoxidation, and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Vascular Nox (NADPH oxidase)-derived reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been implicated in hypertension. However, relationships between these processes are unclear. We hypothesized that Nox isoforms localize in a subcellular compartment-specific manner, contributing to oxidative and ER stress, which influence the oxidative proteome and vascular function in hypertension. Nox compartmentalization (cell fractionation), O (lucigenin), HO (amplex red), reversible protein oxidation (sulfenylation), irreversible protein oxidation (protein tyrosine phosphatase, peroxiredoxin oxidation), and ER stress (PERK [protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase], IRE1α [inositol-requiring enzyme 1], and phosphorylation/oxidation) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMC proliferation was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and vascular reactivity assessed in stroke-prone SHR arteries by myography. Noxs were downregulated by short interfering RNA and pharmacologically. In SHR, Noxs were localized in specific subcellular regions: Nox1 in plasma membrane and Nox4 in ER. In SHR, oxidative stress was associated with increased protein sulfenylation and hyperoxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatases and peroxiredoxins. Inhibition of Nox1 (NoxA1ds), Nox1/4 (GKT137831), and ER stress (4-phenylbutyric acid/) normalized SHR vascular reactive oxygen species generation. GKT137831 reduced IRE1α sulfenylation and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing in SHR. Increased VSMC proliferation in SHR was normalized by GKT137831, 4-phenylbutyric acid, and STF083010 (IRE1-XBP1 disruptor). Hypercontractility in the stroke-prone SHR was attenuated by 4-phenylbutyric acid. We demonstrate that protein hyperoxidation in hypertension is associated with oxidative and ER stress through upregulation of plasmalemmal-Nox1 and ER-Nox4. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response is regulated by Nox4/reactive oxygen species and plays a role in the hyperproliferative VSMC phenotype in SHR. Our study highlights the importance of Nox subcellular compartmentalization and interplay between cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species and ER stress response, which contribute to the VSMC oxidative proteome and vascular dysfunction in hypertension.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29097427>NLRP3 inflammasome activation in aged macrophages is diminished during Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.</a></h2><p>Pneumococcal infections are the eigth leading cause of death in the United States, and it is estimated that older patients (≥65 yr of age) account for the most serious cases. The goal of our current study is to understand the impact of biological aging on innate immune responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of bacterial pneumonia. With the use of in vitro and in vivo aged murine models, our findings demonstrate that age-enhanced unfolded protein responses (UPRs) contribute to diminished inflammasome assembly and activation during S. pneumoniae infection. Pretreatment of aged mice with endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and the stress-reducing agent  (TUDCA) decreased mortality in aged hosts that was associated with increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, improved pathogen clearance, and decreased pneumonitis during infection. Taken together, our data provide new evidence as to why older persons are more susceptible to S. pneumoniae and provide a possible therapeutic target to decrease morbidity and mortality in this population.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148866>Effects of alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase genotype variants on plasma metabolome, immune responses and gastrointestinal bacterial enumeration of pigs pre- and post-weaning.</a></h2><p>In pigs, the alpha-(1,2) fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been highlighted for its properties in controlling the intestinal expression of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) F18 receptors; a pathogen causing edema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea. In this study, we hypothesized that pigs with different genotypes (ETEC F18 resistant (FUT1AA) versus susceptible (FUT1AG)) differed in following systemic and enteric responses: growth performance, plasma metabolic profiles, expression of candidate genes for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and immunity, number of selected bacteria and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in faeces and digesta in piglets pre and post-weaning, and on the ETEC F18 adherence ex vivo. Genotype had the strongest impact on plasma metabolomic profile on day 7 and 28 of age. FUT1AG piglets had higher level of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, hippuric acid, oxindole, and 3-oxo-5-beta-chol-7-en-24-oic acid on day 7, and a higher level of guanosine on day 28 than that in the FUT1AA piglets. FUT1AA piglets had a higher level of betaine on day 7 and 3-methylguanine on day 28. On day 34 of age, the FUT1AA pigs had higher levels of S-2-hydroxyglutarate, L-phenylalanine,  and an undetermined PC/LysoPC, while Ile Glu Phe Gly peptide and genistein 5-O-glucuronide, and PC (18:0/0:0) were at higher levels in the FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype did not affect the growth performance and expression of candidate genes. FUT1AG piglets had a higher number of haemolytic bacteria in faeces and in digesta than that in FUT1AA at 34 days of age. The colonic acetic acid concentration was highest in FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype may influence not only the expression of E. coli F18 receptors but could potentially impact the gut homeostasis and metabotype of piglets pre and post-weaning. Further investigations on the relation between FUT1 genotype and these aspects including the intestinal commensal  will expand the knowledge on factors affecting the intestinal ecosystem.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25804419>TUDCA Promotes Phagocytosis by Retinal Pigment Epithelium via MerTK Activation.</a></h2><p>Renewal and elimination of the aged photoreceptor outer segment (POS) by RPE cells is a daily rhythmic process that is important for long-term vision. Phagocytic dysfunction results in photoreceptor cell death.  (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, is known to show neuroprotective effects in stroke, neurological diseases, and retinal degeneration models. In this study, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on retinal phagocytosis.We used pHrodo-succinimidyl ester (SE), a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, to label the POS for monitoring phagocytosis. After ingestion, the intensity of pHrodo fluorescence increases because of the pH changes inside the liposome. An RPE cell line, ARPE-19, and primary human RPE cells were used to investigate the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of phagocytosis in the pH-sensitive fluorescence POS phagocytosis assay. Additionally, we examined whether TUDCA could promote phagocytic function.The intensity of pHrodo light emission increased in a time-dependent manner.  enhanced phagocytosis of POS and protected against H2O2-induced phagocytic dysfunction. It also promoted phagocytic function via activation of Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK), which is known to have a key role in the physiological renewal of POS.These results suggest that TUDCA activates MerTK, which is important for phagocytosis of POS.  may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of retinal diseases.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p></html>
