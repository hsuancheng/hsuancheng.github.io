In studies utilizing two bovine endothelial cell lines (CPAE and AG04762), both free 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (11-HETE) were generated during incubations with exogenous arachidonic acid and both free 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) were generated during incubations with exogenous linoleic acid. Esterification of 15-HETE,  and 13-HODE during these incubations was demonstrated. The analyses included reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the free acid and its methyl ester and chiral separation of the methyl ester on straight phase chiral columns. The ratio of /13-HODE averaged 2.7 in the chromatographic analyses of the extracts of the incubations with linoleic acid. The combined production of 13-HODE and  from linoleic acid was four times greater than that of 15-HETE and 11-HETE from arachidonic acid. With regard to the products of the CPAE endothelial cell line, the S/R ratio of the stereoisomers averaged 1.5 for free 15-HETE, 5.7 for free 13-HODE and 0.2 for free . The 11-HETE had strict (R) stereospecificity. The products from the AG04762 endothelial cell line had similar stereochemistry. All these stereochemical findings point to the activity of a cyclooxygenase rather than that of a lipoxygenase.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15740040>Characterization and quantification of free and esterified 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODE) in barley, germinating barley, and finished malt.</a></h2><p>The analysis of (R)-9- and (S)-9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid as well as (R)-13- and (S)-13-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (HODE) as free acids, esterified in triacylglycerols (storage lipids), and esterified in polar lipids (phospholipids, glycolipids, etc.) in barley, germinating barley, and finished malt was performed using [13-(18)O(1)]-(S)-13-HODE isotope dilution assays with GC-MS and straight- and chiral-phase HPLC. 9- and 13- HODE occur approximately racemically in barley, indicating an autoxidation. The enantiomeric excesses increase to 78% S for free  and to 58% S for free 13-HODE in germinating barley as a result of lipoxygenase-2 (LOX-2) catalysis, but free HODEs are at low concentration. More than 90% of HODEs in barley and malt are esterified. In the storage lipids of green malt 53 mg/kg  and 147 mg/kg 13-HODE were detected. This ratio of 30:70 reflects the regioselectivity of the LOX-2 enzyme in malt. In the polar lipids 45 mg/kg  and 44 mg/kg 13-HODE were characterized. The latter indicate a hitherto unknown 9-lipoxygenase activity with polar lipids as substrates. During kilning the contents of most HODEs decreased significantly due to chemical and enzymatic degradation, whereas polar-esterified (R)-13-HODE increased (43%) in the finished malt.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25330944>Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids regulate apoptosis in human THP-1 cells in a PPARγ-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Macrophage apoptosis, a key process in atherogenesis, is regulated by oxidation products, including hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs). These stable oxidation products of linoleic acid (LA) are abundant in atherosclerotic plaque and activate PPARγ and GPR132. We investigated the mechanisms through which HODEs regulate apoptosis. The effect of HODEs on THP-1 monocytes and adherent THP-1 cells were compared with other C18  acids, LA and α-linolenic acid (ALA). The number of cells was reduced within 24 hours following treatment with  (p < 0.01, 30 μM) and 13 HODE (p < 0.01, 30 μM), and the equivalent cell viability was also decreased (p < 0.001). Both  and 13-HODE (but not LA or ALA) markedly increased caspase-3/7 activity (p < 0.001) in both monocytes and adherent THP-1 cells, with  the more potent. In addition,  and 13-HODE both increased Annexin-V labelling of cells (p < 0.001). There was no effect of LA, ALA, or the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (1 μM), but the effect of HODEs was replicated with apoptosis-inducer camptothecin (10 μM). Only  increased DNA fragmentation. The pro-apoptotic effect of HODEs was blocked by the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO. The PPARγ antagonist T0070907 further increased apoptosis, suggestive of the PPARγ-regulated apoptotic effects induced by . The use of siRNA for GPR132 showed no evidence that the effect of HODEs was mediated through this receptor.  and 13-HODE are potent--and specific--regulators of apoptosis in THP-1 cells. Their action is PPARγ-dependent and independent of GPR132. Further studies to identify the signalling pathways through which HODEs increase apoptosis in macrophages may reveal novel therapeutic targets for atherosclerosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11304473>Oxidized LDL regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in human macrophages and endothelial cells through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.</a></h2><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recognized as an angiogenic factor that induces endothelial proliferation and vascular permeability. Recent studies have also suggested that VEGF can promote macrophage migration, which is critical for atherosclerosis. We have reported that VEGF is remarkably expressed in activated macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells within human coronary atherosclerotic lesions, and we have proposed the significance of VEGF in the progression of atherosclerosis. To clarify the mechanism of VEGF expression in atherosclerotic lesions, we examined the regulation of VEGF expression by oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), which is abundant in atherosclerotic arterial walls. A recent report has revealed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is expressed not only in adipocytes but also in monocytes/macrophages and has suggested that PPARgamma may have a role in the differentiation of monocytes/macrophages. Furthermore, 9- and 13-hydroxy-(S)-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9- and 13-HODE, respectively), the components of Ox-LDL, may be PPARgamma ligands. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of PPARgamma in the regulation of VEGF by Ox-LDL. PPARgamma expression was detected in human monocyte/macrophage cell lines, human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells, and human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Ox-LDL (10 to 50 microg/mL) upregulated VEGF secretion from THP-1 dose-dependently. VEGF mRNA expression in HCAECs was also upregulated by Ox-LDL. The mRNA expression of VEGF in THP-1 cells and HCAECs was also augmented by PPARgamma activators, troglitazone (TRO), and 15-deoxy-(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ2). In contrast, VEGF expression in another monocyte/macrophage cell line, human histiocytic lymphoma cells (U937), which lacks PPARgamma expression, was not augmented by TRO or PGJ2. We established the U937 cell line, which permanently expresses PPARgamma (U937T). TRO and Ox-LDL augmented VEGF expression in U937T. In addition, VEGF production by THP-1 cells was significantly increased by exposure to  and 13-HODE. In conclusion, Ox-LDL upregulates VEGF expression in macrophages and endothelial cells, at least in part, through the activation of PPARgamma.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19457650>Antiproliferative activity of guava leaf extract via inhibition of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase isoforms.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) is a key enzyme for the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) which play important roles in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Because the extract from Psidium guajava is known to have a variety of beneficial effects on our body including the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and antiproliferative activities, we investigated whether the extract inhibited the catalytic activity of the two PGHS isoforms using linoleic acid as an alternative substrate. The guava leaf extract inhibited the cyclooxygenase reaction of recombinant human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 as assessed by conversion of linoleic acid to 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs). The guava leaf extract also inhibited the PG hydroperoxidase activity of PGHS-1, which was not affected by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Quercetin which was one of the major components not only inhibited the cyclooxygenase activity of both isoforms but also partially inhibited the PG hydroperoxidase activity. Overexpression of human PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 in the human colon carcinoma cells increased the DNA synthesis rate as compared with mock-transfected cells which did not express any isoforms. The guava leaf extract not only inhibited the PGE(2) synthesis but also suppressed the DNA synthesis rate in the PGHS-1- and PGHS-2-expressing cells to the same level as mock-transfected cells. These results demonstrate the antiproliferative activity of the guava leaf extract which is at least in part caused by inhibition of the catalytic activity of PGHS isoforms.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8660674>Prostaglandin synthase 2 expression in epidermal growth factor-dependent proliferation of mouse keratinocytes.</a></h2><p>BALB/c mouse keratinocytes (BALB/MK) are nontumorigenic epithelial cells which are dependent on mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) for maintaining proliferation in culture. In BALB/MK the oxygenation of both arachidonic acid and linoleic acid was dependent on EGF. EGF stimulated the formation of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha from arachidonic acid and 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) from linoleic acid. Analysis of the linoleic acid metabolites determined the ratio of  to 13-HODE was approximately 6 to 4, and the  was the (R) enantiomer, consistent with  by prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGHS). The formation of these linoleic acid metabolites was sensitive to indomethacin, a PGHS inhibitor. EGF induced the expression of PGHS-2 mRNA after 30 min, which peaked after 1 h, and remained expressed for at least 24 h after the addition of EGF. A less significant increase in the expression of PGHS-1 mRNA occurred 4 h after EGF stimulation. Immunoblot analysis did not detect expression of PGHS-1 protein. However, PGHS-2 protein expression was increased 2 h after EGF exposure and was dependent on EGF. PGHS-2 protein was not transiently expressed as reported with other cell types, but was continually expressed in proliferating cells maintained with EGF at a subconfluent density. Indomethacin significantly attenuated EGF-dependent mitogenesis and cell proliferation. These results suggest that PGHS-2 activity contributes to the proliferative response of BALB/MK to EGF.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8378541>Cyclooxygenase activity of cultured human mesothelial cells.</a></h2><p>The fatty acid oxygenase activity of mesothelial cells and its role in inflammatory and neoplastic diseases of the mesothelium have not been defined. Techniques permitting in vitro cultivation of human mesothelial cells shed into serous cavities have permitted analysis of their specific  capacities. The principal products of incubations of cultured human mesothelial cells with polyunsaturated fatty acids were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography on reversed-, straight-, and chiral-phase columns and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The products included 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (S/R = 3.5), 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid from arachidonic acid; 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (molar ratio of 9/13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids = 3.5, S/R ratios = 0.3 and 2.8, respectively) from linoleic acid; and 12-hydroxyheptadecadienoic acid from homo-gamma-linolenic acid.

Adequate glutathione peroxidase activity could be important for the maintenance of prostacyclin synthesis by blood vessels, since hydroperoxides can inhibit the formation of this substance. We have investigated the effects of dietary selenium deficiency on glutathione peroxidase activity and the synthesis of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha and monohydroxy and trihydroxy metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids by aorta. The latter products can be formed either by the actions of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase or by lipid peroxidation. Aortic glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced by over 80% by feeding rats a selenium-deficient diet for 4 weeks, and to undetectable levels after 6 weeks. There were no appreciable differences in the levels of free and esterified oxygenated metabolites of linoleic acid or arachidonic acid between the control and treated groups after 4 weeks. However, after 6 weeks, there were modest, but statistically significant reductions in the formation of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha and monohydroxy products formed by cyclooxygenase. On the other hand, the amounts of esterified 18:2 metabolites appeared to be higher in aortae from animals on the selenium-deficient diet, although only the increase in esterified  was statistically significant. These results suggest that selenium deficiency can affect the formation of prostacyclin and other oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids by aorta, possibly by increasing lipid peroxidation. However, the differences between control and selenium-deficient rats after 6 weeks were not very dramatic, in spite of the fact that glutathione peroxidase activity was undetectable. It would therefore appear that additional mechanisms are also involved in controlling the levels of lipid hydroperoxides in aorta.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3691528>Isolation and characterization of 9-hydroxy-10-trans,12-cis-octadecadienoic acid, a novel regulator of platelet adenylate cyclase from Glechoma hederacea L. Labiatae.</a></h2><p>We have identified and characterized a fatty acid, (9S,10E,12Z)- () as a regulator of adenylate cyclase activity of human platelet membranes. This fatty acid was isolated from a methanolic extract of the plant Glechoma hederacea L. Labiatae (commonly known as 'lierre terrestre', 'ground ivy' or 'creeping Charlie'; it was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. This compound increased basal adenylate cyclase activity in platelet membranes about threefold and had an EC50 of 10-20 microM. This increase in adenylate cyclase activity occurred without a temporal lag, was reversible, and represented an increase in Vmax without a substantial change in Km for ATP, Mg2+ or Mn2+. In addition,  additively or synergistically increased platelet adenylate cyclase activity in response to guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate and forskolin, but the fatty acid failed to alter inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity mediated by epinephrine (alpha 2-adrenergic receptor). Studies of the interaction of  with activation of platelet adenylate cyclase activity mediated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) indicated that this fatty acid produced a parallel shift in the concentration/response curve of PGE1 and PGD2 without altering maximal response, which was substantially greater than that observed with  alone. From these results, we conclude that  appears to be a partial agonist at PGE1 and PGD2 receptors on human platelets. We believe that this is a novel example of a plant-derived fatty acid which acts on cells to regulate adenylate cyclase via prostaglandin receptors.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8424677>Bis-allylic hydroxylation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by hepatic monooxygenases and its relation to the enzymatic and nonenzymatic formation of conjugated hydroxy fatty acids.</a></h2><p>[14C]Linoleic acid was incubated with phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomes and formation of cis-trans-conjugated hydroxy fatty acids was investigated. 13-Hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxy-10E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (), and three novel metabolites were identified, viz. 11-hydroxy-9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (11-HODE), 8-HODE, and 14-HODE. 11-HODE (59% R), the main product, was unstable and converted to 9(R, S)-HODE and 13(R, S)-HODE in acidic media. All metabolites contained oxygen from O2. Experiments under oxygen-18 gas showed that 13-HODE and  contained equal or less amounts of oxygen-18 than the other metabolites. In the former case,  and 13-HODE were formed with stereo-selectivity (80-82% R). [11S-2H]Linoleic acid was metabolized to 13R-HODE with loss of deuterium (24% 2H) and to 9R-HODE with deuterium retention (95% 2H), while [11R-2H]linoleic acid was metabolized to 13R-HODE that largely retained the label (71% 2H) and to 9R-HODE that lost most of the label (22% 2H). These data indicated that P450 catalyzed abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen at C11, double bond migration and suprafacial oxygen insertion at C9 to give 9R-HODE, while abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C11, followed by double bond migration and oxygen insertion, yielded 13R-HODE. Hepatic microsomes of the cynomolgus monkey metabolized 18:2n-6 as above and 20:4n-6 to 13-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, likely formed in analogy with 11-HODE. In summary, one mechanism in the biosynthesis of cis-trans-conjugated hydroxy fatty acids by P450 involves suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion. In addition, hydrolysis of the unstable bis-allylic hydroxy metabolites may contribute to the formation of conjugated hydroxy fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1606159>Toxoplasma gondii stimulates the release of 13- and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids by human platelets.</a></h2><p>We have recently demonstrated a novel cytotoxic effect of human platelets against Toxoplasma gondii and a role for thromboxane (TX) in this process (Yong et al., 1991). We now report on the spectrum of lipid mediators released by human platelets after interaction with T. gondii. In addition to TXB2, human platelets after incubation with T. gondii for 90 min released 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT), 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), and an unidentified peak (UVmax 234 nm) as determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Thermospray-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis and straight-phase HPLC identified the unknown peak as a mixture of 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and . Radiolabeling studies with [14C]linoleic acid indicated that the platelets were the cellular source of the octadecanoids with 13-HODE (87.7%) greater than  (12.3%). Inhibitor studies with indomethacin indicated that 13-HODE was a lipoxygenase product and  was a cyclooxygenase product of linoleic acid. Thus, Toxoplasma-stimulated platelets release oxygenated products of both arachidonic acid and linoleic acid which may be important in the host response to T. gondii infection.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12654483>Activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by lipid hydroperoxides: mechanism of oxidant-mediated smooth muscle cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Oxidized lipids, such as 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. 13-HPODE, a constituent of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, can induce cytotoxicity of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), which may facilitate plaque destabilization and/or rupture. 13-HPODE-induced cytotoxicity has been linked to oxidative stress, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. In the present study, we show that 13-HPODE and 9-HPODE (10-30 microM) increased superoxide (O2*-) production and induced cytotoxicity in SMC. The 13-HPODE-induced increase in O2*- was blocked by transfecting the cells with antisense oligonucleotides against p22phox, suggesting that the O2*- was produced by NAD(P)H oxidase. Similar concentrations of the corresponding HPODE reduction products, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and , neither increased O2*- production nor induced cytotoxicity, while 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), an unsaturated aldehyde lipid peroxidation product, induced cytotoxicity without increasing O2*- production. Treatment with superoxide dismutase or Tiron to scavenge O2*-, or transfection with p22phox antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit O2*- production, attenuated 13-HPODE-induced cytotoxicity, but not that induced by 4-HNE.

However, few studies have evaluated mechanisms by which CNS TRPV1 mediates hyperalgesia and allodynia after injury. We hypothesized that activation of spinal cord systems releases endogenous TRPV1 agonists that evoke the development of mechanical allodynia by this receptor. Using in vitro superfusion, the depolarization of spinal cord triggered the release of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, such as 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () that potently activated spinal TRPV1, leading to the development of mechanical allodynia. Subsequent calcium imaging and electrophysiology studies demonstrated that synthetic oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, including , 13-HODE, and 9 and 13-oxoODE, comprise a family of endogenous TRPV1 agonists. In vivo studies demonstrated that intrathecal application of these oxidized linoleic acid metabolites rapidly evokes mechanical allodynia. Finally, intrathecal neutralization of 9- and 13-HODE by antibodies blocks CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia. These data collectively reveal a mechanism by which an endogenous family of lipids activates TRPV1 in the spinal cord, leading to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia.

RA-dependent stimulation of 18:2 autoxidation was characterized by enhanced rates of dioxygen uptake which were linear with retinoid concentration. In contrast, 5,6-epoxy-RA, a major oxidation product of RA, failed to affect the rate of dioxygen consumption at all concentrations tested. RA was also shown to stimulate peroxyl radical-dependent oxidation of styrene to the corresponding oxirane when styrene was included in the micellar system as a molecular probe.

Detection of metabolites was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in negative multiple-reaction monitoring detection mode. Application of this assay to various biological matrices was performed.The validated assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-500 nmol/L for prostanoids and isoprostane, 50-5000 nmol/L for LOX-derived metabolites and 400-40,000 nmol/L for fatty acids.

These four OXLAMs have been mechanistically linked to pathological conditions ranging from cardiovascular disease to chronic pain. Plasma OXLAMs, which are elevated in Alzheimer's dementia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, have been proposed as biomarkers useful for indicating the presence and severity of both conditions. Because mammals lack the enzymatic machinery needed for de novo LA synthesis, the abundance of LA and OXLAMs in mammalian tissues may be modifiable via diet. To examine this issue in humans, we measured circulating LA and OXLAMs before and after a 12-week LA lowering dietary intervention in chronic headache patients. Lowering dietary LA significantly reduced the abundance of plasma OXLAMs, and reduced the LA content of multiple circulating lipid fractions that may serve as precursor pools for endogenous OXLAM synthesis. These results show that lowering dietary LA can reduce the synthesis and/or accumulation of oxidized LA derivatives that have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions.

Although synthetic agonists for PPARgamma are widely used as insulin sensitizers, the identity of the natural ligand(s) for PPARgamma is still not clear. Suggested natural ligands include 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 and oxidized fatty acids such as  and 13-HODE. Crystal structures of PPARgamma have revealed the mode of recognition for synthetic compounds. Here we report structures of PPARgamma bound to oxidized fatty acids that are likely to be natural ligands for this receptor. These structures reveal that the receptor can (i) simultaneously bind two fatty acids and (ii) couple covalently with conjugated oxo fatty acids. Thermal stability and gene expression analyses suggest that such covalent ligands are particularly effective activators of PPARgamma and thus may serve as potent and biologically relevant ligands.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22997156>Expansion of necrotic core and shedding of Mertk receptor in human carotid plaques: a role for oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids?</a></h2><p>Expansion of necrotic core (NC), a major feature responsible for plaque disruption, is likely the consequence of accelerated macrophage apoptosis coupled with defective phagocytic clearance (efferocytosis). The cleavage of the extracellular domain of Mer tyrosine kinase (Mertk) by metallopeptidase domain17 (Adam17) has been shown to produce a soluble Mertk protein (sMer), which can inhibit efferocytosis. Herein, we analysed the expression and localization of Mertk and Adam17 in the tissue around the necrotic core (TANC) and in the periphery (P) of human carotid plaques. Then we studied the mechanisms of NC expansion by evaluating which components of TANC induce Adam17 and the related cleavage of the extracellular domain of Mertk.We studied 97 human carotid plaques. The expression of Mertk and Adam17 was found to be higher in TANC than in P (P < 0.001). By immunohistochemistry, Mertk was higher than Adam17 in the area of TANC near to the lumen (P < 0.01) but much lower in the area close to NC (P < 0.01). The extract of this portion of TANC increased the expression (mRNA) of Adam17 and Mertk (P < 0.01) in macrophage-like THP-1 cells but it also induced the cleavage of the extracellular domain of Mertk, generating sMer in the medium (P < 0.01). This effect of TANC extract was most evoked by its content in F(2)-isoprostanes, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, and hydroxytetraenoic acids.Some oxidized derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in TANC of human carotid plaques are strong inducers of Adam17, which in turn leads to the generation of sMer, which can inhibit efferocytosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9547616>IL-1 increases the ability of human endothelial cells to transform linoleic acid into monohydroxy-isomers and their incorporation into cell lipids.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3098580>Cyclooxygenase-catalyzed formation of 9-hydroxylinoleic acid by guinea pig alveolar macrophages under non-stimulated conditions.</a></h2><p>Data are presented on the formation of a linoleic acid oxygenation product under basal conditions by guinea pig alveolar macrophages (AM).

Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether HDL may inhibit ER stress in correlation with the secretion of apoE and CETP from lipid-loaded macrophages. To this purpose, THP-1 macrophages were loaded with lipids by incubation with human oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and then exposed to human HDL3. ER stress signaling markers, protein kinase/Jun-amino-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK p54/p46) and eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α), as well as the secreted apoE and CETP, were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Out of the many different bioactive lipids of oxLDL, we tested the effect of 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid () and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) on ER stress. Tunicamycin was used as positive control for ER stress induction. Results showed that oxLDL,  and 4-HNE induce ER stress in human macrophages by activation of eIF-2α and SAPK/JNK (p54/p46) signaling pathways. OxLDL stimulated apoE and CETP secretion, while tunicamycin determined a reduction of the secreted apoE and CETP, both in control and lipid-loaded macrophages. The addition of HDL3 to the culture medium of tunicamycin-treated cells induced: (i) the reduction of ER stress, expressed as decreased levels of eIF-2α and SAPK/JNK, and (ii) a partial recovery of the secreted apoE and CETP levels in lipid-loaded macrophages. These data suggest a new mechanism by which HDL3 diminish ER stress and stimulate cholesterol efflux from lipid-loaded macrophages.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The generation of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence by stimulated and non-stimulated PM was inhibited concentration-dependently. Inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 10 nM. Since 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin also inhibited the generation of chemiluminescence by a cell-free enzyme system, i.e. xanthine/xanthine oxidase, the inhibitory effects might represent a scavenging activity towards reactive oxygen species. 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin did not influence other phagocytic cell functions, e.g. PM phagocytic capacity, the aggregatory response to the calcium ionophore A23187, or the release of lysosomal enzymes. The effects of 9-OH-Lin and 9-OOH-Lin could be ascribed to the hydroxy and hydroxyperoxy moiety, respectively, as evidenced by lack of effect of the native fatty acid linoleic acid.

In experimental infarction models in animals (rats, rabbits, and dogs), significant myocardial salvage has been obtained, up to 100% at the appropriate dose in dogs. The documented mechanism of action in vitro includes direct scavenging of biologically produced superoxide anion; in vivo in rabbits, modulation of the complement activity of serum has also been shown. A direct correlation between administration of the test compound in animals and reductions of multiple, independent markers of oxidative stress in serum was recently obtained in a rat experimental infarction model. For the current study, it was hypothesized that oral Cardax administration would inhibit oxidative damage of multiple relevant biological targets in a representative, well-characterized murine peritoneal inflammation model. A previously developed mass spectrometry-based (LC/ESI/MS/MS) approach was used to interrogate multiple distinct  of oxidation in a black mouse (C57/BL6) model system. In vivo markers of oxidant stress from peritoneal lavage samples (supernatants) were evaluated in mice on day eight (8) after treatment with either Cardax or vehicle (lipophilic emulsion without drug) orally by gavage at 500 mg/kg once per day for seven (7) days at five (5) time points: (1) baseline prior to treatment (t=0); (2) 16 h following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with thioglycollate to elicit a neutrophilic infiltrate; (3) 4 h following i.p. injection of yeast cell wall (zymosan; t=16 h/4 h thioglycollate+zymosan); (4) 72 h following i.p. injection with thioglycollate to elicit monocyte/macrophage infiltration; and (5) 72 h/4 h thioglycollate+zymosan. A statistically significant sparing effect on the arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA) substrates was observed at time points two and five. When normalized to the concentration of the oxidative substrates, statistically significant reductions of 8-isoprostane-F(2alpha) (8-iso-F(2alpha)) at time point three (maximal neutrophil recruitment/activation), and 5-HETE, 5-oxo-EET, 11-HETE, , and PGF(2alpha) at time point five (maximal monocyte/macrophage recruitment/activation) were observed. Subsequently, the direct interaction of the optically inactive stereoisomer of Cardax (meso-dAST) with human 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) was evaluated in vitro with circular dichroism (CD) and electronic absorption (UV/Vis) spectroscopy, and subsequent molecular docking calculations were made using mammalian 15-LOX as a surrogate (for which XRC data has been reported). The results suggested that the meso-compound was capable of interaction with, and binding to, the solvent-exposed surface of the enzyme. These preliminary studies provide the foundation for more detailed evaluation of the therapeutic effects of this compound on the 5-LOX enzyme, important in chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, asthma, and prostate cancer in humans.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035111>Differential cell growth/apoptosis behavior of 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid enantiomers in a colorectal cancer cell line.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases (LOXs) are important enzymes that metabolize arachidonic and linoleic acids. Various metabolites generated by the arachidonic acid cascade regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and senescence. Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs) are synthesized from linoleic acid, giving two enantiomeric forms for each metabolite. The aim was to investigate the effect of 13-HODE enantiomers on nondifferentiated Caco-2 cell growth/apoptosis. Our results indicate that 13(S)-HODE decreases cell growth and DNA synthesis of nondifferentiated Caco-2 cells cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, 13(S)-HODE showed an apoptotic effect that was reduced in the presence of a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) antagonist. In addition, we observed that 13(S)-HODE but not 13(R)-HODE is a ligand to PPARγ, confirming the implication of this nuclear receptor in 13(S)-HODE actions. In contrast, 13(R)-HODE increases cell growth and DNA synthesis in the absence of FBS. 13(R)-HODE interaction with BLT receptors activates ERK and CREB signaling pathways, as well as PGE2 synthesis. These results suggest that the proliferative effect of 13(R)-HODE could be due, at least in part, to COX pathway activation. Thus both enantiomers use different receptors and have contrary effects. We also found these differential effects of  enantiomers on cell growth/apoptosis. Therefore, the balance between (R)-HODEs and (S)-HODEs in the intestinal epithelium could be important to its cell growth/apoptosis homeostasis.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20943796>Adherence to a Mediterranean diet and plasma concentrations of lipid peroxidation in premenopausal women.</a></h2><p>A Mediterranean diet has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. A possible mechanism is through a decrease in lipid peroxidation (LPO); however, evidence linking the Mediterranean diet with lower LPO in premenopausal women is sparse.We investigated whether adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with lower LPO concentrations in premenopausal women.Two hundred fifty-nine healthy women aged 18-44 y were followed for ≤ 2 menstrual cycles.

Here, we report the involvement of the G-protein coupled receptor G2A (GPR132) in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain in mice. We found that mice deficient in the G2A-receptor show decreased mechanical hypersensitivity after oxaliplatin treatment. Lipid ligands of G2A were found in increased concentrations in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia of oxaliplatin treated mice. Calcium imaging and patch-clamp experiments show that G2A activation sensitizes the ligand-gated ion channel TRPV1 in sensory neurons via activation of PKC.

Two regioisomeric sets of Z,E and E,E stereoisomers are normally observed with substitution at the 9- and 13-positions of the 18-carbon chain.

The HODE Z,E/E,E product ratios previously reported for tissues such as liver and brain vary from 0.5 to 2.0, and plasma ratios are somewhat higher, between 2.0 and 3.0. The reported literature protocols for HODE assay in tissues involve homogenization, reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of BHT, and ester hydrolysis with KOH to give the free HODEs. This is followed by either reverse-phase HPLC of the free acid HODEs or by conversion to TMS derivatives and GC-MS. When sodium borohydride is replaced in the protocol by triphenylphosphine, a gentler reducing agent, HODE Z,E/E,E product ratios are much higher, and lower total HODE levels of are found. It is proposed that inclusion of sodium borohydride in the isolation procedures leads to ex vivo reactions that are avoided if triphenylphosphine is used as the reducing agent.

Young peripheral reticulocytes contain more oxygenated polyenoic fatty acids in their membranes than older cells.

The oxidized lipids were also analyzed under conditions allowing preservation of their oxidation state. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of native and saponified lipid extracts of oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), we found that the major fatty acid oxidation product was esterified hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid (HPODE), the oxidized product of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in human LDL, linoleic acid. Although some esterified hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) was also detected, the reduction of HPODE to HODE did not appear to be monocyte-dependent. Essentially all of the HPODE was found to be esterified with the majority being esterified to cholesterol followed by phospholipids and generally following the abundance of esterified linoleic acid within the lipid classes. The percent of cholesteryl linoleate converted to cholesteryl HPODE and cholesteryl HODE at the end of the 24-h incubation was determined to be approximately 13.5%. The formation of oxidized esterified linoleic acid in the LDL was shown to require immunological activation of the human monocytes, a previously observed requirement for general LDL oxidation in this culture system.

UHPLC-MS, univariate and multivariate statistical analysis and ROC curves were used to design biomarkers of consumption in serum.

Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolite as inflammatory mediators can affect progression and treatment of cancer. In this work, the serum was collected from colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers, and then we tested the change of serum PUFA metabolites in both of them by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Of the 158 PUFA and their metabolites, we found that abnormal change of 2, 3-dinor-8-iso-PGF2α, 19-HETE and 12-keto-LTB4 from arachidonic acid were observed in colorectal cancer patients. Meanwhile,  and 13-HODE from linoleic acid were significant lower in colorectal cancer patients.

To gain insight on the impact of HCMV on neuronal development, we used both neural stem cells from human embryonic stem cells (NSC) and brain sections from infected fetuses and investigated the outcomes of infection on Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor critical in the developing brain. We observed that HCMV infection dramatically impaired the rate of neuronogenesis and strongly increased PPARγ levels and activity. Consistent with these findings, levels of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), a known PPARγ agonist, were significantly increased in infected NSCs. Likewise, exposure of uninfected NSCs to  recapitulated the effect of infection on PPARγ activity. It also increased the rate of cells expressing the IE antigen in HCMV-infected NSCs. Further, we demonstrated that (1) pharmacological activation of ectopically expressed PPARγ was sufficient to induce impaired neuronogenesis of uninfected NSCs, (2) treatment of uninfected NSCs with  impaired NSC differentiation and (3) treatment of HCMV-infected NSCs with the PPARγ inhibitor T0070907 restored a normal rate of differentiation. The role of PPARγ in the disease phenotype was strongly supported by the immunodetection of nuclear PPARγ in brain germinative zones of congenitally infected fetuses (N = 20), but not in control samples. Altogether, our findings reveal a key role for PPARγ in neurogenesis and in the pathophysiology of HCMV congenital infection. They also pave the way to the identification of PPARγ gene targets in the infected brain.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1905462>Mammalian lipoxygenases--are they only involved in the arachidonic acid cascade?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23483888> signatures of extreme longevity in northern Italian centenarians reveal a complex remodeling of lipids, amino acids, and gut microbiota .</a></h2><p>The aging phenotype in humans has been thoroughly studied but a detailed  profiling capable of shading light on the underpinning biological processes of longevity is still missing. Here using a combined metabonomics approach compromising holistic (1)H-NMR profiling and targeted MS approaches, we report for the first time the  phenotype of longevity in a well characterized human aging cohort compromising mostly female centenarians, elderly, and young individuals. With increasing age, targeted MS profiling of blood serum displayed a marked decrease in tryptophan concentration, while an unique alteration of specific glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are seen in the longevity phenotype. We hypothesized that the overall lipidome changes specific to longevity putatively reflect centenarians' unique capacity to adapt/respond to the accumulating oxidative and chronic inflammatory conditions characteristic of their extreme aging phenotype. Our data in centenarians support promotion of cellular detoxification mechanisms through specific modulation of the arachidonic acid  cascade as we underpinned increased concentration of 8,9-EpETrE, suggesting enhanced cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity. Such effective mechanism might result in the activation of an anti-oxidative response, as displayed by decreased circulating levels of  and 9-oxoODE, markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative products of linoleic acid. Lastly, we also revealed that the longevity process deeply affects the structure and composition of the human gut microbiota as shown by the increased extrection of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS) in urine of centenarians. Together, our novel approach in this representative Italian longevity cohort support the hypothesis that a complex remodeling of lipid, amino acid , and of gut microbiota functionality are key regulatory processes marking exceptional longevity in humans.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9825542>Strong increase of  in low density lipoprotein after a hemorrhagic shock.</a></h2><p> () is generated by lipid peroxidation (LPO) processes in comparison to other marker compounds in at least 10 fold amount.

As skin is routinely and pathologically exposed to many oxidative stresses such as UV radiation, chemical agents, and inflammation that might induce both G2A expression and production of G2A ligands, we examined G2A function in human keratinocytes. G2A was expressed in human epidermis, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK), and an immortalized human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). 9(S)-HODE evoked intracellular calcium mobilization and secretion of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF in NHEK cells. These responses became prominent in HaCaT cells by overexpression of G2A. 9(S)-HODE inhibited proliferation of NHEK cells by suppressing DNA synthesis and arresting the cell cycle in the G0/1-phase.

Human THP-1 monocytic cells can be induced to differentiate into macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment, and can then be converted into foam cells by exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). To define genes that are specifically expressed during the transformation of macrophages into foam cells, we have performed a subtractive library screening utilizing mRNA isolated from THP-1 macrophages and foam cells. From this analysis, we have identified adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP/aP2) as a gene that is highly upregulated in foam cells in response to oxLDL. Furthermore, overexpression the ALBP gene using an adenovirus construct enhanced the accumulation of cholesterol ester in macrophage foam cells, probably due to an increase in transcription since oxLDL enhanced ALBP promoter activity in experiments using a promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. The induction of ALBP by oxLDL probably involved activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcription factors, since four different endogenous PPARgamma ligands, including 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), two oxidized lipid components of oxLDL, as well as 15-deoxy-delta12,14 prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and retinoic acid (RA), all induced ALBP expression in macrophage/foam cells. Finally, ALBP was found to be highly expressed in vivo in macrophage/foam cells of human atherosclerotic plaques. These observations suggest that oxLDL-mediated increase in ALBP gene expression accelerate cholesterol ester accumulation, and that this is an important component of the genetic program regulating conversion of macrophages to foam cells. The observation that ALBP is readily detected in foam cells in active atherosclerotic lesions implicates a role for ALBP in human vascular disease. The induction of ALPB expression by oxLDL likely involves activation of PPARgamma by components of oxLDL ( and 13-HODE) that also function as PPARgamma ligands.

Seven obese hyperinsulinemic subjects were administered 400 mg troglitazone daily for 4 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained before and during troglitazone therapy at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Fasting insulin concentrations fell at week 1 and persisted at lower levels till 4 weeks. PPARgamma expression fell significantly at week 1 and fell further at weeks 2 and 4.

We previously demonstrated that treatment with a β3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) agonist triggers brown/beige adipogenesis in gonadal white adipose tissue following adipocyte death and clearance by tissue macrophages. The close physical relationship between adipocyte progenitors and tissue macrophages suggested that the macrophages that clear dying adipocytes might generate proadipogenic factors. Flow cytometric analysis of macrophages from mice treated with CL 316,243 identified a subpopulation that contained elevated lipid and expressed CD44. Lipidomic analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting-isolated macrophages demonstrated that CD44+ macrophages contained four- to five-fold higher levels of the endogenous peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) ligands 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), and 13-HODE compared with CD44- macrophages. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that ADRB3 agonist treatment upregulated expression of ALOX15, the lipoxygenase responsible for generating  and 13-HODE. Using an in vitro model of adipocyte efferocytosis, we found that IL-4-primed tissue macrophages accumulated lipid from dying fat cells and upregulated expression of Alox15. Furthermore, treatment of differentiating adipocytes with  and 13-HODE potentiated brown/beige adipogenesis. Collectively, these data indicate that noninflammatory removal of adipocyte remnants and coordinated generation of PPARγ ligands by M2 macrophages provides localized adipogenic signals to support de novo brown/beige adipogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15304744>Characterization of  pathway of linoleic acid 9-hydroperoxide in cytosolic fraction of potato tubers and identification of reaction products.</a></h2><p>Potato tubers are shown to contain a unique lipoxygenase pathway to form 9-hydroperoxy-10,12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HPODE) from linoleic acid. Here, we report the  pathway of 9-HPODE in the cytosolic fraction and the characterization of enzymes involved in the conversion of metabolites. The analysis of enzymatic reaction products at pH 5.5 revealed the formation of 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid, , 9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid, 9,10,13-trihydroxy-11-octadecenoic acid, and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid. The cytosolic enzymes were separated by anion-exchange chromatography into two fractions E1 and E2, having molecular masses of 66 and 54 kDa, respectively. The enzyme fraction E1 only produced 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid, whereas E2 formed other products. The enzyme E1 showed higher reactivity with 13- and 9-hydroperoxide of alpha-linolenic acid than 9-HPODE, but no reaction with hydroxy fatty acids. In contrast, the enzyme E2 showed the highest reactivity with 9-HPODE, followed by hydroperoxides of alpha-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid. We also evaluated the antibacterial activity of hydroxy fatty acids against Erwinia carotovora T-29, a bacterium infecting potato tubers. Growth of the bacteria was suppressed more potently with 9- or 13-hydroxy fatty acids than dihydroxy or trihydroxy fatty acids, suggesting a role for the metabolites in the resistance of bacterial infection.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1448788>1-Deamino-8 D-arginine vasopressin decreases the production of 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid by endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>1-Deamino-8 D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) has been used effectively to normalize the bleeding time in various hemostatic disorders. In von Willebrand disease the reduction in bleeding time is due to the preferential release of large multimers of von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells. However, since the bleeding time correction in patients with uremia and liver disease is independent of the release of von Willebrand antigen and activity, other mechanisms of action of DDAVP need to be considered. Endothelial cells generate several thromborepellant factors including 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), an inhibitor of platelet adhesion to subendothelium. Using cultured fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells (FBAECs), we have investigated whether DDAVP modulates the production of 13-HODE. We have demonstrated that 14C-linoleic acid labeled FBAECs release several oxygenated derivatives of linoleic acid following a 120 min incubation in the presence of serum. One of these products was identified by chromatographic procedures as 13-HODE. The production of 13-HODE was decreased significantly by DDAVP (1-100 ng/ml) with maximal reduction (approx. 25%) seen at 1 ng/ml of DDAVP. While vehicle treated control FBAECs generated 6780 +/- 690 cpm of 13-HODE per 10(6) cells (mean +/- SE, n = 8), DDAVP treated FBAECs produced 4950 +/- 310 (P < 0.01), 5390 +/- 390 (P < 0.01), and 5720 +/- 410 cpm (P < 0.05) of 13-HODE at 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml DDAVP respectively. Our findings of a decrease in 13-HODE would explain the previously observed morphologic changes of increased platelet adhesion to subendothelium following DDAVP infusion and contributes to our understanding of the mode of action of this therapeutic agent in hemostatic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6414520> of linoleic acid by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase from adult and fetal blood vessels.</a></h2><p>Linoleic acid (18:2) is converted by prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase in particulate fractions and homogenates of fetal calf aorta to its 9- and 13-hydroperoxy metabolites. These intermediates are then either dehydrated to the corresponding oxo compounds or reduced to monohydroxy products. Alternatively, the hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acids can be converted to epoxyhydroxyoctadecenoic acids, which are hydrolyzed to trihydroxy metabolites by epoxide hydrolases present in both particulate and cytosolic fractions from aorta. Linoleic acid (Km, 442 microM) is a much poorer substrate for prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase than is arachidonic acid (20:4) (Km, 48 microM). However, the oxygenation of 18:2 by particulate fractions from aorta is linear with time for at least 5 min, whereas the oxygenation of 20:4 is linear for only 15 s. Arachidonic acid strongly inhibits the conversion of 18:2 to monohydroxy (ID50, 10 microM) and trihydroxy (ID50, 140 microM) products. Linoleic acid has a similar, but much weaker effect on the formation of 6-oxoprostaglandin F1 alpha from 20:4. Substantial amounts of both the monohydroxy (9-hydroxy-10, 12-octadecadienoic acid and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid) and trihydroxy (9,10,11-trihydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid, 9,10,13-trihydroxy-11-octadecenoic acid and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid) metabolites of 18:2 were shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be formed from endogenous substrate during incubation of slices of fetal calf aorta in physiological medium. This raises the possibility that some of these products or their hydroperoxy precursors may have some biological significance.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607715>Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling identifies alterations in salivary redox status and fatty acid metabolism in response to  and oxidative stress in periodontal disease.</a></h2><p>Periodontal diseases represent the most common chronic inflammatory diseases in humans and a major cause of tooth loss. Combining mass spectrometry-based ionomics and targeted lipidomics on fatty acid metabolites, we identified significant alterations in redox status and fatty acid metabolism in saliva in response to chronic  and oxidative stress in periodontal disease in a cohort of nonsmoker subjects with chronic periodontitis. For the first time, ionomic profiling of around 30 ions in saliva revealed significantly decreased levels of redox-active metal ions including Mn, Cu, and Zn in the periodontal group, which is consistent with decreased levels of superoxide dismutases in saliva and serum. A targeted lipidomic approach was employed to monitor the major metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in saliva. We observed increased levels of cyclooxygenase products including PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2α and TXB2, but decreased level of PGI2 in the periodontal group. A unique pattern of the lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid was observed with increased level of 5-HETE but decreased levels of 13-HODE and . Levels of salivary F2-isoprostanes, free radical lipid peroxidation products, and a gold standard for oxidative stress in vivo were also significantly elevated. Taking these data together, our study using multiple powerful omics techniques demonstrates that local redox alteration contributes significantly to periodontitis through the modulation of fatty acid metabolism in response to  and oxidative stress. This study highlights the importance of redox status in periodontitis and provides a rationale for preventing periodontal disease by dietary interventions aiming to restore redox balance.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In recent studies, we have shown that lipoproteins can modulate CCR2 expression and have identified native LDL as a positive regulator. In contrast, oxidized LDL (OxLDL), which is mainly formed in the aortic intima, reduces CCR2 expression, promotes monocyte retention, and may cause pathological accumulation of monocytes in the vessel wall. We now provide evidence that OxLDL reduces monocyte CCR2 expression by activating intracellular signaling  that may involve peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Receptor-mediated uptake of the lipoprotein particle was required and allows for delivery of the exogenous ligand to the nuclear receptor. The suppression of CCR2 expression by OxLDL was mediated by lipid components of OxLDL, such as the oxidized linoleic acid metabolites  and 13-HODE, known activators of PPARgamma. Modified apoB had no such effect. Consistent with a participation of the PPARgamma signaling pathway, BRL49653 reduced CCR2 expression in freshly isolated human monocytes ex vivo and in circulating mouse monocytes in vivo.

We previously have shown that ethanol increases mammary epithelial density through increased branching after dietary exposure during puberty in CD2/F1 mice. To extend these studies to parous mice in a breast cancer model, we used a transgenic mouse model of human parity-associated breast cancer, the FVB-MMTV-Her2/Neu mouse, which overexpresses wildtype EGFR2, resulting in constitutive activation of growth signaling in the mammary epithelium. Here we describe the short-term effects of ethanol feeding on progression through involution. Mice were fed diets supplemented with 0%, 0.5%, 1%, or 2% ethanol for 4, 9, or 14 d starting on day 21 of lactation (that is, at the start of natural postlactational involution). Unlike peripubertal mice exposed to ethanol, postlactational dams showed no changes in body weight; liver, spleen, and kidney weights; and pathology. Ethanol exposure had no effect on mammary gland lobular density and adipocyte size throughout involution. Likewise, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and serum oxidized lipid species were unchanged by diet, suggesting that ethanol feeding had no effect on local inflammation (leukocyte infiltration) or systemic inflammation (oxidized lipids). In conclusion, ethanol exposure of parous dams had no effect on mammary gland structure or the regression of the lactating mammary gland to a resting state. The period of involution that follows natural lactation appears to be refractory to developmental effects of ethanol on mammary epithelium.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8001259>Phospholipid peroxidation in tumor promoter-exposed mouse skin.</a></h2><p>We have investigated lipid peroxidation in the skin of CD1 mice following single or repeated topical applications of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). A substantial accumulation of hydroxyphospholipids, to levels 3-5 times control values, followed exposure to two or more TPA treatments (24-72 h intervals), whereas single applications were ineffective. Sodium borohydride reduction increased the yield of product by approximately 50%, suggesting the additional presence of phospholipid hydroperoxides in the oxidized lipids. Straight phase HPLC analysis of the constituent hydroxy fatty acids, followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, revealed that oxidized derivatives of linoleic acid, including 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (9- and 13-HODE), were the primary products. Stereochemical analysis showed ratios of S to R stereoisomers of 1.3 for 13-HODE and 1.27 for , which implied that TPA-induced peroxidation was primarily due to free radical oxidation, although a partial contribution of enzyme (lipoxygenase) activity is possible. The TPA-induced peroxidation was greater in the epidermis than in the dermis. Pre-exposure of mouse skin to the anti-inflammatory agent fluocinolone acetonide, antioxidants and enzyme (phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase) inhibitors lowered the peroxidation response to subsequent exposure to TPA.

Post-75-km cycling plasma levels of 13-HODE +  were not significantly correlated with increases in plasma cytokines but were positively correlated with postexercise F2-isoprostanes (r = 0.75, P < 0.001), linoleate (r = 0.54, P = 0.016), arachidate (r = 0.77, P < 0.001), 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoate (12,13-DiHOME) (r = 0.60, P = 0.006), dihomo-linolenate (r = 0.57, P = 0.011), and adrenate (r = 0.56, P = 0.013).

However, HODE activity at rat TRPV1 in comparison with the best established endovanilloid, anandamide, and its enantioselectivity and selectivity towards other TRP channels that are also abundant in sensory neurons have never been investigated.We studied the effect of 9(R)-HODE, 9(S)-HODE, (+/-)13-HODE, 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide and anandamide on [Ca(2+) ](i)  in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the rat or human recombinant TRPV1, or rat recombinant TRPV2, TRPA1 or TRPM8, and also the effect of 9(S)-HODE in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by calcium imaging.Anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide were the most potent endovanilloids at human TRPV1, whereas 9(S)-HODE was approximately threefold less efficacious and 75- and 3-fold less potent, respectively, and did not perform much better at rat TRPV1.

Since IL-1 induces more IL-1 release, the IL-1 action pathway may share some common second messengers with the IL-1 induction pathway. Therefore, we investigated whether cyclic AMP, protein kinase A and NF kappa B are involved in the induction of IL-1 beta release by human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HPBM) stimulated with a specific IL-1 beta inducer, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (). With regard to cyclic AMP, it peaked 30 min after  stimulation. A role for cyclic AMP in IL-1 beta induction was suggested since forskolin was sufficient to induce IL-1 beta release from HPBM.  stimulation of HPBM also activated an early peak of protein kinase A activity. A requirement of protein kinase A in IL-1 beta induction was suggested since -induced IL-1 beta release was inhibited with a selective protein kinase A inhibitor, Rp-isomer (IC50:5 microM). Lastly, to examine the role of NF kappa B, incubation of HPBM with a double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ds-oligo) bearing the NF kappa B consensus sequence produced a dose-dependent enhancement of -induced IL-1 beta release, whereas a ds-oligo containing an unrelated Oct-1 motif had no effect. These results suggest that NF kappa B plays a negative role in the IL-1 beta induction pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1906087>Evidence for a dominant role of lipoxygenase(s) in the oxidation of LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages.</a></h2><p>It has been suggested that the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a key event in atherogenesis.

In this study we examine the relative contributions of superoxide anions and cellular lipoxygenase (LO) in the modification of LDL by macrophages. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibited LDL oxidation by macrophages but only by 25%. Under the same conditions, several LO inhibitors (eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), piriprost, and A-64077) almost completely inhibited the modification of LDL by macrophages. SOD had a greater inhibitory effect on the modification of LDL by U937 cells and fibroblasts (32% and 64%, respectively) but again LO inhibitors had a much greater effect (79 to 100% inhibition). Incubation of [1-14C]linoleic acid with mouse peritoneal macrophages resulted in its conversion to a single more polar product coeluting with 13- and  by reverse phase HPLC. When the cells were preincubated with LO inhibitors, formation of this product was significantly inhibited.

It is now shown that the mechanism involves myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent use of multiple low-molecular-weight substrates in plasma, generating diffusible oxidant species. Addition of activated human neutrophils (from healthy subjects) to plasma (50%, vol/vol) resulted in the peroxidation of endogenous plasma lipids by catalase-, heme poison-, and ascorbate-sensitive , as assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric analysis of free and lipid-bound 9-HETE and . In marked contrast, neutrophils isolated from multiple subjects with MPO deficiency failed to initiate peroxidation of plasma lipids, but they did so after supplementation with isolated human MPO. MPO-dependent use of a low-molecular-weight substrate(s) in plasma for initiating lipid peroxidation was illustrated by demonstrating that the filtrate of plasma (10-kd MWt cutoff) could supply components required for low-density lipoprotein lipid peroxidation in the presence of MPO and H(2)O(2). Subsequent HPLC fractionation of plasma filtrate (10-kd MWt cutoff) by sequential column chromatography identified nitrite, tyrosine, and thiocyanate as major endogenous substrates and 17 beta-estradiol as a novel minor endogenous substrate in plasma for MPO in promoting peroxidation of plasma lipids.

Seven oxygenated  acids were identified, (A) 12,13-dihydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, (B) , (C) 13-hydroxy-9cis,11trans-octadecadienoic acid, (D) 9,10,13-trihydroxy-11trans-octadecenoic acid, (E) 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10trans,15cis-octadecadienoic acid, (F) 10-oxo-13-hydroxy-11trans-octadecenoic acid and (G) 12-oxo-13-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid, in wheat bran slurries. Our results are important for whole wheat food applications since oxygenated  acids can result in bitter flavors in the final product.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10988277>Troglitazone reduces reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and lipid peroxidation and improves flow-mediated vasodilatation in obese subjects.</a></h2><p>Because troglitazone has been shown to have antioxidant properties, we investigated whether troglitazone administration to obese subjects causes a reduction in (1) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and mononuclear cells (MNCs) and (2) lipid peroxidation as reflected in the plasma concentrations of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE). Seven obese subjects were given 400 mg/d troglitazone for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained before troglitazone administration and at weekly intervals thereafter. Insulin concentrations fell significantly at week 1 and remained low at weeks 2 and 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by PMNLs fell to 77.6+/-25.1% of the basal at week 1 and 47.9+/-41.1% at week 4 (P:<0.001). ROS generation by MNCs fell to 59.8+/-15.7% of the basal at week 1 and 35.1+/-17.6% at week 4 (P:<0.001).  and 13-HODE concentrations fell significantly from 787.4+/-52.4 and 713. 1+/-44.7 pg/mL to 720.4+/-66.7 (P:<0.004) and 675.2+/-65.0 pg/mL (P:<0.01) after 4 weeks, respectively. Postischemic dilatation of the brachial artery was measured by ultrasonography. The mean percent dilatation after forearm ischemia before and after troglitazone was 5.5+/-3.01% and 8.75+/-3.37% (P:<0.02), respectively. The percent increase in diameter after nitroglycerin was 17.08+/-1.18% before troglitazone, whereas it was 18.9+/-1.91% (P:<0.02) after troglitazone. We conclude that troglitazone has a potent and rapid biological inhibitory effect on ROS generation by PMNLs and MNCs and that it inhibits lipid peroxidation significantly.

Dermal fibroblasts untreated and treated with recombinant IL-1beta were incubated with exogenous labeled linoleic acid. A combination of high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used as the analytic technique. We found that dermal fibroblasts convert linoleic acid mainly into 13-hydroxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and 9-hydroxy-10-trans,12-cis-octadecadienoic acid (), 13(S)-HODE and 9(R)-HODE being the predominant enantiomers. IL-1beta increased the formation of both 13-HODE and  in a concentration-dependent manner with similar EC50 values as for prostanoid formation. This effect of IL-1beta on HODEs formation was concomitant with the expression of prostaglandin H-synthase-2. Formation of octadecanoids was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid and indomethacin. Dexamethasone, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide abolished the effect of IL-1beta on HODEs biosynthesis. Octadecanoid biosynthetic activity was associated with the microsomal fraction. Dermal fibroblasts incorporated [14C]- and [14C]-13-HODE into phospholipids, mainly into phosphatidylcholine. IL-1beta increased significantly the esterification of 13-HODE in all glycerophospholipids, the major increase being observed in phosphatidylinositol. These results indicate that prostaglandin H-synthase-2 is the enzyme responsible for the increase in the ability to form HODEs of dermal fibroblasts stimulated with IL-1beta.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30118859>Oxylipins in cerebrospinal fluid in clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Although oxylipins are involved in inflammation, data on these lipid mediators in multiple sclerosis are sparse.

Through this pathway (9Z,11E,13S)-13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD) is reduced to corresponding 13-hydroxy acid (13-HOD), which is in turn dehydrogenated into ketodiene (9Z,11E,13S)-13-oxo-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-KOD). Dehydrogenation of 13-HOD into 13-KOD was not dependent on the presence of either NAD or NADP, but was strongly dependent on the presence of oxygen. Under anoxic conditions, 13-HOD dehydrogenation was blocked, but addition of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol restored it. Sulfite addition fully suppressed the aerobic dehydrogenation of 13-HOD. Hydrogen peroxide is a by-product formed by the enzyme along with 13-KOD. These data suggest that the ketodiene biosynthesis in H. tuberosus tubers is catalyzed by flavin dehydrogenase. (9S,10E,12Z)- (9-HOD) is dehydrogenated by this enzyme as effectively as 13-HOD, while alpha-ketol, (9Z)-12-oxo-13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid, and ricinoleic acid did not act as substrates for dehydrogenase.

Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small lipid derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism.Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis).Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE,  and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis. Observed changes in oxylipin levels can be connected to activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolic pathways in malaria infected individuals compared to controls, and related to increased levels of all linoleic acid oxylipins in severe patients compared to uncomplicated ones. The endocannabinoids were extremely responsive to malaria infection with majority of this class of molecules found at higher levels in infected individuals compared to controls.It was possible to detect oxylipin and endocannabinoid molecules that can be potential biomarkers for differentiation between malaria infected individuals and controls and between different classes of malaria.

As key modulators of the inflammatory response, oxylipins have the potential to provide novel insights into the physiological response to surgery and the pathophysiology of post-operative complications. We aimed to investigate the effects of major surgery on longitudinal oxylipin profile.Adults patients undergoing elective laparoscopic or open colorectal resections were included. Primary outcomes were serum oxylipin profile quantified by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, serum white cell count and C-reactive protein concentration. Serum samples were taken at three time-points: pre-operative (day zero), early post-operative (day one) and late post-operative (day four/five).Some 55 patients were included, of which 33 (60%) underwent surgery that was completed laparoscopically. Pre-operative oxylipin profiles were characterised by marked heterogeneity but surgery induced a common shift resulting in more homogeneity at the early post-operative time-point. By the late post-operative phase, oxylipin profiles were again highly variable. This evolution was driven by time-dependent changes in specific oxylipins. Notably, the levels of several oxylipins with anti-inflammatory properties (15-HETE and four regioisomers of DHET) were reduced at the early post-operative point before returning to baseline by the late post-operative period. In addition, levels of the pro-inflammatory 11-HETE rose in the early post-operative phase while levels of anti-thrombotic mediators ( and 13-HODE) fell; concentrations of all three oxylipins then remained fairly static from early to late post-operative phases. Compared to those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, patients undergoing open surgery had lower levels of some anti-inflammatory oxylipins (8,9-DHET and 17-HDoHE) in addition to reduced concentrations of anti-thrombotic mediators ( and 13-HODE) with increased concentration of their pro-thrombotic counterpart (TxB2).Serum oxylipin profile is modified by surgical intervention and may even be sensitive to the degree of surgical trauma and therefore represents a novel descriptor of the surgical systemic inflammatory response.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9488997>Strong increase in hydroxy fatty acids derived from linoleic acid in human low density lipoproteins of atherosclerotic patients.</a></h2><p>Linoleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in human low density lipoproteins (LDL).

In this study the  content in the LDL of 19 obviously healthy volunteers and 17 atherosclerotic patients was investigated. The level of  obtained from LDL of young atherosclerotic patients (aged 36-47 years) was increased by a factor of 20 when compared with samples from healthy volunteers of the same age group. The content of  in the LDL of atherosclerotic patients aged between 69 and 94 years increased 30-100 fold when compared with young healthy individuals, but when compared with 'healthy' individuals of the same age group it was only 2-3 fold increased. Obviously, as individuals grow older LDL becomes more and more oxidized.

To investigate in vitro characteristics of cutaneous irritation, skin explants of rabbit and human origin were topically exposed to chemical irritants, after which the culture medium was analyzed for the presence of metabolites of both arachidonic and linoleic acid. In rabbits exposed to the potent irritant benzalkonium chloride, a direct relation was established between clinical signs of irritation and in vitro release of the proinflammatory mediator 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) by the exposed skin. Histological examination revealed varying degrees of epidermal damage. 12-HETE was also the predominant hydroxy fatty acid released in a dose-dependent way by rabbit skin cultures after in vitro exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), benzalkonium chloride (BC), and formaldehyde (FA). Human skin cultures released, in addition to 12-HETE, predominantly 15-HETE and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), omega-6 oxygenase products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. The irritant-induced release of hydroxy fatty acids was strongly inhibited by the lipoxygenase inhibitor eicosatetraynoic acid, indicating enzyme-mediated generation of these bioactive lipids. Comparison of hydroxy fatty acid release to more established markers of cytotoxicity (leakage of the cellular enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) revealed that increased levels of 13-HODE, , 12-HETE, and ALT were specific markers of cutaneous irritancy in rabbit skin cultures.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9707212>Normoxic ventilation after cardiac arrest reduces oxidation of brain lipids and improves neurological outcome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence that oxidative stress contributes to delayed neuronal death after global cerebral ischemia has led to reconsideration of the prolonged use of 100% ventilatory O2 following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. This study determined the temporal course of oxidation of brain fatty acyl groups in a clinically relevant canine model of cardiac arrest and resuscitation and tested the hypothesis that postischemic ventilation with 21% inspired O2, rather than 100% O2, results in reduced levels of oxidized brain lipids and decreased neurological impairment.Neurological deficit scoring and high performance liquid chromatography measurement of fatty acyl lipid oxidation were used in an established canine model using 10 minutes of cardiac arrest followed by resuscitation with different ventilatory oxygenation protocols and restoration of spontaneous circulation for 30 minutes to 24 hours.Significant increases in frontal cortex lipid oxidation occurred after 10 minutes of cardiac arrest alone with no reperfusion and after reperfusion for 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours (relative total 235-nm absorbing peak areas=7.1+/-0.7 SE, 17.3+/-2.7, 14.2+/-3.2, 16.1+/-1.0, and 14.0+/-0.8, respectively; n=4, P<0.05).

On the other hand, several reports showing that 8-HETE is also closely associated with keratinocyte differentiation raise a question concerning the role of 8S-LOX/8-HETE in skin carcinogenesis. To address that question, here we conducted a series of gain-of-function studies. Skin targeted loricrin 8S-LOX/C57BL/6J transgenic mice showed a more differentiated epidermal phenotype as well as a 64% reduced papilloma development in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis protocol. Forced expression of 8S-LOX in MT1/2 cells, a murine papilloma cell line, also caused a more differentiated appearance as well as keratin 1 expression. Overexpression of 8S-LOX in CH72 cells, a murine carcinoma cell line, inhibited cell proliferation by 30% in vitro and by 86% in in vivo xenografts. Exogenous addition of 5 muM 8-HETE to CH72 cells caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Finally, immunohistochemical analyses showed 8S-LOX protein expression was strictly confined to the differentiated compartment of mouse skin and throughout tumorigenesis.

On the other hand, acidification ameliorated the SRE activity but not the CRE and NFAT activities in zG2A-b-expressing cells. LPC or  did not modify any activity of either homolog. The substitution of histidine residue at the 174(th) position from the N-terminus of zG2A-a to asparagine residue attenuated proton-induced CRE and NFAT activities but not SRE activity. The substitution of arginine residue at the 32nd position from the N-terminus of zG2A-a to the alanine residue also attenuated its high and the proton-induced CRE and NFAT activities. On the contrary, the substitution did not attenuate SRE activity. The substitution of the arginine residue at the 10th position from the N-terminus of zG2A-b to the alanine residue also did not attenuate its high or the proton-induced SRE activity. These results indicate that zebrafish G2A homologs were activated by protons but not by LPC and , and the activation mechanisms of the homologs were similar to those of human G2A.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The major products are erythro-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, threo-11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-9-octadecenoic acid, 9,12,13-trihydroxy-10-octadecenoic acid, 13-keto-9,11-octadecadienoic acid, and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid. Several minor products have also been identified, including 9-hydroxy-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid, 11-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-12-octadecenoic acid, , and 9-keto-10,12-octadecadienoic acid. Oxygen labeling studies indicate that the observed products arise by at least two . In the major pathway, hematin reduces 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid by one electron to an alkoxyl radical that cyclizes to an adjacent double bond to form an epoxy allylic radical. The allylic radical either couples to the hydroxyl radical coordinated to hematin or diffuses from the solvent cage and couples to O2, forming a peroxyl radical. In the minor pathway, the hydroperoxide is oxidized by one electron to a 13-peroxyl radical that undergoes beta-scission to a pentadienyl radical and O2. Exchange of hydroperoxide-derived O2 for dissolved O2 occurs at this stage followed by coupling of O2 to either terminus of the pentadienyl radical. Both  of hydroperoxide  generate significant quantities of peroxyl radicals that epoxidize the isolated double bonds of dihydroaromatic molecules. The products of hydroperoxide reaction with hematin and the oxygen labeling patterns are very similar to the products of unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxide  by platelets, aorta, and lung. Our results not only provide a mechanism for the formation of a series of mammalian metabolites of linoleic and arachidonic acids but also offer an estimate of the yield of peroxyl radicals generated during the process.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2176862> of 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and other hydroxylated fatty acids by the reductase pathway in porcine polymorphonuclear leukocytes.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that porcine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) reduce leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to 10,11-dihydro-LTB4, 10,11-dihydro-12-epi-LTB4, and 10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-LTB4 [Wainwright et al.

We have now demonstrated that 12(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid [12(S)-HETE] is metabolized by a similar pathway in porcine PMNL. 12(S)-HETE was metabolized to two products that were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as 12-hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid (10,11-dihydro-12-HETE) and 12-oxo-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid (10,11-dihydro-12-oxo-ETE). Derivatization of 12-hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid with (R)-(+)-alpha-methoxy-alpha-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid, followed by chromatography on a silicic acid column, enabled the resolution of 12R and 12S stereoisomers, which were identified by cochromatography with synthetic standards. Incubation of 12(S)-HETE with PMNL for various times revealed that the stereochemistry of the 12-hydroxyl group of 12-hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid was initially the same as that of 12(S)-HETE. However, after 40 min, 30% of the 12-hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid had the opposite configuration at C12. 13-Hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) was metabolized in a similar fashion by porcine PMNL to 13-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid (11,12-dihydro-13-HODE) and 13-oxooctadecenoic acid (11,12-dihydro-13-oxo-ODE). The apparent Km values for the reduction of 12-HETE, LTB4, and 13-HODE were 0.21, 0.28, and 2.22 microM, respectively. All three substrates had the same apparent Vmax [0.029 pmol min-1 (10(6) cells)-1]. Competition experiments between LTB4 and 12-HETE indicated that they were metabolized by the same pathway. Various structurally related compounds were metabolized by porcine PMNL in the order LTB4 = 6-trans-LTB4 greater than 12-epi-6-trans,8-cis-LTB4 greater than 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 greater than 12-HETE greater than LTB5 greater than 15-HETE = 13-HODE much greater than 5-HETE greater than  greater than 20-hydroxy-LTB4 greater than 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid.

One of the differentially expressed (up-regulated) cDNA fragments was found to contain sequences corresponding to monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3). The stimulatory effect of the oxLDL on the expression of MCP-3 mRNA was both time- and dose-dependent. Treatment with GF109203X and genistein, inhibitors of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase, respectively, had no effect on the induction of MCP-3 mRNA by oxLDL, while treatment with cycloheximide inhibited the induction. The induction was reproduced by the lipid components in oxLDL such as  and 13-HODE, which are known to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Introduction of an endogenous PPARgamma ligand, 15d-PGJ2, in the culture of THP-1 cells resulted in the induction of MCP-3 gene expression. Furthermore, analyses of human atherosclerotic plaques revealed that the expressional pattern of MCP-3 in the regions of neointimal and necrotic core overlapped with that of PPARgamma.

However, this connection cannot be entirely explained by dyslipidemia accompanied by SCH. Lipid peroxidation also plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate oxidative stress in SCH patients, as measured according to concentrations of hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs) and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) in both plasma and low density lipoproteins (LDL).The concentrations of HODEs and HETEs in both LDL and plasma were examined in euthyroid (n = 10), mild SCH (4.5 ≤ TSH < 10 mU/L, n = 10), and significant SCH (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L, n = 10) subjects, using a liquid chromatograph-electrospray ionization- mass spectrometer. Then, we explored the relationship among LDL oxidation, TSH levels, and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a biomarker of subclinical atherosclerosis.Serum LDL-C levels and mean-IMT in the significant SCH group were higher than in the euthyroid group (p < 0.05). The HODE and HETE concentrations clearly increased in the significant SCH patients compared with the euthyroid subjects, but there was no difference between the mild SCH and euthyroid groups. Among all subjects, linear and significant positive correlations were identified between TSH and mean-IMT after adjustment for confounding factors (r = 0.480, p = 0.018). Both  (r = 0.376, p = 0.041) and 13-HODE (r = 0.447, p = 0.013) in LDL were linearly and positively correlated with TSH. The concentrations of HODEs (both  and 13-HODE) in LDL were much higher in the thickened IMT group than in the normal IMT group (p =  .017 and 0.015, respectively). HODEs in LDL were also positively associated with mean-IMT.Our findings showed that lipid peroxidation was higher in the significant SCH patients than in the euthyroid subjects, which suggested that qualitative as well as quantitative changes in serum lipids resulting from SCH may add to atherosclerosis risk.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26408952>Metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in early stages of non-alcoholic  disease--A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of  conditions related to fat infiltration.

Very few studies relate to the functional effects of oxidized HDL on platelets in type 2 diabetes (T2D).The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of in vitro glycoxidized HDL and HDL from patients with T2D on platelet aggregation and arachidonic acid signaling cascade. At the same time, the contents of hydroxylated  acids were assessed in HDL.Compared with control HDL, in vitro glycoxidized HDL had decreased proportions of linoleic (LA) and arachidonic (AA) acids in phospholipids and cholesteryl esters, and increased concentrations of hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids ( and 13-HODE) and 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), derived from LA and AA respectively, especially hydroxy derivatives esterified in phospholipids. Glycoxidized HDL dose-dependently decreased collagen-induced platelet aggregation by binding to scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI). Glycoxidized HDL prevented collagen-induced increased phosphorylation of platelet p38 MAPK and cytosolic phospholipase A2, as well as intracellular calcium mobilization.

In this randomized and double-blinded crossover study, we investigated the systemic effect on bioactive lipid metabolite levels after controlled biodiesel exhaust exposure of healthy humans and compared it to filtered air at a separate exposure occasion. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins, as well as endocannabinoids and related lipids, were quantified in plasma from 14 healthy volunteers at baseline and at three subsequent time points (2, 6, and 24 h) after 1 h exposure sessions. Protocols based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods were developed to detect temporal changes in circulating levels after biodiesel exhaust exposure. The exhaust was generated by a diesel engine fed with an undiluted rapeseed methyl ester fuel. Among the 51 analyzed lipid metabolites, PGF, 9,10-DiHOME, , 5-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and DEA displayed significant responsiveness to the biodiesel exhaust exposure as opposed to filtered air. Of these,  and 5-HETE at 24 h survived the 10% false discovery rate cutoff (p < 0.003). Hence, the majority of the responsive lipid metabolites were monohydroxy  acids. We conclude that it is possible to detect alterations in circulating bioactive lipid metabolites in response to biodiesel exhaust exposure using LC-MS/MS, with emphasis on metabolites with inflammation related properties and implications on cardiovascular health and disease.

One major  fate of 13-HODE is oxidation to the 2,4-dienone, 13-oxooctadecadienoic acid by an NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase (13-HODE dehydrogenase). The present work describes the partial purification and characterization of 13-HODE dehydrogenase from rat liver cytosol. The enzyme was purified using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, as well as hydroxylapatite, gel permeation, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Analysis of the most purified preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates two subunits of approximately 55 kDa, suggesting the possibility of a heterodimeric enzyme. However, due to aggregation in the purified preparation, an accurate molecular mass for the native enzyme has not yet been obtained. Using 13-HODE as a substrate, the purified enzyme has a Km of 6.3 microM and a Vmax of 5.7 nmol/min/mg. More importantly, the enzyme has a narrow substrate specificity with 13-HODE being the preferred substrate. From a series of 17 potential substrates, only  (53% the activity of 13-HODE) and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (64% the activity of 13-HODE) showed significant activity as substrates. A number of other unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids, including several eicosanoids, are not substrates.

A link has been established between respiratory exposure to vehicular emissions and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms driving this interaction remain unknown. Chronic inhalation exposure to mixed vehicle emissions has been linked to CVD in animal models. This study evaluated the temporal effects of acute exposure to mixed vehicle emissions (MVE; mixed gasoline and diesel emissions) on potentially active metabolites in the serum of exposed mice. C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to a single 6-hour exposure to filtered air (FA) or MVE (100 or 300 μg/m(3)) by whole body inhalation. Immediately after and 18 hours after the end of the exposure period, animals were sacrificed for serum and tissue collection. Serum was analyzed for metabolites that were differentially present between treatment groups and time points. Changes in metabolite levels suggestive of increased oxidative stress (oxidized glutathione, cysteine disulfide, taurine), lipid peroxidation (13-HODE, ), energy metabolism (lactate, glycerate, branched chain amino acid catabolites, butrylcarnitine, fatty acids), and  (DiHOME, palmitoyl ethanolamide) were observed immediately after the end of exposure in the serum of animals exposed to MVE relative to those exposed to FA. By 18 hours post exposure, serum metabolite differences between animals exposed to MVE versus those exposed to FA were less pronounced.

Using a low-endotoxin in vitro system, we observed that Ox-LDL but not native LDL induced the production, by both freshly adherent human peripheral blood monocytes and human monocytic THP-1 cells, of the alpha chemokine interleukin (IL)-8, a potent chemoattractant for T lymphocytes. Marked IL-8 induction by Ox-LDL did not require IL-1 beta generation in THP-1 cells. Ox-LDL-induced chemokine production was selective, as Ox-LDL did not stimulate the production by THP-1 cells of the T-lymphocyte chemotactic beta chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha. IL-8 induction increased in proportion to the extent of oxidation of LDL as measured by the content of lipid oxidation end products. To identify potentially active components of Ox-LDL, we tested malondialdehyde, an arachidonate-derived lipid oxidation product, and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, an oxidation product of linoleate, the major polyunsaturated fatty acid in LDL, and observed that they induced IL-8 generation in the absence of Ox-LDL. Furthermore, when most free lipid oxidation products were removed from Ox-LDL by dialysis, some IL-8-inducing activity was released into the dialysate. However, the major IL-8-inducing activity was not dialyzable. To address the nature of the LDL particle modification required to induce IL-8, acetylated or malondialdehyde-treated native LDL particles were monitored for activity.

As major products of linoleic acid oxidation, racemic hydroxy linoleate isomers were detected in the lesional ester lipids. In human lesions, the hydroxy linoleic acid/linoleic acid ratio was about 0.5%, a result indicating that 5 out of 1000 linoleate residues are present as hydroxylated derivatives. In umbilical veins, no hydroxy linoleic acid could be detected. These data show that human atherosclerotic lesions contain increased amounts of hydroxy linoleic acid isomers and isoprostanes when compared with nonatherosclerotic vessel wall and suggest a link between local lipid peroxidation and progression of atherosclerosis.

In a recent study, we provided evidence that infestation of Arabidopsis thaliana foliage by the green peach aphid (GPA; Myzus persicae), a phloem sap-consuming insect, was promoted by plant LOX5-derived oxylipins. In comparison to the wild-type (WT) plant, GPA population was smaller on the Arabidopsis lox5 mutant. The insect spent less time feeding from the sieve element and xylem of the lox5 mutant compared with the WT plant. In addition, compared with insects feeding on the WT plant, when on the lox5 mutant, the GPA was unable to suppress an antibiotic activity that is present in Arabidopsis vascular sap. Roots are the critical source of a LOX5-derived oxylipin(s) that promotes colonization of the foliage by GPA.

We further demonstrate that the host plant requires LOX5 function to promote expression of the defense regulatory gene PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4 in the foliage. Taken together, our previous observations and results presented here indicate that while the host plant utilizes LOX5-dependent factors for promoting defense mechanisms, GPA has evolved to utilize plant 9-LOX-derived oxylipins as cues to facilitate infestation, thus suggesting a complex involvement of oxylipins in Arabidopsis interaction with GPA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23278358>The contribution of the endogenous TRPV1 ligands  and 13-HODE to nociceptive processing and their role in peripheral inflammatory pain mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) plays a fundamental role in the detection of heat and inflammatory pain responses.

Following exposure to linoleic acid, 9- and 13-HODE were detected in DRGs and TRPV1 antagonist-sensitive calcium responses evoked, which were blocked by the 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor PD146176 and an anti-13-HODE antibody. Levels of linoleic acid were significantly increased in the carrageenan-inflamed hindpaw (P < 0.05), whereas levels of 9- and 13-HODE were, however, decreased. Intraplantar co-administration of anti-9- and 13-HODE antibodies and treatment with PD146176 significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia.This study demonstrates that, although 9- and 13-HODE can activate TRPV1 in DRG cell bodies, the evidence for a role of these lipids as endogenous peripheral TRPV1 ligands in a model of inflammatory pain is at best equivocal.© 2012 The Authors.

Moreover, oxylipins are readily detectable in plasma, and certain subsets of oxylipins have been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions. Taken together, we set out to produce a detailed quantitative assessment of plasma and plaque oxylipins in a widely used model of atherosclerosis, to identify potential biomarkers of disease progression. We administered regular chow or regular chow supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol (HC) to male New Zealand white rabbits for 12 weeks to induce hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Our targeted lipidomic analyses of oxylipins on plaques isolated from rabbits fed the HC diet detected 34 oxylipins, 28 of which were in compliance with our previously established quality control acceptance criteria. The arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite derived from the COX pathway, 6-keto-PGF1α was the most abundant plaque oxylipin, followed by the linoleic acid (LA) metabolites , 13-HODE and 9,12,13-TriHOME and the arachidonic acid (AA)-derivatives 11-HETE and 12-HETE. We additionally found that the most abundant oxylipins in plasma were three of the five most abundant oxylipins in plaque, namely 11-HETE, 13-HODE, and . The studies reported here make the first step towards a comprehensive characterization of oxylipins as potentially translatable biomarkers of atherosclerosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164225>Inducible expression of 15-lipoxygenase-2 and 8-lipoxygenase inhibits cell growth via common signaling .</a></h2><p>Human 15-lipoxygenase (LOX)-2 and mouse 8-LOX represent orthologous members of the LOX family but display different positional specificities and tissue distribution. To study the functional role of 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX in keratinocytes, an inducible Tet-On gene expression system was established in the premalignant mouse keratinocyte cell line 308. Doxycycline (dox)-induced expression of enzymatically active 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX led to an inhibition of cell growth that was associated with an inhibition of DNA synthesis, as shown by a 15-46% reduction of 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation. The inhibitory effects were increased in the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid. In contrast, addition of linoleic acid or the LOX inhibitor baicalein reversed the growth-inhibitory effects. Treatment of the cells with 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) or 8-HETE resulted in a similar inhibition of BrdU incorporation, whereas 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) and , in contrast, had no effects. Dox-induced keratinocytes showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinases, completely abolished the LOX-induced growth inhibition, indicating a critical role of ROS and p38. Our data suggest that 15-LOX-2 and 8-LOX, although displaying different positional specificity, may use common signaling  to induce growth inhibition in premalignant epithelial cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9219348>Increased levels of lipid oxidation products in low density lipoproteins of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p> () and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) are accumulated in the low density lipoproteins of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for a factor of 20-50 compared to healthy individuals of the same age.

Moreover, we identify two of the major oxidized lipid components of oxLDL,  and 13-HODE, as endogenous activators and ligands of PPARgamma. Our data suggest that the biologic effects of oxLDL are coordinated by two sets of receptors, one on the cell surface, which binds and internalizes the particle, and one in the nucleus, which is transcriptionally activated by its component lipids.

Oxidative stress may be a hallmark of X-ALD. In the plasma of X-ALD patients with different forms of the disease, characterized by high levels of C24:0 and C26:0, we observed the presence of oxidative stress revealed by decreased levels of GSH, α-tocopherol, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We showed that oxidative stress caused the oxidation of cholesterol and linoleic acid, leading to the formation of cholesterol oxide derivatives oxidized at C7 (7-ketocholesterol (7KC), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7β-OHC), and 7α-hydroxycholesrol (7α-OHC)) and of 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (, 13-HODE), respectively. High levels of 7KC, 7β-OHC, 7α-OHC,  and 13-HODE were found. As 7KC induces oxidative stress,  and cell death, which could play key roles in the development of X-ALD, the impact of 7KC on the peroxisomal status was determined in microglial BV-2 cells. Indeed, environmental stress factors such as 7KC could exacerbate peroxisomal dysfunctions in microglial cells and thus determine the progression of the disease. 7KC induces oxiapoptophagy in BV-2 cells: overproduction of HO and O, presence of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation; elevated [LC3-II/LC3-I] ratio, increased p62 levels. 7KC also induces several peroxisomal modifications: decreased Abcd1, Abcd2, Abcd3, Acox1 and/or Mfp2 mRNA and protein levels, increased catalase activity and decreased Acox1-activity. However, the Pex14 level was unchanged. It is suggested that high levels of 7KC in X-ALD patients could foster generalized peroxisomal dysfunction in microglial cells, which could in turn intensify brain damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the source of this lipid, owing to the uptake of oxidised LDL by scavenger receptors. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) released by leukocytes during inflammation produces oxidants that are implicated in atherosclerosis. Modification of LDL by the MPO oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), results in extensive lipid accumulation by macrophages. However, the reactivity of the other major MPO oxidant, hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN) with LDL is poorly characterised, which is significant given that thiocyanate is the favoured substrate for MPO. In this study, we comprehensively compare the reactivity of HOCl and HOSCN with LDL, and show key differences in the profile of oxidative damage observed. HOSCN selectively modifies Cys residues on apolipoprotein B100, and oxidises cholesteryl esters resulting in formation of lipid hydroperoxides,  () and F2-isoprostanes. The modification of LDL by HOSCN results macrophage lipid accumulation, though generally to a lesser extent than HOCl-modified LDL. This suggests that a change in the ratio of HOSCN:HOCl formation by MPO from variations in plasma thiocyanate levels, will influence the nature of LDL oxidation in vivo, and has implications for the progression of atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dietary fat plays an important role in alcoholic liver disease pathogenesis. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of ethanol and a diet rich in linoleic acid (LA) leads to the increased production of oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs), specifically 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), which contribute to a hepatic proinflammatory response exacerbating liver injury. Mice were fed unsaturated (with a high LA content) or saturated fat diets (USF and SF, respectively) with or without ethanol for 10 days, followed by a single binge of ethanol. Compared to SF+ethanol, mice fed USF+ethanol had elevated plasma alanine transaminase levels, enhanced hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and . Plasma and liver levels of 9- and 13-HODEs were increased in response to USF+ethanol feeding. We demonstrated that primarily , but not 13-HODE, induced the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines in vitro in RAW264.7 macrophages. Finally, deficiency of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase, a major enzyme involved in LA oxidation and OXLAM production, attenuated liver injury and  caused by USF+ethanol feeding but had no effect on hepatic steatosis. This study demonstrates that OXLAM-mediated induction of a proinflammatory response in macrophages is one of the potential mechanisms underlying the progression from alcohol-induced steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

These four oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) have been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions. Therefore, their accurate measurement may provide mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis. Here we present a novel quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOFMS) method for quantitation and identification of target OXLAMs in rat plasma. In this method, the esterified OXLAMs were base-hydrolyzed and followed by liquid-liquid extraction. Quantitative analyses were based on one-point standard addition with isotope dilution. The Q-TOFMS data of target metabolites were acquired and multiple reaction monitoring extracted-ion chromatograms were generated post-acquisition with a 10 ppm extraction window. The limit of quantitation was 9.7-35.9 nmol/L depending on the metabolite. The method was reproducible with a coefficient of variation of <18.5%. Mean concentrations of target metabolites in rat plasma were 57.8, 123.2, 218.1 and 57.8 nmol/L for , 13-HODE, 9-oxoODE and 13-oxoODE, respectively. Plasma levels of total OXLAMs were 456.9 nmol/L, which correlated well with published concentrations obtained by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The concentrations were also obtained utilizing a standard addition curve approach. The calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients of >0.991. Concentrations of , 13-HODE, 9-oxoODE and 13-oxoODE were 84.0, 138.6, 263.0 and 69.5 nmol/L, respectively, which were consistent with the results obtained from one-point standard addition. Target metabolites were simultaneously characterized based on the accurate Q-TOFMS data. This is the first study of secondary LA metabolites using Q-TOFMS. Published 2012.

These effects are reversed by supplementation of the MR diet with cysteine (MRC). Genomic and metabolomic studies were conducted to identify potential mechanisms by which MR induces favorable  effects, and that are reversed by cysteine supplementation.Gene expression was examined by microarray analysis and TaqMan quantitative PCR. Levels of selected proteins were measured by Western blot and  intermediates were analyzed by mass spectrometry.MR increased lipid  in inguinal adipose tissue and quadriceps muscle while it decreased lipid synthesis in liver. In inguinal adipose tissue, MR not only caused the transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis but also of Lpin1, Pc, Pck1 and Pdk1, genes that are associated with glyceroneogenesis. MR also upregulated lipolysis-associated genes in inguinal fat and led to increased oxidation in this tissue, as suggested by higher levels of methionine sulfoxide and 13-HODE +  compared to control-fed (CF) rats. Moreover, MR caused a trend toward the downregulation of inflammation-associated genes in inguinal adipose tissue. MRC reversed most gene and metabolite changes induced by MR in inguinal adipose tissue, but drove the expression of Elovl6, Lpin1, Pc, and Pdk1 below CF levels. In liver, MR decreased levels of a number of long-chain fatty acids, glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate corresponding with the gene expression data. Although MR increased the expression of genes associated with carbohydrate , levels of glycolytic intermediates were below CF levels. MR, however, stimulated gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in liver tissue. As previously reported, sulfur amino acids derived from methionine were decreased in liver by MR, but homocysteine levels were elevated. Increased liver homocysteine levels by MR were associated with decreased cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) protein levels and lowered vitamin B6 and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MeTHF) content. Finally, MR upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) gene and protein levels in both liver and adipose tissues. MRC reversed some of MR's effects in liver and upregulated the transcription of genes associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis such as Cxcl16, Cdh17, Mmp12, Mybl1, and Cav1 among others. In quadriceps muscle, MR upregulated lipid -associated genes and increased 3-hydroxybutyrate levels suggesting increased fatty acid oxidation as well as stimulation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in this tissue.Increased lipid  in inguinal adipose tissue and quadriceps muscle, decreased triglyceride synthesis in liver and the downregulation of inflammation-associated genes are among the factors that could favor the lean phenotype and increased insulin sensitivity observed in MR rats.Copyright © 2012 S.

LOX represents the starting enzyme of the octadecanoid pathway. The aim of the work was to purify LOX from California poppy ( Cham.), to determine its biochemical properties and to identify and quantify the products of LOX reaction with unsaturated fatty acids.LOX from California poppy seedlings was purified by hydrophobic chromatography (Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B) and by ion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose). The isolated LOX was incubated with linoleic acid used as a substrate. The HPLC experiments were performed with the Agilent Technologies 1050 series HPLC system. For the preparative separation of a mixture of hydroxy fatty acids from the sample matrix, the RP-HPLC method was used (column 120-5 Nucleosil C18). Then, the NP-HPLC analysis (separation, identification, and determination) of hydroxy fatty acid isomers was carried out on a Zorbax Rx-SIL column.The purified LOX indicates the presence of a nontraditional plant enzyme with dual positional specificity (a ratio of 9- and 13-hydroperoxide products 1:1), a relative molecular mass of 85 kDa, a pH optimum of 6.5, an increasing activity stimulation by CaCl₂ till 2 mM, and a high substrate reactivity to linoleic acid with kinetic values of K 2.6 mM and V 3.14 μM/min/mg.For the first time, the LOX from California poppy seedlings was partially purified and the biochemical properties of the enzyme were analyzed. A dual positional specificity of the LOX found from California poppy seedlings is in agreement with the results obtained for LOXs isolated from other Papaveraceaes.

To examine the mechanism by which Mn elicits its toxic response, we have selected the rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) as our model system because it possesses much of the biochemical machinery associated with dopaminergic neurons. Mn-induced PC12 cell death is both time and concentration dependent with approximately 50% cell survival at 48 hr in the presence of 0.3 mM Mn. To determine whether oxidative stress contributed to cytotoxicity induced by Mn, lipid peroxidation was assessed in Mn-treated in PC12 cells. The highly sensitive HPLC assay that measures the lipid peroxide product, , was used and results of these experiments demonstrate there was no increase in the lipid peroxidation in cells exposed to 0.3 mM Mn for 24 hr. Mn was found to stimulate the activation of the apoptotic marker proteins, p38 and caspase-3 within the first 24 hr of treatment. The selective inhibitor of caspase-3, DEVD-CHO, and the nonselective caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, however, fail to prevent Mn-induced PC12 cell death. Studies were performed to determine the role of mitochondria in initiating or supporting Mn cytotoxicity, because Mn has been reported to cause changes in membrane permeability. Mn caused a decrease in ATP levels in PC12 cells in both a time and concentration dependent manner. We hypothesize that both apoptosis and necrosis contribute to PC12 cell death although the necrotic events prevail even when the apoptotic signaling is inhibited.Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7744301>Lipoxygenase products in human saliva: patients with oral cancer compared to controls.</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase products were quantified in human mixed saliva and in saliva fractions obtained from a parotid or submandibular gland using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and stable isotope dilution.

Healthy premenopausal women were followed for ≤2 menstrual cycles, with biomarkers of lipid peroxidation being assessed ≤8 times per cycle. Metals were measured at baseline in whole blood. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the association between cadmium, lead, and mercury and lipid peroxidation biomarkers. Median cadmium, lead, and mercury levels were 0.30 μg/L, 0.86 μg/dL, and 1.10 μg/L, respectively.

We have investigated whether reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and other indexes of oxidative damage in the body fall with short-term dietary restriction and weight loss. Nine nondiabetic obese subjects (body mass index, 32.5-64.4 kg/m(2)), not taking any antioxidants, were put on a 1000-Cal diet. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks and at 12 weeks after the cessation of dietary restriction. Blood samples were also obtained at 1 and 2 h after administration of 75 g oral glucose at 0 and 4 weeks. Mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated, and reactive oxygen species generation was measured. Plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine as indexes of oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and amino acids, respectively, were measured. Antioxidant vitamins were measured as indexes of antioxidant reserves. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also measured. Mean weight loss was 2.4 +/- 0.6 kg at week 1, 2.5 +/- 1.7 kg at week 2, 3.9 +/- 0.8 kg at week 3, and 4.5 +/- 2.8 kg at week 4 (P < 0.05). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN fell from 236.4 +/- 95.8 to 150.9 +/- 69.0, 125.9 +/- 24.3, 96.0 +/- 39.9, and 103.1 +/- 35.7 mV at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P < 0.001). It increased 3 months after the cessation of dietary restriction to 270.0 +/- 274.3 mV. Reactive oxygen species generation by MNC fell from 187.8 +/- 75.0 to 101.7 +/- 64.5, 86.9 +/- 42.8, 63.8 +/- 14.3, and 75.1 +/- 32.2 mV and increased thereafter to 302.0 +/- 175.5 mV at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 16 weeks, respectively (P < 0.005). Reactive oxygen species generation by PMN and MNC increased in response to glucose; the relative increase was greater at 4 weeks than that at week 0 due to a fall in the basal levels of reactive oxygen species generation. Consistent with the fall in reactive oxygen species generation, there was a reduction in plasma TBARS from 1.68 +/- 0.17 micromol/L at week 0 to 1.47 micromol/L at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 56.4 +/- 36.1% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05), and the  to linoleic acid ratio fell from a baseline of 100% to 60.5 +/- 37.7% at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Carbonylated proteins fell from 1.39 +/- 0.27 microgram/mg protein at week 0 to 1.17 +/- 0.12 microgram/mg protein at week 4 (P < 0.05); o-tyrosine fell from 0.42 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.36 +/- 0.02 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.005), and m-tyrosine fell from 0.45 +/- 0.04 mmol/mol phenylalanine at week 0 to 0.40 +/- 0.03 mmol/mol phenylalanine at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The basal concentrations of TBARS, , 13-HODE, carbonylated proteins, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in the obese were significantly greater than those in normal subjects. On the other hand, tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations did not change during this 4-week period, nor was there any change in antioxidant vitamins. This is the first demonstration of 1) an increase in reactive oxygen species-induced damage in lipids, proteins, and amino acids in the obese compared with normal subjects; and 2) a decrease in reactive oxygen species generation by leukocytes and oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and amino acids after dietary restriction and weight loss in the obese over a short period.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6775354> of linoleic and arachidonic acids in VX2 carcinoma tissue: identification of monohydroxy octadecadienoic acids and monohydroxy eicosatetraenoic acids.</a></h2><p>The  of arachidonic and linoleic acids by VX2 carcinoma tissue in vitro was determined.

Linoleic acid was converted to a mixture of 9-hydroxy-10, 12-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODD) and 13-hydroxy-9, 11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODD). The conversion of linoleic acid to monohydroxy C-18 fatty acids varied from 40-80% 9-HODD and 20-60% 13-HODD in tumor tissue harvested from different animals. The quantity of monohydroxy C-18 fatty acids biosynthesized by VX2 carcinoma tissue from endogenous linoleic acid equals or exceeds that of prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis from endogenous arachidonic acid. The presence of a hydroxyl group adjacent to a conjugated diene suggest that the monohydroxy C-18 and monohydroxy C-20 fatty acids were formed via the action of lipoxygenase-like enzymes. These lipoxygenase-like reactions are inhibited by indomethacin in a concentration-dependent fashion similar to the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis. The enzymes catalyzing the lipoxygenase-like reactions of linoleic and arachidonic acids are localized in the microsomal fraction of VX2 carcinoma tissue. These data suggest that the lipoxygenase-like reactions are catalyzed by fatty acid cyclooxygenase and that there are two major  of fatty acid cyclooxygenase  of polyenoic fatty acids in the neoplastic tissue. One pathway involves the formation of prostaglandin E2 via cyclic endoperoxy intermediates.

G2A is reported to have proton-sensing activity that mediates intracellular inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation with decreasing pH. We previously showed that G2A is also activated by some oxidized free fatty acids such as 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (). In this study, we identified a novel alternative splice variant of G2A (G2A-b) that has a partially different N terminus compared with the G2A originally reported (G2A-a). The two splice variants of G2A show similar tissue distributions, but G2A-b is expressed more abundantly. There was no difference between the two variants in -induced cellular responses, such as intracellular calcium mobilization and GDP/GTP exchange of Galpha protein, and in proton-sensitive IP accumulation. However, G2A-b showed a higher basal activity in terms of IP accumulation. Mutagenesis study revealed that the difference in the basal activity is attributable to the K7 residue that exists only in G2A-a. We further demonstrated that an R42A mutation largely impaired both the basal and proton-sensing activities, but did not affect the -induced intracellular calcium increase. Taken together, we found an additional novel G2A variant (G2A-b) that is the major transcript with functional response to ligand stimulation as well as G2A-a, and succeeded in discriminating proton-sensing and oxidized fatty acid-sensing activities of G2A.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8178971>13-HODE increases intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle cells.</a></h2><p>13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) (2 microM) consistently increased porcine aortic and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), whereas  and linoleic acid had no significant effect in the aortic cells and a much lesser effect in the pulmonary artery cells.

Internal standards consisting of 18O2-labeled analogs of 9- and 13-HODE are added to pulverized frozen tissue prior to extraction with ethanol. Nonlipid materials are removed in a chloroform/methanol/water step. The remaining lipid material is methylated with ethereal diazomethane, and much of the nonoxygenated fatty acid methyl esters are removed via silica solid-phase extraction. Samples are either further derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide to form the trimethylsilyl ethers for quantitative analysis by GC-MS or are analyzed as the methyl esters by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the enantiomeric distribution of the 9- and 13-HODE. The extraction and quantitation protocol was applied to the analysis of mammary glands for free 9- and 13-HODE from mice fed isocaloric diets containing 20% corn oil, 5% corn oil, or 20% beef tallow. Chiral analysis of the products showed higher production of 13(S)-HODE relative to 13(R)-HODE; the enantiomeric excess is most likely due to enzymatic production of 13-HODE superimposed on a background of autoxidative production of 13(R)- plus 9(S)- and 9(R)-HODE. In addition, the effect of sample handling and storage conditions on the formation of 9- and 13-HODE in the samples was assessed by exposing aliquots of a common pool of rat mammary gland tissue to specified conditions prior to analysis.

While 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid () is a constituent of oxidized LDL and can by itself induce IL-1 beta release, its potency relative to oxidized LDL suggested that other components of modified LDL may also contribute to this phenomenon. In this study, LDL of varying oxidation states were prepared by altering the Cu2+ to LDL ratio and/or the length of oxidation. The oxidation status of LDL was measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), electrophoretic mobility in agarose gels, and the content of 9- and 13-HODE. High Cu2+ to LDL ratios promoted extensive TBARS formation and these LDL were the most potent activators of IL-1 beta release, although LDL with TBARS greater than 50 nmol/mg protein were cytotoxic and IL-1 beta release was diminished. An inverse correlation between HODE content and TBARS was found indicating lipid-derived aldehydes also contribute to IL-1 beta release by oxidized LDL. Accordingly, dialysis of oxidized LDL removed nearly all aldehydes and rendered the LDL unable to induce IL-1 beta release. The alkenals 2,4-decadienal and 2-octenal were tested and shown to induce IL-1 beta release while their saturated homologues had no effect. The predominant aldehyde in Cu(2+)-oxidized LDL was hexanal, with the unsaturated aldehydes 2,4-heptadienal, 2-octenal, and 2,4-decadienal also being present.

Experiments were performed in hepatoma 7288CTC and inguinal fat pads in Buffalo rats during perfusion in situ. CLA isomers and trans FAs (0.03-0.4 mmol/L, in plasma) were added to the arterial blood, and FA uptake or release was measured by arterial minus venous difference.

Other CLA isomers, c9,t11-CLA, 13-(S)-HODE, c9,c11-CLA, and c11,t13-CLA, had no effect.

In both hepatoma 7288CTC and inguinal fat pad, addition of either pertussis toxin or 8-Br-cAMP to the arterial blood reversed the inhibitions of FA transport. These results support the idea that an inhibitory GPC FFAR reduces cAMP and controls FA transport by CLA isomers and trans FAs.

However, the postprandial responsiveness of these compounds is largely unknown; therefore, changes in the circulating oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome in response to a challenge meal were investigated at six occasions in a subject who freely modified her usual diet. The dietary change, and especially the challenge meal itself, represented a modification of precursor  acid status, with expectedly subtle effects on bioactive lipid levels. To detect even the slightest alteration, highly sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods for bioactive lipid profiling was employed. A previously validated UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for profiling the endocannabinoid metabolome was used, while validation of an UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for oxylipin analysis was performed with acceptable outcomes for a majority of the parameters according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for linearity (0.9938 < R2 < 0.9996), limit of detection (0.0005-2.1 pg on column), limit of quantification (0.0005-4.2 pg on column), inter- and intraday accuracy (85-115%) and precision (< 5%), recovery (40-109%) and stability (40-105%). Forty-seven of fifty-two bioactive lipids were detected in plasma samples at fasting and in the postprandial state (0.5, 1, and 3 hours after the meal). Multivariate analysis showed a significant shift of bioactive lipid profiles in the postprandial state due to inclusion of dairy products in the diet, which was in line with univariate analysis revealing seven compounds (NAGly, , 13-oxo-ODE, 9(10)-EpOME, 12(13)-EpOME, 20-HETE, and 11,12-DHET) that were significantly different between background diets in the postprandial state (but not at fasting). The only change in baseline levels at fasting was displayed by TXB2. Furthermore, postprandial responsiveness was detected for seven compounds (POEA, SEA, 9(10)-DiHOME, 12(13)-DiHOME, 13-oxo-ODE, , and 13-HODE). Hence, the data confirm that the UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method performance was sufficient to detect i) a shift, in the current case most notably in the postprandial bioactive lipid metabolome, caused by changes in diet and ii) responsiveness to a challenge meal for a subset of the oxylipin and endocannabinoid metabolome.

More  than 13-HODE is formed under most conditions. The production of these metabolites is reduced substantially by acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, or arachidonic acid, suggesting that cyclooxygenase may be involved in endothelial HODE synthesis. Incubations lasting up to 4 h indicate that the endothelial cells can convert [U-14C] linoleic acid into at least four additional products, some of which may be derived from the HODE that is formed initially. Radioactive 9- and 13-HODE are produced when the endothelial cells are labeled with linoleic acid and then exposed to thrombin, suggesting that these metabolites also may be formed when the endothelium is activated. If endothelial monolayers grown on micropore filters are incubated with linoleic acid, a substantial amount of the HODE formed accumulates in the basolateral fluid. This suggests that HODE may have extracellular effects, especially within the vascular wall. Furthermore, when 9- or 13-HODE are added, endothelial cultures produce less prostaglandin I2 and convert less 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid to its main metabolite, 8-hydroxyhexadecatrienoic acid.

However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the beneficial effects of PTX in NASH remains unidentified. A key role of lipid oxidation in the pathogenesis and progression of NASH has been established. PTX is known to decrease free-radical-mediated oxidative stress and inhibit lipid oxidation. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of PTX on levels of lipid oxidation products in patients with NASH. Levels of multiple structurally specific oxidized fatty acids including hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), oxo-octadecadienoic acids (oxoODEs), and hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) were quantified by mass spectrometry in plasma obtained at baseline and at study completion in patients who completed 1 year of therapy with PTX or placebo in a randomized controlled trial. Therapy with PTX resulted in significant decreases in  and 13-oxoODE, oxidized lipid products of linoleic acid (LA) linked to histological severity in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Similarly, PTX therapy was associated with significant decreases in 8-HETE, 9-HETE, and 11-HETE compared to placebo. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the decrease in HODEs and oxoODEs and improved histological scores of fibrosis and between the decrease in HETEs and improved lobular inflammation.Therapy with PTX compared to placebo was associated with a significant reduction of oxidized fatty acids. This novel evidence supports that the beneficial effects of PTX in patients with NASH are likely partly mediated through decreasing lipid oxidation, largely free-radical-mediated lipid oxidation. Additionally, this is the first report on the link between decreased oxidized lipid products and improved histological disease in the setting of a therapeutic trial in NASH.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8228632>Synthesis of monohydroxylated fatty acids from linoleic acid by rat aortic smooth muscle cells and tissues: influence on prostacyclin production.</a></h2><p>We have investigated whether cellular  of linoleic acid (18:2) can influence prostacyclin (PGI2) production by cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) and tissues.

The observed changes, in percent enzymatically synthesized 13-HODE in the presence of indomethacin, aspirin, metyrapone, 15-HPETE (hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid), and NDGA, suggest that it is formed from the PGH (prostaglandin endoperoxide) synthase pathway. Incubation of intact adherent SMC with [14C]linoleic acid demonstrates that the monohydroxylated compounds are predominantly esterified within the membrane phospholipids and not released into the incubation medium. The simultaneous incubation or a short-term preincubation of 18:2 and arachidonic acid (20:4) do not modify the enzymatic profile of 20:4 transformation. By contrast, long-term preincubation of cells with 18:2 or 13-HODE stimulates the transformation of exogenously added [14C]20:4 to [14C]6-keto PGF1 alpha. However, exogenous 13-HODE does not enhance [14C]6-keto PGF1 alpha recovery from [14C]20:4 prelabeled SMCs.

Our results demonstrate that these lipids stimulate PPAR gamma activity and that the AF-2 fragment, which harbors the ligand-binding domain of PPAR gamma, mediates this effect. Furthermore, we assessed the consequences of PPAR gamma activation by the oxidized lipids, and we found that these lipids stimulate human CG production, a measure of trophoblast differentiation.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were isolated from plasma using fast protein liquid chromatography and HDL was isolated from SF using dextran sulfate precipitation. 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), 12-HETE, 15-HETE, 9 hydroxyoctadecadienoic (HODE), and 13-HODE levels were measured in HDL, LDL, and SF by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. HDL's anti-inflammatory function, cholesterol levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activities were determined as previously. 5-HETE, 15-HETE, , and 13-HODE levels were significantly increased in HDL and LDL from patients with active RA (n = 10) compared to healthy controls (n = 8) and correlated significantly with measures of systemic , particularly in HDL (r = 0.65-0.80, p values < 0.004). Higher HETES and HODES in HDL were also significantly correlated with impaired HDL function as measured by the HDL inflammatory index (HII) (r = 0.54-0.58; p values < 0.03). 15-HETE levels and MPO activity were higher in RA SF (n = 10) compared to osteoarthritis (OA) SF(n = 11), and HDL from RA SF had worse function compared to OA SF HDL (HII = 2.1 ± 1.9 and 0.5 ± 0.1), respectively (p < 0.05). Oxidation products of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid are increased in HDL and LDL from patients with active RA compared to healthy controls, and are associated with worse anti-oxidant function of HDL.

The ability of Lp-PLA(2) to hydrolyze peroxidized species of phosphatidylserine (PS), acting as a recognition signal for clearance of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes, as well as the products of the reaction has not been investigated. We performed liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based structural characterization of oxygenated, hydrolyzed molecular species of PS-containing linoleic acid in either the sn-2 position (C(18:0)/C(18:2)) or in both sn-1 and sn-2 positions (C(18:2)/C(18:2)), formed in the cytochrome c- and H(2)O(2)-driven enzymatic oxidation reaction. Cytochrome c has been chosen as a catalyst of peroxidation reactions because of its likely involvement in PS oxidation in apoptotic cells. We found that Lp-PLA(2) catalyzed the hydrolysis of both nontruncated and truncated (oxidatively fragmented) species of oxidized PS species, albeit with different efficiencies, and performed detailed characterization of the major reaction products: oxygenated derivatives of linoleic acid as well as nonoxygenated and oxygenated species of lyso-PS. Among linoleic acid products, derivatives oxygenated at the C(9) position, including 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), a potent ligand of G protein-coupled receptor G2A, were the most abundant. Computer modeling of interactions of Lp-PLA(2) with different PS-oxidized species indicated that they are able to bind in the proximity (<5 Å) of Ser273 and His351 of the catalytic triad. For 9-hydroxy and 9-hydroperoxy derivatives of oxidized PS, the sn-2 ester bond was positioned very close (<3 Å) to the Ser273 residue, a nucleophile directly attacking the sn-2 bond, thus favoring the hydrolysis reaction. We suggest that oxidatively modified free fatty acids and lyso-PS species generated by Lp-PLA(2) may represent important signals facilitating and regulating the execution of apoptotic and phagocytosis programs essential for the control of inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25381799>Switching from singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation to free-radical-mediated oxidation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in model mouse.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of type 2 diabetes. However, it is still unknown what kind of oxidative stress underlies the development of type 2 diabetes. We investigated hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE) isomers, which have been proposed as a biomarker for evaluating oxidative stress in vivo, during the development of diabetes in Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetes (TSOD) mouse, a type 2 diabetes model. It was revealed that glucose tolerance and insulin resistance index HOMA-IR in TSOD mice at 5 weeks of age were approximately normal, namely, the mice were in the prediabetic state, but these levels were significantly exacerbated from 8 weeks of age compared with those in Tsumura Suzuki Non Obesity (TSNO) mice (control). Concomitantly, the plasma levels of free-radical-mediated oxidation products, 9- and 13-(E,E)-HODE and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, in TSOD mice were significantly higher than those in TSNO mice at 8, and 8 and 11 weeks of age, respectively. Interestingly, the plasma levels of 10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODE, which are produced specifically by singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation, in TSOD mice were higher than those in TSNO mice only at 5 weeks of age, and not at 8, 11, and 13 weeks of age. We demonstrated that singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation occurred in TSOD mice before development of the diabetic phenotypes, including impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. These results suggest that excessive singlet-oxygen-mediated oxidation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25170928>Effect of exposure to atmospheric ultrafine particles on production of free  acids and lipid metabolites in the mouse small intestine.</a></h2><p>Exposure to ambient ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) is a well-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, little is known about the effects of air pollution on gastrointestinal disorders.We sought to assess whether exposure to ambient UFP (diameter < 180 nm) increased free  acids and lipid metabolites in the mouse small intestine.Ldlr-null mice were exposed to filtered air (FA) or UFP collected at an urban Los Angeles, California, site that was heavily affected by vehicular emissions; the exposure was carried out for 10 weeks in the presence or absence of D-4F, an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide with antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties on a high-fat or normal chow diet.Compared with FA, exposure to UFP significantly increased intestinal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), including 15-HETE, 12-HETE, 5-HETE, as well as hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), including 13-HODE and . Arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) as well as some of the lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) in the small intestine were also increased in response to UFP exposure. Administration of D-4F significantly reduced UFP-mediated increase in HETEs, HODEs, AA, PGD2, and LPA. Although exposure to UFP further led to shortened villus length accompanied by prominent macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal villi, administration of D-4F mitigated macrophage infiltration.Exposure to UFP promotes lipid metabolism, villus shortening, and inflammatory responses in mouse small intestine, whereas administration of D-4F attenuated these effects.

This can be exemplified by the production of anti-inflammatory oxidized fatty acids and proinflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) during LDL oxidation. We have shown previously that oxidized LDL (oxLDL) plays an active role at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity by delivering instructive molecules such as LPC, which promotes mature dendritic cell (DC) generation from differentiating monocytes. It is shown in this study that LPC affects the signaling pathway of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). LPC-induced DC maturation is associated with complete inhibition of PPARgamma activity and up-regulation of the activity of an uncharacterized nuclear receptor that bind peroxisome proliferator response element. Oxidized fatty acids generated during LDL oxidation are natural ligands for PPARgamma and inhibit oxLDL- and LPC-induced maturation. Inhibition experiments with synthetic PPARgamma ligands suggested a PPARgamma-dependent and independent effect of LPC on DC maturation. Therefore, the relative amount of oxidized fatty acids and LPC influences the immunological functions of oxLDL on DC, in part by regulating the PPAR pathway. By sensing the biochemical composition of lipoprotein particles, the innate immune system may thus identify various endogenous signals that influence the immune response during the acute-phase reaction. The therapeutic emulsion intralipid also blocks LPC action on PPAR activity and DC maturation. Intralipid may thus be an alternative therapeutic strategy for some chronic inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10342328>Oxysterols in cap and core of human advanced atherosclerotic lesions.</a></h2><p>Different parts of the advanced atherosclerotic lesion have characteristic differences in lipid content, but the distribution of lipid oxidation products has not been reported. This study provides novel data on oxysterol and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids quantification in core versus cap. It compares the lipid composition of core and cap to assess the topographical distribution of evidence of lipid oxidation.Lipids and oxidised lipids were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in samples of human atheromatous lipid core and fibrous cap of individual advanced atherosclerotic plaques (Stary, Type V) in necropsy samples.The total lipid was of course massively greater in the core than in the cap. The oxidation products, cholest-5-en-3beta,26-diol (26-OH-CHOL) and cholest-5-en-3beta,7beta-diol (7beta-OH-CHOL) were detected in all the samples. 26-OH-CHOL was more abundant in the core than in the cap when related both to wet weight and to cholesterol. 7Beta-OH-CHOL levels were significantly higher in the core than in the cap when related to wet weight but not when related to cholesterol. Because the processing included a sodium borohydride reduction step, the 7beta-OH-CHOL detected could partly originate from 7-ketocholesterol or 7-hydroperoxycholesterol. Several isomeric hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids were detected in both core and cap, more in the cap when related to cholesterol content. Most of the components of the cap showed a high degree of cross-correlation on linear regression analysis, but cross-correlations were weaker for the core. The core samples contained a larger proportion of linoleate relative to oleate than the fibrous cap.The findings suggest that the different lipid and oxidised lipid contents of cap and core may be due to variations in oxidative activity in different parts of the lesion.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8156169>Distribution of monohydroxy fatty acids in specific human epidermal phospholipids.</a></h2><p>Monohydroxy derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA) can modulate inflammation and epidermal proliferation.

Lipids were extracted from 6 normal keratome skin biopsies and phospholipids were separated into the major classes by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography.

Unesterified MHFAs were determined in a similar way. , 13-HODE and 15-HETE were detectable in phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).

Esterified 15-HETE was equally distributed between PI and PC, in which 15-HETE was predominant, accounting for 60% and 69% of the total MHFAs, respectively (p < 0.05).

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is upregulated by oxLDL, may contribute to atherogenesis through monocyte recruitment, increased vascular permeability and promotion of intraplaque vessels. The VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1/Flt-1) mediates monocyte migration towards VEGF and regulates the levels of available VEGF through ligand-entrapment. In this study we investigated the effect of oxLDL on VEGFR-1 expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages. mRNA expression was estimated using RT-PCR, protein secretion was measured with ELISA and the amount of membrane-bound VEGFR-1 was analysed using flow cytometry analysis. Binding of transcription factors to the promoter was studied with EMSA. Incubation with oxLDL decreased VEGFR-1 mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, followed by a subsequent decrease in protein secretion of VEGFR-1 and a reduction of the amount of receptor expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, the PPARgamma agonists 9-hydroxy-(S)-10,12-octadecadienoic acid () and darglitazone also decreased VEGFR-1 mRNA expression. Incubation of macrophages with oxLDL or  decreased binding of the transcription factor AP-1 (c-jun/ATF-2) to the VEGFR-1 promoter. Together, these data suggest that oxLDL decreases VEGFR-1 expression in macrophages, probably through a PPARgamma-dependent reduction in the AP-1 transcriptional activity. This implies that oxLDL has effects on the biological availability of VEGF, besides its direct effect on VEGF expression.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2080762>Epithelium-derived linoleic acid metabolites modulate airway smooth muscle function.</a></h2><p>Cultured epithelial cells obtained from guinea pig tracheal preparations metabolized arachidonic acid into 5- and 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid and into the prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha.

Some lipid peroxidation products have already been reported to be formed via glucose-induced oxidative stress. We have identified 9-hydroxy linoleic acid (9-OH-C18:2) in the red cell membrane phospholipid of diabetic subjects. We hypothesized that 9-OH-C18:2 would be formed in hydroxyl radical reactions to linoleic acid (C18:2) during glucose-induced oxidative stress, and confirmed that the formation of 9-OH-C18:2 was induced by ultraviolet (UV)-C irradiation to the synthetic C18:2. UV-C light generates highly reactive hydroxy radicals. C18:2 is confirmed to be the precursor of 9-OH-C18:2. To estimate the degree of oxidative damage to red cell membrane phospholipids, we developed a selective ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometric measurement for C18:2 and 9-OH-C18:2, following methanolysis of red cell membrane phospholipids. The relative peak height ratio of C18:2 to 9-OH-C18:2 (9-OH-C18:2/C18:2) was measured in phospholipid extracts of red cell membranes from healthy (n=29, 3.1+/-1.9%) and diabetic (n=27, 20. 9+/-16.1%) subjects. It was confirmed that 9-OH-C18:2/C18:2 is significantly (P<0.001) elevated in patients with diabetes.

Peroxidation of RBC membranes caused a profound decrease in the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids and concomitantly hydroperoxides, as primary products of peroxidation, appeared in the phospholipids. Hydroperoxides were predominantly generated in choline glycerophospholipid (CGP), while the extent of formation of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid (EGP) hydroperoxides was low and their presence was transient. Hydroxy and hydroperoxy moieties in CGP were identified as 9-hydroxy and 13-hydroxy octadecanoic acid, derived from linoleic acid, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis. No consistent generation of hydroperoxide from arachidonic acid was evident in CGP. The CGP-hydroperoxide accounted for approximately 76% of linoleic acid consumed during peroxidation of RBC membranes. The prominent generation of phospholipid hydroperoxides was observed in the linoleic acid-rich membranes from rabbit RBC, indicating that the level of linoleic acid in phospholipids determines, in part, the extent of formation of phospholipid hydroperoxides. Aldehydic phospholipids, as secondary products of peroxidation, were detected in oxidized membranes. EGP was the most prominent aldehydic phospholipid, while negligible amounts of aldehydic CGP were formed.

Oxidized polyunsaturated  acids content of HDL is modified by ACS.Background Although HDLs have antithrombotic effects by reducing platelet activation, the relationship between HDL levels and the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is unclear, as HDL particles are heterogeneous in composition and biological properties. Objective To characterize the effects of HDL2 and HDL3 subclasses from ACS patients and non-coronary artery disease (CAD) subjects on platelet activation. Methods We measured platelet aggregation and ex vivo thrombus formation, analyzed signaling pathways by flow cytometry, and performed a targeted lipidomics analysis on HDL subclasses. Results Analysis of human platelet aggregation in suspension, adhesion on von Willebrand factor and thrombus formation on collagen under arterial shear demonstrated that HDL2 from ACS patients had higher antiplatelet potency than HDL3 from ACS patients and HDL from non-CAD subjects. HDL binding to scavenger receptor class B type I was essential for this effect. A lipidomics analysis revealed that HDL2 from ACS patients had more oxidized polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs). An inverse correlation between the concentrations of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), the eicosapentaenoic acid metabolite 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid isomers in HDL2 and platelet aggregation was observed. This relationship was further demonstrated by the direct inhibitory effects of 18-HEPE, , 13-HODE, 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid and 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid on collagen-related peptide-induced platelet aggregation, indicating that oxidized PUFAs contribute to the antithrombotic effect of ACS HDL2.

The additional presence of a hydroxyl group gave opposite results: 13-HODE (I50=3 microM) was about 4-fold more potent a cyclooxygenase inhibitor than the 9c,11t-CLA isomer but  was 2- to 3-fold less effective an inhibitor (I50=34 microM) of [14C]TXB2 formation than the corresponding 10t,12c-CLA. In both the aggregation and arachidonic acid  experiments, the inhibitory effects of CLA on platelets were reversible and dependent on the time of addition of either the aggregating agent or the [14C]arachidonic acid substrate.

Work in the present authors' laboratory has shown that the formation of 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODEs), 15-lipoxygenase-derived metabolites of linoleic acid, are involved in the mitogenic response to EGF in these cells (Glasgow et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10771-10779). SHE cells also produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). We now report the effects of HODEs and prostaglandins on EGF-dependent expression of the growth-related proto-oncogene c-myc in SHE cells. Treatment of cells with eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), which blocks EGF-dependent HODE formation, inhibited the mitogenic response to EGF, while exogenous 13-HODE potentiated EGF-dependent DNA synthesis. However, neither ETYA or 13-HODE altered the accumulation of c-myc mRNA in response to EGF. In contrast, PGE2 inhibited EGF-induced DNA synthesis and down-regulated EGF-stimulated c-myc mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas PGF2 alpha had no effect on these responses. PGE2, but not PGF2 alpha, induced a rapid increase in cAMP formation, and both forskolin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP mimicked the inhibitory effects of PGE2 on EGF-dependent DNA synthesis and c-myc mRNA accumulation, suggesting that the involvement of cAMP. The results indicate that the modulation of EGF-dependent DNA synthesis by PGE2, but not by HODEs, is associated with altered expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc in SHE cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3919389>Circulating hydroxy fatty acids in familial Mediterranean fever.</a></h2><p>Episodes of fever, serositis, and arthritis in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) suggested circulating mediators of acute inflammation (e.g., neutrophil activation). The mean serum neutrophil-aggregating activity of 51 FMF patients was 2.5 +/- 0.2 cm2/min, compared to 1.0 +/- 0.1 cm2/min in 20 normal controls (P less than 0.0002). Lipid extracts of FMF sera retained neutrophil-aggregating activity and had UV absorbance peaks at 269 and 279 nm, indicating the presence of lipids with a conjugated triene structure. Chromatography of extracts yielded peaks that were coeluted with reference dihydroxyicosatetraenoic acids, had UV absorbance peaks at 259, 269, and 279 nm, and possessed neutrophil-aggregating activity. The presence of leukotriene B4 was excluded by chromatography following methyl-esterification. Monohydroxy compounds identified in FMF extracts by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry included 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid, and 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids. Hydroxy acids were present in 19 of 31 FMF sera and absent in extracts of sera from 8 patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus, 7 with fever from infection, and 12 normal controls.

Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized  acids  (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of  and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse , with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and  steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15833297>Improved enantioselective analysis of polyunsaturated hydroxy fatty acids in psoriatic skin scales using high-performance liquid chromatography.</a></h2><p>Enantioselective analysis is used as a valuable tool for determining the biological origin of chiral derivatives of arachidonic, 11,14-eicosadienoic and linoleic acid in psoriatic skin scales and for clarifying their role in pathogenesis.

To test these properties in humans, we investigated the effect of troglitazone on the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and its inhibitory protein IkappaB in mononuclear cells (MNC) and plasma soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein. We also examined the effect of troglitazone on reactive oxygen species generation, p47(phox) subunit expression, 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-HODE, o-tyrosine, and m-tyrosine in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Seven obese patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with troglitazone (400 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Blood samples were obtained at weekly intervals. Nuclear factor-kappaB binding activity in MNC nuclear extracts was significantly inhibited after troglitazone treatment at week 1 and continued to be inhibited up to week 4. On the other hand, IkappaB protein levels increased significantly after troglitazone treatment at week 1, and this increase persisted throughout the study. Plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations did not decrease significantly after troglitazone treatment, although there was a trend toward inhibition. Reactive oxygen species generation by polymorphonuclear cells and MNC, p47(phox) subunit protein quantities, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly after troglitazone intake. 13-HODE/linoleic acid and /linoleic acid ratios also decreased after troglitazone intake. However, o-tyrosine/phenylalanine and m-tyrosine/phenylalanine ratios did not change significantly. These data show that troglitazone has profound antiinflammatory effects in addition to antioxidant effects in obese type 2 diabetics; these effects may be relevant to the recently described beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects of troglitazone at the vascular level.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23973531>Development of a high-throughput ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay to profile 18 eicosanoids as exploratory biomarkers for atherosclerotic diseases.</a></h2><p>Abundant evidence suggests a prominent role for eicosanoids and metabolites in the pathogenesis and prognosis of inflammatory diseases.

A limit of quantitation of 0.25ng/mL was achieved for all 18 investigated compounds with linear ranges spanning four orders of magnitude. Bioanalytical performance of this assay was fully characterized including SPE extraction efficiency, matrix effect, autosampler stability, benchtop stability and freeze-thaw cycle variability. Endogenous levels of the eicosanoids and analogs within a set of monkey plasma samples challenged with lipopolysaccharide and human plasma samples were quantified by this ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay. Quantitative eicosanoid profiles of the human samples were further analyzed by a non-supervised cluster analysis, which revealed a set of potential positive and negative lipid biomarkers to distinguish the following three groups: healthy individuals, hypertensive patients and severe atherosclerosis patients. The components of the negative biomarker cluster (8-HETE, LTB4,  and 13-HODE) are putative ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a family of master genes controlling the resolution of inflammatory signaling.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Mesangial cell proliferation with OX-LDL,  (9HODE), and 13-hydroxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13HODE), the major components of OX-LDL, were determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) incorporation. The effect of OX-LDL on mesangial cell proliferation with PD98059 pretreatment was determined by BrdU incorporation. Type IV collagen, fibronectin, and PPARgamma expression with OX-LDL or 9HODE or 13HODE was determined by Western blotting. Type IV collagen expression with antisense oligonucleotide against PPARgamma pretreatment was also determined by Western blotting. The effect of PD98059 pretreatment on PPARgamma expression was determined by Western blotting. In mesangial cells exposed to isolated OX-LDL from human plasma, BrdU incorporation was increased, and this increase was deleted by PD98059. Type IV collagen expression was significantly increased by OX-LDL. 9HODE and 13HODE increased BrdU and MTT incorporation into mesangial cells and also increased expressions of Type IV collagen and fibronection, the major components of ECM. PPARgamma expression in mesangial cells was stimulated by 9HODE. The reduction of PPARgamma synthesis by pretreatment of antisense oligonucleotide against PPARgamma remarkably attenuated Type IV collagen synthesis induced by 9HODE. PPARgamma expression induced by 9HODE was also reduced by PD98059 pretreatment. These findings demonstrate that 9HODE, the major component of OX-LDL, stimulates cell proliferation and ECM production of human mesangial cells.

Targeted MS analysis of bioactive lipid mediators as markers of inflammation was performed and correlated with eGFR and total kidney volume (TKV) normalized to the body surface area (BSAR) to assess if these markers are predictive of ADPKD severity. ADPKD patients with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) showed higher levels of 5- and 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenase, and generated higher levels of hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids  and 13-HODE and HETEs 8-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE as compared with healthy subjects.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether modified LDL could also induce macrophage release of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), a cytokine which enhances vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, another feature of the atherosclerotic process. LDL were oxidatively modified by incubation with either Cu2+ (Cu(2+)-LDL) or human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (M-LDL). Incubation of these modified LDL with macrophages (6 x 10(6) cells/culture) resulted in a dose-dependent induction of IL-1 beta release. At 300 micrograms protein/ml, Cu(2+)-LDL and M-LDL induced 422 and 333 pg of IL-1 beta/culture, respectively. Saponified Cu(2+)-LDL and M-LDL were shown to contain 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), lipid oxidation products of linoleate.

Macrophage activation is achieved by oxidized lipoproteins (oxLDL) and is determined by oxygen radical (ROS) formation. The oxidative burst was measured by flow cytometry and quantitated by oxidation of the redox-sensitive dye dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Short-time stimulation dose-dependently elicited ROS formation. Diphenylene iodonium prevented ROS formation, thus pointing to the involvement of a NAD(P)H oxidase in producing reduced oxygen species. In contrast, preincubation of macrophages with oxLDL for 16 h showed an attenuated oxidative burst upon a second contact with oxLDL. Taking into account that oxLDL is an established peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist and considering the anti-inflammatory properties of PPARgamma, we went on and showed that a PPARgamma agonist such as ciglitazone attenuated ROS formation. Along that line, major lipid peroxidation products of oxLDL, such as 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, shared that performance. Supporting evidence that PPARgamma activation accounted for reduced ROS generation came from studies in which proliferator-activated receptor response element decoy oligonucleotides, but not a mutated oligonucleotide, supplied in front of oxLDL delivery regained a complete oxidative burst upon cell activation. We conclude that oxLDL not only elicits an oxidative burst upon first contact, but also promotes desensitization of macrophages via activation of PPARgamma. Desensitization of macrophages may have important consequences for the behavior of macrophages/foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006841>The cytochrome P450 inhibitor, ketoconazole, inhibits oxidized linoleic acid metabolite-mediated peripheral inflammatory pain.</a></h2><p>Oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OLAMs) are a class of endogenous agonists to the transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) receptor. Although TRPV1 mediates inflammatory heat hyperalgesia, it is not known if the OLAMs contribute to the peripheral activation of this receptor during tissue inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated whether the OLAM system is activated during inflammation and whether cytochrome P450 enzymes mediate OLAM contributions to heat hyperalgesia using the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammation.Our results demonstrate that the intraplantar (ipl) injection of anti-OLAM antibodies significantly reversed CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia. Moreover, application of lipid extracts from inflamed rat skin to cultured sensory neurons triggered a significant release of iCGRP that is blocked by co-treatment with I-RTX, a TRPV1 antagonist. To determine the role of CYP enzymes in mediating OLAM effects, we used a broad spectrum CYP inhibitor, ketoconazole. Pretreatment with ketoconazole inhibited the release of TRPV1 agonists in lipid extracts from inflamed skin and significantly reversed CFA-induced heat hyperalgesia by a peripheral mechanism of action. Moreover, the ipl injection of linoleic acid to rats 24 hr after CFA evoked spontaneous nocifensive behaviors that were significantly reduced by capsazepine, by knockout of the TRPV1 gene, or by pretreatment with either anti-OLAM antibodies or ketoconazole.Taken together, our data suggests that OLAMs contribute to inflammatory nociception in the periphery and that cytochrome P450 enzymes play a crucial role in mediating OLAM contributions to inflammatory heat hyperalgesia.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25899850>Increased cerebrospinal fluid cleaved tau protein (C-tau) levels suggest axonal damage in pediatric patients with brain tumors.</a></h2><p>This study aims to determine if cerebrospinal fluid/serum cleaved tau protein and CSF 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid levels, reflecting potential biomarkers of overall neuronal injury and lipid peroxidation, respectively, are elevated in brain tumor patients compared with controls.This article is a prospective clinical observational study.This study is conducted at a tertiary-care children's hospital.Our participants are children younger than or equal to 18 years of age undergoing brain tumor surgery.During the study period, 26 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with brain tumors who met the inclusion criteria were prospectively enrolled.

This fatty acid contains structural features that are not typically found in plant fatty acids, including a C-9 hydroxyl group, Delta(10),Delta(12)-conjugated double bonds, and trans-Delta(12) unsaturation. Expressed sequence tag analysis was conducted to determine the biosynthetic origin of dimorphecolic acid. cDNAs for two divergent forms of Delta(12)-oleic acid desaturase, designated DsFAD2-1 and Ds-FAD2-2, were identified among expressed sequence tags generated from developing Dimorphotheca sinuata seeds. Expression of DsFAD2-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and soybean somatic embryos resulted in the accumulation of the trans-Delta(12) isomer of linoleic acid (18: 2Delta(9)(cis)(,12)(trans)) rather than the more typical cis-Delta(12) isomer. When co-expressed with DsFAD2-1 in soybean embryos or yeast, DsFAD2-2 converted 18:2Delta(9)(cis)(,12)(trans) into dimorphecolic acid. When DsFAD2-2 was expressed alone in soybean embryos or together with a typical cis-Delta(12)-oleic acid desaturase in yeast, trace amounts of the cis-Delta(12) isomer of dimorphecolic acid (9-OH-18:2Delta(10)(trans,)(12)(cis)) were formed from DsFAD2-2 activity with cis-Delta(12)-linoleic acid [corrected]. These results indicate that DsFAD2-2 catalyzes the conversion of the Delta(9) double bond of linoleic acid into a C-9 hydroxyl group and Delta(10)(trans) double bond and displays a substrate preference for the trans-Delta(12), rather than the cis-Delta(12), isomer of linoleic acid. Overall these data are consistent with a biosynthetic pathway of dimorphecolic acid involving the concerted activities of DsFAD2-1 and DsFAD2-2.
