MEA or RA at 0.05% or 0.1% was supplied to diabetic mice for six weeks. The intake of MEA, not RA, dose-dependently lowered plasma glucose level and increased plasma insulin level. MEA, not RA, intake dose-dependently reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and fibrinogen level; as well as restored antithrombin-III and protein C activities in plasma of diabetic mice. MEA or RA intake decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma and liver. Histological data agreed that MEA or RA intake lowered hepatic lipid droplets, determined by ORO stain. MEA intake dose-dependently declined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione levels, increased glutathione content and maintained the activity of glutathione reductase and catalase in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. MEA intake dose-dependently reduced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. RA intake at 0.1% declined cardiac and renal levels of these inflammatory factors. These data indicated that MEA improved glycemic control and hemostatic imbalance, lowered lipid accumulation, and attenuated oxidative and inflammatory stress in diabetic mice. Thus,  could be considered as an anti-diabetic agent.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080345> triterpenes for diabetic neuropathy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical study.</a></h2><p>Diabetic neuropathy (DN), a common complication of , results from hyperglycemia, poor microcirculation and attendant nerve damage. Currently available treatments relieve symptoms, but do not modify the neurodegeneration underlying DN.  (CA) triterpenes improved microcirculation in earlier clinical studies, and showed neurotropic effects in preclinical models suggesting a potential disease modifying effect in DN. This 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of CAST, a standardized CA extract containing triterpenes, on neuropathy symptoms in Type II diabetic subjects.The study enrolled patients with a history of Type II , with evidence of symptomatic symmetrical DN with total symptom score (TSS) ≥4, and stable HbA1c level <8. The primary outcome measure was TSS, which assessed intensity and frequency of parasthesia, numbness, pain and burning symptoms self-reported by patients. Secondary measures were nerve conduction, neurological impairment score, and quantitative sensory testing.Comparing CAST (n=21) and Placebo (n=22) groups, significant reductions from baseline for TSS (p<0.01) and paresthesia (p<0.01) were seen only in CAST treated groups. Numbness increased from baseline only in the Placebo group (p<0.05) and was significantly higher than for the CAST group (p<0.001). Burning sensation was reduced in both groups (p<0.01). Plasma triterpene levels in patients treated with CAST mirrored neurotropic concentrations .CAST is a potential oral treatment for diabetic neuropathy, as it is well tolerated and effective in reducing the severity of DN symptoms in patients with Type II .</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p></html>
