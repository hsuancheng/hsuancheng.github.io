Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to measure beta-relaxation in PVP.Reheating the annealed samples gives rise to annealing peaks that occur below T(g). The peaks cannot be generated when annealing below the low temperature limit of beta-relaxation. These limits are around 50 degrees C for PVP, -20 degrees C for IM, and 30 degrees C for UDA. The effective activation  (E) of the sub-T(g) relaxation has been estimated for each T(a) and found to increase with T(a), reflecting increasing contribution of the alpha-process. Estimates of E for beta-relaxation have been obtained from the lowest T(a) data, and are as follows: 68 (PVP), 56 (IM), 67 (UDA) kJ mol(-1).DSC can be used for detecting beta-relaxation processes and estimating its low temperature limit, i.e., the temperature below which amorphous drugs would remain stable. It can also provide comparative estimates of low temperature stability of amorphous drugs in terms of the activation energies of the beta-relaxation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1903001>The uptake of the cyanobacterial hepatotoxin microcystin by isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Microcystin-YM a cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxin isolated from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa was radiolabeled with 125I, and used to investigate the uptake of the toxin by freshly isolated rat hepatocytes. The uptake was temperature dependent with apparent activation  of 18 kcal/mole (77 kJ/mole) for the initial rate of uptake. Uptake of non-toxic (10-20 nM) doses of microcystin by hepatocytes continued with time, the intracellular to extracellular distribution ratio for the toxin was 70 at 60 min for 10(6) cells/ml. Uptake of higher doses of microcystin (100 nM and more) stopped when the cells blebbed: a toxic response of hepatocytes to microcystin. Uptake of microcystin by hepatocytes was inhibited 70-80% by the addition of 10 microM sodium deoxycholate or bromsulphthlein, compounds that protect hepatocytes from the toxic effects of microcystin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3421905>Spectrophotometric determination of the critical micellar concentration of bile salts using bilirubin monoglucuronide as a micellar probe. Utility of derivative spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>We have developed a simple biologically non-invasive method for determining the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of bile salts using pure naturally occurring bilirubin IX alpha monoglucuronide (BMG), an important bile pigment present in virtually all mammalian biles. This methodology employs visible absorbance spectroscopy of BMG in bile salts over a range of bile salt concentrations that include the reported CMC. Using 100 microM-BMG in 0.4 M-imidazole buffer at pH 7.8, we calculated that the CMC for sodium taurochenodeoxycholate is between 2.5 and 3.0 mM based on: (1) an abrupt change in lambda max. in this concentration range, (2) a precipitous decrease in the amplitude of the absorbance shoulder at 450 nm, (3) a sudden decrease in the second derivative absorbance of BMG at 400 nm and an increase in absorbance at 470 nm, (4) a sharp change in the 4th derivative absorbance at 375 and 395 nm. In contrast, sodium taurocholate, a bile salt that reportedly does not have a CMC but continuously self-associates over a wide concentration range, exhibited none of these changes. The use of derivative spectroscopy enhances the ability to detect the CMC changes and also indicates the number of BMG species in solution and their relative  states.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24296272>Tandem mass spectrometric characterization of bile acids and steroid conjugates based on low- collision-induced dissociation.</a></h2><p>We examined the characteristics of several bile acids and some steroid conjugates under low--collision-induced dissociation conditions using a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. According to conjugation types, we observed characteristic product ions and/or neutral losses in the product ion spectra. Amino  conjugates afforded specific product ions. For example, glycine-conjugated metabolites routinely produced a product ion at m/z 74, and taurine-conjugated metabolites produced product ions at m/z 124, 107, and 80. When a strong peak appeared at m/z 97, the molecule contained a sulfate group. In contrast to amino  conjugates, carbohydrate conjugates required a combination of product ions and neutral losses for identification. We could discriminate a glucoside from an acyl galactoside according to the presence or absence of a product ion at m/z 161 and a neutral loss of 180 Da. Discrimination among esters, aliphatic ethers, and phenolic ether types of glucuronides was based upon differences in the intensities of a product ion at m/z 175 and a neutral loss of 176 Da. Furthermore, N-acetylglucosamine conjugates showed a characteristic product ion at m/z 202 and a neutral loss of 203 Da, and the appearance of a product ion at m/z 202 revealed the existence of N-acetylglucosamine conjugated to an aliphatic hydroxyl group without a double bond in the immediate vicinity. Together, the data presented here will help to enable the identification of unknown conjugated cholesterol metabolites by using low- collision-induced dissociation.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Steady-state continuous cultures were achieved at two dilution rates (D). Trends of the carbon flow were determined by comparison of ratios between the specific rates of formation of the three products of metabolism (lactate, acetate, butyrate). Chenodeoxycholate induced the 7alpha- and 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of C. absonum. In the presence of this inducer, the growth yield and the carbon recovery decreased, the carbon flow distribution was altered favoring acetate production, and a deficit in the reoxydation of nucleotidic cofactors was observed. In the presence of chenodeoxycholate, C. absonum would favor the production of  at the expense of the reoxidation of nucleotidic cofactors so as to ensure its growth, and the epimerization of chenodeoxycholate to ursodeoxycholate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12033284>Disruption of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis after chronic alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate administration: relevance for cholestasis.</a></h2><p>Hepatocyte dysfunction caused by impaired mitochondrial function has been pointed out as a probable leading cause of cholestatic liver injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate liver mitochondrial bioenergetics that followed repeated in vivo administration of alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate, a known cholestatic agent.Serum markers of liver injury and endogenous adenine nucleotides were measured in alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate-treated rats (intraperitoneally, 100 mg/Kg/wk x 6 wk). Changes in membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, as well as alterations in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis were monitored.In rats injected with alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate, liver injury with cholestasis developed within 48 hours, as indicated by both serum enzyme activities and total bilirubin concentration. However, 1 week after the last injection, serum enzyme activity returned to control levels. In addition, after chronic alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate administration, no alterations in mitochondrial respiratory function and membrane potential were observed. Associated with these parameters, mitochondria from treated animals exhibited increased susceptibility to disruption of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis by calcium phosphate and by bile acids, which was probably caused by induction of permeability transition pore.Our data suggest that chronic cholestasis in rats leads to impaired mitochondrial function due to the disruption of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. The initiating event is the induction of a cyclosporine A-sensitive release of calcium. This event may be an important determinant of the progression of cholestatic liver injury and associated liver cirrhosis. In addition, in the present study we observed that impairment of mitochondrial function is potentiated by chenodeoxycholate, a bile  that is known to be toxic. Ursodeoxycholate (the beta- epimer of chenodeoxycholate) is approved for the treatment of chronic cholestatic liver disease. Interestingly, we show that the susceptibility to the cyclosporine A-sensitive release of calcium was increased by the combination of both bile acids. These results indicate that the reported improvement of biochemical parameters in cholestatic patients treated with ursodeoxycholate would not prevent the associated mitochondrial dysfunction. This may explain the progression of the histological stage and the maintenance of symptoms during cholestasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916388>Differential effects of FXR or TGR5 activation in cholangiocarcinoma progression.</a></h2><p>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive tumor type affecting cholangiocytes. CCAs frequently arise under certain cholestatic liver conditions. Intrahepatic accumulation of bile acids may facilitate cocarcinogenic effects by triggering an inflammatory response and cholangiocyte proliferation. Here, the role of bile  receptors FXR and TGR5 in CCA progression was evaluated.FXR and TGR5 expression was determined in human CCA tissues and cell lines. An orthotopic model of CCA was established in immunodeficient mice and tumor volume was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging under chronic administration of the specific FXR or TGR5 agonists, obeticholic  (OCA) or INT-777 (0,03% in chow; Intercept Pharmaceuticals), respectively. Functional effects of FXR or TGR5 activation were evaluated on CCA cells in vitro.FXR was downregulated whereas TGR5 was upregulated in human CCA tissues compared to surrounding normal liver tissue. FXR expression correlated with tumor differentiation and TGR5 correlated with perineural invasion. TGR5 expression was higher in perihilar than in intrahepatic CCAs. In vitro, FXR was downregulated and TGR5 was upregulated in human CCA cells compared to normal human cholangiocytes. OCA halted CCA growth in vivo, whereas INT-777 showed no effect. In vitro, OCA inhibited CCA cell proliferation and migration which was associated with decreased mitochondrial  metabolism. INT-777, by contrast, stimulated CCA cell proliferation and migration, linked to increased mitochondrial  metabolism.Activation of FXR inhibits, whereas TGR5 activation may promote, CCA progression by regulating proliferation, migration and mitochondrial  metabolism. Modulation of FXR or TGR5 activities may represent potential therapeutic strategies for CCA.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography. We investigated the effects of dissolving model cholesterol gallstones with the MPn-CDCA conjugates in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. The dissolution rates of CDCA, MP40-CDCA, MP30-CDCA, MP20-CDCA and MP10-CDCA were 5.33, 5.717, 17.59, 6.868 and 9.615x10(-7)kgm(-2)s(-1), micellar solubilities were 0.2431, 3.095, 12.972, 5.248 and 5.790kgm(-3) and total resistances were 5.33, 5.717, 17.59, 6.868 and 9.615x10(-7)kgm(-2)s(-1), respectively. These studies suggested that the interfacial resistance was the dominant rate-determining factor in dissolving model cholesterol gallstones. Model cholesterol gallstones could be more effectively dissolved by increasing the steric interactive potential  of side chains and ensuring that the hydrophilic-lipophilic properties of MP-CDCA are within an appropriate range. The micellar dissolution rates of model cholesterol gallstones by MP20-CDCA were significantly faster than by the other conjugates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846919>Intestinal bile  receptors are key regulators of glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>In addition to their well-known function as dietary lipid detergents, bile acids have emerged as important signalling molecules that regulate  homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted that disrupted bile  metabolism is associated with metabolism disorders such as dyslipidaemia, intestinal chronic inflammatory diseases and obesity. In particular, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with quantitative and qualitative modifications in bile  metabolism. Bile acids bind and modulate the activity of transmembrane and nuclear receptors (NR). Among these receptors, the G-protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5) and the NR farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are implicated in the regulation of bile , lipid, glucose and  homeostasis. The role of these receptors in the intestine in  metabolism regulation has been recently highlighted. More precisely, recent studies have shown that FXR is important for glucose homeostasis in particular in metabolic disorders such as T2D and obesity. This review highlights the growing importance of the bile  receptors TGR5 and FXR in the intestine as key regulators of glucose metabolism and their potential as therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214655>Calorie-induced ER stress suppresses uroguanylin satiety signaling in diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>The uroguanylin-GUCY2C gut-brain axis has emerged as one component regulating feeding,  homeostasis, body mass and metabolism. Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying obesity was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of obesity, as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation of receptor sensitivity, obesity may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17967503>Spread mixed monolayers of  and dehydrocholic acids at the air-water interface, effect of subphase pH. Characterization by axisymmetric drop shape analysis.</a></h2><p>Bile acids ( and dehydrocholic acids) spread mixed monolayers behavior at the air/water interface were studied as a function of subphase pH using a constant surface pressure penetration Langmuir balance based on the Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis (ADSA). We examined the influence of electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydration forces on the interaction between amphiphilic molecules at the interface by the collapse area values, the thermodynamic parameters and equation of state virial coefficients analysis. The obtained results showed that at neutral (pH=6.7) or basic (pH=10) subphase conditions the collapse areas values are similar to that of cholanoic  and consistent with the cross-sectional area of the steroid nucleus (approximately 40 A(2)). The Gibbs  of mixing values (DeltaG(mix)<0) and the first virial coefficients of the equation of state (b(0)<1) indicated that a miscible monolayer with laterally structured microdomains existed. The aggregation number (1/b(0)) was estimated within the order of 6 (pH=6.7) and 3 (pH=10). At pH=3.2, acidic subphase conditions, no phase separation occurs (DeltaG(mix)<0) but a high expanded effect of the monolayer could be noted. The mixed monolayer behavior was no ideal and no aggregates were formed (b(0)> or =1). Such behavior indicates that the polar groups of the molecules interacts each other more strongly by repulsive electrostatic forces than with the more hydrophobic part of the molecule.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9136839>Safety and efficacy of repeated shockwave lithotripsy of gallstones with and without adjuvant bile  therapy.</a></h2><p>The value of adjuvant bile  dissolution therapy after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gallbladder stones is under debate. A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of repeated ESWL with and without adjuvant bile  therapy.At five centers, 153 patients with gallstones and good gallbladder emptying were randomized to undergo up to six high- lithotripsy sessions combined with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA, 750 mg/day; n = 77) or placebo (n = 76).Six months after the initial treatment, 77% of patients with small single stones (< or = 20 mm in diameter), 60% with large single stones (> 20 mm in diameter), and 41% with multiple stones were free of stones. Administration of UDCA had no effect on stone disappearance in the whole study group but tended to improve stone disappearance rates in patients with large single stones and tended to decrease biliary adverse effects in patients with multiple stones.Repeated high- ESWL without adjuvant bile  therapy represents a safe and effective treatment in patients with small single stones and good gallbladder emptying. In patients with large single stones and multiple stones, adjuvant bile  therapy may be beneficial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11274790>Creatine-supplemented diet extends Purkinje cell survival in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 transgenic mice but does not prevent the ataxic phenotype.</a></h2><p>It is not known why expression of a protein with an expanded polyglutamine region is pathogenic in spinocerebellar ataxia, Huntington's disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Dietary supplementation with creatine improves survival and motor performance and delays neuronal atrophy in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease. These effects may be due to improved  and calcium homeostasis, enhanced presynaptic glutamate uptake, or protection of mitochondria from the mitochondrial permeability transition. We tested the effects of a 2% creatine-supplemented diet and treatment with taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic , a bile constituent that can inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition, on ataxia and Purkinje cell survival in a transgenic model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. After 24 weeks, transgenic mice on the 2% creatine diet had cerebellar phosphocreatine levels that were 72.5% of wildtype controls, compared to 26.8% in transgenic mice fed a control diet. The creatine diet resulted in maintenance of Purkinje cell numbers in these transgenic mice at levels comparable to wildtype controls, while transgenic mice fed a control diet lost over 25% of their Purkinje cell population. Nevertheless, the ataxic phenotype was neither improved nor delayed. Repeated s.c. ursodeoxycholic  injections markedly elevated ursodeoxycholic  levels in the brain without adverse effects, but provided no improvement in phenotype or cell survival in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 mice. These results demonstrate that preserving neurons from degeneration is insufficient to prevent a behavioral phenotype in this transgenic model of polyglutamine disease. In addition, we suggest that the means by which creatine mitigates against the neurodegenerative effects of an ataxin-1 protein containing an expanded polyglutamine region is through mechanisms other than stabilization of mitochondrial membranes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6626562>The effect of 3-sulphation and taurine conjugation on the uptake of chenodeoxycholic  by rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The hepatic uptake of chenodeoxycholic , taurochenodeoxycholic , chenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate and taurochenodeoxycholate  3-sulphate by isolated rat hepatocytes was examined. Taurochenodeoxycholic , taurochenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate and chenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate uptake occurred by a saturable, -dependent process while chenodeoxycholic  uptake was predominantly non-saturable, possibly simple diffusion. Apparent Km (mumol/l) and Vmax (nmol/mg protein per min) values (mean +/- S.D.), respectively, were: chenodeoxycholic  (saturable component), 33 +/- 6.4 and 4.8 +/- 0.6; taurochenodeoxycholic , 11.1 +/- 2.0 and 3.1 +/- 0.5; chenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate, 6.1 +/- 0.9 and 2.3 +/- 0.4; and taurochenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate, 5.0 +/- 0.7 and 0.9 +/- 0.15. Both conjugation with taurine and sulphation at the 3 position resulted in a reduction in the values of Km and Vmax. Uptake of each of the bile acids taurochenodeoxycholic , taurochenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate and chenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate was competitively inhibited by the other two, with taurochenodeoxycholic  a potent inhibitor of both taurochenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate and chenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate uptake. Other bile acids also inhibited. Uptake was inhibited by albumin in the order chenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate greater than taurochenodeoxycholic  3-sulphate greater than taurochenodeoxycholic  and was dependent on the extent of bile  binding to albumin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18328679>Critical micellar concentrations of keto derivatives of selected bile acids: thermodynamic functions of micelle formation.</a></h2><p>The knowledge of the process of formation of molecular aggregates of bile acids in aqueous media and of the corresponding critical micellar concentrations (CMCs) is of great significance because of the biological importance of these compounds and their pharmacological applications. In view of this, the present study is concerned with the determination of CMCs of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids and their keto derivatives at different temperatures with the aim to calculate the standard thermodynamic functions of micelle formation. Based on the molecular descriptors for tested compounds and entropy of micelle formation, the method of principal component analysis (PCA) allowed grouping of the behavior of tested molecules at 30, 50 and 70 degrees C. To one group belong cholic  and its keto derivatives, the other group consisting of chenodeoxycholic and  acids and their keto derivatives. For each group, the derived multiple linear regression equations of the entropy dependence on temperature contains different independent variables. A main difference between the two groups of tested bile acids is in the  of dipole-dipole interaction, which appears to be temperature dependent, and in the case of the latter group comes into play as an independent variable already in the regression equation derived for 30 degrees C. The most remarkable changes of the descriptors with temperature were observed in the group of cholic  and its derivatives.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766162>Nuclear receptors: how do they position in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease treatment?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1319111>Effect of oat bran on plasma cholesterol and bile  excretion in nine subjects with ileostomies.</a></h2><p>A higher excretion of dry matter, fat, nitrogen, , and total bile acids in ileal effluents; a lower plasma low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterols (12.1% and 9.0% lower respectively); but no change in plasma high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apolipoproteins A-I and B were observed in nine subjects with ileostomies when they consumed an oat-bran, bread-based, high-fiber diet (HFD) as compared with a wheat-flour, bread-based, low-fiber diet (LFD) for 3 wk with a crossover design.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting  expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The aims of the present study were to investigate (1) whether inflammation induced by a single high-, high-fat meal (HFM) is associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and (2) whether these inflammatory and ERS responses could be prevented by the chemical chaperone ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). A total of ten healthy lean men were recruited to a randomised, blind, cross-over trial. Subjects were given two doses of placebo (lactose) or UDCA before the consumption of a HFM (6151 kJ; 47·4 % lipids). Blood was collected at baseline and 4 h after the HFM challenge. Cell populations and their activation were analysed using flow cytometry, and plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines were assessed by ELISA and Luminex technology. Gene expression levels of inflammatory and ERS markers were analysed in CD14⁺ and CD14⁻ PBMC using quantitative RT-PCR. The HFM induced an increase in the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, 2·1-fold; IL-8, 2·4-fold; TNF-α, 1·4-fold; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, 2·1-fold) and a decrease in the expression levels of miR181 (0·8-fold) in CD14⁺ monocytes. The HFM challenge did not up-regulate the expression of ERS markers (XBP1, HSPA5, EDEM1, DNAJC3 and ATF4) in either CD14⁺ or CD14⁻ cell populations, except for ATF3 (2·3-fold). The administration of UDCA before the consumption of the HFM did not alter the HFM-induced change in the expression levels of ERS or inflammatory markers. In conclusion, HFM-induced inflammation detectable on the level of gene expression in PBMC was not associated with the concomitant increase in the expression levels of ERS markers and could not be prevented by UDCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190214>Novel chenodeoxycholic -sodium alginate matrix in the microencapsulation of the potential antidiabetic drug, probucol.

Here the derivatized fullerenes covalently bound to silica particles with different pore sizes are applied as thin layer for laser desorption/ionization (LDI) mass spectrometric analysis. Thus, an interference of intrinsic matrix ions can be eliminated or minimized in comparison with the state-of-the-art weak organic  matrices. The desorption/ionization ability of the developed fullerene-silica materials depends on the applied laser power, sample preparation and pore size of the silica particles. Thus, fullerene-silica serves as an LDI support for mass spectrometric analysis of molecules (<1500 Da). The performance of the fullerene-silica is demonstrated by the mass analysis of variety of small molecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, phospholipids and drugs.2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6865641>Effect of blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration on fecal steroid excretion in humans.</a></h2><p>Daily excretion of fecal total bile acids and neutral steroids were compared in five controls and two patients with extremely low concentrations of plasma high density lipoprotein (3 to 11 mg/dl) and severe atherosclerosis.

The latter agent binds to the surface pocket formed by the BH1, BH2 and BH3 domains of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L). Fluorescence polarization studies indicated that affinity of HA14-1 for Bcl-2 was enhanced in the presence of UDCA. Moreover, Bcl-2 photodamage was promoted by UDCA using a photosensitizing agent with affinity for the endoplasmic reticulum, a site of Bcl-2 localization. Fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) studies revealed that the proximity of Bcl-2 to a hydrophobic photosensitizing agent embedded in liposomes was enhanced by UDCA. Since photodamage will occur only if a protein is in close contact with a photosensitizing agent, we propose that these findings support the hypothesis that UDCA causes a conformational change in Bcl-2, promoting HA14-1 binding and enhancing affinity for certain membrane-bound photosensitizers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702187>Solubilization conditions for bovine heart mitochondrial membranes allow selective purification of large quantities of respiratory complexes I, III, and V.</a></h2><p>Ascertaining the structure and functions of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes is essential to understanding the biological mechanisms of  conversion; therefore, numerous studies have examined these complexes. A fundamental part of that research involves devising a method for purifying samples with good reproducibility; the samples obtained need to be stable and their constituents need to retain the same structure and functions they possess when in mitochondrial membranes. Submitochondrial bovine heart particles were isolated using differential centrifugation to adjust to a membrane concentration of 46.0% (w/v) or 31.5% (w/v) based on weight. After 0.7% (w/v) , 0.4% (w/v) decyl maltoside, and 7.2% (w/v) potassium chloride were added to the mitochondrial membranes, those membranes were solubilized. At a membrane concentration of 46%, complex V was selectively solubilized, whereas at a concentration of 31.5% (w/v), complexes I and III were solubilized. Two steps-sucrose density gradient centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography on a POROS HQ 20 μm column-enabled selective purification of samples that retained their structure and functions. These two steps enabled complexes I, III, and V to be purified in two days with a high yield. Complexes I, III, and V were stabilized with n-decyl-β-D-maltoside. A total of 200 mg-300 mg of those complexes from one bovine heart (1.1 kg muscle) was purified with good reproducibility, and the complexes retained the same functions they possessed while in mitochondrial membranes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Compounds that alter endogenous FXR signaling can be used as therapeutic candidates or identified as potentially hazardous compounds depending on exposure doses and health states. Therefore, there is an increasing need for high-throughput screening assays of FXR activity to profile large numbers of environmental chemicals and drugs. This chapter describes a workflow of FXR modulator identification and characterization. To identify compounds that modulate FXR transactivation at the cellular level, we first screen compounds from the Tox21 10 K compound library in an FXR-driven beta-lactamase reporter gene assay multiplexed with a cell viability assay in the same well of the 1536-well plates. The selected compounds are then tested biochemically for their ability to modulate FXR-coactivator binding interactions using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance  transfer (TR-FRET) coactivator assay. The assay results from the workflow can be used to prioritize compounds for more extensive investigations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21220320>Bile  stimulates hepatocyte polarization through a cAMP-Epac-MEK-LKB1-AMPK pathway.</a></h2><p>This study describes a unique function of taurocholate in bile canalicular formation involving signaling through a cAMP-Epac-MEK-Rap1-LKB1-AMPK pathway. In rat hepatocyte sandwich cultures, polarization was manifested by sequential progression of bile canaliculi from small structures to a fully branched network. Taurocholate accelerated canalicular network formation and concomitantly increased cAMP, which were prevented by adenyl cyclase inhibitor. The cAMP-dependent PKA inhibitor did not prevent the taurocholate effect. In contrast, activation of Epac, another cAMP downstream kinase, accelerated canalicular network formation similar to the effect of taurocholate. Inhibition of Epac downstream targets, Rap1 and MEK, blocked the taurocholate effect. Taurocholate rapidly activated MEK, LKB1, and AMPK, which were prevented by inhibition of adenyl cyclase or MEK. Our previous study showed that activated-LKB1 and AMPK participate in canalicular network formation. Linkage between bile  synthesis, hepatocyte polarization, and regulation of  metabolism is likely important in normal hepatocyte development and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028858>Approach to the Mature Cosmetic Patient: Aging Gracefully.</a></h2><p><p>Aging gracefully has taken on a whole new meaning over the past few decades as new aesthetic treatments have been developed and are becoming more sophisticated by the day. The aging process, which is exacerbated by chronic UV exposure, results in dyspigmentation, loss of skin laxity, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions, fat loss and redistribution, and bone resorption. Laser and light devices can be used to treat dyspigmentation, while neuromodulators and soft tissue fillers can be used for rhytides and revolumization. Newer procedures include using resorbable polyglycolide/L-lactide suspension sutures with bidirectional cones for mid face revolumization,  injections for submental fat reduction, and radiofrequency . Certain over-the-counter products can increase the risk of postprocedure bruising, while arnica and bromelain may help decrease this risk.

Cholic  was shown to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders in high-fat-diet (cHF)-fed mice while enhancing  expenditure through induction of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and activation of non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this study, the effects of another natural BA, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), on dietary obesity, UCP1 in both interscapular BAT and in white adipose tissue (brite cells in WAT), were characterized in dietary-obese mice.To induce obesity and associated metabolic disorders, male 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice were fed cHF (35% lipid wt wt(-1), mainly corn oil) for 4 months. Mice were then fed either (i) for 8 weeks with cHF or with cHF with two different doses (0.5%, 1%; wt wt(-1)) of CDCA (8-week reversion); or (ii) for 3 weeks with cHF or with cHF with 1% CDCA, or pair-fed (PF) to match calorie intake of the CDCA mice fed ad libitum; mice on standard chow diet were also used (3-week reversion).In the 8-week reversion, the CDCA intervention resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of obesity, dyslipidaemia and glucose intolerance, which could be largely explained by a transient decrease in food intake. The 3-week reversion revealed mild CDCA-dependent and food intake-independent induction of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in interscapular BAT, negligible increase of UCP1 in subcutaneous WAT and a shift from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation.CDCA could reverse obesity in cHF-fed mice, mainly in response to the reduction in food intake, an effect probably occuring but neglected in previous studies using cholic . Nevertheless, CDCA-dependent and food intake-independent induction of UCP1 in BAT (but not in WAT) could contribute to the reduction in adiposity and to the stabilization of the lean phenotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22939256>Interactions of phenothiazine drugs with bile salts: micellization and binding studies.</a></h2><p>An evaluation of the interactions of phenothiazine tranquilizer drugs (promazine hydrochloride; PMZ and promethazine hydrochloride; PMT) with bile salts viz., sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) in aqueous medium, investigated through different physicochemical measurements is presented in this work. The mixed micellization behavior and surface properties of the phenothiazine-bile salt systems have been analyzed by conductivity and surface tension measurements. Application of different theoretical approaches to all the phenothiazine-bile salt mixtures shows a non-ideal behavior. Further, the spectroscopic techniques such as UV-visible and steady state fluorescence have been employed to study the binding of phenothiazines with bile salts. The stoichiometric ratios, binding constants (K), and free  change (ΔG) for the phenothiazine-bile salt complexes were estimated from the Benesi-Hildebrand (B-H) double reciprocal plots obtained by using the changes in spectral intensities of phenothiazines on addition of bile salts. The results are discussed in the light of use of bile salts as promising drug delivery agents for phenothiazines and hence improve their bioavailabilty.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Bile acids (BAs) bind to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and  expenditure. The present study aimed to determine associations between the circulating BAs and the skeletal muscle volume (SMV), and lipid and glucose metabolism in patients with NAFLD. Methods Serum BAs and metabolic parameters were measured in 55 patients with NAFLD (median age, 55 years). The changes (Δ) in serum BA (ΔBA) and metabolic parameters were determined in 17 patients (male, n=10; female, n=7) who received nutritional counseling for 12 months. Results Spearman's test revealed that the levels of 12α-hydroxysterol (12α-OH) BAs, including  (DCA), were inversely correlated with the SMV of the upper and lower limbs and the total SMV. A multivariate analysis revealed that the level of DCA was correlated with a reduced total SMV, whereas non-12α-OH BAs, including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), were correlated with an increased SMV of the lower limbs. Changes in CDCA were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs, and inversely correlated with the Δwaist-hip ratio and Δtotal cholesterol. Changes in the total non-12α-OH BA level were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs. Conclusion Circulating BAs were associated with SMV. The 12α-OH BAs, including DCA were associated with reduced SMV levels, whereas non-12α-OH BAs including CDCA were associated with increased SMV levels. The molecular mechanisms underlying the association between the BA levels and the SMV remain to be explored.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1514291>[Extracorporeal shock wave treatment of calcium containing gallbladder calculi].</a></h2><p>A total of 50 patients--37 female and 13 male--with an average age of 50 +/- 27 years (23-86 years), suffering from rim-calcified gallbladder stones, underwent extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), using an ultrasound-guided overhead module of Lithostar Plus (Siemens Company). The total number of stones was 87, with an average diameter of 16 +/- 7 (7-38) mm. 29 patients had a solitary stone, 13 had two and 8 patients three or more stones. All patients received adjunct medication of 10 mg/kg body weight chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic  14 days prior to ESWL as a single bedtime dose. An average number of 5,300 +/- 2,200 shock waves (1,200-15,000) was applied for stone disintegration. The corresponding  amounted to 750 bar. 29 patients needed one, 21 two or more treatments. After ESWL a variety of clinical abnormalities was observed: flank pain (15%), transient microhaematuria (33%) and transient macrohaematuria (2%). Subsequent to ESWL 5 patients suffered from complications such as biliary obstruction 3 weeks to 9 months after treatment and had to undergo ERCP. Three times endoscopic papillotomy was performed to remove stones from the common bile duct. Up to now 4 patients have undergone cholecystectomy: acute cholecystitis (n = 3), recurrent colicky pain (n = 1). 20 patients have been followed up over a 12-month period; 12 of them are completely free of stones and fragments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015415>Bile acids inhibit Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger activities via cellular  breakdown and Ca²⁺ overload in human colonic crypts.</a></h2><p>Bile acids play important physiological role in the solubilisation and absorption of dietary lipids. However, under pathophysiological conditions, such as short bowel syndrome, they can reach the colon in high concentrations inducing diarrhoea. In this study, our aim was to characterise the cellular pathomechanism of bile-induced diarrhoea using human samples. Colonic crypts were isolated from biopsies of patients (controls with negative colonoscopic findings) and of cholecystectomised/ileum-resected patients with or without diarrhoea. In vitro measurement of the transporter activities revealed impaired Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger (NHE) and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger (CBE) activities in cholecystectomised/ileum-resected patients suffering from diarrhoea, compared to control patients. Acute treatment of colonic crypts with 0.3 mM chenodeoxycholate caused dose-dependent intracellular acidosis; moreover, the activities of /base transporters (NHE and CBE) were strongly impaired. This concentration of chenodeoxycholate did not cause morphological changes in colonic epithelial cells, although significantly reduced the intracellular ATP level, decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caused sustained intracellular Ca²⁺ elevation. We also showed that chenodeoxycholate induced Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular Ca²⁺ influx contributing to the Ca²⁺ elevation. Importantly, our results suggest that the chenodeoxycholate-induced inhibition of NHE activities was ATP-dependent, whereas the inhibition of CBE activity was mediated by the sustained Ca²⁺ elevation. We suggest that bile acids inhibit the function of ion transporters via cellular  breakdown and Ca²⁺ overload in human colonic epithelial cells, which can reduce fluid and electrolyte absorption in the colon and promote the development of diarrhea.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25519031>Ultrastructural analysis of an enterolith composed of .</a></h2><p>A 67-year-old Japanese man underwent enterotomy because of enterolith ileus.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9098046>Active efflux of bile salts by Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli must tolerate high levels of bile salts, powerful detergents that disrupt biological membranes. The outer membrane barrier of gram-negative bacteria plays an important role in this resistance, but ultimately it can only retard the influx of bile salts. We therefore examined whether E. coli possessed an -dependent efflux mechanism for these compounds. Intact cells of E. coli K-12 appeared to pump out chenodeoxycholate, since its intracellular accumulation increased more than twofold upon deenergization of the cytoplasmic membrane by a proton conductor. Growth inhibition by bile salts and accumulation levels of chenodeoxycholate increased when mutations inactivating the acrAB and emrAB gene clusters were introduced. The AcrAB system especially appeared to play a significant role in bile  efflux. However, another efflux system(s) also plays an important role, since the accumulation level of chenodeoxycholate increased strongly upon deenergization of acrA emrB double mutant cells. Everted membrane vesicles accumulated taurocholate in an -dependent manner, apparently consuming delta pH without affecting delta psi. The efflux thus appears to be catalyzed by a proton antiporter. Accumulation by the everted membrane vesicles was not decreased by mutations in acr and emrB genes and presumably reflects activity of the unknown system seen in intact cells. It followed saturation kinetics with Vmax and Km values in the neighborhood of 0.3 nmol min(-1) mg of protein(-1) and 50 microM, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29371149>Redox-responsive micelles for triggered drug delivery and effective laryngopharyngeal cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>In this study, we reported a redox-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) based on heparosan and  conjugates (HSDs) for effective treatment of laryngopharyngeal carcinoma. The amphiphilic HSDs can self-assemble into stable nanoscale micelles in aqueous medium with favorable drug loading capacity for doxorubicin (DOX). The HSD micelles can exhibit glutathione (GSH)-triggered drug release behavior and reach a nearly 100% release rate in a high GSH level (10 mM) environment. Moreover, FaDu cancer cells can internalize HSD micelles by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is  dependent, fast, and effective. The DOX@HSD induced inhibition of FaDu cancer cells can achieve a minimum of 10-fold selectivity relative to that of COS-7 normal cells. Overall, the redox-responsive DDSs show good biocompatibility and are promising in the clinical treatment of laryngopharyngeal carcinoma.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Rat feces were collected from 2 to 4 weeks following exposure and were assessed for gut-microbiota-dependent metabolites. Gut-microbiota-related organic acids were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure, AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with an over 70% reduction in the high-dose group (75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs, but no significant time effect was found. When compared with the control, oral exposure to middle-dose AFB1 (25 μg/kg) resulted in remarkable elevations of fecal cholic  (2.18-fold), linoleic  (cis-9, cis-12-18:2) (11.3-fold), pentadecanoic  (15: 0) (3.68-fold), pyruvic  (4.56-fold), and 3-phenyllactic  (3.74-fold), but  level was reduced by 41% in the low-dose group (5 μg/kg). These results demonstrated the disruptions of several important gut-microbiota metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of SCFAs, pyruvic  related pathways, metabolisms of amino acids, bile acids and long-chain fatty acids, which may further affect host digestive efficiency, energy supply, intestinal , production of neurotransmitters, and enterohepatic cross-talk.

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between plasma BA levels and  expenditure in humans. Type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients (n = 12) and gender, age and BMI-matched healthy controls (n = 12) were studied before and after 8 weeks of treatment with a BA sequestrant. In addition, patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 46) were investigated, since these display elevated plasma BA together with increased  expenditure. This group was compared to gender-, age- and BMI-matched healthy controls (n = 20). Fasting plasma levels of total BA and individual BA species as well as resting  expenditure were determined. In response to treatment with the BA sequestrant, plasma  (DCA) levels decreased in controls (-60%, p < 0.05) and T2DM (-32%, p < 0.05), while chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) decreased in controls only (-33%, p < 0.05).  expenditure did not differ between T2DM and controls at baseline and, in contrast to plasma BA levels, was unaffected by treatment with the BA sequestrant. Total BA as well as individual BA species did not correlate with  expenditure at any time throughout the study. Patients with cirrhosis displayed on average an increase in  expenditure of 18% compared to values predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation, and plasma levels of total BA (up to 12-fold) and individual BA (up to 20-fold) were increased over a wide range. However, neither total nor individual plasma BA levels correlated with  expenditure. In addition,  expenditure was identical in patients with a cholestatic versus a non-cholestatic origin of liver disease while plasma total BA levels differed four-fold between the groups. In conclusion, in the various (patho)physiological conditions studied, plasma BA levels were not associated with changes in  expenditure. Therefore, our data do not support an important role of circulating BA in the control of human  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7647098>Kinetic behaviour of pancreatic lipase in five species using emulsions and monomolecular films of synthetic glycerides.</a></h2><p>In the absence of colipase and bile salts, using tributyrin emulsions or monomolecular films of dicaprin at low surface pressure, we observed that no significant lipase activity can be measured with Human Pancreatic Lipase (HuPL), Horse Pancreatic Lipase (HoPL) or Dog Pancreatic Lipase (DPL). Only Porcine Pancreatic Lipase (PPL) and recombinant Guinea Pig Pancreatic Lipase Related Protein of type 2 (r-GPL) hydrolyse pure tributyrin in the absence of any additive, as well as dicaprin films at low surface pressures. The former lipases may lack enzyme activity because of irreversible interfacial denaturation due to the high  existing at the tributyrin/water interface and at the dicaprin film surface at low surface pressures. The enzyme denaturation cannot be reflected in the number of disulfide bridges, since all the pancreatic lipases tested here contain six disulfide bridges, but behaved very differently at interfaces. We propose to use the surface pressure threshold, as determined using the monomolecular technique, as a criterion for classifying lipases in terms of their sensitivity to interfacial denaturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29751815>Changes in the faecal bile  profile in dogs fed dry food vs high content of beef: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Dogs are fed various diets, which also include components of animal origin. In humans, a high-fat/low-fibre diet is associated with higher faecal levels of bile acids, which can influence intestinal health. It is unknown how an animal-based diet high in fat and low in fibre influences the faecal bile  levels and intestinal health in dogs. This study investigated the effects of high intake of minced beef on the faecal bile  profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs (n = 8) in a 7-week trial. Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food. Thereafter, incremental substitution of the dry food by boiled minced beef over 3 weeks resulted in a diet in which 75% of each dog's total  requirement was provided as minced beef during week 5. Dogs were subsequently reintroduced to the dry food for the last 2 weeks of the study. The total taurine and glycine-conjugated bile acids, the primary bile acids chenodeoxycholic  and cholic , and the secondary bile acids lithocholic ,  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) were analysed, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The faecal quantities of DCA were significantly higher in dogs fed the high minced beef diet. These levels reversed when dogs were reintroduced to the dry food diet. The faecal levels of UDCA and taurine-conjugated bile acids had also increased in response to the beef diet, but this was only significant when compared to the last dry food period.These results suggest that an animal-based diet with high-fat/low-fibre content can influence the faecal bile acids levels. The consequences of this for canine colonic health will require further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26613247>Structural determinants of ligand binding in the ternary complex of human ileal bile  binding protein with glycocholate and glycochenodeoxycholate obtained from solution NMR.</a></h2><p>Besides aiding digestion, bile salts are important signal molecules exhibiting a regulatory role in metabolic processes. Human ileal bile  binding protein (I-BABP) is an intracellular carrier of bile salts in the epithelial cells of the distal small intestine and has a key role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. Positive binding cooperativity combined with site selectivity of glycocholate and glycochenodeoxycholate, the two most abundant bile salts in the human body, make human I-BABP a unique member of the family of intracellular lipid binding proteins. Solution NMR structure of the ternary complex of human I-BABP with glycocholate and glycochenodeoxycholate reveals an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions stabilizing the bound bile salts. Conformational changes accompanying bile salt binding affects four major regions in the protein including the C/D, E/F and G/H loops as well as the helical segment. Most of these protein regions coincide with a previously described network of millisecond time scale fluctuations in the apo protein, a motion absent in the bound state. Comparison of the heterotypic doubly ligated complex with the unligated form provides further evidence of a conformation selection mechanism of ligand entry. Structural and dynamic aspects of human I-BABP-bile salt interaction are discussed and compared with characteristics of ligand binding in other members of the intracellular lipid binding protein family.The coordinates of the 10 lowest  structures of the human I-BABP : GCDA : GCA complex as well as the distance restraints used to calculate the final ensemble have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession number 2MM3.© 2015 FEBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28779240>Increased glycine-amidated hyocholic  correlates to improved early weight loss after sleeve gastrectomy.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are post-prandial hormones that play an important role in glucose and lipid homeostasis as well as  expenditure.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the comprehensive changes in meal-stimulated BAs after SG and determine if a specific change in the BA profile correlates to the early weight loss response.Patients were prospectively enrolled at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who were undergoing a SG for treatment of morbid obesity. Primary and secondary plasma bile acids and their amidated (glycine, G-, or taurine, T-) subtypes were measured at fasting, 30 and 60 min after a liquid meal performed pre-op, and at 6 and 12 weeks post-op. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the hour meal test for each bile  subtype. BAs that were significantly increased post-op were correlated to body mass index (BMI) loss.Total BA AUC was significantly increased at 6 (p < 0.01) and 12 weeks post-op (p < 0.01) compared to pre-operative values. The increase in total BA AUC was due to a statistically significant increase in G-BAs. Nine different BA AUC subtypes were significantly increased at both 6 and 12 weeks post-op. Increased total and G-chenodeoxycholic  AUC was significantly correlated to the 6 week BMI loss (p = 0.03). Increased G-hyocholic  was significantly correlated to increased weight loss at both 6 (p = 0.05) and 12 weeks (p = 0.006).SG induced an early and persistent post-prandial surge in multiple bile  subtypes. Increased G-hyocholic consistently correlated with greater early BMI loss. This study provides evidence for a role of BAs in the surgical weight loss response after SG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372730>Obesity and the gut microbiome: pathophysiological aspects.</a></h2><p>While there is a large volume of literature describing a role for obesity as a risk factor for breast cancer and many other cancers, in the main a causal relationship has not been established. If the study is limited to breast cancer risk, it has been suggested that the increase in sex steroid formation that occurs in postmenopausal women plays a role. Obesity is known to be associated with chronic low grade inflammation, but no reason for this association has been offered in the past. The gut microbiome, while known to be enormous, has not in the past been considered as a metabolic role player in the body. This is now recognized to be the case. Recent studies have found the obesity is correlated with an alteration in the gut microbiome. In obese individual there is a change in the relative proportions of the two major classes of bacteria - bacteroides and firmacutes - with the latter dominant in obesity and resulting in the formation of increased amounts of metabolic endotoxins like  and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Obese individuals show a decrease in the concentration of Akkermansia muciniphila in the mucus that lines the intestinal wall, resulting in thinner mucus and a weakened intestinal lining and permitting metabolic endotoxins formed by other bacterial flora like LPS to enter the blood steam and cause the chronic inflammation associated with obesity. The change in the microbiome profile results in increases in bacterial strains that are more efficient at generating , leading to increased obesity. In mice, it has been shown that introducing gut bacterial flora from the cecum of obese mice into germ-free mice results in increased obesity with lesser food consumption while the reverse, introducing bacterial flora from lean mice results in a loss in weight. This raises the attractive possibility that manipulating the gut microbiome could facilitate weight loss or prevent obesity in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27488269>The bile  chenodeoxycholic  directly modulates metabolic pathways in white adipose tissue in vitro: insight into how bile acids decrease obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, and associated pathologies, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular alterations, are increasingly escalating morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for  waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty  oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147338>Metabolic profiling in colorectal cancer reveals signature metabolic shifts during tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises as the consequence of progressive changes from normal epithelial cells through polyp to tumor, and thus is an useful model for studying metabolic shift. In the present study, we studied the metabolomic profiles using high analyte specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to attain a systems-level view of the shift in metabolism in cells progressing along the path to CRC. Colonic tissues including tumor, polyps and adjacent matched normal mucosa from 26 patients with sporadic CRC from freshly isolated resections were used for this study. The metabolic profiles were obtained using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. Our data suggest there was a distinct profile change of a wide range of metabolites from mucosa to tumor tissues. Various amino acids and lipids in the polyps and tumors were elevated, suggesting higher  needs for increased cellular proliferation. In contrast, significant depletion of glucose and inositol in polyps revealed that glycolysis may be critical in early tumorigenesis. In addition, the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, and the decrease of uric  concentration, suggest that the purine biosynthesis pathway could have been substituted by the salvage pathway in CRC. Further, there was a step-wise reduction of  concentration from mucosa to tumors. It appears that to gain a growth advantage, cancer cells may adopt alternate metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis and this flexibility allows them to adapt and thrive in harsh environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14698205>In vitro farnesoid X receptor ligand sensor assay using surface plasmon resonance and based on ligand-induced coactivator association.</a></h2><p>Ligand binding to nuclear receptors leads to a conformational change that increases the affinity of the receptors to coactivator proteins. We have developed a ligand sensor assay for farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in which the receptor-coactivator interaction can be directly monitored using surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology. A 25-mer peptide from coactivator SRC1 containing the LXXLL nuclear receptor interaction motif was immobilized on the surface of a BIAcore sensor chip. Injection of the FXR ligand binding domain (FXRLBD) with or without the most potent natural ligand, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), over the surface of the chip resulted in a ligand- and LXXLL motif-dependent interaction. Kinetic analysis revealed that CDCA and its conjugates decreased the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) by 8-11-fold, indicating an increased affinity. Using this technique, we found that a synthetic bile  sulfonate, 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholane-24-sulfonate, which was inactive in a FXR response element-driven luciferase assay using CV-1 cells, caused the most potent interaction, comparable to the reaction produced by CDCA. This method provides a rapid and reliable in vitro ligand assay for FXR. This kinetic analysis-featured technique may be applicable to mechanistic studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904812>Molecular dynamics simulations on the aggregation behavior of indole type organic dye molecules in dye-sensitized solar cells.</a></h2><p>In Ti0(2) nanostructured dye-sensitized solar cells indole based organic dyes D149, D205 exhibits greater power conversion efficiency. Such organic dye molecules are easily undergone for aggregation. Aggregation in dye molecules leads to reduce electron transfer process in dye-sensitized solar cells. Therefore, anti-aggregating agents such as chenodeoxycholic  are commonly added to organic dye solution in DSSCs. Studying aggregation of such dye molecules in the absence of semiconductors gives a detailed influence of anti-aggregating agents on dye molecules. Atomistic level of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on aggregation of indole type dye molecules D149, D205 and D205-F with anti-aggregating agent chenodeoxy cholic  using AMBER program. The trajectories of the MD simulations were analyzed with order parameters such as radial atom pair distribution functions g(r), diffusion coefficients and root mean square deviations values. MD results suggest that addition of chenodeoxy cholic  to dyes significantly reduces structural arrangement and increases conformational flexibility and mobility of dye molecules. The influence of semi-perfluorinated alkyl chains in indole dye molecules was analyzed. The parameters such as open-circuit voltage (V(oc)) and power conversion efficiency (η) of dye-sensitized solar cells are corroborated with flexibility and diffusion values of dye molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859643>Undernourishment in utero and hepatic steatosis in later life: A potential issue in Japanese people.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal  intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic fat deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high fat diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the liver on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis. These results also provide an insight into interventions for the potential high-risk population of NAFLD, such as those born small or exposed to maternal undernourishment during the fetal period, with the alleviation of ER stress by dietary supplements and/or specific food including chaperones.© 2016 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2364768>[Biliary extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy in the surgical treatment concept of cholelithiasis].</a></h2><p>Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (BESWL) using the "Obertisch" module Lithostar Plus (Siemens AG) was carried out in 100 patients, comprising a total of 189 gallbladder stones with a size range from 8 to 35 mm. Chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic  was given as adjuvant litholytic therapy, beginning 14 days before treatment. 53% of the patients suffered from radiolucent solitary stones with an average size of 21 +/- 6 mm. 14% had more than 3 stones, another 12% had solitary stones with a small rim calcification. In 99 patients all stones could be disintegrated.

Secondary bile acids are formed by the 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by intestinal anaerobic bacteria. We have previously described a multistep biochemical pathway in Clostridium scindens that is responsible for bile  7α-dehydroxylation. We have identified a large (12 kb) bile  inducible (bai) operon in this bacterium that encodes eight genes involved in bile  7α-dehydroxylation. However, the function of the baiF gene product in this operon has not been elucidated. In the current study, we cloned and expressed the baiF gene in E. coli and discovered it has bile  CoA transferase activity. In addition, we discovered a second bai operon encoding three genes. The baiK gene in this operon was expressed in E. coli and found to encode a second bile  CoA transferase. Both bile  CoA transferases were determined to be members of the type III family by amino  sequence comparisons. Both bile  CoA transferases had broad substrate specificity, except the baiK gene product, which failed to use lithocholyl-CoA as a CoA donor. Primary bile acids are ligated to CoA via an ATP-dependent mechanism during the initial steps of 7α-dehydroxylation. The bile  CoA transferases conserve the thioester bond , saving the cell ATP molecules during bile  7α-dehydroxylation. ATP-dependent CoA ligation is likely quickly supplanted by ATP-independent CoA transfer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172112>Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary pomegranate extract and inulin in mice fed an obesogenic diet.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated in animal studies that both polyphenol-rich pomegranate extract (PomX) and the polysaccharide inulin, ameliorate metabolic changes induced by a high-fat diet, but little is known about the specific mechanisms.This study evaluated the effect of PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination on cholesterol and lipid metabolism in mice.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat/high-sucrose [HF/HS (32%  from fat, 25%  from sucrose)] diets supplemented with PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination for 4 weeks. At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and lipid metabolism as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways. Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and lipid weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The uptake consisted of unsaturable and saturable processes at 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C, respectively. The activation  found for the saturable process was 26.1 Kcal/mol. In the saturable process the rate of cholic  uptake followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km: 67 microM and Vmax: 1.43 nmoles/ml protein/min. The uptake was significantly inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol, and replacement of extracellular Na+ by choline did not decrease the uptake. The uptake of cholic  was competitively inhibited by , taurocholic , glycocholic , chenodeoxycholic , taurochenodeoxycholic  and glycochenodeoxycholic . It is concluded from the above results that the cholic  uptake in isolated hepatocytes is mainly mediated by an -dependent and sodium-independent carrier-mediated transport process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679932>The measurement of enzyme activities in the resting human polymorphonuclear leukocyte--critical estimate of a method.</a></h2><p>As a system for study, the isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocyte combines the advantages of a quasi-non-invasive preparation with a nearly complete complement of enzymes of carbohydrate and  metabolism. However, small sample volumes and, in some cases, very low enzyme activities make high demands on sample processing, storage, and performance of continuous measurements, if the enzyme activities are to be measured with acceptable reproducibility. In the presented study several aspects of homogenization, storage, and continuous measurement were scrutinized, to identify critical steps and consider ways of optimizing the method. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from the blood of healthy subjects by sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation. After ultrasonic homogenization, 13 enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic  cycle, and glycogen metabolism were determined photometrically. The variation of several conditions showed: 1. The duration of exposure to ultrasound for the homogenization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes has no influence over a wide range of time. 2. Addition of the detergents Triton X-100 and , as well as the SH-group protector dithiothreitol, to the homogenizing medium increased the measured activities of only a few enzymes. 3. Considerable inaccuracy was encountered when the suspension was divided into parts for homogenization with different additives; such splitting of the suspension should therefore be performed only when necessary, as in the determination of reference values (e.g. protein or DNA content of the cell suspension). 4. Twenty four-fold determination of enzyme activities from one homogenate resulted in precisions between 4.5% (citrate synthase) and 14.4% (transketolase), which is satisfactory for the low activities (as low as 1 U/l) in the homogenate. 5. The reproducibility of enzyme activities, measured in homogenates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from different blood samples drawn simultaneously, was only slightly worse than that of the continuous measurement method itself. Thus, the precision of the measurement of enzyme activity seems to be the main determinant of the overall method. In conclusion, the described procedure of separation, homogenization, and enzyme measurement in human polymorphonuclear leukocyte meets the requirements of biochemical or clinical trials and can be recommended for clinical metabolic studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10500075>Oral budesonide and ursodeoxycholic  for treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis: results of a prospective double-blind trial.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is used for treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. Previous studies showed that, compared with UDCA monotherapy, bile salts plus prednisolone had no further effect on laboratory data but improved liver histology. Thirty percent of these patients had prednisolone-related side effects. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with a high receptor affinity and a high first-pass metabolism. In this study we investigated whether budesonide and UDCA are superior to UDCA monotherapy.A 2-year prospective, controlled double-blind trial was performed. Twenty patients (mainly with early-stage disease) were treated with UDCA at a dose of 10-15 mg/kg daily in addition to 3 mg budesonide 3 times daily (group A), and 19 patients (1 dropped out for personal reasons) were treated with UDCA plus placebo (group B). Liver biopsy specimens were taken before, after 12 months, and at the end of study. Glucose tolerance tests, serum cortisol levels, and adrenocorticotropin-stimulated cortisol secretion were assessed at regular intervals. Bone mass density was measured by dual- photon absorptiometry.Compared with pretreatment values, liver enzyme and immunoglobulin M and G levels decreased significantly in both groups. Improvement in group A was significantly more pronounced (P < 0.05) than in group B. Titers of antimitochondrial antibodies did not change. In group A, the point score of liver histology improved by 30.3%; in group B, it deteriorated by 3.5% (P < 0.001). Changes in bone mineral density after 2 years were -1.747% in group A and -0.983% in group B (P = 0.43). Budesonide had little influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

Since it was previously shown that bile acids bind to FXR by projecting the carboxylic tail opposite the transactivation function 2 (AF-2, helix 12), functionalization of the side chain is not expected to interfere directly with the orientation of H12 but can result in a more indirect way of receptor modulation. The newly synthesized compounds were extensively characterized for their ability to modulate FXR function in a variety of assays, including the cell-free fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) assay and the cell-based luciferase transactivation assay, and displayed a broad range of activity from full agonism to partial antagonism. Docking studies clearly indicate that the side chain of the new derivatives fits in a so far unexploited receptor cavity localized near the "back door" of FXR.

Nowadays, their role in glucose regulation and  homeostasis are widely reported. BAs are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, such as protein kinase cascades, cyclic AMP (cAMP) synthesis, and calcium mobilization. They are ligands for several nuclear hormone receptors, including farnesoid X-receptor (FXR). Recently, BAs have been shown to bind to muscarinic receptor and Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), both G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), independent of the nuclear hormone receptors. Moreover, BA signals have also been elucidated in other nonclassical BA pathways, such as sphingosine-1-posphate and BK (large conductance calcium- and voltage activated potassium) channels. Hydrophobic BAs have been proven to affect heart rate and its contraction. Elevated BAs are associated with arrhythmias in adults and fetal heart, and altered ratios of primary and secondary bile  are reported in chronic heart failure patients. Meanwhile, in patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction has been strongly linked to the increase in serum bile  concentrations. In contrast, the most hydrophilic BA, known as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has been found to be beneficial in improving peripheral blood flow in chronic heart failure patients and in protecting the heart against reperfusion injury. This review provides an overview of BA signaling, with the main emphasis on past and present perspectives on UDCA signals in the heart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579434>The human gut sterolbiome: bile -microbiome endocrine aspects and therapeutics.</a></h2><p>The human body is now viewed as a complex ecosystem that on a cellular and gene level is mainly prokaryotic. The mammalian liver synthesizes and secretes hydrophilic primary bile acids, some of which enter the colon during the enterohepatic circulation, and are converted into numerous hydrophobic metabolites which are capable of entering the portal circulation, returned to the liver, and in humans, accumulating in the biliary pool. Bile acids are hormones that regulate their own synthesis, transport, in addition to glucose and lipid homeostasis, and  balance. The gut microbial community through their capacity to produce bile  metabolites distinct from the liver can be thought of as an "endocrine organ" with potential to alter host physiology, perhaps to their own favor. We propose the term "sterolbiome" to describe the genetic potential of the gut microbiome to produce endocrine molecules from endogenous and exogenous steroids in the mammalian gut. The affinity of secondary bile  metabolites to host nuclear receptors is described, the potential of secondary bile acids to promote tumors, and the potential of bile acids to serve as therapeutic agents are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9588011>Characterization of mixed micellar pseudostationary phases in electrokinetic chromatography using linear solvation  relationships.</a></h2><p>The influence of mixed micellar systems on retention and selectivity in micellar electrokinetic chromatography is examined using linear solvation  relationships (LSER).

The interactive properties of the mixed micelles are different from the constituent individual micelles, however, the overall characteristics are closer to one of the bile salt micelles in the mixture even at the equimolar compositions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011359>Investigation of Efficacy Enhancing and Toxicity Reducing Mechanism of Combination of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and Paeoniae Radix Alba in Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis Rats by Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Combination of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (FZ) and Paeoniae Radix Alba (BS) shows a significant effect in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy enhancing and toxicity reducing mechanism of combination of them in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats by metabolomics. Rats were randomly divided into seven groups, including A (healthy control), B (model control), C1 (therapy group), C2 (efficacy enhancing group), D1 (toxicity group), and D2 (toxicity reducing group), and dexamethasone group was used as positive control. The plasma biochemical indexes showed that therapeutic dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could significantly inhibit the concentrations of IL-1, TNF- and IFN- in AIA rats, and combination with total glucosides of peony could further reduce the concentration of IL-1. Then, UPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap MS with untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify the possible metabolites and pathways. Through multivariate data analysis of therapeutic dose groups (A vs. B vs. C1 vs. C2) and multivariate data analysis of toxic dose groups (A vs. B vs. D1 vs. D2), 10 and 7 biomarkers were identified based on biomarker analysis, respectively. After inducing AIA model, the plasma contents of spermidine, vanillylmandelic , catechol, and linoleate were increased significantly, and the contents of citric , L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, leucine, L-tryptophan, and uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) were decreased significantly. High dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could increase the plasma contents of L-lysine, L-arginine, and , while the plasma contents of UMP, carnitine, N-formylanthranilic , and adenosine were decreased significantly. The pathway analysis indicated that therapeutic dose of lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ could regulate  and amino  metabolic disorders in AIA rats. However, toxic dose could cause bile , fat, amino , and  metabolic disorders. And combination with total glucosides of peony could enhance the therapeutic effects and attenuate the toxicity induced by lipid-soluble alkaloids of FZ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8243428>The effect of a natural high-fibre diet on faecal and biliary bile acids, faecal pH and whole-gut transit time in man. A controlled study.</a></h2><p>Dietary fibre possibly protects against colonic cancer by effects on bile  metabolism. We investigated the effect of a natural high-fibre diet on secondary bile  formation. Twelve healthy subjects on an habitual low-fibre diet (for 4 weeks) consumed a high-fibre menu for 10 weeks (experimental group). A control group of 10 subjects consumed their regular high-fibre diet during this period. Faecal and biliary  composition, faecal weight, faecal pH and gut transit time were studied before and after 6 and 10 weeks of fibre addition. Changes in the experimental group were compared to changes in the control group. The concentration, but not the excretion, of the secondary faecal bile acids was reduced in the experimental group. Faecal weight increased, faecal pH dropped and gut transit time was not altered. The biliary  content decreased and the cholic  content increased after 6 weeks, but returned to baseline values after 10 weeks of fibre addition. This study shows that a natural high-fibre diet lowers secondary faecal bile  concentration through an increase in stool weight.

For the purpose of comparison, two natural bile acids, cholic  (CA) and  (DCA), and one semi-synthetic bile , 12-monoketocholic  (MKC), were studied in parallel. The free-binding  was used as the main criterion for ranking ligands.Studied bile acids exhibited different binding affinities towards bacterial transporters with MKC showing the most prominent effect. For the majority of studied transporters, the estimated affinities of bile acids decreased in the following order: MKC-CA-DCA. Namely, 38.7% of examined transport proteins gave the lowest free-binding  with MKC. The weak inverse relationship between number of hydrogen bonds and estimated free-binding energies was revealed.The predominant effect of MKC for the majority of studied transport proteins suggests that keto group at carbon 12 of the steroid core has a significant influence on the properties of MKC and consequently, on interactions with membrane transporters. Present findings might have a role in the prediction of potential influence of bile acids and probiotics on drug pharmacokinetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30189365>Green tea polyphenols modify gut-microbiota dependent metabolisms of , bile constituents and micronutrients in female Sprague-Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Our recent metagenomics analysis has uncovered remarkable modifying effects of green tea polyphenols (GTP) on gut-microbiota community structure and  conversion related gene orthologs in rats. How these genomic changes could further influence host health is still unclear. In this work, the alterations of gut-microbiota dependent metabolites were studied in the GTP-treated rats. Six groups of female SD rats (n=12/group) were administered drinking water containing 0%, 0.5%, and 1.5% GTP (wt/vol). Their gut contents were collected at 3 and 6 months and were analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS). GC-MS based metabolomics analysis captured 2668 feature, and 57 metabolites were imputatively from top 200 differential features identified via NIST fragmentation database. A group of key metabolites were quantitated using standard calibration methods. Compared with control, the elevated components in the GTP-treated groups include niacin (8.61-fold), 3-phenyllactic  (2.20-fold), galactose (3.13-fold), mannose (2.05-fold), pentadecanoic  (2.15-fold), lactic  (2.70-fold), and proline (2.15-fold); the reduced components include cholesterol (0.29-fold), cholic  (0.62-fold),  (0.41-fold), trehalose (0.14-fold), glucose (0.46-fold), fructose (0.12-fold), and alanine (0.61-fold). These results were in line with the genomic alterations of gut-microbiome previously discovered by metagenomics analysis. The alterations of these metabolites suggested the reduction of calorific carbohydrates, elevation of vitamin production, decreases of bile constituents, and modified metabolic pattern of amino acids in the GTP-treated animals. Changes in gut-microbiota associated metabolism may be a major contributor to the anti-obesity function of GTP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The micellar systems studied contained sodium taurocholate (NaTC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC). Using the retention factor k', functional group selectivity, gammaG, is defined as the ratio of the retention factor of a substituted aminopenicillanic  (APS-R) over the capacity factor of APS-H and the difference in free  (deltadeltaG degrees) can be used for the characterization of the affinity and interaction between drugs and micelles. The functional group selectivity is a direct measure of the interaction of the functional group with micelles. The calculated deltadeltaG degrees value gives information on the partition equilibrium and interaction between drugs and micelles. A positive deltadeltaG degrees value means that the interaction of a functional group gammaG to the APS-H leads to a decrease in the interaction with the micelles. A negative deltadeltaG degrees value, on the other hand, has the opposite meaning. The results obtained in this study exhibited that these APS-R compounds have smaller affinity to the micelles compared to unsubstituted APS-H. Furthermore, the log k' of the drugs in these systems were correlated with the log Pow in the n-octanol/water system and with log P(G) (permeation coefficient).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859856>Takeda G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5-Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Signaling Contributes to the Increment of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Production after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.</a></h2><p>The mechanism by which Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) increases the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) remains incompletely defined. Here we investigated whether TGR5-mTORC1 signaling mediates the RYGB-induced alteration in GLP-1 production in mice and human beings.Circulating bile acids, TGR5-mTORC1 signaling, GLP-1 synthesis and secretion were determined in lean or obese male C57BL/6 mice with or without RYGB operation, as well as in normal glycemic subjects, obese patients with type 2 diabetes before and after RYGB.Positive relationships were observed among circulating bile acids, ileal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and GLP-1 during changes in  status in the present study. RYGB increased circulating bile acids, ileal Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and mTORC1 signaling activity, as well as GLP-1 production in both mice and human subjects. Inhibition of ileal mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the stimulation of bile  secretion, TGR5 expression and GLP-1 synthesis induced by RYGB in lean and diet-induced obese mice. GLP-1 production and ileal TGR5-mTORC1 signaling were positively correlated with plasma  (DCA) in mice. Treatment of STC-1 cells with DCA stimulated the production of GLP-1. This effect was associated with a significant enhancement of TGR5-mTORC1 signaling. siRNA knockdown of mTORC1 or TGR5 abolished the enhancement of GLP-1 synthesis induced by DCA. DCA increased interaction between mTOR-regulatory-associated protein of mechanistic target of rapamycin (Raptor) and TGR5 in STC-1 cells.-TGR5-mTORC1 signaling contributes to the up-regulation of GLP-1 production after RYGB.Copyright © 2018.

Both bile acids and steroid hormones, especially glucocorticoids, play important roles in regulating body metabolism and  expenditure. Currently, our understanding on AKR1D1 regulation and its roles in metabolic diseases is limited. We found that AKR1D1 expression was markedly repressed in diabetic patients. Consistent with repressed AKR1D1 expression, hepatic bile acids were significantly reduced in diabetic patients. Mechanistic studies showed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) transcriptionally down-regulated AKR1D1 expression in vitro in HepG2 cells and in vivo in mice. Consistently, PPARα signaling was enhanced in diabetic patients. In summary, dysregulation of AKR1D1 disrupted bile  and steroid hormone homeostasis, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes. Restoring bile  and steroid hormone homeostasis by modulating AKR1D1 expression may represent a new approach to develop therapies for diabetes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Animal studies found that NSAID-induced small intestinal injury depends on the ability of these drugs to be secreted into the bile. Because the individual toxicity of amphiphilic bile acids and NSAIDs directly correlates with their interactions with phospholipid membranes, we propose that the presence of both NSAIDs and bile acids alters their individual physicochemical properties and enhances the disruptive effect on cell membranes and overall cytotoxicity. We utilized in vitro gastric AGS and intestinal IEC-6 cells and found that combinations of bile ,  (DC), taurodeoxycholic , glycodeoxycholic , and the NSAID indomethacin (Indo) significantly increased cell plasma membrane permeability and became more cytotoxic than these agents alone. We confirmed this finding by measuring liposome permeability and intramembrane packing in synthetic model membranes exposed to DC, Indo, or combinations of both agents. By measuring physicochemical parameters, such as fluorescence resonance  transfer and membrane surface charge, we found that Indo associated with phosphatidylcholine and promoted the molecular aggregation of DC and potential formation of larger and isolated bile  complexes within either biomembranes or bile -lipid mixed micelles, which leads to membrane disruption. In this study, we demonstrated increased cytotoxicity of combinations of bile  and NSAID and provided a molecular mechanism for the observed toxicity. This mechanism potentially contributes to the NSAID-induced injury in the small bowel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21158453>Ursodeoxycholic  amides as novel glucocorticoid receptor modulators.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is used for the treatment of hepatic inflammatory diseases. Recent studies have shown that UDCA's biological effects are partly glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated. UDCA derivatives were synthesized and screened for ability to induce GR translocation in a high content analysis assay using the esophageal cancer SKGT-4 cell line. UDCA derivatives induced GR translocation in a time dependent manner with equal efficacy to that of dexamethasone (Dex) and with greatly increased potency relative to UDCA. The cyclopropylamide 1a suppressed TNF-α induced NF-κB activity and it induced GRE transactivation. 1a was unable to displace Dex from the GR ligand binding domain (LBD) in a competition experiment but was capable of coactivator recruitment in a time-resolved fluorescence  transfer assay (TR-FRET). This represents a novel mechanism of action for a GR modulator.

In Expt. 1, after feeding either a HFD (62.7% ) or a normal-fat diet (NFD; 11.1% ) for 2 d, C57BL/6 mice were i.g. administered Lactobacillus plantarum No. 14. Fecal recovery of viable L. plantarum was significantly decreased 99% by the HFD compared with the NFD. Total bile  concentrations in the small intestine and cecum were significantly higher (1.5- and 2.2-fold of NFD, respectively) in mice fed HFD than in those fed NFD. Cholic  and  significantly reduced the viability of L. plantarum No. 14 in culture experiments. In Expt. 2, after feeding HFD for 2 d, simultaneous administration of inulin (10 mg) with L. plantarum No. 14 significantly increased (100-fold of that without inulin) the fecal recovery of viable L. plantarum. Inulin administration did not alter intestinal bile  concentrations. In Expt. 3, after feeding HFD for 2 d, mice were i.g. administered either inulin (10 mg) or vehicle and, after 6 h, cecal contents were subjected to culture experiments. Growth of L. plantarum No. 14 was significantly higher in the cecal contents of inulin-administered mice than vehicle-administered mice. Inulin supplementation to cecal contents of vehicle-administered mice significantly enhanced the growth of L. plantarum No. 14. We propose that HFD impairs the survival of probiotics in the gut due to increased bile  stress and that simultaneous administration of inulin prolongs the survival of probiotics in mice fed HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285140>Analysis of the potency of various low molecular weight chemical chaperones to prevent protein aggregation.</a></h2><p>Newly translated proteins must undergo proper folding to ensure their function. To enter a low  state, misfolded proteins form aggregates, which are associated with many degenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown the use of low molecular weight chemical chaperones to be an effective method of reducing protein aggregation in various cell types. This study demonstrates a novel non-biased assay to assess the molecular efficacy of these compounds at preventing protein misfolding and/or aggregation. This assay utilizes a thioflavin T fluorescent stain to provide a qualitative and quantitative measure of protein misfolding within cells. The functionality of this method was first assessed in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells treated with various endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers. Once established in the renal model system, we analyzed the ability of some known chemical chaperones to reduce ER stress. A total of five different compounds were selected: 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), tauroursodeoxycholic , trehalose, and glycerol. The dose-dependent effects of these compounds at reducing thapsigargin-induced ER stress was then analyzed, and used to determine their EC values. Of the chaperones, 4-PBA and DHA provided the greatest reduction of ER stress and did so at relatively low concentrations. Upon analyzing the efficiency of these compounds and their corresponding structures, it was determined that chaperones with a localized hydrophilic, polar end followed by a long hydrophobic chain, such as 4-PBA and DHA, were most effective at reducing ER stress. This study provides some insight into the use of low molecular weight chemical chaperones and may serve as the first step towards developing new chaperones of greater potency thereby providing potential treatments for diseases caused by protein aggregation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

When cis-parinaric  (cis-PnA) was spread over an aqueous subphase before the injection of sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) and Thermomyces lanuginosa lipase (TLL), no FRET was observed. Under these conditions, no adsorption of TLL was detected using an ELISA. In contrast, FRET occurred when cis-PnA was spread over an aqueous subphase containing NaTDC and TLL. The FRET signals observed were attributed to the interactions between the adsorbed TLL and the cis-PnA monomolecular films. Comparisons between the fluorescence emission spectra corresponding to the bulk phase and the aspirated film, in the presence and absence of TLL, showed that cis-PnA was undetectable in the bulk phase. We concluded that the FRET originated from the interface and not from the bulk phase. Using surface FRET, we estimated that the surface excess of the catalytically inactive mutant, TLL(S146A), was 1.6 higher than that present in the wild-type TLL. This finding is in agreement with independent measurements of the surface excess of TLL and TLL(S146A) on monomolecular films of cis-PnA.Copyright 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Micellar systems of bile salts are not only important for solubilization of cholesterol, but they also interact with certain drugs thus changing their bioavailability.The number-average aggregation numbers (n¯) are determined using the Moroi-Matsuoka-Sugioka thermodynamic method. Critical micellar concentrations were determined by spectrofluorometric method using pyren and by surface tension measurements.Micelles of ethylidene derivatives possess the following values for n¯: 7-Eth-D (n¯=11 (50 mM)-n¯=14.8 (100 mM)); 12-Ox-7-Eth-L (n¯≈8.8, without concentration dependence) and 7,12-diOx-3-Eth-Ch (n¯≈2.9, without concentration dependence).

Gibbs  of formation for 7,12-diOx-3-Eth-Ch and 12-Ox-7-Eth-L anion micelle is determined by the Gibbs  of hydrophobic interactions. Relative increase in hydrophobicity and aggregation number for ethylidene derivatives is larger when ethylidene group is introduced from the C7 lateral side of steroidal skeleton then it is when ethylidene group is on C3 carbon.Position of outlier towards hydrophobic congeneric groups from n¯-ln k and ln CMC-ln k planes indicates the existence of excess Gibbs  (GE) which is not of hydrophobic nature (formation of hydrogen bonds). For the bile salt micelles to have GE (formation of secondary micelles) it is necessary that steroidal skeleton possesses C3-α-(e)-OH and C12-α-(a)-OH groups.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The swelling of gels at higher temperature enhanced the swelling rates but not the swelling extent. HEMA-co-MAETC hydrogel exhibited an excellent responsive characteristic to the ionic strength of the swelling medium.

Their actions are implemented through activation of nuclear (FXR, VDR, PXR) and membrane G protein-coupled (TGR5, S1PR2) receptors. Areas covered: This review discusses the potential of FXR and TGR5 as therapeutic targets in the treatment of pulmonary disorders linked to metabolism and/or inflammation. Obeticholic  (OCA) is the most clinically advanced bile -derived agonist for FXR-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. It therefore represents an attractive pharmacological approach for the treatment of lung conditions characterized by vascular and endothelial dysfunctions. Expert opinion: Inflammation, vascular remodeling and fibrotic processes characterize the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These processes are only partially targeted by the available therapeutic options and still represent a relevant medical need. The results hereby summarized demonstrate OCA efficacy in preventing experimental lung disorders, i.e. monocrotaline-induced PAH and bleomycin-induced fibrosis, by abating proinflammatory and vascular remodeling progression. TGR5 is also expressed in the lung, and targeting the TGR5 pathway, using the TGR5 agonist INT-777 or the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767, could also contribute to the treatment of pulmonary disorders mediated by inflammation and fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814411>Alteration of Bile  Metabolism by a High-Fat Diet Is Associated with Plasma Transaminase Activities and Glucose Intolerance in Rats.</a></h2><p>Ingestion of a high-fat (HF) diet is known to enhance bile  (BA) secretion, but precise information about the BA molecular species is lacking, especially information on the conjugated BAs in enterohepatic circulation. As cholesterol is the precursor of BAs, we analyzed alterations of the entire BA metabolic pathway in response to a HF diet without the addition of cholesterol and BA in the diet. Additionally, we evaluated the relationships between BA metabolism and some disorders, such as plasma transaminase activities and glucose intolerance induced by the HF diet. Acclimated WKAH/HkmSlc male rats (3 wk old) were divided into two groups fed a control or the HF diet for 22 wk. Fasting blood glucose was measured during the experimental period, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed at week 21. As a result, ingestion of the HF diet selectively increased the concentration of taurocholic  in the bile and small intestinal contents as well as  in the large intestinal contents and feces. These results indicated a selective increase of 12α-hydroxylated BA concentrations in response to the HF diet. Moreover, fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA concentration was positively correlated with cumulative  intake, visceral adipose tissue weight, and glucose intolerance. The present study suggests that fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA is a non-invasive marker that can detect the early phase of glucose intolerance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174168>Chenodeoxycholic  significantly impacts the expression of miRNAs and genes involved in lipid, bile  and drug metabolism in human hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are important gut signaling hormones, influencing lipid, glucose, and  homeostasis. The exact mechanisms behind these effects are not yet fully understood. Lately, they have come to the fore as putative therapeutics in metabolic diseases, such as e.g. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We elucidate to what extent BAs impacts on the mRNAome and microRNAome in hepatocytes to gather novel insights into the mechanisms behind metabolic and toxicologic effects of bile acids.Five batches of primary human hepatocytes were treated with 50μmol/l chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) for 24 or 48h. Total RNA was extracted, size fractionated and subjected to Next Generation Sequencing to generate mRNA and miRNA profiles.Expression of 738 genes and 52 miRNAs were CDCA dependently decreased, whereas 1566 genes and 29 miRNAs were significantly increased in hepatocytes. Distinct gene clusters controlling BA and lipid homeostasis (FGF(R), APO and FABP family members, HMGCS2) and drug metabolism (CYP, UGT and SULT family members) were significantly modulated by CDCA. Importantly, CDCA affected distinct microRNAs, including miR-34a, -505, -885, -1260 and -552 that systematically correlated in expression with gene clusters responsible for bile , lipid and drug homeostasis incorporating genes, such as e.g. SLCO1B1, SLC22A7, FGF19, CYP2E1, CYP1A2, APO family members and FOXO3.Bile acids significantly modulate metabolic and drug associated gene networks that are connected to distinct shifts in the microRNAome These findings give novel insights on how BA enfold metabolic and system toxic effects.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Obeticholic  (OCA) improves steatosis in patients but for unknown reasons does not resolve NASH pathology. This study therefore investigated OCA effects in Wt mice, which develop obesity with atherogenic dietary feeding, and appetite-dysregulated, Alms1 mutant foz/foz mice fed the same diet, which develop metabolic obesity and diabetes.OCA (1 mg/kg) was administered orally to female foz/foz mice and Wt littermates from weaning until 28 weeks. Adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and fatty liver pathology were studied. Experiments were repeated with OCA 10 mg/kg.OCA reduced body weight and hepatic lipids and improved glucose disposal only in Wt mice. OCA limited Wt adipose expansion, altered morphometry in favor of small adipocytes, enhanced expression of genes indicating adipose browning, and reduced crown-like structure number in visceral adipose tissue. foz/foz mice showed more crown-like structures in all compartments; OCA failed to alter adipose morphometry, browning, inflammation, or improve NASH severity, even at 10 mg/kg.OCA improved adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and steatosis in a milder metabolic phenotype but failed to improve these factors in morbidly obese diabetic mice. These results help explain OCA's limited efficacy to reverse human NASH.© 2016 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16741293>The mechanism of ABCG5/ABCG8 in biliary cholesterol secretion in mice.</a></h2><p>The main player in biliary cholesterol secretion is the heterodimeric transporter complex, ABCG5/ABCG8, the function of which is necessary for the majority of sterols secreted into bile. It is not clear whether the primary step in this process is flopping of cholesterol from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane, with desorption by mixed micelles, or decreasing of the activation  required for cholesterol desorption from the outer membrane leaflet. In this study, we investigated these mechanisms by infusing Abcg8(+/+), Abcg8(+/-), and Abcg8(-/-) mice with hydrophilic and hydrophobic bile salts. In Abcg8(-/-) mice, this failed to substantially stimulate biliary cholesterol secretion. Infusion of the hydrophobic bile salt taurodeoxycholate also resulted in cholestasis, which was induced in Abcg8(-/-) mice at a much lower infusion rate compared with Abc8(-/-) and Abcg8(+/-) mice, suggesting a reduced cholesterol content in the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Indeed, isolation of canalicular membranes revealed a reduction of 45% in cholesterol content under these conditions in Abcg8(-/-) mice. Our data support the model that ABCG5/ABCG8 primarily play a role in flopping cholesterol (and sterols) from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20580913>A novel lipoprotein-mimic nanocarrier composed of the modified protein and lipid for tumor cell targeting delivery.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UA) modified protein-lipid nanocomplex (uP-LNC) as a novel biomimetic nanocarrier was developed for tumor-targeting delivery. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein and its amino groups were covalently modified by UA. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) composed of phospholipids, triglycerides and octadecylamine was prepared by using solvent evaporation method and was used as the core. UA modified BSA (uP) was attached onto the surface of LNP by post-insert method and generated the protein-lipid nanocomplex. As the control, cholesteryl hemiglutarate (CH), a non-targeting ligand was also used to modify BSA and then formed CH modified protein-lipid nanocomplex (cP-LNC). The combining efficiency of modified BSA with LNP, determined by Bradford protein assay, increased with the enhancement of substitution degree. The modified BSA and nanocomplex were characterized for the substitute degree, average molecular weight, surface tension, particle size and zeta potential by various physicochemical analyses. In vitro dissolution tests and cell uptake studies were performed by loading coumarin-6 as a fluorescent probe. The results indicated that the UA modified protein attached on the nanoparticles significantly decreased drug release from the nanocomplex in pH 7.4 medium, The uptake of uP-LNC was higher in hepatic carcinoma cells (HepG2 and Bel 7402) than in normal liver cells (L02). Furthermore, the uptake of uP-LNC was significantly higher than that of cP-LNC and LNP in these cells. The uptake was dependent on time, temperature and concentration, and could be inhibited by free UA. In addition, the MTT assay of uP-LNC and u(x)P with various degrees of substitution showed very low cytotoxicity at tested concentrations in all cells. The UA modification served to facilitate the specific receptor and  mediated endocytosis process of the protein-lipid nanocomplex and enabled this nanocomplex to be a potential nanocarrier for tumor-targeting drug delivery.2010 Elsevier B.V.

Excessive  intake elicits its detrimental effect by altering lipoprotein and hepatic cholesterol metabolism in association with hyperinsulinemia. Factors, dietary and genetic, that favor elevated hepatic cholesterol synthesis and production of a bile  profile in which chenodeoxycholic  predominates appear to be associated with lithogenic bile. An inconsistent effect of dietary fat saturation on gallstones is that polyunsaturates possibly increase risk in men and decrease risk in women. Vegetable protein may reduce the risk of cholelithiasis. Whereas both the amount and type of dietary fiber influence cholesterol and bile lipid metabolism, specific associations between fiber and gallstones in humans remain elusive.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236510>N-terminus of IpaB provides a potential anchor to the Shigella type III secretion system tip complex protein IpaD.</a></h2><p>The type III secretion system (T3SS) is an essential virulence factor for Shigella flexneri , providing a conduit through which host-altering effectors are injected directly into a host cell to promote uptake. The type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) is composed of a basal body, external needle, and regulatory tip complex. The nascent needle is a polymer of MxiH capped by a pentamer of invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD). Exposure to bile salts (e.g., deoxycholate) causes a conformational change in IpaD and promotes recruitment of IpaB to the needle tip. It has been proposed that IpaB senses contact with host cell membranes, recruiting IpaC and inducing full secretion of T3SS effectors. Although the steps of T3SA maturation and their external triggers have been identified, details of specific protein interactions and mechanisms have remained difficult to study because of the hydrophobic nature of the IpaB and IpaC translocator proteins. Here, we explored the ability for a series of soluble N-terminal IpaB peptides to interact with IpaD. We found that DOC is required for the interaction and that a region of IpaB between residues 11-27 is required for maximum binding, which was confirmed in vivo. Furthermore, intramolecular FRET measurements indicated that movement of the IpaD distal domain away from the protein core accompanied the binding of IpaB11-226. Together, these new findings provide important new insight into the interactions and potential mechanisms that define the maturation of the Shigella T3SA needle tip complex and provide a foundation for further studies probing T3SS activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7541037>Protein hydration during generation of coagulation factor Xa in aqueous phase and on phospholipid membranes.</a></h2><p>The energetic contribution of protein solvation-desolvation reactions to generation of coagulation activated factor X (FXa) by the extrinsic pathway protease complex was determined using the technique of osmotic stress. The initial rate of FXa generation by limited proteolysis of human FX was measured in reaction mixtures with human tissue factor (TF) and factor VIIa (FVIIa) assembled either in aqueous phase or on phospholipid membranes. Osmotic stress was induced on the surface of reacting proteins with either polyethylene glycol, or dextran of 6000 and 500,000 molecular weight, respectively. These inert polymers are sterically excluded from the solvation shells of proteins and thus increase the water activity in the excluded spaces. The volume of water transferred either to or from the excluded spaces during formation of reaction intermediates was calculated from the ratio of change in free  of activation with change in osmotic pressure, delta G*/delta II. For aqueous phase-assembled reactions, delta G* values decreased with delta II at ratios of -2.36 +/- 0.38 and -2.26 +/- 0.26 kcal/mol/atm for polyethylene glycol and dextran, respectively. These values correspond to 5488 +/- 883 and 5255 +/- 604 mol of water transferred from the reacting protein surfaces per mol of FXa generated. At a physiologic osmotic pressure of 7 atm the work of transfer corresponded to 16 kcal/mol, approximately 70% of delta G*. The observed osmotic effects were independent of the viscosity, temperature, and ionic strength of solutions. For reactions assembled on phospholipid membranes, delta G* increased with delta II at a ratio of 0.35 +/- 0.05 kcal/mol/atm, corresponding to 814 +/- 116 mol of water tansferred from bulk solution to protein surfaces. At physiologic osmotic pressure the work of transfer is 2.45 kcal/mol, approximately 12% of delta G*. Results indicate that for factor Xa generation in aqueous phase the work of desolvation is a significant component of the free  of activation. Results also suggest that phospholipid membranes catalyze the reaction by reducing the desolvation component of the free  of activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690590>FXR agonists as therapeutic agents for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and a risk factor for both cardiovascular and hepatic related morbidity and mortality. The increasing prevalence of this disease requires novel therapeutic approaches to prevent disease progression. Farnesoid X receptors are bile  receptors with roles in lipid, glucose, and  homeostasis. Synthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists have been developed to specifically target these receptors for therapeutic use in NAFLD patients. Here, we present a review of bile  physiology and how agonism of FXR receptors has been examined in pre-clinical and clinical NAFLD. Early evidence suggests a potential role for synthetic FXR agonists in the management of NAFLD; however, additional studies are needed to clarify their effects on lipid and glucose parameters in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23049867>Synergism and rules from combination of Baicalin, Jasminoidin and Desoxycholic  in refined Qing Kai Ling for treat ischemic stroke mice model.</a></h2><p>Refined Qing-Kai-Ling (QKL), a modified Chinese medicine, consists of three main ingredients (Baicalin, Jasminoidin and Desoxycholic ), plays a synergistic effect on the treatment of the acute stage of ischemic stroke. However, the rules of the combination and synergism are still unknown. Based on the ischemic stroke mice model, all different kinds of combination of Baicalin, Jasminoidin, and Desoxycholic  were investigated by the methods of neurological examination, microarray, and genomics analysis. As a result, it confirmed that the combination of three drugs offered a better therapeutical effect on ischemic stroke than monotherapy of each drug. Additionally, we used Ingenuity pathway Analysis (IPA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the dominant information of expression changes in 373 ischemia-related genes. The results suggested that 5 principal components (PC1-5) could account for more than 95%  in the gene data. Moreover, 3 clusters (PC1, PC2+PC5, and PC3+PC4) were addressed with cluster analysis. Furthermore, we matched PCs on the drug-target networks, the findings demonstrated that Baicalin related with PC1 that played the leading role in the combination; Jasminoidin related with PC2+PC5 that played a compensatory role; while Desoxycholic  had the least performance alone which could relate with PC3+PC4 that played a compatible role. These manifestations were accorded with the principle of herbal formulae of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), emperor-minister-adjuvant-courier. In conclusion, we firstly provided scientific evidence to the classic theory of TCM formulae, an initiating holistic viewpoint of combination therapy of TCM. This study also illustrated that PCA might be an applicable method to analyze the complicated data of drug combination.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8308566>A very low intake of fat is required to decrease fecal bile  concentrations in rats.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different amounts of dietary fat on colonic cell proliferation and fecal bile  concentrations. Thirty-nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three diets (13 rats per diet) containing 5, 10 and 20 g butter/100 g diet. Diets were fed for 3 wk. As fat intake increased, total fecal fat excretion remained constant. When dietary fat was decreased from 20 to 10 g/100 g diet, total fecal bile  concentrations tended to increase 14.5%. However, a further reduction to 5 g butter/100 g diet significantly decreased fecal total bile  concentration by 48% from the concentration in feces of rats fed 10 g butter/100 g diet. The concentration of deoxycholate (considered a highly promotive bile ) was not reduced unless the amount of fat in the diet was reduced to 5 g/100 g. Labeling index was used as an intermediate marker for colon carcinogenesis. For deoxycholate, a decrease of fat intake to 5 g/100 g diet decreased the cecal labeling index relative to those of rats fed 10 or 20 g butter/100 g diet. These data indicate that decreasing the dietary fat from 20 to 10 g/100 g does not decrease fecal bile  concentration or colonic cell proliferation, but some effects are seen in rats fed 5 g butter/100 g diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20725912>Improved glycemic control with colesevelam treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes is not directly associated with changes in bile  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are essential for fat absorption and appear to modulate glucose and  metabolism. Colesevelam, a BA sequestrant, improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to characterize the alterations in BA metabolism associated with T2DM and colesevelam treatment and to establish whether metabolic consequences of T2DM and colesevelam are related to changes in BA metabolism. Male subjects with T2DM (n = 16) and controls (n = 12) were matched for age and body mass index. BA pool sizes and synthesis/input rates were determined before and after 2 and 8 weeks of colesevelam treatment. T2DM subjects had higher cholic  (CA) synthesis rate, higher  (DCA) input rate, and enlarged DCA pool size. Colesevelam resulted in a preferential increase in CA synthesis in both groups. CA pool size was increased whereas chenodeoxycholic  and DCA pool sizes were decreased upon treatment. Fasting and postprandial fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) levels did not differ between controls and diabetics, but were decreased by treatment in both groups. Colesevelam treatment reduced hemoglobin A1C by 0.7% (P < 0.01) in diabetics. Yet, no relationships between BA kinetic parameters and changes in glucose metabolism were found in T2DM or with colesevelam treatment.Our results reveal significant changes in BA metabolism in T2DM, particularly affecting CA and DCA. Colesevelam treatment reduced FGF19 signaling associated with increased BA synthesis, particularly of CA, and resulted in a more hydrophilic BA pool without altering total BA pool size.

However, the effects of diets high in whole versus refined grains on circulating bile acids, which can influence glucose homeostasis and inflammation through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5), have not been studied.We conducted a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled crossover feeding trial () in 80 healthy adults (40 women/40 men, age 18-45 years) from the greater Seattle Area, half of which were normal weight (BMI 18.5-25.0 kg/m) and half overweight to obese (BMI 28.0-39.9 kg/m). Participants consumed two four-week controlled diets in randomized order: 1) a whole grain diet (WG diet), designed to be low in glycemic load (GL), high in whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables, and 2) a refined grain diet (RG diet), designed to be high GL, high in refined grains and added sugars, separated by a four-week washout period. Quantitative targeted analysis of 55 bile  species in fasting plasma was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, and CRP were measured in fasting serum. Linear mixed models were used to test the effects of diet on bile  concentrations, and determine the association between plasma bile  concentrations and HOMA-IR and CRP. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was used to control for multiple testing.A total of 29 plasma bile acids were reliably detected and retained for analysis. Taurolithocholic  (TLCA), taurocholic  (TCA) and glycocholic  (GCA) were statistically significantly higher after the WG compared to the RG diet (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant differences by BMI or sex. When evaluating the association of bile acids and HOMA-IR, GCA, taurochenodeoxycholic , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), 5β‑cholanic ‑3β,12α‑diol, 5‑cholanic ‑3β‑ol, and glycodeoxycholic  (GDCA) were statistically significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR individually, and as a group, total, 12α‑hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile acids were also significant (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by BMI, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), cholic  (CA), UDCA, 5β-cholanic -3β, , and total, 12α-hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile  groups were significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR among overweight to obese individuals (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by sex, GCA, CDCA, TCA, CA, UDCA, GDCA, glycolithocholic  (GLCA), total, primary, 12α‑hydroxylated, and glycine-conjugated bile acids were significantly associated with HOMA-IR among women, and CDCA, GDCA, and GLCA were significantly associated among men (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant associations between bile acids and CRP.Diets with comparable macronutrient and  composition, but differing in carbohydrate source, affected fasting plasma bile acids differently. Specifically, a diet characterized by whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars led to modest increases in concentrations of TLCA, TCA and GCA, ligands for FXR and TGR5, which may have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The degree of counterion binding was found to be 0.37-0.38 for chenodeoxycholate conjugates, while the determination of the degree was quite difficult for ursodeoxycholate conjugates. The change of I1/I3 values on the fluorescence spectrum with the conjugate bile salt concentration suggested two steps for their bile salt aggregation. The first step is a commencement of smaller aggregates, the first cmc, and the second one is a starting of stable aggregates, the second cmc.

Klb mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed (increased) bile  (BA) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, fed a chow diet focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and  balance. Klb mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived , classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity through direct action (mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms (mediating FGF15 signaling that maintains BA level and composition).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6537051>Phenolic 9,10-secosteroids as products of the catabolism of bile acids by a Pseudomonas sp.</a></h2><p>The obligate aerobe, Pseudomonas putida ATCC 31752, efficiently utilises bile acids as a source of carbon and  for growth and maintenance.

The heat associated with crystallization was measured in an isothermal microcalorimeter at 25 degrees C at various relative humidities (RH) (50%-100%) and, in the presence of the vapour from a mixed solvent of ethanol and water (ethanol conc. 10%-100%). The specific surface area was calculated from krypton adsorption. Contact angles were measured by using a Wilhelmy plate to calculate the surface  of the samples.Ground and quenched samples yielded amorphous XRD patterns. Differential scanning calorimetry thermographs of the milled sample revealed that crystallization occurred at around 80 degrees C, whereas the quenched sample did not crystallize. Exposure to humid air did not result in crystallization of either amorphous sample during the microcalorimetric experiments. In the presence of ethanol vapour, the ground sample did, but the quenched sample did not, crystallize. The amount of water sorption into the quenched sample was larger than that of the ground sample at low RH. The surface  of the quenched material was different to that of the ground. Peak shifts were observed in the NIR spectra at around 1450, 2100 nm, allowing differentiation between the ground and quenched samples.It can be concluded that different molecular states of amorphous UDCA were obtained depending on the preparation method.

Sufficient fragmentation were obtained in 94% when 2112 +/- 137 shocks in 211 sessions with an  setting of 17.8 +/- 0.8 kV were administered. Only 4/170 patients needed transient analgesia. Overall, side effects were transient and mild, but three patients developed biliary pancreatitis, which was treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy in two of them. A total of 67/100 patients were free of stones after one year. Subgroup analysis showed that 80% of the patients (stone diameter 5-20 mm), 64% (20-30 mm) and 65% (multiple stones), respectively, can expected to be free of stones after 12 months. In addition, 25 patients with large, endoscopically not extractable common bile duct stones were treated by lithotripsy with the Modulith. After endoscopic placement of a nasobiliary tube, stone targeting was possible by ultrasonography in 14 patients and by fluoroscopy in another 11 cases. In 23 of the 25 patients (92%) stone clearance by endoscopy was achieved after application of 2516 +/- 565 shocks with an  preset of 18 kV. One patient refused further endoscopic procedures after successful fragmentation and another required local stone dissolution therapy. Side effects occurred more frequently (P < 0.05) after lithotripsy of bile duct stones than of gallbladder stones, but they were without major clinical relevance.

Initially, germ cell sloughing and rupture of the blood-testis barrier occur and are correlated with decreased protein accumulation of connexin-43 (Cx43) and N-cadherin, whereas at later stages, apoptosis of spermatids is observed. These abnormalities are associated with increased intratesticular BA levels in general and , a TGR5 agonist, in particular. We demonstrate here that Tgr5 is expressed within the germ cell lineage, where it represses Cx43 expression through regulation of the transcriptional repressor, T-box transcription factor 2 gene. Consistent with this finding, mice deficient for Tgr5 are protected against the deleterious testicular effects of BA exposure.These data identify the testis as a new target of BAs and emphasize TGR5 as a critical element in testicular pathophysiology. This work may open new perspectives on the potential effect of BAs on testis physiology during liver dysfunction.© 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31093422>Interactions between fecal bacteria, bile acids and components of tomato pomace.</a></h2><p>The tomato pomace obtained during processing as a residue of tomato processing from large industry. The interactions between tomato pomace and fecal bacteria, bile acids during in vitro digestion were studied. Digestion was carried out by using bioreactor in anaerobic conditions. Tomato pomace can significantly affect the count of fecal bacteria and the solubility of bile acids in in vitro digestion due to bonding ability of their proteins/peptides. The availability and use of bile acids does not only depend on the interactions between bile acids and bacteria, but also the interactions of bile acids with digested food components. Tomato pomace characterized high dietary fiber content and its fractions: 17.64-21.53% for cellulose and 13.48-18.63% for lignin. Given our results we supposed that fecal bacteria can use primary bile acids, as their source of  in an environment where carbon availability is limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9153403>Structural mechanisms of bile salt-induced growth of small unilamellar cholesterol-lecithin vesicles.</a></h2><p>The liver secretes cholesterol and lecithin in the form of mixed vesicles during the formation of bile. When exposed to bile salts, these metastable vesicles undergo various structural rearrangements. We have examined the effects of three different bile salts, taurocholate (TC), tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC), and taurodeoxycholate (TDC), on the stability of sonicated lecithin vesicles containing various amounts of cholesterol. Vesicle growth was probed by turbidity measurements, quasi-elastic light scattering, and a resonance  transfer lipid-mixing assay. Leakage of internal contents was monitored by encapsulation of fluorescence probes in vesicles. At low bile salt-to-lecithin ratios (TC/L or TUDC/L < 1), pure lecithin vesicles do not grow, but exhibit slow intervesicular mixing of lipids as well as gradual leakage. At high BS/L (TC/L or TUDC/L > 5), pure lecithin vesicles are solubilized into mixed micelles with a concomitant decrease in the overall particle size. In this regime, extensive leakage and lipid mixing occur instantaneously after exposure to bile salt. At intermediate BS/L (1 < TC/L or TUDC/L < 5), vesicles grow with time, and the rates of both leakage and lipid mixing are rapid. The data suggest that vesicles grow by the transfer of lecithin and cholesterol via diffusion in the aqueous medium. The addition of cholesterol to lecithin vesicles reduces leakage dramatically and increases the amount of BS required for complete solubilization of vesicles. The more hydrophobic TDC induces vesicle growth at a lower BS/L than does TC or TUDC. These results demonstrate the physiologic forms of lipid microstructures during bile formation and explain how the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of BS mixtures may profoundly affect the early stages of CH gallstone formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2912153>Uptake of bumetanide into isolated rat hepatocytes and primary liver cell cultures.</a></h2><p>Uptake of bumetanide into rat liver cells was investigated using isolated hepatocytes and primary cell cultures. The kinetics of [3H]-bumetanide uptake revealed two saturable components in addition to an unsaturable component. Saturable bumetanide uptake consists of a high-affinity, sodium-dependent uptake and a low-affinity transport system. Bumetanide uptake into isolated rat hepatocytes is  dependent and temperature sensitive. At low temperatures, bumetanide uptake is due to diffusion with a permeability coefficient of 1.16 x 10(-6) cm/s. In primary liver cell cultures, uptake of bumetanide decreases rapidly over 3 days. AS-30D ascites hepatoma cells do not take up bumetanide but bind small amounts of the loop diuretic. Hepatocytes metabolized bumetanide extensively. The metabolites were secreted into the surrounding incubation buffer. Two hydroxylated and at least one conjugated biotransformation product could be separated by thin-layer chromatography. Isolated rat hepatocytes possess carrier proteins for uptake of bumetanide and very likely also for uptake of other loop diuretics like furosemide, piretanide, and torasemide. Several inhibitors of multispecific transport systems in the kidney and liver were tested as potential inhibitors of hepatocellular bumetanide or furosemide uptake. Probenecid, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic , iodipamide, digitoxin, bile acids, and bromosulfophthalein inhibited uptake of loop diuretics. Inhibition by taurocholic  was competitive with a Ki of 24 microM. Taurocholic  inhibited [3H]bumetanide uptake in the presence but not in the absence of Na+.  and bromosulfophthalein were noncompetitive inhibitors of hepatocellular bumetanide uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23951244>Metformin protects rat hepatocytes against bile -induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Metformin is used in the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus type II and improves liver function in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the cellular  sensor that is sensitive to changes in the AMP/ATP-ratio. AMPK is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Both AMPK and mTOR are able to modulate cell death.To evaluate the effects of metformin on hepatocyte cell death.Apoptotic cell death was induced in primary rat hepatocytes using either the bile  glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) or TNFα in combination with actinomycin D (actD). AMPK, mTOR and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt were inhibited using pharmacological inhibitors. Apoptosis and necrosis were quantified by caspase activation, acridine orange staining and Sytox green staining respectively.Metformin dose-dependently reduces GCDCA-induced apoptosis, even when added 2 hours after GCDCA, without increasing necrotic cell death. Metformin does not protect against TNFα/ActD-induced apoptosis. The protective effect of metformin is dependent on an intact PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, but does not require AMPK/mTOR-signaling. Metformin does not inhibit NF-κB activation.Metformin protects against bile -induced apoptosis and could be considered in the treatment of chronic liver diseases accompanied by inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23212544>Long-term bone density evaluation in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: evidence of improvement after chenodeoxycholic  treatment.</a></h2><p>Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is known to be associated with osteoporosis and a higher incidence of bone fractures. However, the underlying pathogenesis is still unknown, and the effects of long-term replacement therapy with chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on bone mineral density (BMD) have not been fully investigated. We studied 11 CTX patients aged 13-43 years. We performed dual- X-ray absorptiometry and assessed serum cholestanol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations both at the time of diagnosis and after long-term treatment with CDCA. At baseline, we found low BMD in nine patients, cholestanol elevation in all subjects, and 25-OHD decrease in nine. After a mean follow-up time of 30 months (range 24-36), no substantial clinical changes including bone fractures occurred; and we detected a significant increase of both planar and volumetric BMD as well as normalization of plasma cholestanol levels and increase of serum 25-OHD. Densitometric improvement following CDCA introduction was not correlated to changes of biochemical parameters. Our study confirms the presence of low bone mass in CTX and demonstrates that long-term CDCA treatment increases bone mineral content. In this respect, improvement of vitamin D intestinal absorption secondary to bile  restoration could play an important role. Moreover, our data strongly suggest the utility of periodic bone density evaluation in CTX patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27900259>Dietary fat and gut microbiota interactions determine diet-induced obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota may promote positive  balance; however, germfree mice can be either resistant or susceptible to diet-induced obesity (DIO) depending on the type of dietary intervention. We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to body fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice.GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut microbiota of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut microbiota. In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased  expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and  excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile  and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate  expenditure and interfere with bile  metabolism. Decreased cecal bile  levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut microbiota and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile  levels and specific bacteria of the order  (phylum ) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group). Following 10 weeks of tumor growth, all animals were sacrificed to collect total white adipose tissue (WAT). Luminex assays were performed for gut hormone and inflammation marker analysis. Bile acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in feces and serum. The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels. Moreover, the TG mice displayed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-10. Lithocholic , , and ursodeoxycholic  were significantly decreased in the stool of TG mice. Significant alterations of the intestinal microbiome were found in the ileal contents of the TG.The present study provides a first glimpse that human NB in a murine model induces tumor cachexia associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory parameters, as well as changes in the intestinal microbiota. Since the intestinal microbiome is known to contribute to the host's ability to harvest , a favorable modulation of the intestinal microbiome in tumor patients could potentially represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent tumor-associated cachexia.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17637009>Fluorescence of amphotericin B-deoxycholate (fungizone) monomers and aggregates and the effect of heat-treatment.</a></h2><p>Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra are reported for the polyene macrolide antifungal agent Amphotericin B formulated as micellar dispersion Fungizone (FZ) and its modified counterpart heat-treated Fungizone. The addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium deoxycholate surfactant to modulate the aggregation state of Amphotericin B confirms that the monomer and dimer states have different fluorescence spectra.  transfer from excited dimer to monomer is observed. Both FZ and heat-treated FZ (HTFZ) show expected S1 --> S0 fluorescence emission as well as anti-Kasha fluorescence emission from the S2 state. The excitation and S1 --> S0 emission spectra of HTFZ are similar to those of FZ, while the S2 --> S0 fluorescence differs in intensity between them. The variation in the rate constant for internal conversion from S2 to S1 as the surfactant concentration is increased differs for FZ and HTFZ; we propose that this may form a new basis for examining the super-aggregated character of AmB preparations. FZ and HTFZ have a similar stability to disaggregation by added sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant.

Patients seeking to improve their submental contour have a variety of treatment options including surgical procedures, -based devices, and injectable treatment. The Condition of Submental Fullness and Treatment Outcomes Registry (CONTOUR) was designed to provide insights into the treatment of submental fat (SMF) in clinical practice. CONTOUR was a prospective observational study that enrolled 1029 adults at 91 sites in the United States and Canada. Patients were followed until treatment completion, discontinuation, or 1 year elapsed from enrollment without treatment. Final data from CONTOUR are reported here. Of the 676 patients who underwent treatment, 570 were treated with ATX-101 ( injection), 77 with -based devices, 23 with surgical liposuction, 5 with laser liposuction, and 9 with other treatments. The majority of treated patients were facial aesthetic treatment naive. A markedly greater percentage of patients with mild or moderate SMF at baseline received treatment with ATX-101 or -based devices, whereas the majority of patients undergoing liposuction had severe or extreme SMF. Physicians most frequently cited a preference for a noninvasive/minimally invasive procedure as the reason for choosing either ATX-101 or -based devices. The majority of patients were at least partially satisfied with results, regardless of the chosen treatment. Data from CONTOUR indicate that cost is the most important factor in a patient’s decision to undergo treatment, that choice of treatment method is most influenced by SMF severity and preference for nonsurgical versus surgical intervention, and that the availability of noninvasive/minimally invasive options has made SMF treatment an attractive first procedure for patients who have not undergone previous facial aesthetic treatments.

First, the aqueous solubility of beta-sitosterol, beta-sitostanol, and campesterol was determined by considering the specific radioactivity by using a fairly small quantity of each radiolabeled compound. The order of their aqueous solubilities was as follows: cholesterol > campesterol > beta-sitostanol > beta-sitosterol. The maximum solubility of cholesterol and the above mentioned sterol/stanol in sodium taurodeoxycholate and sodium taurocholate solutions (single solubilizate system) was measured. Moreover, the preferential solubilization of cholesterol in bile salt solutions was systematically studied by using different types of plant sterols/stanols. The solubilization results showed that the cholesterol-lowering effect was similar for sterols and stanol. Thermodynamic analysis was applied to these experimental results. The Gibbs  change (Delta G degrees ) for the solubilization of plant sterols/stanols showed a negative value larger than that for cholesterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28322867>Bile  analysis in human disorders of bile  biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>Bile acids facilitate the absorption of lipids in the gut, but are also needed to maintain cholesterol homeostasis, induce bile flow, excrete toxic substances and regulate  metabolism by acting as signaling molecules. Bile  biosynthesis is a complex process distributed across many cellular organelles and requires at least 17 enzymes in addition to different metabolite transport proteins to synthesize the two primary bile acids, cholic  and chenodeoxycholic . Disorders of bile  synthesis can present from the neonatal period to adulthood and have very diverse clinical symptoms ranging from cholestatic liver disease to neuropsychiatric symptoms and spastic paraplegias.

However, the investigations toward self-assembly of CQDs are still in their infancy. The participation of CQDs can bring additional functions to supramolecular self-assemblies, with photoluminescent property as the most exciting aspect. Here, we introduce CQDs into two types of classic colloidal systems containing low molecular weight surfactant and gelator to construct fluorescent vesicles and chiral hydrogels. The CQD-based vesicles were constructed through electrostatic interaction between the positively charged CQDs with peripherally substituted imidazolium cations and a negatively-charged biosurfactant, i.e., sodium deoxycholate (NaDC). The chiral hydrogels were prepared by increasing the concentration of NaDC and addition of a tripeptide (glutathione, GSH). It was found that both the hydrogels and corresponding xerogels are highly photoluminescent. A solid sensing system was prepared by coating a uniform layer of the hydrogel onto the silica gel plates by doctor blade technique followed by air-drying, which was then utilized to semiquantitatively detect Cu2+ in aqueous solutions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27561199>Synthesis of (125) I-lamivudine and (125) I-lamivudine-ursodeoxycholic  codrug.</a></h2><p>The preparation of (125) I-lamivudine ((125) I-3TC) and (125) I-lamivudine-ursodeoxycholic  codrug ((125) I-3TC-UDCA), suitable for comparative biodistribution studies, is described.

The aim of this study was to optimize PB microcapsules by incorporating the bile   (DCA), which has good permeation-enhancing properties, and to examine its effect on microcapsules' morphology, rheology, structural and surface characteristics, and excipients' chemical and thermal compatibilities. Microencapsulation was carried out using a BÜCHI-based microencapsulating system established in the authors' laboratory. Using the polymer sodium alginate (SA), two microencapsulated formulations were prepared: PB-SA (control) and PB-DCA-SA (test) at a constant ratio (1:30 and 1:3:30, respectively). Complete characterization of the microcapsules was carried out. The incorporation of DCA resulted in better structural and surface characteristics, uniform morphology, and stable chemical and thermal profiles, while size and rheological parameters remained similar to control. In addition, PB-DCA-SA microcapsules showed good excipients' compatibilities, which were supported by data from differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and  dispersive X-ray studies, suggesting microcapsule stability.

The experiments are conducted in vacuo by suspending the target dye-sensitized nanoparticles within a quadrupole ion trap, where they are probed with laser radiation to obtain emission spectra and time-resolved excited state decay curves. For Carbz-Al, the dye's emission band is blue-shifted and the excited state lifetime is increased upon the coabsorption of CDCA, effects attributed to reduced dye aggregation. Compared to Carbz-Al, the Carbz-Ti excited state lifetimes are significantly shorter due to excited dye molecules injecting electrons into the titania conduction band. For Carbz-Ti, the electron injection quantum yields for the surfaces with CDCA (CDCA : dye = 25 : 1) and without CDCA are estimated to be 0.87 and 0.71, respectively.

Animals were pair-fed liquid diets containing 36% of calories as ethanol or isocaloric carbohydrates. They were randomly assigned into 4 groups of 7 rats each and received a specific treatment for 5 weeks: control diet, ethanol diet, control diet + UDC, and ethanol diet + UDC. Respiratory rates of isolated liver mitochondria were measured using a Clark oxygen electrode with sodium succinate as substrate. Mitochondria from rats chronically fed ethanol demonstrated an impaired ability to produce . At the fatty liver stage, the ADP-stimulated respiration (V3) was depressed by 33%, the respiratory control ratio (RC) by 25% and the P/O ratio by 15%. In ethanol-fed rats supplemented with UDC, both the rate and efficiency of ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation were improved: V3 was increased by 35%, P/O by 8%. All the respiratory parameters were similar in control group and control + UDC group. On the other hand, the number and size of mitochondria were assessed by electron microscopy and computer-assisted quantitative analysis. The number of mitochondria from ethanol-treated rats was decreased by 29%, and they were enlarged by 74%. Both parameters were normalized to control values by UDC treatment. These studies demonstrate that UDC has a protective effect against ethanol-induced mitochondrial injury by improving ATP synthesis and preserving liver mitochondrial morphology. These UDC positive effects may contribute to the observed decrease in fat accumulation and may delay the progression of alcoholic injury to more advanced stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27109170>Photoactive bile salts with critical micellar concentration in the micromolar range.</a></h2><p>The aggregation behavior of bile salts is strongly dependent on the number of hydroxyl groups. Thus, cholic  (CA), with three hydroxyls, starts forming aggregates at 15 mM, while , chenodeoxycholic or ursodeoxycholic acids, with two hydroxyls, start aggregating at 5-10 mM; for lithocholic , with only one hydroxyl group, aggregation is observed at lower concentration (2-3 mM). Here, the singular self-assembling properties of dansyl and naproxen derivatives of CA (3β-Dns-CA and 3β-NPX-CA, respectively) have been demonstrated on the basis of their photoactive properties. Thus, the emission spectra of 3β-Dns-CA registered at increasing concentrations (25-140 μM) showed a remarkable non-linear enhancement in the emission intensity accompanied by a hypsochromic shift of the maximum and up to a three-fold increase in the singlet lifetime. The inflection point at around 50-70 μM pointed to the formation of unprecedented assemblies at such low concentrations. In the case of 3β-NPX-CA, when the NPX relative triplet lifetime was plotted against concentration, a marked increase (up to two-fold) was observed at 40-70 μM, indicating the formation of new 3β-NPX-CA assemblies at ca. 50 μM. Additional evidence supporting the formation of new 3β-Dns-CA or 3β-NPX-CA assemblies at 40-70 μM was obtained from singlet excited state quenching experiments using iodide. Moreover, to address the potential formation of hybrid assemblies, 1 : 1 mixtures of 3β-Dns-CA and 3β-NPX-CA (2-60 μM, total concentration) were subjected to steady-state fluorescence experiments, and their behavior was compared to that of the pure photoactive derivatives. A lower increase in the emission was observed for 3β-NPX-CA in the mixture, while a huge increase was experienced by 3β-Dns-CA in the same concentration range (up to 60 μM total). A partial intermolecular  transfer from NPX to Dns, consistent with their reported singlet energies, was revealed, pointing to the formation of extremely fluorescent hybrid assemblies at 5-10 μM (total concentration). The morphology of the entities was investigated by means of confocal microscopy.

Bile salts cause a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the proteins at the emission maximum of 333-335 nm. The concentration dependence of this decrease shows saturation behavior, is relatively nonspecific with respect to bile salt conjugation or the presence of the 7 alpha-hydroxyl group, and is consistent with a 1:1 interaction between enzyme and bile salt. Direct measurement of the binding of [3H]cholate by equilibrium dialysis supports the stoichiometry. Other detergents also bind, causing fluorescence changes, but with much lower affinities. Binding of taurocholate to the monomeric pig enzyme is enhanced by increasing ionic strength, indicating the predominance of hydrophobic interactions. In the range of pH 5.5-6.8, binding is pH-independent with dissociation constants of 3-20 microM. At higher pH, affinity is greatly reduced and the fluorescence spectrum changes, indicating the importance of a protonated group for efficient interaction. Occupancy of the bile salt binding site partially stabilizes the enzyme against inactivation by heat but not trypsin. However, circular dichroism spectra do not indicate that bile salt binding is accompanied by any change in secondary structure. The monomeric pig enzyme binds to the argon/water interface in the presence of bile salts and binding of taurocholate to diisopropylphosphoryl-enzyme is similar to that measured with native enzyme. These results suggest that surface binding and catalysis occur at sites distinct from the bile salt binding site of the enzyme. Stabilization of the monomeric pig enzyme against denaturation at high  surfaces occurs concomitantly with occupancy of the bile salt binding site. Overall, the data suggest that an important role of bile salts in vivo is to stabilize these enzymes at lipid-water interfaces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776395>Electrokinetic potential-stabilization by bile -microencapsulating formulation of pancreatic β-cells cultured in high ratio poly-L-ornithine-gel hydrogel colloidal dispersion: applications in cell-biomaterials, tissue engineering and biotechnological applications.</a></h2><p>Current trials for β-cell transplantation have been hindered by poor cell viability and function post-transplantation.

The bile , ursodeoxycholic , was added into the microcapsules to measure its effects on electric charges.The electric charge of the microencapsulating formulation was enhanced by bile  addition, and resulted in better cell viability and function.Ursodeoxycholic  microencapsulated with poly-L-ornithine, suspending electrical-stimulation hydrogel and polystyrene sulphone at 1:1:0.1 ratio, using 800 V and 2000 Hz microencapsulating conditions, produced enhanced electrokinetic parameters of microcapsules with optimized cell functions. This suggests that electric charge of formulations containing pancreatic β-cell may have significant effects on cell mass and functions, post-transplantation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29978488>Transport mechanism of ursodeoxycholic  in human placental BeWo cells.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a first-line drug to treat intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). However, its effects on the fetus are not clearly known. To better guide its clinical use, we aimed to study the mechanism underlying the placental transport of UDCA. The uptake and efflux of UDCA across placental apical membranes were studied using BeWo cells; effects of different exposure durations, UDCA concentrations, temperatures, and inhibitors of transporters were studied. A transwell assay was performed, and UDCA concentration in both fetal and maternal sides was measured using LC-MS/MS. Higher unidirectional transport of UDCA was observed in the basolateral-to-apical direction than in the apical-to-basolateral direction. Ko143 and verapamil, which are typical inhibitors of efflux transporters, significantly increased UDCA transport from different directions. UDCA uptake from the apical membrane of BeWo cells was time-dependent, but sodium-independent. It was inhibited by inhibitors of  metabolism and of organic anion transporters, indicating an active transport mechanism. UDCA uptake from the apical membranes of BeWo cells could be mediated by organic anion-transporting polypeptides, whereas its efflux could be mediated by breast cancer resistance protein and multidrug resistant protein 3. The results of the present study may provide a basis for UDCA use in pregnancy.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30912732>Ingestion of difructose anhydride III partially suppresses the deconjugation and 7α-dehydroxylation of bile acids in rats fed with a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Difructose anhydride III (DFAIII) is a prebiotic involved in the reduction of secondary bile acids (BAs). We investigated whether DFAIII modulates BA metabolism, including enterohepatic circulation, in the rats fed with a diet supplemented with cholic  (CA), one of the 12α-hydroxylated BAs. After acclimation, the rats were fed with a control diet or a diet supplemented with DFAIII. After 2 weeks, each group was further divided into two groups and was fed diet with or without CA supplementation at 0.5 g/kg diet. BA levels were analyzed in aortic and portal plasma, liver, intestinal content, and feces. As a result, DFAIII ingestion reduced the fecal  level via the partial suppression of deconjugation and 7α-dehydroxylation of BAs following CA supplementation.

It is well established that HD is associated with perturbation of mitochondrial  metabolism. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a naturally occurring bile , can stabilize the mitochondrial membrane, inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition, decrease free radical formation, and derail apoptotic pathways.

In addition, rats treated with TUDCA exhibited an 80% reduction in apoptosis and in lesion volumes associated with 3-NP administration. Moreover, rats which received a combination of TUDCA + 3-NP exhibited sensorimotor and cognitive task performance that was indistinguishable from that of controls, and this effect persisted at least 6 months.

It may be associated with transient elevations of liver enzyme concentrations, which return to normal after parenteral nutrition is discontinued. Prolonged parenteral nutrition is associated with complications affecting the hepatobiliary system, such as cholelithiasis, cholestasis, and steatosis. The most common of these is parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC), which may occur in children and may progress to liver failure. The pathophysiology of PNAC is poorly understood, and the etiology is multifactorial. Risk factors include prematurity, long duration of parenteral nutrition, sepsis, lack of bowel motility, and short bowel syndrome. Possible etiologies include excessive caloric administration, parenteral nutrition components, and nutritional deficiencies. Several measures can be undertaken to prevent PNAC, such as avoiding overfeeding, providing a balanced source of , weaning parenteral nutrition, starting enteral feeding, and avoiding sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651024>pKa values of hyodeoxycholic and cholic acids in the binary mixed micelles sodium-hyodeoxycholate-Tween 40 and sodium-cholate-Tween 40: Thermodynamic stability of the micelle and the cooperative hydrogen bond formation with the steroid skeleton.</a></h2><p>Due to a relatively small size of bile  salts, their mixed micelles with nonionic surfactants are analysed. Of the special interests are real binary mixed micelles that are thermodynamically more stable than ideal mixed micelles. Thermodynamic stability is expressed with an excess Gibbs  (G) or over an interaction parameter (β). In this paper sodium salts of cholic (C) and hyodeoxycholic  (HD) in their mixed micelles with Tween 40 (T40) are analysed by potentiometric titration and their pKa values are determined. Examined bile acids in mixed micelles with T40 have higher pKa values than free bile acids. The increase of ΔpKa  constant of micellary bound C and HD is in a correlation with absolute values of an interaction parameter. According to an interaction parameter and an excess Gibbs , mixed micelle HD-T40 are thermodynamically more stable than mixed micelles C-T40. ΔpKa values are higher for mixed micelles with Tween 40 whose second building unit is HD, related to the building unit C. In both micellar systems, ΔpKa increases with the rise of a molar fraction of Tween 40 in binary mixtures of surfactants with sodium salts of bile acids. This suggests that, ΔpKa can be a measure of a thermodynamic stabilization of analysed binary mixed micelles as well as an interaction parameter. ΔpKa values are confirmed by determination of a distribution coefficient of HD and C in systems: water phase with Tween 40 in a micellar concentration and 1-octanol, with a change of a pH value of a water phase. Conformational analyses suggests that synergistic interactions between building units of analysed binary micelles originates from formation of hydrogen bonds between steroid OH groups and polyoxyethylene groups of the T40. Relative similarity and spatial orientation of C and C OH group allows cooperative formation of hydrogen bonds between T40 and HD - excess entropy in formation of mixed micelle. If a water solution of analysed binary mixtures of surfactants contains urea in concentration of 4M significant decreases of an interaction parameter value happens which confirms the importance of hydrogen bonds in synergistic interactions (urea compete in hydrogen bonds).Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It has been suggested that changes of high- phosphates, intracellular pH, and intracellular cation homeostasis are closely related to hepatocellular injury associated with MOF.Phosphorus metabolites, intracellular pH (pHi), and intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) were measured in rat livers in vivo using 31P and 23Na NMR spectroscopy after  (DCA)-induced pancreatitis or intraperitoneal injection (ip) of pancreatitis-induced ascitic fluid (PAF).Two hours after induction of DCA-pancreatitis, the liver experienced significant intracellular acidosis (pHi = 6.99 +/- 0.16) and sodium loading (75 +/- 9 mM) and a reduction in its  state (beta-ATP/Pi = 0.2 +/- 0.03 and Pi = 164 +/- 12). Although ip injection of PAF into healthy rats did not induce systemic hypotension, the livers under these conditions also developed severe disturbances in hepatocellular ion homeostasis and depletion of its bioenergetics. The longer the abdomen was exposed to the PAF, the worse the changes were. At 3 h after ip injection of PAF, hepatic [Na+]i significantly increased (42 +/- 3 mM) along with a significant decrease in pHi (7.30 +/- 0. 03). At 6 h after ip injection of PAF, the hepatic beta-ATP/Pi ratio decreased to 0.34 +/- 0.05 and Pi increased to 97 +/- 27.PAF induced severe hepatocellular acidosis, rapid accumulation of hepatic intracellular sodium, impaired hepatic cytosolic phosphorylation potential, and increased hepatic utilization of ATP.

The purpose of this study was to use an established in vitro technique to examine the uptake of bile acids into jejunum, ileum, and colon of control (CON) and streptozotocin-diabetic rats (DM). When the bulk phase was stirred to reduce the effective thickness of the unstirred layer, the ileal uptake of 1.5-15 mM cholic (C), glycocholic (GC), taurocholic (TC), chenodeoxycholic (CDC), glycochenodeoxycholic (GCDC), and  (DC)  was similar in CON and DM. The relative values of the maximal transport rates (Jdm) were CDC greater than GC greater than GCDC greater than C greater than TC = DC, and similar relative values were observed for the Michaelis constants (Km). The values of Jdm and Km for each bile  were similar in CON and in DM. In CON and at pH 7.4 an inverse linear relationship was noted between the number of hydrogen bonds in the bile acids and the natural logarithm of the permeability coefficient (Pd) times the square root of the molecular weight of the bile . This slope reflected the incremental change in free , delta delta Fw leads to I, associated with the uptake of bile acids; the value of delta delta Fw leads to I was similar for jejunum, ileum, and colon of CON, but was lower in jejunum of DM than CON.

The mechanism by which bile acids can damage the gastric epithelium is not completely understood. Several studies have emphasized mucosal lipid solubilization by bile acids in the pathogenesis of mucosal injury. Bile  entry into gastric mucosal cells may be a critical and early step in the genesis of mucosal injury, but this possibility has not yet been investigated. The present study was designed to explore the interaction of bile acids with dispersed gastric mucosal cells isolated from the rabbit and guinea pig stomach. Results showed that both glycocholic and  rapidly associated with the gastric cells and reached a steady state concentration by 30 min. Glycocholic  accumulated in the cells to a concentration approximately eight times greater than that in the surrounding medium. The amount of bile  associated with the cells was greater at an acidic than at a neutral pH, and was a function of the concentration of both the cells and the bile . The process did not require cellular , was nonsaturable, and was not species specific. Experiments with 86Rb, a cytoplasmic marker, revealed that approximately one half of the cellular glycocholic  was associated with the cytoplasmic compartment and the rest with the membranes. These findings are consistent with a combination of intracellular entrapment of the bile acids due to intracellular ionization and bile  binding to cellular membrane components being the mechanisms by which bile acids accumulate in cells. -driven bile  accumulation may explain how relatively low luminal concentrations of bile  can be damaging to the gastrointestinal mucosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168912>Obesity and cancer: A mechanistic overview of metabolic changes in obesity that impact genetic instability.</a></h2><p>Obesity, defined as a state of positive  balance with a body mass index exceeding 30 kg/m in adults and 95th percentile in children, is an increasing global concern. Approximately one-third of the world's population is overweight or obese, and in the United States alone, obesity affects one in six children. Meta-analysis studies suggest that obesity increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer, and with poorer outcomes, especially in children. The contribution of obesity to cancer risk requires a better understanding of the association between obesity-induced metabolic changes and its impact on genomic instability, which is a major driving force of tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss how molecular changes during adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage. This represents one of the many critical steps connecting obesity and cancer since oxidative DNA lesions can result in cancer-associated genetic instability. In addition, the by-products of the oxidative degradation of lipids (e.g., malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and acrolein), and gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile  metabolites (e.g.,  and lithocholic ), can function as genotoxic agents and tumor promoters. We also discuss how obesity can impact DNA repair efficiency, potentially contributing to cancer initiation and progression. Finally, we outline obesity-related epigenetic changes and identify the gaps in knowledge to be addressed for the development of better therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699733>Thematic review series: Adipocyte Biology. Adipocyte stress: the endoplasmic reticulum and metabolic disease.</a></h2><p>In the context of obesity and its related maladies, the adipocyte plays a central role in the balance, or imbalance, of metabolic homeostasis. An obese, hypertrophic adipocyte is challenged by many insults, including surplus , inflammation, insulin resistance, and considerable stress to various organelles. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one such vital organelle that demonstrates significant signs of stress and dysfunction in obesity and insulin resistance. Under normal conditions, the ER must function in the unique and trying environment of the adipocyte, adapting to meet the demands of increased protein synthesis and secretion,  storage in the form of triglyceride droplet formation, and nutrient sensing that are particular to the differentiated fat cell. When nutrients are in pathological excess, the ER is overwhelmed and the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. Remarkably, the consequences of UPR activation have been causally linked to the development of insulin resistance through a multitude of possible mechanisms, including c-jun N-terminal kinase activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This review will focus on the function of the ER under normal conditions in the adipocyte and the pathological effects of a stressed ER contributing to adipocyte dysfunction and a thwarted metabolic homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11880244>Solubilization of cholesterol and polycyclic aromatic compounds into sodium bile salt micelles (part 2).</a></h2><p>The aqueous solubility of cholesterol was determined over the temperature range from 288.2 to 318.2 K with intervals of 5 K by the enzymatic method. The solubility was (3.7+/-0.3)x10(-8) mol dm(-3) (average +/- S.D.) at 308.2 K. The maximum additive concentrations of cholesterol into the aqueous micellar solutions of sodium deoxycholate (NaDC), sodium ursodeoxycholate (NaUDC), and sodium cholate (NaC) were spectrophotometrically determined at different temperatures. The cholesterol solubility increased in the order of NaUDC<NaC<NaDC; for example, 0.10 for NaUDC, 0.61 for NaC, and 2.99 mmol dm(-3) for NaDC at the concentration of 60 mmol dm(-3) and at 308.2 K. The same solubilization experiments were made at 308.2 K using polycyclic aromatic compounds (benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene) as a reference. Their solubility increase for the bile salts was in the same order as above. Thermodynamic analysis was made for the solubilization, where a micelle was regarded as a chemical species. The average number of solubilizate per micelle was less than unity throughout the experiments. From the Gibbs  change for solubilization at the different mean aggregation numbers, the function of bile salt micelles was discussed from the viewpoint of molecular structure of solubilizates. The DeltaG(0) value for cholesterol was most negative among the solubilizates studied, which reflected that solubilization of cholesterol into bile salt micelles brought about largest thermodynamic stabilization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28422755>β-Klotho deficiency protects against obesity through a crosstalk between liver, microbiota, and brown adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>β-Klotho (encoded by Klb) is the obligate coreceptor mediating FGF21 and FGF15/19 signaling. Klb-/- mice are refractory to beneficial action of pharmacological FGF21 treatment including stimulation of glucose utilization and thermogenesis. Here, we investigated the  homeostasis in Klb-/- mice on high-fat diet in order to better understand the consequences of abrogating both endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 signaling during caloric overload. Surprisingly, Klb-/- mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO) owing to enhanced  expenditure and BAT activity. Klb-/- mice exhibited not only an increase but also a shift in bile  (BA) composition featured by activation of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative (acidic) pathway. High hepatic production of cholic  (CA) results in a large excess of microbiota-derived  (DCA). DCA is specifically responsible for activating the TGR5 receptor that stimulates BAT thermogenic activity. In fact, combined gene deletion of Klb and Tgr5 or antibiotic treatment abrogating bacterial conversion of CA into DCA both abolish DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice. These results suggested that DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice is caused by high levels of DCA, signaling through the TGR5 receptor. These data also demonstrated that gut microbiota can regulate host thermogenesis via conversion of primary into secondary BA.

Bile travels through the liver in a series of ducts, eventually exiting through the common hepatic duct. Bile flows through this duct into the gallbladder where it is concentrated and stored. When stimulated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), the gallbladder contracts, pushing bile through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  Simultaneously, the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, permitting bile to enter the duodenal lumen. The hormone secretin also plays an important role in the flow of bile into the small intestine. By stimulating biliary and pancreatic ductular cells to secrete bicarbonate and water in response to the presence of  in the duodenum, secretin effectively expands the volume of bile entering the duodenum. In the small intestine, bile acids facilitate lipid digestion and absorption. Only approximately 5% of these bile acids are eventually excreted. The majority of bile acids are efficiently reabsorbed from the ileum, secreted into the portal venous system, and returned to the liver in a process known as enterohepatic recirculation.[1][2][3]   Bile is produced by hepatocytes, which is then modified by the cholangiocytes lining the bile ducts. The production and secretion of bile require active transport systems within hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in addition to a structurally and functionally intact biliary tree. Initially, hepatocytes produce bile by secreting conjugated bilirubin, bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, proteins, ions, and water into their canaliculi (thin tubules between adjacent hepatocytes that eventually join to form bile ducts). The canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte is the main bile secretory apparatus which contains the intracellular organelles, the cytoskeleton of the hepatocyte and carrier proteins. The carrier proteins in the canalicular membrane transport bile  and ions. Transporter proteins found within the canalicular membrane use  to secrete molecules into bile against concentration gradients. Through this active transport, osmotic and electrochemical gradients are formed. When conjugated bile salts enter the canaliculus, water follows by osmosis. The electrochemical gradient allows for the passive diffusion of inorganic ions such as sodium. The most significant promoter of bile formation is the passage of conjugated bile salts into the biliary canaliculus. The total bile flow in a day is approximately 600 ml, of which 75% is derived from the hepatocyte, and 25% is from the cholangiocytes. Approximately half of the hepatocyte component of bile flow (about 225 ml per day) is bile salt-dependent and the remaining half bile salt independent. Osmotically active solutes such as glutathione and bicarbonate promote bile salt independent bile flow.[4][5] Canaliculi empty bile into ductules or cholangioles or canals of Hering. The ductules connect with interlobular bile ducts, which are accompanied by branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery forming portal triads. Bile is subsequently modified by ductular epithelial cells as it passes through the biliary tree. These cells, known as cholangiocytes, dilute and alkalinize the bile through hormone-regulated absorptive and secretory processes. The cholangiocytes have receptors which modulate the bicarbonate-rich ductular bile flow, which is regulated by hormones. These receptors include receptors for secretin, somatostatin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger.  For example, when secretin stimulates receptors in the cholangiocyte, a cascade is initiated which activates the CFTR chloride channel and allows the exchange of bicarbonate for chloride. In contrast, somatostatin inhibits the cAMP synthesis within the cholangiocytes causing the opposite effect. While bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, acetylcholine, and secretin enhances bile flow, somatostatin, gastrin, insulin, and endothelin inhibit the flow.[6]  Cholesterol catabolism by hepatocytes results in the synthesis of the 2 major primary bile acids, cholic , and chenodeoxycholic . This process involves multiple steps, with cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Primary bile acids undergo dehydroxylation by bacteria in the small intestine, forming the secondary bile acids  and lithocholic , respectively.  Both primary and secondary bile acids are conjugated by the liver with an amino , either glycine or taurine. Conjugated bile acids are known as bile salts. Bile salts inhibit cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, decreasing the synthesis of bile acids. Despite the increased water solubility of bile salts, they are amphipathic molecules overall. This critical property allows them to effectively emulsify lipids and form micelles with the products of lipid digestion. The bile  pool is maintained via mainly the enterohepatic circulation and to a small extent (about 5%) by hepatic synthesis of bile acids, as long as the daily fecal loss of bile acids do not exceed 20% of the pool.Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17482801>Monolayers (Langmuir films) behavior of multi-component systems composed of a bile  with different sterols and with their 1:1 mixtures.</a></h2><p>Different physicochemical properties of Langmuir films (monolayers) composed of 10 mixed systems of a bile ,  (DC) with various plant sterols, such as stigmasterol (Stig), beta-sitosterol (Sito) and campesterol (Camp) and a stanol, cholestanol (Chsta) in addition to an animal sterol, cholesterol (Ch) [these sterols and Chsta are abbreviated as St] and DC with 1:1 St mixtures; (Ch+Chsta), (Ch+Stig), (Stig+Chsta), (Ch+Sito) and (Ch+Camp) on the substrate of 5M aqueous NaCl solution (pH 1.2) at 25 degrees C, were investigated in terms of mean surface area per molecule (A(m)), the partial molecular area (PMA), surface excess Gibbs  (DeltaG((ex))), interaction parameter (I(p)) as well as activity coefficients (f(1) and f(2)) in 2-D phase of each binary (or ternary) component system and elasticity (Cs(-1)) of formed films; these were analyzed on the basis of the respective surface pressure (pi) versus A(m) isotherms as a function of mole fraction of Sts (X(st)) in the DC/St(s) mixtures at discrete surface pressures.

There are several possible explanations for the high prevalence of supersaturated bile in the Western adult human as compared to other adult mammals. First, the human liver is defective in converting cholesterol to bile acids; the majority of cholesterol is eliminated as cholesterol. Second, the large flux of cholesterol in vesicular form is not matched by a large flux of recycling bile acids. Third, humans live sedentary lives and voluntarily reduce their caloric requirement to prevent obesity. Low caloric intake decreases the circulation of bile acids (including the flux through the hepatocyte). Fourth, the human species is a defective bile secretor in terms of biliary volume (microliter/kg-min) compared to other mammals. This is because human enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is "sluggish" and because bile -independent flow is also lower than in all other mammals. The accumulation of , a secondary bile  formed in the colon, appears to cause secretion of bile that is supersaturated in cholesterol, and may also contribute. Five additional risk factors explain why cholesterol gallstone disease is so prevalent. First, the human species has a gallbladder, and the irregular meal pattern of humans may be responsible for prolonged storage of bile. Second, bile from cholesterol gallstone patients nucleates cholesterol more rapidly. Third, defective gallbladder contraction is associated with cholesterol gallstone disease in the majority of gallstone patients. Fourth, the healthy gallbladder absorbs cholesterol and desaturates bile--protective functions that may be lost with chronic cholecystitis. Finally, the presence of gallstones stimulates mucous secretion, which traps cholesterol crystals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23747364>Cytotoxic bile acids, but not cytoprotective species, inhibit the ordering effect of cholesterol in model membranes at physiologically active concentrations.</a></h2><p>Submillimolar concentrations of cytotoxic bile acids (BAs) induce cell death via apoptosis. On the other hand, several cytoprotective BAs were shown to prevent apoptosis in the same concentration range. Still, the mechanisms by which BAs trigger these opposite signaling effects remain unclear. This study was aimed to determine if cytotoxic and cytoprotective BAs, at physiologically active concentrations, are able to modulate the biophysical properties of lipid membranes, potentially translating into changes in the apoptotic threshold of cells. Binding of BAs to membranes was assessed through the variation of fluorescence parameters of suitable derivatized BAs. These derivatives partitioned with higher affinity to liquid disordered than to the cholesterol-enriched liquid ordered domains. Unlabeled BAs were also shown to have a superficial location upon interaction with the lipid membrane. Additionally, the interaction of cytotoxic BAs with membranes resulted in membrane expansion, as concluded from FRET data. Moreover, it was shown that cytotoxic BAs were able to significantly disrupt the ordering of the membrane by cholesterol at physiologically active concentrations of the BA, an effect not associated with cholesterol removal. On the other hand, cytoprotective bile acids had no effect on membrane properties. It was concluded that, given the observed effects on membrane rigidity, the apoptotic activity of cytotoxic BAs could be potentially associated with changes in plasma membrane organization (e.g. modulation of lipid domains) or with an increase in mitochondrial membrane affinity for apoptotic proteins.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Bile acids (BAs) have been recognized as signaling molecules regulating the homeostasis of glucose, lipid, and . The current study characterizes the age-related changes of individual BA concentrations by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) in serum and liver of male and female C57BL/6 mice from 3 to 27 months of age. Total BA concentrations in serum increased 340% from 3 to 27 months in female mice, whereas they remained relatively constant with age in male mice. During aging, male and female mice shared the following changes: (1) BA concentrations in liver remained relatively constant; (2) the proportions of beta-muricholic  (βMCA) increased and  (DCA) decreased between 3 and 27 months in serum and liver; and (3) total BAs in serum and liver became more hydrophilic between 3 and 27 months. In female mice, (1) the mRNAs of hepatic BA uptake transporters, the Na(+)/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b2 (Oatp1b2), decreased after 12 months, and similar trends were observed for their proteins; (2) the mRNA of the rate-limiting enzyme for BA synthesis, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1), increased from 3 to 9 months and remained high thereafter. However, in male mice, Ntcp, Oatp1b2, and Cyp7a1 mRNAs remained relatively constant with age. In summary, the current study shows gender-divergent profiles of BA concentrations and composition in serum and liver of mice during aging, which is likely due to the gender-divergent expression of BA transporters Ntcp and Oatp1b2 as well as the synthetic enzyme Cyp7a1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925077>Network-Wide Screen Identifies Variation of Novel Precise On-Module Targets Using Conformational Modudaoism.</a></h2><p>Modular targeting is promising in drug research at the network level, but it is challenging to quantificationally identify the precise on-modules. Based on a proposed Modudaoism (MD), we defined conserved MD (MDc) and varied MD (MDv) to quantitatively evaluate the conformational and  variations of modules, and thereby identify the conserved and discrepant allosteric modules (AMs). Compared to the Z , MDc/MDv got an optimized result of module preserved ratio and modular structure. In the mice anti-ischemic networks, 3, 5, and 1 conserved AMs as well as 4, 1, and 3 on-modules of baicalin (BA), jasminoidin (JA), and ursodeoxycholic  (UA) were identified by MDc and MDv, 5 unique AMs and their characteristic actions were revealed. Besides, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments validated the representative modular structure. MDc/MDv method can quantitatively define the conformational variations of modules and screen the precise on-modules network-wide, which may provide a promising strategy for drug discovery.© 2017 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15868595>Failure of cholecystokinin-octapeptide to prevent TPN-associated gallstone disease.</a></h2><p>Gallstone formation is a common problem in neonates on prolonged courses of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The authors hypothesized that the use of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK), given at the time of TPN administration, would prevent gallstone formation in a high-risk group of patients with TPN.A prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled trial of neonates who were on a prolonged course of TPN for prematurity (25 infants), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, 8 infants), or abdominal surgery (5 infants) were selected randomly to receive CCK vs placebo. Patients remained on the study until taking more than 50% of  enterally. Children were recalled between 2 and 4 years after completing TPN for ultrasonographic examination of their hepatobiliary tree.Neonates (38 studied) required a mean (+/-SD) of 33 +/- 16 days of TPN. Cholelithiasis was detected in 4 (10%) infants. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide was not effective in preventing the formation of gallstones (3 stones in infants receiving CCK, P = .51). Diagnosis (P = .56), birth weight (P = .54), gestational age (P = .18), and duration of TPN (P = .53) did not correlate with gallstone formation. To address the management of these stones, all 4 were placed on a prolonged course of ursodeoxycholic  (mean duration, 11.6 +/- 5.4 months). Two additional infants (not in the original study) with TPN-associated gallstone disease were also given a trial of ursodeoxycholic . Serial ultrasounds were performed every 6 months. No patient achieved any degree of stone dissolution. One patient underwent cholecystectomy for symptomatology.Total parenteral nutrition-associated gallstones were detected in 10% of children, and most are nonsymptomatic. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide prophylaxis was not effective in preventing TPN-associated gallstones. In addition, the use of ursodeoxycholic  did not dissolve gallstones, once identified. Future methods will be needed to address the prevention and treatment of these stones.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672601>Factors affecting the apparent solubility of ursodeoxycholic  in the grinding process.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was ground by a vibrating mill. Apparent solubility of the ground sample was determined by Coulter counter method. The samples were characterized by pore size distribution measurement, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement, near infra-red (NIR) spectroscopy and contact angle measurement. The dispersive and polar components of surface free  were calculated from the contact angle data determined by a contact angle analyzer. Surface polarity was calculated from the surface free  components. The apparent solubility of UDCA was increased by the grinding with vibrating mill, however, the particle size of ground sample was not decreased. An amorphization was observed in the PXRD pattern of the ground sample, and the crystallinity of sample was decreased with increasing the grinding time. During the initial grinding, the dispersive component of surface free  was decreased, whereas the polar part of surface free  was increased. The surface polarity of the sample was increased in the same manner. Relationship between the solubility and the factors changing in the grinding process was evaluated. There was a significant correlation between the apparent solubility and the surface polarity and crystallinity of the sample. The NIR spectra confirmed the appearance of [bond]OH group on the sample surface. The apparent solubility increase of the ground sample was closely related to the improvement of the surface polarity and the destruction of crystalline structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3593707>The passive permeability properties of in vivo perfused rat jejunum.</a></h2><p>The polarity of the microvillus membrane of rat and rabbit jejunum, determined in vitro by the incremental free  changes associated with the addition of -CH2 groups to fatty acids or -OH groups to bile acids, has been found to be more polar than other biological membranes. The reason for the difference in polarity is unexplained but could be due to artifacts caused by the in vitro conditions. In the current studies the apparent permeability coefficients were determined for a homologous series of fatty acids and bile acids in in vivo perfused rat jejunum. The true permeability coefficients were derived by correction for diffusion barrier resistance. The incremental free  changes associated with the addition of a -CH2 group to a fatty  and a -OH group to a bile  were -619 and +2069 cal/mol, respectively. These values correspond to values determined in other biological membranes such as erythrocytes and adipocytes. Thus, the rat microvillus membrane is more nonpolar than previously observed in vitro. The reason for the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro results is most likely due to an underestimation of the permeability coefficients in the in vitro studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2280184>Bile  structure-activity relationship: evaluation of bile  lipophilicity using 1-octanol/water partition coefficient and reverse phase HPLC.</a></h2><p>Two independent methods have been developed and compared to determine the lipophilicity of a representative series of naturally occurring bile acids (BA) in relation to their structure. The BA included cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA),  (DCA), hyodeoxycholic  (HDCA), ursocholic  (UCA), hyocholic  (HCA), as well as their glycine and taurine amidates. Lipophilicity was determined using a 1-octanol/water shake-flask procedure and the experiments were performed at different pH and ionic strengths and at initial BA concentrations below their critical micellar concentrations (CMC) and the water solubility of the protonated form. The experimental data show that both the protonated (HA) and ionized (A-) forms of BA can distribute in 1-octanol, and consequently a partition coefficient for HA (logP' HA) and for A- (logP' A-) must be defined. An equation to predict a weighted apparent distribution coefficient (D) value as a function of pH and pKa has been developed and fits well with the experimental data. Differences between logP for protonated and ionized species for unconjugated BA were in the order of 1 log unit, which increased to 2 for glycine-amidate BA. The partition coefficient of the A- form increased with Na+ concentration and total ionic strength, suggesting an ion-pair mechanism for its partition into 1-octanol. Lipophilicity was also assessed using reverse phase chromatography (C-18-HPLC), and a capacity factor (K') for ionized species was determined. Despite a broad correlation with the logP data, some BA behaved differently. The logP values showed that the order of lipophilicity was DCA greater than CDCA greater than UDCA greater than HDCA greater than HCA greater than CA greater than UCA for both the protonated and ionized unconjugated and glycine-amidate BA, while the K' data showed an inversion for some BA, i.e., DCA greater than CDCA greater than CA greater than HCA greater than UDCA greater than HDCA greater than UCA. The logP data fitted well with other indirect measurements of BA monomeric lipophilicity such as albumin binding or accessible total hydrophobic surface area data calculated by  minimization and molecular computer graphics. Differences between unconjugated and amidated BA are consistent with the presence of an amide bond and a lower pKa when pH dependence was studied. Capacity factors, on the other hand, were related to properties of BA micelles such as cholesterol-solubilizing capacity and membrane disruption, reflecting the BA detergency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179489>Comparison of diets enriched in stearic, oleic, and palmitic acids on inflammation, immune response, cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women-randomized crossover trial.</a></h2><p>Direct comparisons between SFAs varying in chain length, specifically palmitic  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0), relative to the latter's metabolic product, oleic  (18:1), on cardiometabolic risk factors are limited.The aim of this study was to determine the relative comparability of diets enriched in palmitic , stearic , and oleic  on inflammation and coagulation markers, T lymphocyte proliferation/ex-vivo cytokine secretion, plasma cardiometabolic risk factors, and fecal bile  concentrations.Hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women (n = 20, mean ± SD age 64 ± 7 y, BMI 26.4 ± 3.4 kg/m2, LDL cholesterol ≥ 2.8 mmol/L) were provided with each of 3 diets [55%  (%E) carbohydrate, 15%E protein, 30%E fat, with ∼50% fat contributed by palmitic , stearic , or oleic  in each diet; 5 wk/diet phase] using a randomized crossover design with 2-wk washouts between phases. Outcome measures were assessed at the end of each phase.Fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic  and oleic  diets than the palmitic  diet (all P < 0.01). Fasting HDL-cholesterol concentrations were lower after the stearic  diet than the palmitic  and oleic  diets (P < 0.01). The stearic  diet resulted in lower lithocholic  (P = 0.01) and total secondary bile  (SBA) concentrations (P = 0.04) than the oleic  diet. All other outcome measures were similar between diets. Lithocholic  concentrations were positively correlated with fasting LDL-cholesterol concentrations (r = 0.33; P = 0.011). Total SBA, lithocholic , and  concentrations were negatively correlated with fasting HDL cholesterol (r = -0.51 to -0.44; P < 0.01) concentrations and positively correlated with LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol (r = 0.37-0.54; P < 0.01) ratios.Dietary stearic  and oleic  had similar effects on fasting LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol concentrations and more favorable ones than palmitic . Unlike oleic , the hypocholesterolemic effect of stearic  may be mediated by inhibition of intestinal hydrophobic SBA synthesis.

This study measured the early changes in hepatocellular ions and energetics associated with such conditions.Twenty-five rats, prepared with a 23Na and 31P double-tuned nuclear magnetic resonance surface coil secured over the dome of the liver, were randomized into 5 groups: control, 10 and 20 minutes of total inflow ischemia, pancreatitis induced by  (DCA), and sham-DCA (saline injection). Dysprosium-TTHA3- solution was used to separate the intracellular and extracellular sodium peaks.In rat liver, 20 minutes of total inflow occlusion caused irreversible depletion of high- phosphates. Changes at 2 hours after the onset of DCA-pancreatitis are compared with changes after 20 minutes of ischemia (mean +/- SEM). Although the DCA-pancreatitis animals did not become hypotensive until 1 hour after the induction of pancreatitis, the changes in hepatic intracellular ions and energetics began soon after such an insult. At 2 hours after the onset of pancreatitis, hepatocellular pHi and [NA+]i were 6.99 +/- 0.16 and 78.4 +/- mmol/L, respectively (P < .01, compared with sham animals). A similar pattern of changes in hepatic bioenergetics also occurred. After the onset of pancreatitis, the hepatic cytostolic phosphorylation potential decreased with time (y = 0.654 - 0.004t, where t is time in minutes and r2 = 0.967 and the rate of hepatic hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate increased progressively (y = 0.702t + 91.363, where t is time in minutes and r2 = 0.969. These changes correlated well with the accumulated [Na]i.Unresuscitated necrotizing pancreatitis caused severe hepatocellular acidosis, profound sodium accumulation, and bioenergy depletion early in its course. These effects were as severe as those induced by total liver ischemia.

To test this hypothesis, 13 subjects with probable cholesterol gall stones ate refined and unrefined carbohydrate diets, each for six weeks in random order. On the refined carbohydrate diet, subjects ate more refined sugar (mean = SEM: 106 +/- 7 vs 6 +/- 1 g/day, p less than 0.001), less dietary fibre (13 +/- 1 vs 27 +/- 3 g/day, p less than 0.001), and had a higher  intake (9.17 +/- 0.66 vs 7.16 +/- 0.64 MJ/day, p less than 0.001). After each diet, the lipid composition of duodenal bile and bile  kinetics was determined. The cholesterol saturation index of bile was higher on the refined carbohydrate diet in all but one subject, with a mean value of 1.50 +/- 0.10 compared with 1.20 +/- 0.12 on the unrefined diet (p less than 0.005). On the refined carbohydrate diet, bile contained relatively less cholic  and slightly more . There were, however, no significant differences in total or individual bile  pool sizes. There were also no differences in the rates of primary bile  synthesis or fractional turnover on the two diets. Consumption of carbohydrate in refined form increases bile cholesterol saturation. The risk of gall stones might be reduced by avoidance of refined carbohydrate foods.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30964010>DOC-LS, a new liposome for dermal delivery, and its endocytosis by HaCaT and CCC-ESF-1 cells.</a></h2><p>The main objective of this work was to investigate the uptake channels of skin cells through which coumarin 6, transported by deoxycholate-mediated liposomes (DOC-LS), was internalised; this was also compared against the action of conventional LS.

The micellar solubilisation of AmB by a gemini lipoamino  (LAA) derived from cysteine and its equimolar mixtures with the bile salts sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC), as well as the aggregation sate of the drug in the micellar systems, was studied under biomimetic conditions (phosphate buffered-saline, pH 7.4) using UV-vis spectroscopy. Pure surfactant systems and equimolar mixtures were characterized by tensiometry and important parameters were determined, such as critical micelle concentration (CMC), surface tension at the CMC (γCMC), maximum surface excess concentration (Γmax), and minimum area occupied per molecule at the water/air interface (Amin). Rheological behaviour from viscosity measurements at different shear rates was also addressed. Solubilisation capacity was quantified in terms of molar solubilisation ratio (χ), micelle-water partition coefficient (KM) and Gibbs  of solubilisation (ΔGs°). Formulations of AmB in micellar media were compared in terms of drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, aggregation state of AmB and in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The LAA-containing micellar systems solubilise AmB in its monomeric and less toxic form and exhibit in vitro antifungal activity comparable to that of the commercial formulation Fungizone.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

P84, F127 and F108 in the absence and presence of bile salt sodium deoxycholate (SDC) has been studied. UV-Vis spectroscopy has been exploited to determine the solubilization capacity of the investigated micellar systems in terms of drug loading efficiency, average number of drug molecules solubilized per micelle (n), partition coefficient (P) and standard free  of solubilization (∆G). The morphological and structural changes taking place in pluronics in different concentration regimes of SDC and with the addition of drug CLZ has been explored using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. The SANS results revealed that aggregation behaviour of pluronic-SDC mixed micelles gets improved in the presence of drug. The micropolarity measurements have been performed to shed light on the locus of solubilization of the drug in pure and mixed micellar systems. The compatibility between CLZ and drug carriers (pluronics and SDC) was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. Among the investigated systems, P84-SDC mixed system was found to be highly efficient for CLZ loading. The long term stability data indicated that CLZ loaded P84-SDC mixed micellar formulation remained stable for 3months at room temperature. Further, it was revealed that the CLZ loaded P84-SDC mixed micelles are converted into CLZ loaded pure P84 micelles at 30-fold dilutions which remain stable up to 48-fold dilutions. The results from the present studies suggest that P84-SDC mixed micelles can serve as suitable delivery vehicles for hydrophobic drug CLZ.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The molecular mechanisms of this bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) are not yet clarified and no neuroprotective strategy is currently worldwide accepted. Here, we show that UCB, at conditions mimicking those of hyperbilirubinemic newborns (50 microM UCB in the presence of 100 muM human serum albumin), rapidly (within 1 h) inhibited cytochrome c oxidase activity and ascorbate-driven oxygen consumption in 3 days in vitro rat cortical neurons. This was accompanied by a bioenergetic and oxidative crisis, and apoptotic cell death, as judged by the collapse of the inner-mitochondrial membrane potential, increased glycolytic activity, superoxide anion radical production, and ATP release, as well as disruption of glutathione redox status. Furthermore, the antioxidant compound glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) fully abrogated UCB-induced cytochrome c oxidase inhibition and significantly prevented oxidative stress, metabolic alterations, and cell demise.

The added bile salt, sodium deoxycholate (NaDC), decreases the α-helicity in Hb (α-helix: 71.3% → 61.7% in the presence of 9.6 mM NaDC, and 83.2% → 66.2% in the presence of 14 mM NaDC, at pH 7.4 and 9.0, respectively), while a reverse pattern of modification in the Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra of Hb is found at pH 3.2. The -induced denatured Hb (pH 3.2) regains its structural integrity by changing conformation from a random coil to an α-helix rich secondary structure upon addition of NaDC (α-helix: 10.4% → 53.4%, β-sheet: 31.0% → 18.5% and random coil: 58.6% → 28.1%, in the presence of 0.65 mM NaDC). Also, a step-wise binding interaction pattern of Hb with NaDC was revealed at pH 7.4 and 9.0 upon variation of steady-state fluorescence intensity and average lifetime of Hb. From the fluorescence lifetime decay pattern, the decrement of  transfer from Trp to a heme group was found upon the addition of NaDC at pH 7.4 and 9.0. However, at pH 3.2, the modification of the time-resolved fluorescence decay behavior of Hb within NaDC is typically reversed, where the  transfer from Trp to heme is restored to some extent.

Purification was accomplished by solubilization of the membrane-associated enzyme with octylglucoside and chromatographic resolution on sequential DEAE cellulose and hydroxylapatite (HPLC) columns in the presence of octylglucoside. The partially purified enzyme, specific for the 2-deacylated plasmalogen, lysoplasmalogen (1-alk-1'-enyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or -ethanolamine), had no hydrolytic activity with intact plasmalogens or 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.

The Vmax values were 11.7 and 13.6 mumol/min per mg with the choline and ethanolamine substrates, respectively. The optimal pH range was between 6.6 and 7.1 with both substrates; the  of activation for the purified enzyme was 15,200 cal. The enzyme required no cofactors and was unaffected by low millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ or EDTA. It was inhibited by the sulfhydryl-reacting reagent, p-chloromercuribenzoate. Mono- or diradylglycerophospholipids or sphingomyelin did not affect the enzymic activity at 37 degrees C.

Osmotic water permeability (Pf) and urea permeability were measured in large unilamellar vesicles composed with egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) +/- cholesterol (Ch) or rat liver microsomal membranes by monitoring self-quenching of entrapped carboxyfluorescein (CF). Ammonia permeability was determined utilizing the pH dependence of CF fluorescence. Submicellar bile salt concentrations did not significantly alter Pf of EYPC +/- Ch or rat liver microsomal membranes. At taurodeoxycholate (TDC) or tauroursodeoxycholate concentrations approaching those that solubilized membrane lipids, CF leakage occurred from vesicles, but Pf remained unchanged. Higher bile salt concentrations (0.5-2 mM TDC) did not alter Pf of equimolar EYPC/Ch membranes. The activation  for transmembrane water flux was unchanged (12.1 +/- 1.2 kcal/mol for EYPC) despite the presence of bile salts in one or both membrane hemileaflets, suggesting strongly that bile salts do not form transmembrane pores that facilitate water flux. Furthermore, submicellar bile salt concentrations did not increase membrane permeability to urea or ammonia. We conclude that at submicellar concentrations, bile salts do not form nonselective convective channels that facilitate transmembrane transport of small uncharged molecules. These results suggest that bile salt-mediated transport of specific substrates, rather than nonselective enhancement of membrane permeability, underlies bile salt cytotoxicity for enterocytes and hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274506>Rationalization of dye uptake on titania slides for dye-sensitized solar cells by a combined chemometric and structural approach.</a></h2><p>A model photosensitizer (D5) for application in dye-sensitized solar cells has been studied by a combination of XRD, theoretical calculations, and spectroscopic/chemometric methods. The conformational stability and flexibility of D5 and molecular interactions between adjacent molecules were characterized to obtain the driving forces that govern D5 uptake and grafting and to infer the most likely arrangement of the molecules on the surface of TiO2. A spectroscopic/chemometric approach was then used to yield information about the correlations between three variables that govern the uptake itself: D5 concentration, dispersant (chenodeoxycholic ; CDCA) concentration, and contact time. The obtained regression model shows that large uptakes can be obtained at high D5 concentrations in the presence of CDCA with a long contact time, or in absence of CDCA if the contact time is short, which suggests how dye uptake and photovoltaic device preparation can be optimized.© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A clinical trial].</a></h2><p>Nearly 30% of the obese patients treated with hypoenergetic diets for weight reduction develop gallstone disease (GD). Until the present time, the use of ursodeoxycholic  (UDA) is the only available therapeutic measure to avoid the development of GD. Dietary fiber induce a bile  synthesis. A double-blind clinical trial was conducted to compare the effect of rational diet plus UDA vs a rational diet supplemented with Psyllium plantago (Pp) for the prevention of GD in obese subjects undergoing a weight-reduction diet. Patients with a body mass index (BMI = weight in Kg/square height in m) of 30 Kg/m2 or more and with normal gallbladder and biliary tree ultrasound (GBUS) were included. Weight-reduction diets were individually calculated for each patient according to their  expenditure (EE). Patients were randomly and blindly assigned either to group I (diet + 750 mg UDA + fiber placebo) or group II (diet + 15 g Pp+ UDA placebo). An anthropometric evaluation was performed to each patient before and after the two-month treatment, as well as resting EE by indirect calorimetry, GBUS and endoscopy for the determination of cholesterol crystals in duodenal bile. Weight reduction was similar in both groups (group I = 6 +/- 2 Kg vs group II = 6 +/- 3 Kg). GD development was observed in one patient of group I (5.5%) and two patients of group II (p > 0.05). All patients with GD lost a minimum of 4 Kg during the study period. GD development did not correlate with the presence of crystals in the duodenal bile at the beginning of the study. Our results suggest a beneficial effect of a rational diet with fiber supplementation to prevent GD development in obese patients included in a weight reduction program.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7979171>Early changes in  metabolism in rats exposed to an acute level of deoxycholate and fed a Nigerian-like diet.</a></h2><p>Early alterations in cellular  metabolism, reductive biosynthesis and enzymes related to cell proliferation were studied in 40 Wistar albino rats exposed to an acute level of deoxycholate (DOC), and fed different diets. The animals were divided into four equal groups and fed ad libitum either a normal diet (ND), a high-carbohydrate high-fibre (HCF) diet, or a high-protein high-fat (HPF) diet. Three times weekly intrarectal injection of 40 mg/0.2 ml DOC was given to three groups of the rats for 9 weeks. The specific activities of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were all significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the DOC-treated animals compared with the physiological saline-treated control. Reductive biosynthetic enzyme activities (malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase-NADP(+)-dependent, and ATP-citrate lyase) were reduced in the DOC-treated animals compared with the control. Feeding rats with the HCF diet significantly (p < 0.05) lowered the specific activities of the enzymes of glycolysis, of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative) and hyaluronidase and proteinase compared with those of the HPF-fed rats. These results show an altered enzymic profile in rats fed an HCF and an HPF diet compared with rats fed the ND and suggests a protective role of the HCF diet against the development of colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16242893>Ionization of unconjugated, glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of organic anions as spray liquid additives on the ionization efficiency of unconjugated, glycine-conjugated and taurine-conjugated bile acids under electrospray ionization conditions. Addition of organic acids influenced the ionization efficiency of whole bile acids. Use of a stronger  reduced the peak intensity of unconjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids, while the use of TFA, the strongest  tested, improved the intensity of taurine conjugates. The hydroxyl group at the C-12 alpha position of cholic  and  easily underwent intra-molecular hydrogen bonding with the side chain carboxyl group, accelerating the ionization efficiency.

The work was aimed at investigating the suitability of using P123 as bile salt sequestrant beside the fundamental aspects of PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymer-bile salt interactions. Various experimental techniques including dynamic and static light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed in combination with electrophoretic mobility measurements. The system was investigated at a constant P123 concentration of 1.74 mM and with varying bile salt concentrations up to approximately 250 mM NaGDC (or a molar ratio n(NaGDC)/n(P123) = 144). In the mixed P123-NaGDC solutions, the endothermic process related to the self-assembly of P123 was observed to gradually decrease in enthalpy and shift to higher temperatures upon progressive addition of NaGDC. To explain this effect, the formation of NaGDC micelles carrying partly dehydrated P123 unimers was proposed and translated into a stoichiometric model, which was able to fit the experimental DSC data. In the mixtures at low molar ratios, NaGDC monomers associated with the P123 micelle forming a charged "P123 micelle-NaGDC" complex with a dehydrated PPO core. These complexes disintegrated upon increasing NaGDC concentration to form small "NaGDC-P123" complexes visualized as bile salt micelles including one or a few P123 copolymer chains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646933>Current and upcoming pharmacotherapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Given the high prevalence and rising incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the absence of approved therapies is striking. Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Both dyes exhibit higher solar-to-electrical  conversion efficiency when compared to a commonly used N3 sensitizer under the same conditions. To examine the influence of the bulky ancillary ligands and alleviate the electron recombination in cells, we have developed a dual functioned truxene-based coadsorbent (MXD1) as an alternative candidate to chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). This coadsorbent not only effectively shields the back electron transfer from the TiO(2) to I(3)(-) ions but also enhances the light harvesting ability in the short wavelength regions. The photovoltaic performance of XS48-sensitized DSC was independent of the coadsorbents, while XS49 with large bulky ancillary ligand presented better performance when coadsorbent was employed. Interestingly, the simultaneous adsorption-to-sequential adsorption of XS48/49 and MXD1 has caused a notably improved photovoltage, which can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced dye adsorption and retardation of charge recombination. These results not only provide a new vision on how ancillary ligands affect the performance of ruthenium complexes but also open up a new way to achieve further efficiency enhancement of ruthenium complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18450744>Deoxycholate interacts with IpaD of Shigella flexneri in inducing the recruitment of IpaB to the type III secretion apparatus needle tip.</a></h2><p>Type III secretion (TTS) is an essential virulence function for Shigella flexneri that delivers effector proteins that are responsible for bacterial invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The Shigella TTS apparatus (TTSA) consists of a basal body that spans the bacterial inner and outer membranes and a needle exposed at the pathogen surface. At the distal end of the needle is a "tip complex" composed of invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD). IpaD not only regulates TTS, but is required for the recruitment and stable association of the translocator protein IpaB at the TTSA needle tip in the presence of deoxycholate or other bile salts. This phenomenon is not accompanied by induction of TTS or the recruitment of IpaC to the Shigella surface. We now show that IpaD specifically binds fluorescein-labeled deoxycholate and, based on  transfer measurements and docking simulations, this interaction appears to occur where the N-terminal domain of IpaD meets its central coiled-coil, a region that may also be involved in needle-tip interactions. TTS is initiated as a series of distinct steps and that small molecules present in the bacterial milieu are capable of inducing the first step of TSS through interactions with the needle tip protein IpaD. Furthermore, the amino acids proposed to be important for deoxycholate binding by IpaD appear to have significant roles in regulating tip complex composition and pathogen entry into host cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7590575>An aggressive protocol of ESWL and dissolution therapy of gallbladder stones.</a></h2><p>to assess the overall efficacy and which factors are independent predictors of success of ESWL and oral dissolution therapy of gallbladder stones using an aggressive protocol (high  shock waves -median 22 Kv- and allowance to up to 6 sessions with an electro-hydraulic lithotripter).inclusion criteria were 1) biliary pain; 2) 1 to 3 radiolucent stones or with slight calcification; 3) total stone volume under 15 cm3, equivalent to a single stone 3 cm diameter and 4) opacified cholecystography. Data was collected prospectively for 139 consecutive patients undergoing this treatment and the stone-free curves up to 12 months were analyzed as a function of age, sex, body-mass index, total stone volume, number of stones and the presence of slight calcification.patients underwent a mean of 2.6 sessions (range: 1-6) and 2834 shock waves (range: 589-8175). The global stone-free rate at 12 months was 54% (95% confidence interval: 45-64%). Factors that significantly -and adversely- influenced outcome were total stone volume (P < 0.001), number of stones (P = 0.005) and slight calcification (P = 0.038), using Cox's regression. Beyond significance, these three factors showed a marked effect on the stone-free curves.our data suggest that, even with this aggressive protocol, these factors are clearly detrimental. Thus, the results of our study agree with the current trend to restrict this combination therapy to patients with single, non-calcified stones with a small volume, or up to 2 cm diameter as is usually quoted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10903004>Review: low caloric intake and gall-bladder motor function.</a></h2><p>Cholelithiasis is the primary expression of obesity in the hepatobiliary system. In obese subjects the risk of developing gallstones is increased due to a higher cholesterol saturation of gall-bladder bile. During weight reduction with very low calorie diets (VLCD) the incidence of gallstones increases, but the mechanism for gallstone formation is not completely understood and several pathogenetic mechanisms have been suggested: increased saturation of bile, increased gall-bladder secretion of mucin and calcium, increased presence of prostaglandins and arachidonic . Alterations in gall-bladder motility may contribute to gallstone formation, but few studies have addressed the issue of gall-bladder motility during rapid weight loss and its possible role in gallstone formation. VLCD have been associated with a gall-bladder stasis, as a consequence of reduced gall-bladder stimulation by low fat content of the diets. A threshold quantity of fat (10 g) has been documented to obtain efficient gall-bladder emptying. Ursodeoxycholic  administered during VLCD seems to have a protective role in developing a biliary cholesterol crystals. Gall-bladder emptying was lower in response to low fat meals with respect to relative higher fat meals, before as well as during the VLCD. This may account the possibility of an adaptative response of the gall-bladder motility to a given diet regimen. Adequate fat content of the VLCD may prevent gallstone formation, maintaining adequate gall-bladder motility and may be more economic and physiologically acceptable than administration of a pharmacological agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8152242>An optimized method for determining cytochrome oxidase activity in brain tissue homogenates.</a></h2><p>We have developed a method to accurately and reproducibly determine the total activity of cytochrome oxidase (CO) in rat brain tissue homogenates. Previously, accurate measurements have been difficult to obtain because detergents, which are needed to disrupt membranes and unmask CO, also inhibit the enzyme by solubilizing certain phospholipids required for rapid turnover. We compared various methods of sample preparation, and found that maximal CO activity in homogenates could be obtained using specific concentrations of detergents. The range of optimal detergent concentrations was relatively narrow, as CO activity fell sharply with small deviations from the optimum. Of 5 detergents tested, deoxycholate stimulated CO maximally over the widest range of concentrations. In deoxycholate-treated homogenate samples, the calculated CO turnover number was about 480 s-1, indicating that overall enzyme activity was maximal or near maximal, and therefore that the total content of CO was probably detected. This method was reproducible with large or small samples (e.g., < 1 mg tissue), and should be applicable to studies of neural tissue in general.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21485524>[Effect of ursodeoxycholic  for reducing the deficit of vitamin D status and bone mineral density at gallstones].</a></h2><p>To study the effect of ursodeoxycholic  on vitamin D levels and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with gallstone disease (GSD).BMD assessed by dual- X-ray densitometry in 53 patients with gallstone disease, of whom 21 patients received litolitic therapy at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg for 1,5-2 years.

Viral titers strongly fluctuated depending upon concentration and chemical structure of the detergent as well as upon the dissolved organic content of the aqueous samples. Supplementation of the cellular monolayers with an additional amount of cell culture medium or with a nonionic detergent in a subcytotoxic concentration 48 h after inoculation partly induced cytopathic effects in silent dilution steps. Since, in the presence of the same detergent, viral recovery rates varied with the type of waste water, titer-conditioning activity of detergents was suggested to depend upon their effective critical micellization concentration. Especially for virus recovery from concentrated waste water, treatment with strongly disruptive detergents such as sodium dodecylsulfate revealed to be much more efficient than with the less hydrophilic sodium N-laurylsarcosine, sodium glycodeoxycholate or lauryldimethylamine-oxide, whereas the opposite seemed to be the case if virus recovery from filtrate samples were to be optimized. The mechanisms by which viral particles become infectious for the cell appear to be triggered by general principles of equilibrium thermodynamics, which means that interactions between viral surface proteins and cellular receptor molecules seem to reflect the tendency of these reagents to assume the energetically most favored orientation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8955384>Sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a bile  transporter from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708.</a></h2><p>Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 expresses inducible bile  7alpha-dehydroxylation activity via a multistep pathway. The genes encoding several of the inducible proteins involved in the pathway have been previously mapped to a bile -inducible (bai) operon in Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708. We now report the cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the baiG gene, which is part of the bai operon. The predicted amino  sequence of the BaiG polypeptide shows significant homology to several membrane transport proteins, including sugar and antibiotic resistance transporters, which are members of the major facilitator superfamily. Hydrophilicity plots of BaiG show a high degree of similarity to class K and L TetA proteins from gram-positive bacteria, and, like these classes of TetA proteins, BaiG has 14 proposed transmembrane domains. The baiG gene was cloned into Escherichia coli and shown to confer an -dependent bile  uptake activity. Primary bile acids were preferentially transported into E. coli cells expressing this gene, with at least sevenfold and fourfold increases in the uptake of cholic  and chenodeoxycholic , respectively, over control reactions. Less transport activity was observed with cholylglycine, 7-oxocholic , and . The transport activity was inhibited by the proton ionophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and nigericin but not by the potassium ionophore valinomycin, suggesting that the transport is driven by the proton motive force across the cell membrane. In summary, we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a bile -inducible bile  transporter from Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cloning and expression of a gene encoding a procaryotic bile  transporter.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3862909>Effect of different levels of dietary trans fat or corn oil on azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis in F344 rats.</a></h2><p>The effect of various levels of dietary corn oil or trans fat on azoxymethane (AOM; CAS: 25843-45-2)-induced carcinogenesis was investigated in female F344 rats fed the AIN-76 semipurified diets.

At 7 weeks of age, all animals except the vehicle-treated controls, were given sc injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body wt, once weekly) for 3 weeks. After 1 week, groups of animals were transferred to semipurified diets containing 13.6% corn oil and 23.5% corn oil or high-fat diets containing 5.9% corn oil plus 5.9% trans fat plus 11.8% Oleinate (low trans fat), 5.9% corn oil plus 11.8% trans fat plus 5.9% Oleinate (intermediate trans fat), and 5.9% corn oil plus 17.6% trans fat (high trans fat). Fecal bile acids were measured in vehicle-treated rats. All animals were necropsied 34 weeks after the last AOM injection. The animals fed the 23.5% corn oil diet had a higher incidence of colon tumors than did those in the groups fed the 5 and 13.6% corn oil diets. There was no difference in colon tumor incidence between the 5 and 13.6% corn oil diet groups. The animals fed the high-fat diets containing low trans fat, intermediate trans fat, and high trans fat developed significantly fewer liver and colon tumors and more small intestinal tumors than did the rats fed 23.5% corn oil diet.

Using an experimental model of biliary cirrhosis in the rat, we aimed to investigate changes in calcium transport at the jejunal and ileal levels. Two methods were used: 1) uptake of 45Ca in brush border membrane vesicles and 2) measurements of transepithelial fluxes of calcium in Ussing chambers. Thirty days postsurgery, cholestatic rats presented biliary cirrhosis, with normal growth, normal daily , and calcium intakes, but had depressed circulating levels of 25-(OH)-vitamin D2 and 1,25-(OH)-vitamin D3. Compared with sham-operated controls, 45Ca uptake ([Ca2+] = 0.03 mmol) measured in vesicles from cholestatic rats was decreased by 3-fold in the duodenojejunum, in concordance with a lower content in brush border membrane calmodulin. Other changes in brush border membrane composition included decreases in structural proteins, microvillous enzymes, and in triglyceride content. Transepithelial fluxes of calcium measured in the ileum ([Ca2+] = 1.2 mmol) revealed in controls a net basal secretion flux (Jnet = -30.4 +/- 8.1 mmol.h-1.cm-2) that was reduced by 3-fold (p < 0.05) in vitamin D-deficient rats (Jnet = -10.4 +/- 4.8 mmol.h-1.cm-2). In response to 25-(OH)-vitamin D2 treatment, calcium uptake rates increased by 40% in the jejunum, whereas in the ileum, the secretion flux returned to basal control levels. Oral administration of taurocholate or tauroursodeoxycholate (50 mmol) depressed almost completely calcium uptake capacity in the duodenojejunum. By complexing free calcium, tauroconjugated bile acids inhibited in vitro calcium uptake proportionally to their concentration in the medium (0-40 mmol). Our data indicate that, in rat biliary cirrhosis, transport capacity of calcium in the duodenojejunum is markedly reduced in association with vitamin D deficiency and alterations in brush border membrane composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15202934>The nuclear bile  receptor FXR is activated by PGC-1alpha in a ligand-dependent manner.</a></h2><p>The nuclear bile  receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor) is one of the key factors that suppress bile  biosynthesis in the liver. PGC-1alpha [PPARgamma (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma) co-activator-1alpha] is known to control  homoeostasis in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. We performed cell-based reporter assays using the expression system of a GAL4-FXR chimaera, the ligand-binding domain of FXR fused to the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4, to find the co-activators for FXR. We found that the transcriptional activation of a reporter plasmid by a GAL4-FXR chimaera was strongly enhanced by PGC-1alpha, in a ligand-dependent manner. Transcriptional activation of the SHP (small heterodimer partner) gene by the FXR-RXRalpha (retinoid X receptor alpha) heterodimer was also enhanced by PGC-1alpha in the presence of CDCA (chenodeoxycholic ). Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down studies using glutathione S-transferase-PGC-1alpha fusion proteins revealed that the ligand-binding domain of FXR binds PGC-1alpha in a ligand-influenced manner both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, our studies revealed that SHP represses its own transcription, and the addition of excess amounts of PGC-1alpha can overcome the inhibitory effect of SHP. These observations indicate that PGC-1alpha mediates the ligand-dependent activation of FXR and transcription of SHP gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1554723>Interaction of lysophospholipid/taurodeoxycholate submicellar aggregates with phospholipid bilayers.</a></h2><p>The equilibrium partitioning and the rate of transfer of monoacylphosphatidylethanolamines (lysoPEs) between phospholipid bilayers and lysoPE/taurodeoxycholate submicellar aggregates (SMAs) were examined with a series of environment-sensitive fluorescent-labeled N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1-monoacylphosphatidyletha nolamine (N-NBD-lysoPE) probes of differing acyl chain length. Our previous work has demonstrated the formation of SMAs between bile salts and lysophospholipids [Shoemaker & Nichols (1990) Biochemistry 29, 5837-5842]. The experiments in the current work demonstrate that SMAs can coexist with phospholipid vesicles and can function as shuttle carriers for the transfer of lysophospholipids between membranes. The formation of submicellar aggregates of N-NBD-lysoPE and taurodeoxycholate (TDC) in equilibrium with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles was determined from the increase in fluorescence generated upon addition of TDC to POPC vesicles containing 3 mol% N-NBD-lysoPE and 3 mol% N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (N-Rh-PE) as a nonextractable fluorescence -transfer quencher. The fraction of lysolipid extracted increased as a function of decreasing acyl chain length of the N-NBD-lysoPE molecule. The half-time for equilibration was independent of acyl chain length and averaged 44 ms at 10 degrees C. The delivery of N-NBD-lysoPE from preformed N-NBD-lysoPE/TDC SMAs into POPC vesicles containing the -transfer quencher N-Rh-PE was measured by the rate of fluorescence decline. The initial rate of insertion increased with decreasing acyl chain length of the N-NBD-lysoPE molecule and as a function of vesicle concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15368455>Quality of life in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>The impact of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is poorly documented. We assessed quality of life in a group of 276 unselected patients with PBC using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). This is a generic scale that assesses six major areas commonly associated with HRQOL. Data were compared with those of a sex- and age-matched control group. The associations between NHP scores and the severity of PBC were tested. Patients (86% women) had a median age of 62 years (range 33-87). Most patients were treated with UDCA. PBC patients showed a strong statistically significant difference in  compared to controls (respectively, 40.6 vs. 22.9, P < .0001) and had worse scores for emotional reactions (22.2 vs. 16.1, P < .005). No other differences were observed. No associations of the dimension subscores were found with biochemical liver tests, histological stages, or duration of the disease. Among the signs or symptoms, fatigue was the finding most often associated with the dimension subscores. In conclusion, patients with PBC feel that their overall quality of life is worse than that of the control population. This difference is mainly due to the decrease in the subscores of  and emotional reactions, both associated with fatigue. These effects must be taken into account by clinicians when treating these patients, as they constitute the clinical outcomes that have the most impact on patients' lifestyle and adherence to treatment.Copyright 2004 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30246935>Proteome Profiling by Label-Free Mass Spectrometry Reveals Differentiated Response of Campylobacter jejuni 81-176 to Sublethal Concentrations of Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are crucial components of the intestinal antimicrobial defense and represent a significant stress factor for enteric pathogens.

Concurrently, an induction of factors involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, protein folding, and bile  exporting efflux pumps is detected. Exposure to  and chenodeoxycholic  results in an increased expression of components of the more -efficient aerobic respiration pathway, while the anaerobic branches of the electron transport chain are down-expressed.The results show that C. jejuni has a differentiated system of adaptation to bile  stresses. The findings enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of campylobacteriosis, especially for survival of C. jejuni in the human intestine, and may provide clues to future medical treatment.© 2018 The Authors.

The observed  transfer may indicate weak interaction between the Ca2(+)-ATPase and proteolipid, but collisional  transfer definitely contributes. The  transfer was abolished by deoxycholate or sodium dodecylsulfate at concentrations sufficient to solubilize the membrane. In view of the low proteolipid content of sarcoplasmic reticulum and the weak interaction suggested by the  transfer, at best only a small fraction of ATPase molecules could exist in the form of ATPase-proteolipid complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047703>Higher fecal bile  hydrophobicity is associated with exacerbation of dextran sodium sulfate colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Increased luminal bile  hydrophobicity is associated with cytotoxicity and has been suggested to contribute to gut barrier dysfunction. The aim of this study was to compare 2 high-fat diets and a low-fat diet as to whether they modify fecal bile  profile and hydrophobicity and/or susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis in C57Bl/6J mice. Control and DSS-Control groups received a low-fat control diet [5.5% of total  (E%) soy oil, 4.5 E% lard], and the DSS-Lard (5.5 E% soy oil, 54.5 E% lard) and DSS-Fish oil (5.5 E% soy oil, 27.2 E% lard and 27.2% menhaden oil) groups received high-fat diets. Feces for bile  analysis were collected after 3-wk feeding, followed by induction of dextran DSS colitis (2 d 5% DSS in drinking water + 2 d tap water). Fecal bile  hydrophobicity was elevated 76% in the lard group (P = 0.051) and 122% in the fish oil group (P = 0.001) compared with control, indicating potentially increased cytotoxicity. DSS caused severe colitis symptoms, evaluated as rectal bleeding, whereas all the controls were symptom free. The median symptom scores were: DSS-Control, 2.3 (IQR = 0.6, 3.0); DSS-Lard, 0.3 (IQR = 0, 2.3); and DSS-Fish oil, 2.4 (IQR = 1.9, 2.8). The only differences were DSS-Control vs. control (P < 0.001) and DSS-Fish oil vs. control (P < 0.001). Severity of symptoms in all colitic mice was positively correlated with fecal bile  hydrophobicity (Spearman's ρ = 0.43; P = 0.028) and fecal  concentration (Spearman's ρ = 0.39; P = 0.048). These results suggest that luminal bile  modification, induced by altered dietary fat composition, may alter susceptibility to DSS colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8775472>Changes in biliary lipid secretion and cholic  kinetics induced by diet, diet plus simvastatin and diet plus ursodeoxycholic  in obese subjects.</a></h2><p>The aim of this work was to evaluate and compare the effects of a low calorie diet (1026 kcal), simvastatin and ursodeoxycholic  administration on biliary lipid secretion and cholic  kinetics in dieting obese subjects. We studied 6 obese subjects before and after four weeks of a hypocaloric diet alone, after four weeks of diet plus ursodeoxycholic  (900 mg/day) and after four weeks of diet plus simvastatin (40 mg/day), according to a Latin square design. The cholesterol saturation index was increased after diet alone, significantly reduced with diet plus ursodeoxycholic  (p < 0.01), and unchanged during simvastatin administration. While the cholesterol output was reduced by all three regimens, diet plus ursodeoxycholic  caused a significantly greater decrease than diet alone (p < 0.01). Cholic  synthesis and bile  secretion were decreased by diet and diet plus simvastatin (p < 0.05), but neither was affected by ursodeoxycholic . For cholic , all three treatments, but especially diet alone and diet plus simvastatin (p < 0.05), reduced the pool size; all three regimens also increased the turnover rate, but this was significant only for ursodeoxycholic  (p < 0.01). Our study shows that, in obese patients, a hypocaloric diet reduces cholesterol-holding biliary lipid output and consequently increases the cholesterol saturation index. The addition of simvastatin to a hypocaloric dietary regimen reduces cholesterol secretion, but without variation in bile  and phospholipid output thus the cholesterol saturation index remains unchanged. When ursodeoxycholic  is added to the dietary regimen, it reduces cholesterol secretion, while maintaining bile  output and, thus, lowers the cholesterol saturation index. Unlike simvastatin, ursodeoxycholic  prevents the drop in cholic  synthesis induced by a low calorie diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2161613>Low vs high dietary fiber and serum, biliary, and fecal lipids in middle-aged men.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol metabolism was studied in 34 50-y-old men at home on high and low mixed-fiber diets. The high-fiber diet increased fiber intake (26.2 vs 11.6 g/d) and decreased slightly but significantly total , carbohydrate, and protein intakes and serum total, low-density-lipoprotein, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol values with no effect on dietary cholesterol and fat composition or body weight. Biliary molar lipid percentages were unaffected but  was increased and chenodeoxycholic  was decreased by the high-fiber diet. The high-fiber diet changed cholesterol absorption and fecal output of neutral and total sterols nonsignificantly but increased fecal bile acids by 13% (p less than 0.05) and reduced bacterial conversion of fecal sterols to secondary products. The decreased serum cholesterol concentration was probably caused by enhanced fecal output of cholesterol as bile acids resulting in enhanced cholesterol synthesis as indicated by an increased serum concentration of a cholesterol precursor, lathosterol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20222991>NPC1L1 inhibitor ezetimibe is a reliable therapeutic agent for non-obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>We recently examined the distribution of abdominal fat, dietary intake and biochemical data in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and found that non-obese NAFLD patients did not necessarily exhibit insulin resistance and/or dysregulated secretion of adipocytokines. However, dietary cholesterol intake was superabundant in non-obese patients compared with obese patients, although total  and carbohydrate intake was not excessive. Therefore, excess cholesterol intake appears to be one of the main factors associated with NAFLD development and liver injury.We reviewed a year of follow-up data of non-obese NAFLD patients treated with Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 inhibitor ezetimibe to evaluate its therapeutic effect on clinical parameters related to NAFLD. Without any dietary or exercise modification, 10 mg/day of ezetimibe was given to 8 patients. In 4 of 8 patients, ezetimibe was administered initially. In the remaining 4 patients, medication was switched from ursodeoxycholic  to ezetimibe.In each patient, body mass index was maintained under 25 kg/m2 during the observation period. Serum ALT levels significantly decreased within 6 months and in 4 patients levels reached the normal range (<30 U/L), which was accompanied with at least a 10% decrease in serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. However, ultrasonographic findings of fatty liver did not show obvious improvement for a year.We conclude that the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe can suppress hepatic injury in non-obese patients with NAFLD and that ezetimibe may offer a novel treatment for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2775763>Topo-dynamic characteristics of human plasma VLDL apolipoproteins and efficiency of triacylglycerol hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase.</a></h2><p>A lower accessibility to water-soluble quenchers of tryptophanyls of VLDL apolipoproteins B, E, C as compared to LDL apoB chromophores has been detected by a fluorescence quenching technique. The dynamic behaviour of the tryptophanyls of VLDL amphipathic apolipoproteins E and C did not change in the presence of a detergent, Tween-20, at sub-lytic concentrations. However, a reversible structural transition registered by the 'red' shift of the emission spectrum maximum and the changes in the quenching pattern by I- occurred under these conditions. The increase in the VLDL tryptophanyl accessibility to acrylamide and the decrease in the quenching constant were observed at partial and complete solubilization of the VLDL particles by the detergent. Dissociation of apolipoproteins from VLDL occurred after their treatment with Tween-20 or lipoprotein lipase isolated from bovine milk, and the tryptophanyl population not participating in fluorescence  transfer on lipid phase-localized fluorescent probe pyrene appeared. In the presence of Tween-20, the relative affinity of apoE for the lipid matrix of VLDL was lower than that of apoC. Besides, the uncompetitive mode of inhibition of the LPL activity by apoC-III has been demonstrated. It is suggested that: (1) the amphipathic apolipoproteins E and C are organized as clusters on the VLDL surface and/or partially shielded by apolipoprotein B: (2) self-regulation of lypolysis may exist involving detergent-like reaction product accumulation and changes in relative apolipoprotein contents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2554715>Shift from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet: influence on acidic lipids in fecal water--a potential risk factor for colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Although there have recently been reports in the literature indicating that vegetarian-type diets are protective against the development of human colon cancer, this is still far from clear. It was also recently indicated that the concentration of acidic lipids in the aqueous phase of stool constitutes a risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Thus, we examined the effect of a change from a mixed to a lactovegetarian diet on this fecal variable. The dietary change caused a decrease in the total concentration of soluble fecal fatty acids (4310 +/- 3020 to 1080 +/- 1040 mumol/L, p less than 0.05) and  (125 +/- 42 to 73 +/- 35 mumol/L, p less than 0.05). However, there was no change in either the total bile  concentration in (164 +/- 54 to 107 +/- 41 mumol/L) or the cellular toxicity of (0.94 +/- 0.55 to 1.60 +/- 0.63 mumol/L, relative survival) the aqueous phase of stool. Thus, the consumption of a lactovegetarian diet may reduce certain risk factors of potential significance in colon carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2807060>[Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy of gallstones].</a></h2><p>We performed 16 extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsies (ESWL) to fragment gallstones in 11 women and 2 men, aged 19 to 57 (mean 41 +/- 10) years, during the past 10 months. Criteria for selection included a history of biliary colic, not more than 3 stones with a total diameter of not more than 30 mm, and a functioning gallbladder. 210 patients were examined, of whom 98 were referred for additional screening by combined ultrasonography and oral cholecystography. This resulted in rejection of another 71 patients due to multiple stones (38%), nonfunctioning gallbladder (22%), calcified stones (12%), stones not visualized in the prone position (9%), excessively large stones (3%) and other reasons (16%). Only 27 patients fulfilled all the criteria. Under epidural or general anesthesia (11 and 2 patients, respectively), we administered 1200-3500 (mean 2250 +/- 750) shock waves at 20-24 KV with the Tripter X1 (Direx, Israel-USA). This is an ultrasound-guided, modular portable, shock-wave generator utilizing underwater high  spark discharge. Chenodeoxycholic or ursodeoxycholic , 10 mg/kg/day, was started 1 week prior to ESWL and continued for 3 months after disappearance of fragments and debris. We encountered skin petechiae in all patients, transient hematuria in 8, mild biliary colic in 1 and a small liver hematoma in 1. To date, 3 patients are free of stones, while in 7 only sludge and tiny fragments are present which we expect to disappear as a result of the litholytic therapy. 3 patients had fragments larger than 5 mm and required a second ESWL. Thus ESWL, which was indicated in only 13% of screened patients, proved to be safe and can be expected to be successful in 75% of selected candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2050752>The effect of bile salts on the permeability and ultrastructure of the perfused, -depleted, rat blood-brain barrier.</a></h2><p>The action of bile salts upon the rat blood-brain barrier (BBB) was assessed in the absence of -yielding metabolism. Brains were perfused in situ with a Ringer solution for 5 min followed by a 1 min perfusion containing either sodium deoxycholate (DOC), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), or Ringer/DNP. The integrity of the BBB was then determined by perfusing with the radiotracer [14C]mannitol for 2.5 min. Alternatively, the brains were perfusion fixed for ultrastructural assessment. At 0.2 mM DOC, the BBB remained intact and the cerebral ultrastructure was similar to the controls. At 1 mM and above, disruption of the BBB became evident. At 2 mM, the cerebral cortex became severely vacuolated, with damaged endothelium and collapsed capillaries. With TCDC, BBB disruption occurred at 0.2 mM without any apparent ultrastructural damage to the microvasculature. Following 2 mM TCDC, similar, but less widespread, structural changes to the 2 mM DOC-perfused animals was apparent. Opening of the BBB occurred at a concentration lower than that required to cause lysis of either red blood cells or cultured cerebral endothelial cells. It is proposed that the effect of bile salts at concentrations of 1.5 mM and above is largely due to their lytic action as strong detergents on endothelial cell membranes, but that at lower concentrations a more subtle modification of the BBB occurs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26235421>The Bile  Chenodeoxycholic  Increases Human Brown Adipose Tissue Activity.</a></h2><p>The interest in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a target to combat metabolic disease has recently been renewed with the discovery of functional BAT in humans. In rodents, BAT can be activated by bile acids, which activate type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) in BAT via the G-coupled protein receptor TGR5, resulting in increased oxygen consumption and  expenditure. Here we examined the effects of oral supplementation of the bile  chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on human BAT activity. Treatment of 12 healthy female subjects with CDCA for 2 days resulted in increased BAT activity. Whole-body  expenditure was also increased upon CDCA treatment. In vitro treatment of primary human brown adipocytes derived with CDCA or specific TGR5 agonists increased mitochondrial uncoupling and D2 expression, an effect that was absent in human primary white adipocytes. These findings identify bile acids as a target to activate BAT in humans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Animals fed a 8% protein diet (LP) for 4, 8 and 12 wk had a significantly lower bile flow and a lower biliary bile  and protein secretion rate compared with rats fed a 26% protein (normal) diet (NP). The bile -independent fraction of bile flow was significantly increased. The slope of the regression line to zero bile  was markedly smaller in the LP than in the NP group, indicating lower bile -dependent bile flow. Biliary phospholipid and cholesterol secretion rates were significantly higher in the LP than in the NP group, demonstrating an uncoupling between bile  and lipid secretion at the low rates of bile  secretion. The percentage increase for these parameters was of similar magnitude (30%). Absolute concentrations of bile , phospholipid and cholesterol were significantly higher in LP-fed rats than in NP rats, while relative concentration of bile  was lower and those of cholesterol and phospholipid were higher. Analysis of biliary bile acids showed that the percent contribution of chenodeoxycholic  and of  increased significantly in the LP-fed rats, while that of cholic  decreased. These data indicate that the lower bile flow in the rats fed LP can be attributed to lower bile salt-dependent flow associated with significantly lower choleretic potency of bile acids secreted.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669471>Integrating 16S rRNA Sequencing and LC⁻MS-Based Metabolomics to Evaluate the Effects of Live Yeast on Rumen Function in Beef Cattle.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of live yeast on ruminal bacterial diversity and metabolome of beef steer. Eight rumen-cannulated Holstein steers were assigned randomly to one of two treatment sequences in a study with two 25-d experimental periods and a crossover design. The steers were housed in individual pens. The dietary treatments were control (CON) or yeast (YEA; CON plus 15 g/d of live yeast product). Bacterial diversity was examined by sequencing the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The metabolome analysis was performed using a liquid chromatograph and a mass spectrometry system (LC⁻MS). Live yeast supplementation increased the relative abundance of eight cellulolytic bacterial genera as well as  and . , , and  were not detected in the YEA treatment. Live yeast supplementation increased the concentrations of 4-cyclohexanedione and glucopyranoside and decreased the concentrations of threonic , xanthosine, , lauroylcarnitine, methoxybenzoic , and pentadecylbenzoic . The  BS11,  R-7, and  showed positive correlations with the metabolites involved in amino  biosynthesis and the metabolism of  substrates; the functions of these bacteria are not fully understood in relation to the mode of action of yeast. This study confirms the usefulness of LC⁻MS-based metabolomics in deciphering the mode of action of live yeast in the rumen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17978759>Membranolytic activity of bile salts: influence of biological membrane properties and composition.</a></h2><p>The two main steps of the membranolytic activity of detergents: 1) the partitioning of detergent molecules in the membrane and 2) the solubilisation of the membrane are systematically investigated. The interactions of two bile salt molecules, sodium cholate (NaC) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) with biological phospholipid model membranes are considered. The membranolytic activity is analysed as a function of the hydrophobicity of the bile salt, ionic strength, temperature, membrane phase properties, membrane surface charge and composition of the acyl chains of the lipids. The results are derived from calorimetric measurements (ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry). A thermodynamic model is described, taking into consideration electrostatic interactions, which is used for the calculation of the partition coefficient as well as to derive the complete thermodynamic parameters describing the interaction of detergents with biological membranes (change in enthalpy, change in free , change in entropy etc). The solubilisation properties are described in a so-called vesicle-to-micelle phase transition diagram. The obtained results are supplemented and confirmed by data obtained from other biophysical techniques (DSC differential scanning calorimetry, DLS dynamic light scattering, SANS small angle neutron scattering).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6286288>Age-related differences in the response of hepatic microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase to triiodothyronine and triamcinolone in the rat.</a></h2><p>A previous report from this laboratory demonstrated age-related differences in the hormonal regulation of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase). A detailed kinetic analysis of G-6-Pase activity has been performed to distinguish between effects on the microsomal carrier for glucose-6-phosphate and those on the enzyme itself. The maximum velocity (Vmax) was determined in untreated microsomes and microsomes treated with sodium deoxycholate (DOC); the Vmax of the enzyme (VE) was equal to the Vmax in the presence of DOC, and the Vmax of the carrier (VT) was calculated from the Vmax of untreated microsomes and the latency (the activity of DOC-treated microsomes not expressed by the intact preparation). The age-related decrease in G-6-Pase activity was caused by a decrease in the VE. In 3-month-old rats, the VE was increased 2,5-fold by treatment with T3, whereas triamcinolone or the two hormones in combination caused little effect; in 24-month-old animals, the VE was increased 10-fold by T3 and 2-fold by either triamcinolone or the two hormones in combination. In contrast, in 3-month-old animals, the VT was increased 2-fold by triamcinolone, 1.5-fold by T3, and 2-fold by the two hormones in combination; in 24-month-old animals, the VT was increased 3.5-fold by triamcinolone, was not affected by T3, and was increased 1.5-fold by the two hormones in combination. These differences could not be explained by changes in the response of isolated microsomes to sodium deoxycholate or by effects on the  of activation of G-6-Pase. The results provide detailed evidence for an altered response to either T3 or triamcinolone in hepatocytes from old animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634226>Reduction of Hypothalamic Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Activates Browning of White Fat and Ameliorates Obesity.</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on  balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18048926>VmeAB, an RND-type multidrug efflux transporter in Vibrio parahaemolyticus.</a></h2><p>Genes vmeA and vmeB, encoding a multidrug efflux transporter in the halophilic bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus, have been cloned using a drug-hypersusceptible Escherichia coli strain as the host. Cells of E. coli KAM33 (DeltaacrAB DeltaydhE) carrying the vmeAB region from V. parahaemolyticus conferred much higher MICs for a variety of antimicrobial agents than did control cells. Cells possessing VmeAB under energized conditions maintained very low intracellular concentrations of ethidium. This was as expected for an -dependent efflux system, and supports the notion--based on sequence homology--that VmeAB belongs to the resistance nodulation cell division (RND) family of multidrug efflux transporters. It is likely that VmeAB forms functional complexes with the outer-membrane protein TolC in E. coli, because introduction of vmeAB into cells of E. coli KAM43, which lacks the tolC gene, failed to elevate the MICs for any of the antimicrobial agents tested. Therefore, a V. parahaemolyticus homologue of tolC was also cloned, designated vpoC, and was introduced together with vmeAB into cells of E. coli KAM43. The MICs of all agents tested were raised and were comparable to the values observed in E. coli KAM33 harbouring a plasmid carrying vmeAB. Finally, a vmeAB-deficient mutant of V. parahaemolyticus was constructed (designated TM3). TM3 showed slightly higher susceptibility than the parental V. parahaemolyticus to some antimicrobial agents. Survival rate of the TM3 when exposed to deoxycholate decreased compared with that of the parent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21126091>Conformational changes in IpaD from Shigella flexneri upon binding bile salts provide insight into the second step of type III secretion.</a></h2><p>Shigella flexneri uses its type III secretion apparatus (TTSA) to inject host-altering proteins into targeted eukaryotic cells. The TTSA is composed of a basal body and an exposed needle with invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) forming a tip complex that controls secretion. The bile salt deoxycholate (DOC) stimulates recruitment of the translocator protein IpaB into the maturing TTSA needle tip complex. This process appears to be triggered by a direct interaction between DOC and IpaD. Fluorescence spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy are used here to confirm the DOC-IpaD interaction and to reveal that IpaD conformational changes upon DOC binding trigger the appearance of IpaB at the needle tip. Förster resonance  transfer between specific sites on IpaD was used here to identify changes in distances between IpaD domains as a result of DOC binding. To further explore the effects of DOC binding on IpaD structure, NMR chemical shift mapping was employed. The environments of residues within the proposed DOC binding site and additional residues within the "distal" globular domain were perturbed upon DOC binding, further indicating that conformational changes occur within IpaD upon DOC binding. These events are proposed to be responsible for the recruitment of IpaB at the TTSA needle tip. Mutation analyses combined with additional spectroscopic analyses confirm that conformational changes in IpaD induced by DOC binding contribute to the recruitment of IpaB to the S. flexneri TTSA needle tip. These findings lay the foundation for determining how environmental factors promote TTSA needle tip maturation prior to host cell contact.</p></html>
