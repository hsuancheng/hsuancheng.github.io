The association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and hepatocyte  disorders prompted us to characterize ER stress-induced hepatic metabolic dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hiPSC-Hep), to explore regulatory pathways and validate a phenotypic  model for progression of liver steatosis. We treated hiPSC-Hep with a ratio of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in the presence of an inducer of ER stress to synergistically promote triglyceride accumulation and dysregulate . We monitored  accumulation by high-content imaging and measured gene regulation by RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses. Our results show that ER stress potentiated intracellular  accumulation by 5-fold in hiPSC-Hep in the absence of apoptosis. Transcriptome pathway analysis identified ER stress pathways as the most significantly dysregulated of all pathways affected. Obeticholic  dose dependently inhibited  accumulation and modulated gene expression downstream of the farnesoid X receptor. We were able to identify modulation of hepatic markers and gene pathways known to be involved in steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), in support of a hiPSC-Hep disease model that is relevant to clinical data for human NASH. Our results show that the model can serve as a translational discovery platform for the understanding of molecular pathways involved in NAFLD, and can facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic molecules based on high-throughput screening strategies.© 2018.

Secondary bile acids produced by intestinal bacteria are ligands for specific nuclear receptors, which regulate glucose, , and drug  in the liver. The present study aimed to clarify the effect of changes in secondary bile acids caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on the host physiology, especially glucose, , and drug . After oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics for 5 days, decreased amounts of secondary bile -producing bacteria in faeces and a reduction in secondary bile  [lithocholic  (LCA) and  (DCA)] levels in the liver were observed. Serum glucose and triglyceride levels were also decreased, and these decreases were reversed by LCA and DCA supplementation. Quantitative proteomics demonstrated that the expression levels of proteins involved in glycogen , cholesterol, bile  biosynthesis, and drug  (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a25, and Cyp51a1) were altered in the liver in dysbiosis, and these changes were reversed by LCA and DCA supplementation.

However, the exact role of FXR in diabetes remains to be fully elucidated. The present study examined the effects of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an agonist of FXR, on  profile in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Male Wistar rats (8‑week‑old; n=40) were randomized into the following four groups (n=10): Untreated control, CDCA‑treated, T2DM, and CDCA‑treated T2DM. To establish the T2DM model, the rats were fed a high‑ diet (HFD) for 4 weeks and received a single low‑dose intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg), followed by an additional 4 weeks of HFD feeding. CDCA was administrated (10 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally for 10 days. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays were performed to determine the RNA and protein expression of FXR, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, G6Pase, proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1 and short heterodimer partner in rat liver tissue. The results revealed that FXR activation by CDCA did not reduce body weight, but it lowered the plasma levels of fasting glucose, insulin and triglycerides in the T2DM rats. CDCA administration reversed the downregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of FXR in the T2DM rat liver tissue samples. Furthermore, treatment with CDCA reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose 6‑phosphatase and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1 in the liver tissue samples of the T2DM rats. By contrast, CDCA treatment increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of short heterodimer partner in the liver tissue samples of the T2DM rats. In conclusion, FXR agonist treatment induces beneficial effects on  in the rat T2DM model. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the FXR agonist may be useful for the treatment of T2DM and hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic   by gut microbes and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated .

Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract NASH development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, , and gallbladder bile  profile. WDS2 gained significantly less weight than WD. Liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic  and β-muricholic . Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of SLE against WD induced NASH that is related to less inflammation and oxidative stress, a preserved glucose tolerance, and less hepatotoxic bile  profile.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579441>Bile acids and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 in hepatic .</a></h2><p>The liver is the central organ involved in .

Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression.

We analyzed the chemical composition and quantified the prebiotic activity score and selected carbohydrates; we also determined the water holding (WHC), oil holding (OHC), cation exchange capacities, bile  binding, and glucose dialysis retardation (GDR) of the solid fraction and the antioxidative and α-amylase inhibitory capacities (AIC) of the ethanolic extract. Refiner contained 7.7% , 7.08% protein and a relatively high phytate content; it had a high prebiotic activity score and possessed the highest binding capacity with . Siever contained high levels of low molecular weight carbohydrates and total tannin but relatively low crude fiber and cellulose contents. It had the highest binding with chenodeoxycholic  (74.8%), and exhibited the highest 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity. Decanter was rich in cellulose and had a high prebiotic activity score. The WHC and OHC values of decanter were within a narrow range and also exhibited the highest binding with cholic  (86.6%), and the highest values of GDR and AIC. The refiner waste could be included in animal feed but requires further processing to reduce the high phytate levels. All three guava byproducts had the potential to be a source of antioxidant dietary fiber (DF), a finding that warrants further in vivo study.To differing extents, the guava byproducts exhibited useful physicochemical binding properties and so possessed the potential for health-promoting activity. These byproducts could also be upgraded to other marketable products so the manufacturers of processed guava might be able to develop their businesses sustainably by making better use of them.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846919>Intestinal bile  receptors are key regulators of glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>In addition to their well-known function as dietary  detergents, bile acids have emerged as important signalling molecules that regulate energy homeostasis.

Herein, we aimed to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of UDCA-LPE on pro-fibrogenic integrin signalling. UDCA-LPE treatment of human embryonic liver cell line CL48 and primary human hepatic stellate cells induced a non-classical internalization of integrin β1 resulting in dephosphorylation and inhibition of SRC and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Signalling analyses suggested that UDCA-LPE may act as a heterobivalent ligand for integrins and lysophospholipid receptor1 (LPAR1) and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the bridging effect of UDCA-LPE on integrin β1 and LPAR1.

Although, FXR is expressed in male reproductive tissue, the relevance of the receptor on reproduction is scarcely known. Here, we demonstrated the FXR presence and its action on several human sperm features. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays evidenced the FXR expression in human spermatozoa and the localisation in the middle piece. CDCA increasing concentrations and GW4064, synthetic ligand of FXR, were used to study the FXR influence on sperm motility, survival, capacitation, acrosome reaction and on glucose as well as lipid . Interestingly, our data showed that increasing concentrations of CDCA negatively affected sperm parameters, while the receptor blockage by (Z)-Guggulsterone and by the anti-FXR Ab reversed the effects. Intriguingly, elevated CDCA levels increased triglyceride content, while lipase and G6PDH activities were reduced with respect to untreated samples, thus impeding the  reprogramming typical of the capacitated sperm. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated for the first time a novel target for FXR and that the activated receptor alters the acquisition of sperm fertilising ability. We showed that sperm itself express the FXR and it is responsive to specific ligands of the receptor; therefore, bile acids influence this cell both in male and in female genital tracts.

Intracellular  droplet dispersion and glycerin content in culture media were determined to evaluate the effect of TUDCA on TNF‑α‑induced lipolysis in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Western blotting was performed to detect protein expression levels of perilipin‑A and protein markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress: Immunoglobulin‑binding protein (BiP), inositol‑requiring enzyme (IRE), c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated (p)‑IRE and p‑JNK.

Glycerin content was reduced significantly and dispersal of  droplets reduced following pretreatment of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with 1 mmol/l TUDCA. TNF‑α additionally activated the expression of BiP, p‑IRE and p‑JNK in a time‑dependent manner; following pretreatment of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with 1 mmol/l TUDCA, the expression levels of these three proteins decreased.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a newly emerging pharmaceutical target and FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate cholestasis and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of obeticholic  (OCA) treatment in preventing SBS-ALDs.Piglets underwent 75% small-bowel resection (SBS) or sham surgery (sham) and were assigned to either a daily dose of OCA (2.4 mg/kg/day) or were untreated. Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool  and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced  malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs.

However, detecting dynamic changes in FFA uptake by the liver in live model organisms has proven difficult. To enable noninvasive real-time imaging of FFA flux in the liver, we generated transgenic mice with liver-specific expression of luciferase and performed bioluminescence imaging with an FFA probe. Our approach enabled us to observe the changes in FFA hepatic uptake under different physiological conditions in live animals. By using this method, we detected a decrease in FFA accumulation in the liver after mice were given injections of  and an increase after they were fed fenofibrate. In addition, we observed diurnal regulation of FFA hepatic uptake in living mice.

We fed wild-type (WT) and FXR KO mice a MCD diet (model of steatohepatitis) and found that Chop mRNA expression is upregulated in WT but not FXR KO mice. The absence of FXR aggravates hepatic inflammation after MCD feeding. In HepG2 cells, we found that Chop expression is regulated in a FXR/Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-dependent manner.

To allow in-depth investigation of functions of bile salts in healthy and diseased liver, the spatial distribution of bile salt species within the liver needs to be studied. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine hepatic bile salt distribution and identify specific  markers that define the structural elements of the liver. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to monitor the spatial distribution of bile salts and lipids in liver sections of rat, dog, and patients with unaffected and cholestatic parenchyma. MALDI-MSI in negative ion mode showed the local presence of a variety of bile salts, predominantly taurine-conjugates, as localized patches of varying sizes (representing the bile ducts) throughout the liver tissue. Specific molecular markers were identified for the connective tissue (phosphatidic acids, e.g., [PA (18:0_18:1)-H]), the liver parenchyma (phosphatidylinositols, e.g., [PI (18:0_20:4)-H]), and the bile ducts (hydroxylated-sulfatides, e.g., [ST-OH (18:1_24:0)-H]). One of these sulfatides (at m/ z 906.6339) was found to be uniquely localized in a thin lining on the inside of the bile duct, colocalized with cytokeratins, and encased luminal bile salts. A similar distribution of the aforementioned sulfatide was observed, albeit in constricted ductular structures, in the liver of a patient with a mild clinical phenotype of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In contrast, sulfatides were virtually absent in the liver of patients with PSC and a severe clinical phenotype, with (atypical) cholanoids (e.g., the bile alcohol 5-cyprinolsulfate) abundant in the extra-ductular space and glyco(cheno)-3-sulfate localized to fibrotic connective tissue. The latter two molecular species were able to discriminate between healthy liver tissue ( n = 3) and tissue from PSC patients with a severe clinical phenotype ( n = 3). In conclusion, the distinct structural elements of the mammalian liver are characterized by specific classes of lipids. We propose that (hydroxylated-)sulfatides are specific molecular markers of the bile duct.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut microbiota and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human  through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis,  oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile   and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk.

UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic .To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an oleic  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA,  accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited  accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD.

Two phase I studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of repeated oral doses of 5, 10 or 25 mg OCA on  variables after 14 or 20 days of consecutive administration in 68 healthy adults. Changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were examined, in addition to nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of particle sizes and sub-fraction concentrations. OCA elicited changes in circulating cholesterol and particle size of LDL and HDL. OCA decreased HDL cholesterol and increased LDL cholesterol, independently of dose. HDL particle concentrations declined as a result of a reduction in medium and small HDL. Total LDL particle concentrations increased because of an increase in large LDL particles.

Bile acids (BAs) bind to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), which are involved in  and glucose  and energy expenditure. The present study aimed to determine associations between the circulating BAs and the skeletal muscle volume (SMV), and  and glucose  in patients with NAFLD. Methods Serum BAs and metabolic parameters were measured in 55 patients with NAFLD (median age, 55 years). The changes (Δ) in serum BA (ΔBA) and metabolic parameters were determined in 17 patients (male, n=10; female, n=7) who received nutritional counseling for 12 months. Results Spearman's test revealed that the levels of 12α-hydroxysterol (12α-OH) BAs, including  (DCA), were inversely correlated with the SMV of the upper and lower limbs and the total SMV. A multivariate analysis revealed that the level of DCA was correlated with a reduced total SMV, whereas non-12α-OH BAs, including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), were correlated with an increased SMV of the lower limbs. Changes in CDCA were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs, and inversely correlated with the Δwaist-hip ratio and Δtotal cholesterol. Changes in the total non-12α-OH BA level were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs. Conclusion Circulating BAs were associated with SMV. The 12α-OH BAs, including DCA were associated with reduced SMV levels, whereas non-12α-OH BAs including CDCA were associated with increased SMV levels.

They are important in pharmaceutical studies as modulators of the transport-permeability of drugs or as ligands for certain receptors. For the rational application of bile salts in medicine, it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of their aggregation capabilities (which determine their membranotoxicity and solubilization capacity). From the examination of bile salt derivatives, the in plane of lnk (RPHPLC) and micelle aggregation number n, as well as the anion of 7-oxodeoxycholic  (7-OxD) and anion of cholic  (C), are considered to be outliers, related to linear hydrophobic congeneric groups, which means that their micelles, in addition to being determined by hydrophobic interactions, are determined by hydrogen bonds, i.e., they form micelles with higher aggregation numbers than would be expected from the hydrophobicity of their steroid skeleton. For bile salts of the normal series in the formation of hydrogen bonds in secondary micelles, the crucial structural elements of the steroid skeleton are: α-equatorial-C3-OH group and α-axial-C12-OH group. Bile salts of the allo series, including allocholic (aC), allodeoxycholic (aDC) and allochenodeoxycholic  (aCD), belong to the linear hydrophobic congeneric group. Their micelles are determined by hydrophobic interactions. It is assumed that for the analyzed allo derivatives, the A ring of the steroid skeleton is in the twisted boat conformation, which explains the spatial sheltering of their C3-OH group in micelles.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Injection of a formula comprising phosphatidylcholine (PPC) and deoxycholate (DC) has emerged as an alternative to liposuction in the reduction of local  deposits. However, the formula component mainly responsible for this effect and the mechanism behind the actions of the components with respect to  reduction are unknown. Here, we investigate the specific effects of PPC and DC on adipocyte viability. When exposed to PPC or DC, 3T3L1 preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes showed dose dependent decrease in cell viability. Interestingly, while DC mediated cell death was non-specific to both preadipocytes and adipocytes, PPC specifically induced a decrease in mature adipocyte viability, but had less effect on preadipocytes. Injection of PPC and DC into inguinal  pads caused reduction in size. PPC injections preferentially decreased gene expression in mature adipocytes, while a strong inflammatory response was elicited by DC injection. In line with the decreased adipocyte viability, exposure of differentiated adipocytes to PPC resulted in triglyceride release, with a minimal effect on free fatty acids release, suggesting that its -reducing effect mediated mainly through the induction of adipocyte cell death rather than lipolysis. Taken together, it appears that PPC specifically affects adipocytes, and has less effect on preadipocyte viability.

Here we aimed to explore the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in modulating the cross-talk between liver and visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) regarding BA and cholesterol  and fatty / partitioning in morbidly obese NAFLD patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study, we analyzed serum, liver and vWAT samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese patients receiving UDCA (20 mg/kg/day) or no treatment three weeks prior to bariatric surgery.Short term UDCA administration stimulated BA synthesis by reducing circulating fibroblast growth factor 19 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation, resulting in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase induction mirrored by elevated C4 and 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Enhanced BA formation depleted hepatic and LDL-cholesterol with subsequent activation of the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Blunted FXR anti-lipogenic effects induced lipogenic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in the liver, thereby increasing hepatic triglyceride content. In addition, induced SCD activity in vWAT shifted vWAT  towards generation of less toxic and more lipogenic monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic .These data demonstrate that by exerting FXR-antagonistic effects, UDCA treatment in NAFLD patients strongly impacts on cholesterol and BA synthesis and induces neutral  accumulation in both liver and vWAT.Copyright © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high--diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts in part through a B. fragilis-GUDCA-intestinal FXR axis to improve metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078101>Reno-protective effects of ursodeoxycholic  against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity through modulation of NF-κB, eNOS and caspase-3 expressions.</a></h2><p>Gentamicin (GNT) is a potent aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. We aim to investigate the potential protective effect of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) against GNT-induced nephrotoxicity. In this study, 24 male Wistar rats were used and randomly divided into four groups of six animals each.

Serum levels of kidney function parameters (urea, creatinine, uric  and albumin) were measured. Renal tissues were used to evaluate oxidative stress markers; malonaldehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and the anti-oxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and caspase-3 and histological and ultrastructural examination were performed. Treatment with GNT increased the serum levels of renal function parameters and renal MDA, NF-κB and KIM-1 mRNA levels, while it decreased GSH and SOD activities. Marked immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 was observed after GNT administration while it decreased eNOS expression. Histological and ultrastructural alterations were also evident in renal corpuscles and tubules. In contrast, pretreatment with UDCA reversed changes caused by GNT administration.

We hypothesize that high- feeding upregulates gastric neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression, resulting in delayed gastric emptying. We propose this is mediated by increased bile  action on bile  receptor 1 (TGR5) located on nNOS gastric neurons. To test this hypothesis, rats were fed regular chow or a high- diet for 2 wk. Rats fed the high- diet were subjected to concurrent feeding with oral cholestyramine or terminal ileum resection. TGR5 and nNOS expression in gastric tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry, PCR, and Western blot. Gastric motility was assessed by organ bath and solid-phase gastric emptying studies. The 2-wk high- diet caused a significant increase in neurons coexpressing nNOS and TGR5 in the gastric myenteric plexus and an increase in nNOS and TGR5 gene expression, 67 and 111%, respectively. Enhanced nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) relaxation,  (DCA)-induced inhibition in fundic tissue, and a 26% delay in gastric emptying accompanied these changes. A 24-h incubation of whole-mount gastric fundus with DCA resulted in increased nNOS and TGR5 protein expression, 41 and 37%, respectively. Oral cholestyramine and terminal ileum resection restored the enhanced gastric relaxation, as well as the elevated nNOS and TGR5 expression evoked by high- feeding. Cholestyramine also prevented the delay in gastric emptying. We conclude that increased levels of circulatory bile acids induced by high- feeding upregulate nNOS and TGR5 expression in the gastric myenteric plexus, resulting in enhanced NANC relaxation and delayed gastric emptying.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774887>Suppressed hepatic bile  signalling despite elevated production of primary and secondary bile acids in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are regulators of  and glucose , and modulate inflammation in the liver and other tissues. Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high- diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high- diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two dietary groups (n = 6 in each group): a high-cholesterol diet containing 0.5% cholesterol and 0.15% sodium cholate, and a high-cholesterol diet with 5% (w/w) taurine. The experimental diets were given for 2 weeks. Taurine supplementation reduced the serum and hepatic cholesterol levels by 37% and 32%, respectively. Faecal excretion of bile acids was significantly increased in taurine-treated rats, compared with untreated rats. Biliary bile  concentrations were also increased by taurine. Taurine supplementation increased taurine-conjugated bile acids by 61% and decreased glycine-conjugated bile acids by 53%, resulting in a significant decrease in the glycine/taurine (G/T) ratio. Among the taurine-conjugated bile acids, cholic  and  were significantly increased. In the liver, taurine supplementation increased the mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme for bile  synthesis, by three- and two-fold, respectively. Taurine also decreased the enzymatic activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). These observations suggest that taurine supplementation increases the synthesis and excretion of taurine-conjugated bile acids and stimulates the catabolism of cholesterol to bile  by elevating the expression and activity of CYP7A1. This may reduce cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein assembly for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, leading to reductions in the serum and hepatic cholesterol levels.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315136>Ursodeoxycholic  Suppresses Lipogenesis in Mouse Liver: Possible Role of the Decrease in β-Muricholic , a Farnesoid X Receptor Antagonist.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a major nuclear receptor of bile acids; its activation suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c)-mediated lipogenesis and decreases the  contents in the liver. There are many reports showing that the administration of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) suppresses lipogenesis and reduces the  contents in the liver of experimental animals. Since UDCA is not recognized as an FXR agonist, these effects of UDCA cannot be readily explained by its direct activation of FXR. We observed that the dietary administration of UDCA in mice decreased the expression levels of SREBP1c and its target lipogenic genes. Alpha- and β-muricholic acids (MCA) and cholic  (CA) were the major bile acids in the mouse liver but their contents decreased upon UDCA administration. The hepatic contents of chenodeoxycholic  and  (DCA) were relatively low but were not changed by UDCA. UDCA did not show FXR agonistic or antagonistic potency in in vitro FXR transactivation assay. Taking these together, we deduced that the above-mentioned change in hepatic bile  composition induced upon UDCA administration might cause the relative increase in the FXR activity in the liver, mainly by the reduction in the content of β-MCA, a farnesoid X receptor antagonist, which suggests a mechanism by which UDCA suppresses lipogenesis and decreases the  contents in the mouse liver.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26767984>Protective effect of agaro-oligosaccharides on gut dysbiosis and colon tumorigenesis in high- diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>High- diet (HFD)-induced alteration in the gut microbial composition, known as dysbiosis, is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for various diseases, including colon cancer. This report describes a comprehensive investigation of the effect of agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO) on HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, including alterations in short-chain fatty  contents and bile   in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet or HFD, with or without AGO. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis produced their fecal microbiota profiles. Profiles of cecal organic acids and serum bile acids were determined, respectively, using HPLC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems. T-RFLP analyses showed that an HFD changed the gut microbiota significantly. Changes in the microbiota composition induced by an HFD were characterized by a decrease in the order Lactobacillales and by an increase in the Clostridium subcluster XIVa. These changes of the microbiota community generated by HFD treatment were suppressed by AGO supplementation. As supported by the data of the proportion of Lactobacillales order, the concentration of lactic  increased in the HFD + AGO group. Data from the serum bile  profile showed that the level of , a carcinogenic secondary bile  produced by gut bacteria, was increased in HFD-receiving mice. The upregulation tended to be suppressed by AGO supplementation. Finally, results show that AGO supplementation suppressed the azoxymethane-induced generation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon derived from HFD-treated mice. Our results suggest that oral intake of AGO prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, thereby inhibiting colon carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27412720>Proteomics of hydrophobic samples: Fast, robust and low-cost workflows for clinical approaches.</a></h2><p>In a comparative study, we investigated the influence of nine sample preparation workflows and seven different lysis buffers for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the human adipose tissue proteome. Adipose tissue is not just a  depot but also an endocrine organ, which cross-talks with other tissue types and organs throughout the body, like liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Its secreted molecules have an influence on the nervous, immune, and vascular system, thus adipose tissue plays an important role in the regulation of whole-body homeostasis. Proteomic analysis of adipose tissue is challenging due to the extremely high  content and a variety of different cell types included. We investigated the influence of different detergents to the lysis buffer and compared commonly used methods like protein precipitation and filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) with workflows involving  labile or precipitable surfactants. The results indicate that a sodium deoxycholate (SDC) based workflow had the highest efficiency and reproducibility for quantitative proteomic analysis.

A random-effect model and the generic inverse variance weighting method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A random-effects meta-regression model was performed to explore the association between potential confounders and the estimated effect size on plasma  concentrations.Meta-analysis of 20 treatment arms revealed a significant reduction of total cholesterol following ursodeoxycholic  treatment (WMD: - 13.85 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.45, - 6.25, p < 0.001). Nonetheless, LDL-C (WMD: -6.66 mg/dL, 95% CI: -13.99, 0.67, p = 0.075), triglycerides (WMD: - 1.42 mg/dL, 95% CI: -7.51, 4.67, p = 0.648) and HDL-C (WMD: -0.18 mg/dL, 95% CI: -5.23, 4.87, p = 0.944) were not found to be significantly altered by ursodeoxycholic  administration.

In humans, a high-/low-fibre diet is associated with higher faecal levels of bile acids, which can influence intestinal health. It is unknown how an animal-based diet high in  and low in fibre influences the faecal bile  levels and intestinal health in dogs. This study investigated the effects of high intake of minced beef on the faecal bile  profile in healthy, adult, client-owned dogs (n = 8) in a 7-week trial. Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food. Thereafter, incremental substitution of the dry food by boiled minced beef over 3 weeks resulted in a diet in which 75% of each dog's total energy requirement was provided as minced beef during week 5. Dogs were subsequently reintroduced to the dry food for the last 2 weeks of the study. The total taurine and glycine-conjugated bile acids, the primary bile acids chenodeoxycholic  and cholic , and the secondary bile acids lithocholic ,  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) were analysed, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The faecal quantities of DCA were significantly higher in dogs fed the high minced beef diet. These levels reversed when dogs were reintroduced to the dry food diet. The faecal levels of UDCA and taurine-conjugated bile acids had also increased in response to the beef diet, but this was only significant when compared to the last dry food period.These results suggest that an animal-based diet with high-/low-fibre content can influence the faecal bile acids levels.

The present study investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on renal inflammation and oxidative stress in a model of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.0 mg/kg). In the OCA + LPS group, mice were orally pretreated with three doses of OCA (5 mg/kg) at 48, 24 and 1 h before LPS injection. Interestingly, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced renal dysfunction and pathological damage. Moreover, OCA pretreatment repressed renal inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In addition, OCA blocked nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and p50 subunits in tubular epithelial cells of renal cortex. Additional experiment showed that OCA pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced renal glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. Moreover, OCA pretreatment inhibited the upregulation of renal NADPH oxidase and inos genes during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In conclusion, OCA pretreatment protects against sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through inhibiting renal inflammation and oxidative stress. These results provide evidence for roles of FXR as an important regulator of inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney.Copyright © 2018.

In the present study, we demonstrated that 400 µmol/l  (DCA) stimulation promotes the proliferation of normal human gastric epithelial cells (GES-1). In addition, DCA activated FXR and increased the expression of intestinal metaplasia genes, including caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (Cdx2) and mucin 2 (MUC2). The treatment of FXR agonist GW4064/antagonist guggulsterone (Gug.) significantly increased/decreased the expression levels of FXR, Cdx2 and MUC2 protein in DCA-induced GES-1 cells. GW4064/Gug. also enhanced/reduced the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity and binding of the Cdx2 promoter region and NF-κB, the most common subunit p50 protein. Taken together, the results indicated that DCA is capable of modulating the expression of Cdx2 and the downstream MUC2 via the nuclear receptor FXR-NF-κB activity in normal gastric epithelial cells.

The primary endpoint was the effect of supplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were insulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver  content, body composition, body  distribution, faecal microbiota composition and serum bile acids.Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12 weeks did not affect HbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or microbiota composition. Participants who received the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile   (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in the between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who responded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher microbial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after supplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with improvement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12 weeks did not affect HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved insulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high diversity of the gut microbiota at baseline may be important.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27539104>The effect of colesevelam treatment on bile  and  and glycemic control in healthy men.</a></h2><p>The treatment of hypercholesterolemia with bile  (BA) sequestrants results in upregulation of BA synthesis through the classical pathway initiated by cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1).

Isomaltulose, a naturally‑occurring disaccharide, is reported to improve glucose and lipid metabolisms in obese patients. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of isomaltulose on insulin resistance and various metabolites in NAFLD patients. Five male patients with NAFLD consumed 20 g isomaltulose or sucrose (control). Changes in insulin resistance and metabolites were evaluated by alterations of serum C‑peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) and metabolomic analysis from baseline to 15 min after the administration, respectively. There was no significant difference in changes of blood glucose level; however, the CPR level was significantly decreased in the Isomaltulose group compared to the control group (0.94±0.89 vs. ‑0.12±0.31, P=0.0216). In a metabolomic analysis, a significant alteration was seen in 52 metabolites between the control and Isomaltulose groups. In particular, the taurodeoxycholic  level significantly increased approximately 12.5‑fold, and the arachidonic  level significantly decreased approximately 0.01‑fold. Together, it present study demonstrated that isomaltulose improved insulin resistance in NAFLD patients. It was also revealed that isomaltulose affects taurodeoxycholic  and arachidonic .

The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal energy intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic  deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high  diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the liver on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis. These results also provide an insight into interventions for the potential high-risk population of NAFLD, such as those born small or exposed to maternal undernourishment during the fetal period, with the alleviation of ER stress by dietary supplements and/or specific food including chaperones.© 2016 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485902>Vasonatrin peptide attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and underlying mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus increases morbidity/mortality of ischemic heart disease. Although atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide reduce the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion damage in nondiabetic rats, whether vasonatrin peptide (VNP), the artificial synthetic chimera of atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide, confers cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, especially in diabetic patients, is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of VNP on ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and to further elucidate its mechanisms. The high- diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion operation. VNP treatment (100 μg/kg iv, 10 min before reperfusion) significantly improved the instantaneous first derivation of left ventricle pressure (±LV dP/dtmax) and LV systolic pressure and reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, apoptosis index, caspase-3 activity, plasma creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Moreover, VNP inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by suppressing glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). These effects were mimicked by 8-bromine-cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a cGMP analog, whereas they were inhibited by KT-5823, the selective inhibitor of PKG. In addition, pretreatment with tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a specific inhibitor of ER stress, could not further promote the VNP's cardioprotective effect in diabetic rats. In vitro H9c2 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and incubated with or without VNP (10(-8) mol/l). Gene knockdown of PKG1α with siRNA blunted VNP inhibition of ER stress and apoptosis, while overexpression of PKG1α resulted in significant decreased ER stress and apoptosis. VNP protects the diabetic heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting ER stress via the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. These results suggest that VNP may have potential therapeutic value for the diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27773935>Alisol B 23-acetate protects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice via farnesoid X receptor activation.</a></h2><p>Alisol B 23-acetate (AB23A) is a natural triterpenoid isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine rhizoma alismatis, which exhibits a number of pharmacological activities, including anti-hepatitis virus, anti-cancer and antibacterial effects. In this study we examined whether AB23A protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects. NASH was induced in mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. The mice were simultaneously treated with AB23A (15, 30, and 60 mg·kg·d, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, blood samples and livers were collected. Serum liver functional enzymes, inflammatoru markers were assessed. The livers were histologically examined using H&E, Oil Red O, Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red staining. Mouse primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro experiments. The mechanisms underlying AB23A protection were analyzed using siRNA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays. AB23A treatment significantly and dose-dependently decreased the elevated levels of serum ALT and AST in MCD diet-fed mice. Furthermore, AB23A treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the mice. AB23A-induced decreases in serum and hepatic lipids were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis through decreasing hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1 and SCD1 and increased  via inducing PPARα, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration corresponded to deceased serum levels of mKC and MCP-1 and decreased hepatic gene expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis was correlated with decreased hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers. The protective effects of AB23A were FXR-dependent, because treatment with the FXR agonist CDCA mimicked AB23A-induced hepato-protection in the mice, whereas co-administration of FXR antagonist guggulsterone abrogated AB23A-induced hepato-protection. In mouse primary hepatocytes, FXR gene silencing abrogated AB23A-induced changes in gene expression of Apo C-II, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL.

Nowadays, their role in glucose regulation and energy homeostasis are widely reported. BAs are involved in various cellular signaling pathways, such as protein kinase cascades, cyclic AMP (cAMP) synthesis, and calcium mobilization. They are ligands for several nuclear hormone receptors, including farnesoid X-receptor (FXR). Recently, BAs have been shown to bind to muscarinic receptor and Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), both G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), independent of the nuclear hormone receptors. Moreover, BA signals have also been elucidated in other nonclassical BA pathways, such as sphingosine-1-posphate and BK (large conductance calcium- and voltage activated potassium) channels. Hydrophobic BAs have been proven to affect heart rate and its contraction. Elevated BAs are associated with arrhythmias in adults and fetal heart, and altered ratios of primary and secondary bile  are reported in chronic heart failure patients. Meanwhile, in patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction has been strongly linked to the increase in serum bile  concentrations. In contrast, the most hydrophilic BA, known as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has been found to be beneficial in improving peripheral blood flow in chronic heart failure patients and in protecting the heart against reperfusion injury. This review provides an overview of BA signaling, with the main emphasis on past and present perspectives on UDCA signals in the heart.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26595891>High- Diet-induced Intestinal Hyperpermeability is Associated with Increased Bile Acids in the Large Intestine of Mice.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is characterized by low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, which is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability. This study examined the effects of 3 high- diets (HFDs) composed of different  sources (soybean oil and lard) on the intestinal permeability, tight junction (TJ) protein expression, and cecal bile  (BA) concentrations in mice, and then analyzed their interrelations. C57/BL6 mice were fed the control diet, HFD (soybean oil), HFD (lard), and HFD (mix; containing equal concentrations of soybean oil and lard) for 8 wk. Glucose tolerance, intestinal permeability, TJ protein expression, and cecal BA concentration were evaluated. Feeding with the 3 HDFs similarly increased body weight, liver weight, and  pad weight, and induced glucose intolerance and intestinal hyperpermeability. The expression of TJ proteins, zonula occludens-2 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, were lower in the colons of the 3 HFD groups than in the control group (P < 0.05), and these changes appeared to be related to intestinal hyperpermeability. Feeding with HFDs increased total secondary BA (SBA) and total BA concentrations along with increases in some individual BAs in the cecum. Significant positive correlations between intestinal permeability and the concentrations of most SBAs, such as  and ω-muricholic acids, were detected (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the HFD-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased BA secretion.

We hypothesize that UDCA-18:1LPE may directly inhibit the activation of immune cells. We found that UDCA-18:1LPE was capable of inhibiting the migration of phorbol ester-differentiated human THP-1 cells. We examined anti-inflammatory activity of UDCA-18:1LPE during activation of THP1-derived macrophages. Treatment of these macrophages by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. This release was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with UDCA-18:1LPE by ~ 65-90%. Derivatives with a different fatty- chain in LPE moiety also exhibited anti-inflammatory property. Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence analyses revealed that UDCA-18:1LPE attenuated the expression of phosphorylated p38, MKK4/MKK7, JNK1/2, and c-Jun as well as nuclear translocation of NF-κB by ~ 22-86%. After LPS stimulation, the Toll-like receptor adaptor proteins, myeloid differentiation factor 88 and TNF receptor associated factor 6, were recruited into  rafts and UDCA-18:1LPE inhibited this recruitment by 22% and 58%, respectively.

In conclusion, UDCA-18:1LPE and derivatives inhibited LPS inflammatory response by interfering with Toll-like receptor signaling in  rafts leading to an inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB activation.

Gene expression profiles of hepatoprotectants-treated cells were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray in triplicates. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activities were assessed by luciferase assay.Among a total of 30,968 genes, 252 genes were commonly regulated by glycyrrhizin, silymarin, and ursodeoxycholic . These compounds affected the expression of genes relevant various biological pathways, such as neurotransmission, and glucose and . Genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, apoptosis, and anti-oxidative pathways were differentially regulated by all compounds. Moreover, interaction networks showed that NF-κB might play a central role in the regulation of gene expression. Further analysis revealed that these hepatoprotectants inhibited NF-κB activities in a dose-dependent manner.Our data suggested that glycyrrhizin, silymarin, and ursodeoxycholic  regulated the expression of genes relevant to apoptosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells.

Here, we investigated the protective role of FXR against kidney damage induced by obesity in mice that had undergone uninephrectomy, a model resembling the clinical situation of kidney donation by obese individuals. Mice fed a high- diet developed the core features of metabolic syndrome, with subsequent renal  accumulation and renal injury, including glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and albuminuria. The effects were accentuated by uninephrectomy. In human renal biopsies, staining of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), and C/EBP-homologous protein, markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, was more prominent in the proximal tubules of 15 obese patients compared with 16 non-obese patients. In mice treated with the FXR agonist obeticholic , renal injury, renal  accumulation, apoptosis, and changes in  peroxidation were attenuated. Moreover, disturbed mitochondrial function was ameliorated and the mitochondrial respiratory chain recovered following obeticholic  treatment. Culturing renal proximal tubular cells with free fatty  and FXR agonists showed that FXR activation protected cells from free fatty -induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as denoted by a reduction in the level of reactive oxygen species staining and Grp78 immunostaining, respectively. Several genes involved in glutathione  were induced by FXR activation in the remnant kidney, which was consistent with a decreased glutathione disulfide/glutathione ratio. In summary, FXR activation maintains endogenous glutathione homeostasis and protects the kidney in uninephrectomized mice from obesity-induced injury.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26474702>Activation of farnesoid X receptor downregulates monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in murine macrophage.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which plays important roles in bile acids/ homeostasis and inflammation.

Serum and bile lipids and serum metabolic parameters were analyzed.Serum levels of campesterol, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased after 3 and 12 months of treatment. In contrast, serum lathosterol levels increased gradually. The lithogenic index of bile was unsaturated and unchanged in patients who were previously and concomitantly receiving ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). In patients who were not receiving UDCA, bile was initially supersaturated, but eventually was unsaturated. However, ezetimibe tended to elevate bile lithogenicity in cholecystectomy patients.Long-term treatment with ezetimibe improves  without significantly altering the bile lithogenicity.

However, understanding of the precise mechanism of this process remains incomplete. A new class steatohepatitis-inducing high- diet (HFD), namely STHD-01, can promote the development of HCC without the administration of chemical carcinogens. Using this diet, we comprehensively analyzed changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions during the development of HCC in NASH. Mice fed the STHD-01 developed NASH within 9 weeks. NASH further progressed into HCC by 41 weeks. Treatment with antibiotics significantly attenuated liver pathology and suppressed tumor development, indicating the critical role of the gut microbiota in tumor development in this model. Accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the liver and feces increased after feeding the mice with STHD-01. Treatment with antibiotics did not reverse these phenotypes. In contrast, accumulation of secondary bile acids was dramatically reduced after the treatment with antibiotics, suggesting the critical role of the gut microbiota in the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids such as  activated the mTOR, pathway in hepatocytes. Activation of mTOR was observed in the liver of mice fed STHD-01, and the activation was reduced when mice were treated with antibiotics.

However, whether or not FXR can prevent rise in blood pressure remains unknown. Here, we investigate the possibility of using chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a natural ligand of FXR, to attenuate elevated blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated with CDCA (30 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Compared with vehicle control, CDCA attenuated rise in blood pressure in SHR. In addition, CDCA improved vasorelaxation and diminished the contractile response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) in mesenteric arteries from SHR. CDCA also stimulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, repressed ET-1 levels, and inhibited NF-κB activities in mesenteric arteries of the SHR. Overall, we showed that CDCA treatment reduces systolic blood pressure, improves vascular relaxation, and inhibits vasoconstriction activity in SHR. The repressed ET-1 level, the raised eNOS expression, and the ameliorated inflammation in mesenteric arteries could be responsible for the vasorelaxant and hypotensive effect of CDCA.

Their actions are implemented through activation of nuclear (FXR, VDR, PXR) and membrane G protein-coupled (TGR5, S1PR2) receptors. Areas covered: This review discusses the potential of FXR and TGR5 as therapeutic targets in the treatment of pulmonary disorders linked to  and/or inflammation. Obeticholic  (OCA) is the most clinically advanced bile -derived agonist for FXR-mediated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. It therefore represents an attractive pharmacological approach for the treatment of lung conditions characterized by vascular and endothelial dysfunctions. Expert opinion: Inflammation, vascular remodeling and fibrotic processes characterize the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These processes are only partially targeted by the available therapeutic options and still represent a relevant medical need. The results hereby summarized demonstrate OCA efficacy in preventing experimental lung disorders, i.e. monocrotaline-induced PAH and bleomycin-induced fibrosis, by abating proinflammatory and vascular remodeling progression. TGR5 is also expressed in the lung, and targeting the TGR5 pathway, using the TGR5 agonist INT-777 or the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767, could also contribute to the treatment of pulmonary disorders mediated by inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814411>Alteration of Bile   by a High- Diet Is Associated with Plasma Transaminase Activities and Glucose Intolerance in Rats.</a></h2><p>Ingestion of a high- (HF) diet is known to enhance bile  (BA) secretion, but precise information about the BA molecular species is lacking, especially information on the conjugated BAs in enterohepatic circulation. As cholesterol is the precursor of BAs, we analyzed alterations of the entire BA metabolic pathway in response to a HF diet without the addition of cholesterol and BA in the diet. Additionally, we evaluated the relationships between BA  and some disorders, such as plasma transaminase activities and glucose intolerance induced by the HF diet. Acclimated WKAH/HkmSlc male rats (3 wk old) were divided into two groups fed a control or the HF diet for 22 wk. Fasting blood glucose was measured during the experimental period, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed at week 21. As a result, ingestion of the HF diet selectively increased the concentration of taurocholic  in the bile and small intestinal contents as well as  in the large intestinal contents and feces. These results indicated a selective increase of 12α-hydroxylated BA concentrations in response to the HF diet. Moreover, fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA concentration was positively correlated with cumulative energy intake, visceral adipose tissue weight, and glucose intolerance. The present study suggests that fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA is a non-invasive marker that can detect the early phase of glucose intolerance.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27174168>Chenodeoxycholic  significantly impacts the expression of miRNAs and genes involved in , bile  and drug  in human hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are important gut signaling hormones, influencing , glucose, and energy homeostasis.

Lately, they have come to the fore as putative therapeutics in metabolic diseases, such as e.g. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We elucidate to what extent BAs impacts on the mRNAome and microRNAome in hepatocytes to gather novel insights into the mechanisms behind metabolic and toxicologic effects of bile acids.Five batches of primary human hepatocytes were treated with 50μmol/l chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) for 24 or 48h.

In the present study, FGF21was administrated in high- diet-induced obese mice and tunicamycin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and metabolic parameters, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicators, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting. The administration of FGF21 in obese mice reduced body weight, blood glucose and serum insulin, and increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in alleviation of insulin resistance. Meanwhile, FGF21 treatment reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress in adipose tissue of obese mice. Additionally, suppression of ER stress via the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  increased adiponectin expression and improved insulin resistance in obese mice and in tunicamycin-induced adipocytes.

To date, no LXR agonists or antagonists can be used in clinics, emphasizing the importance for discovering new LXR modulators. Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) is powerful for designing new scaffolds and new mechanistic drugs, but fragment screening has not been applied to LXRs yet, which might be due to the lack of a specific fragment screening method against the dynamic and hydrophobic ligand binding domain (LBD) of LXRs. Herein, a series of fluorescent tracers were designed, synthesized and tested. The tracer based on hyodeoxycholic  exhibited a good capability for competitively detecting the ligand binding of LXRβ using a fluorescence polarization approach. Then, 1074 fragments were screened against the LBD of LXRβ (LXRβ-LBD), resulting in 27 binding hits. These fragment hits were further tested using the co-activator recruitment assay and reporter gene assay, and efforts in X-ray crystallography fortunately solved a co-crystal structure of LXRβ-LBD with the fragment F3 (tert-butyl-7-amino-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate).

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high- diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, lithocholic-, - and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high- diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low- diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low- diets than in groups fed high- diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy put women at higher risk. The incidence rates of biliary sludge (a precursor to gallstones) and gallstones are up to 30 and 12%, respectively, during pregnancy and postpartum, and 1-3% of pregnant women undergo cholecystectomy due to clinical symptoms or complications within the first year postpartum. Increased estrogen levels during pregnancy induce significant metabolic changes in the hepatobiliary system, including the formation of cholesterol-supersaturated bile and sluggish gallbladder motility, two factors enhancing cholelithogenesis. The therapeutic approaches are conservative during pregnancy because of the controversial frequency of biliary disorders. In the majority of pregnant women, biliary sludge and gallstones tend to dissolve spontaneously after parturition. In some situations, however, the conditions persist and require costly therapeutic interventions. When necessary, invasive procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy are relatively well tolerated, preferably during the second trimester of pregnancy or postpartum. Although laparoscopic operation is recommended for its safety, the use of drugs such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and the novel -lowering compound, ezetimibe would also be considered.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts  and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of  and glucose . Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile acids can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Treatment of diabetic DBA/2J and db/db mice with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 improved proteinuria and prevented podocyte injury, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. INT-767 exerted coordinated effects on multiple pathways, including stimulation of a signaling cascade involving AMP-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, PGC-1, sirtuin 3, estrogen-related receptor-, and Nrf-1; inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress; and inhibition of enhanced renal fatty  and cholesterol . Additionally, in mice with diet-induced obesity, INT-767 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and kidney fibrosis determined by second harmonic imaging microscopy. These results identify the renal signaling pathways regulated by FXR and TGR5, which may be promising targets for the treatment of nephropathy in diabetes and obesity.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29743187>Effects of Farnesoid X Receptor Activation on Arachidonic  , NF-kB Signaling, and Hepatic Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Inflammation has a recognized role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression. In the present work, we studied the effect of high- diet (HFD) on arachidonic   in the liver and investigated the role of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) in eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways and nuclear factor  light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling, major modulators of the inflammatory cascade. Mice were fed an HFD to induce NAFLD and then treated with the FXR ligand obeticholic  (OCA). Histology and gene expression analyses were performed on liver tissue. Eicosanoid levels were measured from serum and urine samples. The molecular mechanism underlying the effect of FXR activation on arachidonic   and NF-kB signaling was studied in human liver Huh7 cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. NAFLD was characterized by higher (∼25%) proinflammatory [leukotrienes (LTB)] and lower (∼3-fold) anti-inflammatory [epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)] eicosanoid levels than in chow mice. OCA induced the expression of several hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) epoxygenases, the enzymes responsible for EET synthesis, and mitigated HFD-induced hepatic injury. In vitro, induction of CYP450 epoxygenases was sufficient to inhibit NF-kB signaling and cell migration. The CYP450 epoxygenase pan-inhibitor gemfibrozil fully abolished the protective effect of OCA, indicating that OCA-mediated inhibition of NF-kB signaling was EET-dependent. In summary, NAFLD was characterized by an imbalance in arachidonate . FXR activation reprogramed arachidonate  by inducing P450 epoxygenase expression and EET production. In vitro, FXR-mediated NF-kB inhibition required active P450 epoxygenases.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661219>Feeding of the water extract from Ganoderma lingzhi to rats modulates secondary bile acids, intestinal microflora, mucins, and propionate important to colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Consumption of reishi mushroom has been reported to prevent colon carcinogenesis in rodents, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

However, the responsible molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Aim of the present study was the search for the key regulator of the overall fatty  absorption mechanism and its pharmaceutical modulation. As experimental tool we employed the polarized human intestinal tumor derived cell line CaCo2. Here we showed that influx of fatty acids is mediated by an apical heterotetrameric plasma membrane protein complex of which the calcium-independent membrane phospholipase A (iPLAß) is one constituent. The newly synthesized bile -phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholate-lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) blocked iPLAß, which structurally disrupted the fatty -uptake complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of iPLAß lead to reduction of cytosolic lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) production which suppressed p-JNK1, as a central regulator of . In a concerted action low p-JNK1 levels prohibited synthesis of the members of the fatty  uptake complex as well as of apolipoprotein B and the connected members of the basolateral vesicular chylomicron excretion machinery, thereby inhibiting cellular  excretion. The basolateral chylomicron release was shown to determine the overall fatty -absorption capacity as rate limiting step, whereas apical uptake replenishes the cellular stores, enabling continuous transcellular movement of fatty acids. In conclusion, the UDCA-LPE mediated inhibition of p-JNK1 represents a powerful tool to control intestinal absorption of fatty acids and, thus may be employed as a drug to treat obesity.Copyright © 2017.

In each session, 5 ml of 30 mg /ml DCA was injected. The sessions were spaced approximately 2 months apart. All these patients with reductions in SMF were reported using Clinician Reported SMF Rating Scale (CR-SMFRS) and Patient Reported SMF Rating Scale (PR-SMFRS) using the Validated Rating Scale for improvement in the appearance of their chin, the neck, and the cervico-mental profile. Also, for objective assessment of improvement in SMF, caliper measurements were used.One session was required in 2 patients, 12 patients needed 2 sessions, 32 patients needed 3 sessions, and 4 patients needed 4 sessions. Altogether, 90% patients showed at least a decrease of 1 point in (CR-SMFRS).

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth weight, glucose intolerance, obesity, and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic  and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high- diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and microbiota composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced obesity in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting insulin, and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA  (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal microbiota correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with resistance to the weight-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation.

Obeticholic  (OCA) is a FXR agonist being developed for treating various chronic liver diseases. Previous studies reported inconsistent effects of OCA on regulating plasma cholesterol levels in different animal models and in different patient populations. The mechanisms underlying its divergent effects have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is a FXR-modulated gene and the major receptor for HDL-C. We investigated the effects of OCA on hepatic SR-BI expression and correlated such effects with plasma HDL-C levels and hepatic cholesterol efflux in hyperlipidemic hamsters. We demonstrated that OCA induced a time-dependent reduction in serum HDL-C levels after 14 days of treatment, which was accompanied by a significant reduction of liver cholesterol content and increases in fecal cholesterol in OCA-treated hamsters. Importantly, hepatic SR-BI mRNA and protein levels in hamsters were increased to 1.9- and 1.8-fold of control by OCA treatment. Further investigations in normolipidemic hamsters did not reveal OCA-induced changes in serum HDL-C levels or hepatic SR-BI expression. We conclude that OCA reduces plasma HDL-C levels and promotes transhepatic cholesterol efflux in hyperlipidemic hamsters via a mechanism involving upregulation of hepatic SR-BI.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315087>Molecular Properties of Guar Gum and Pectin Modify Cecal Bile Acids, Microbiota, and Plasma Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein in Rats.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) act as signaling molecules in various physiological processes, and are related to colonic microbiota composition as well as to different types of dietary  and fiber. This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles, microbiota composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular-weight (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high- diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbiota composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels, microbiota composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high- diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and ursodeoxycholic acids as well as α-, β-, and ω-muricholic acids to a greater extent than other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal - and hyodeoxycholic  were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ω-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF32. These results indicate that the molecular properties of guar gum and pectin are important for their ability to modulate cecal BA formation, gut microbiota composition, and high- diet induced inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26882172>Supplementation of ursodeoxycholic  improves  digestion and absorption in cystic fibrosis patients with mild liver involvement.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) supplementation is recommended for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with associated liver disease.

Whether ER homeostasis is affected in cows experiencing fatty liver is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ER stress in hepatic  accumulation in calf hepatocytes and ER stress status in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. In vitro experiments were conducted in which hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with different concentrations of fatty acids, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA; a canonical inhibitor of ER stress), or both. The increase in phosphorylation level of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) proteins, and the cleavage of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) protein in response to increasing doses of fatty acids (which were reversed by TUDCA treatment) in primary hepatocytes underscored a mechanistic link between fatty acids and ER stress. In addition, fatty  treatment increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, fatty  synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and  accumulation in calf primary hepatocytes, whereas inhibition of ER stress by incubating with TUDCA significantly weakened these effects. Overall, results in vitro indicate that inhibition of ER stress in calf hepatocytes alleviates fatty -induced  accumulation by downregulating the expression of lipogenic genes. In vivo experiments, liver and blood samples were collected from cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 15) or with severe fatty liver (n = 15). The phosphorylation level of PERK and IRE1α, the cleavage of ATF6 protein, and the abundance of several unfolded protein response genes (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, AMP-dependent transcription factor 4, and spliced X-box binding protein 1) were greater in liver of cows with severe fatty liver. The present in vivo study confirms the occurrence of ER stress in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. Considering the causative role of fatty -induced ER stress in hepatic  accumulation in calf hepatocytes, the existence of ER stress in the liver of severe fatty liver cows may presage its participation in fatty liver progression in dairy cows. However, the mechanistic relationship between ER stress and fatty liver in dairy cows remain to be determined.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut microbiota of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high- diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high- diet, DIO was independent of gut microbiota. In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal  and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile  and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile  . Decreased cecal bile  levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high- diet. We propose that an interaction of gut microbiota and cholesterol  is essential for  accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary  source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile  levels and specific bacteria of the order  (phylum ) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host .</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29854830>-Mediated Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2 Signaling Exacerbates DSS-Induced Colitis through Promoting Cathepsin B Release.</a></h2><p>We recently have proved that excessive fecal DCA caused by high-fat diet may serve as an endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and thus contributes to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Moreover, the effect of DCA on inflammasome activation is mainly mediated through bile  receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2); however, the intermediate process remains unclear.

DCA enema significantly aggravated DSS-induced colitis in mice and S1PR2 inhibitor as well as inflammasome inhibition by cathepsin B antagonist substantially reducing the mature IL-1 production and alleviated colonic inflammation superimposed by DCA.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which obesity promotes HCC development are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota may influence liver diseases by transferring its metabolites and components. Here, we show that the hepatic translocation of obesity-induced lipoteichoic  (LTA), a Gram-positive gut microbial component, promotes HCC development by creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in obesity-associated HCC. The gut microbiota-driven COX2 pathway produced the  mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immunity, suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic NASH-associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27471003>Activation of farnesoid X receptor promotes triglycerides lowering by suppressing phospholipase A2 G12B expression.</a></h2><p>As a novel mediator of hepatic very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) secretion, phospholipase A2 G12B (PLA2G12B) is transcriptionally regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF-4α). Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a critical role in maintaining bile acids and triglycerides (TG) homeostasis. Here we report that FXR regulates serum TG level in part through PLA2G12B. Activation of FXR by chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) or GW4064 significantly decreased PLA2G12B expression in HepG2 cells. PLA2G12B expression was transcriptionally repressed due to an FXR-mediated up-regulation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) which functionally suppresses HNF-4α activity. We found that hepatic PLA2G12B expression was suppressed and serum TG level reduced in high  diet mice treated with CDCA. Concurrently, CDCA treatment lowered hepatic VLDL-TG secretion.

The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of cancer cells. The effects of UDCA on cancer cell migration, cancer stem cells and drug-induced dysbiosis are also evoked. The drug has revealed modest activities against colon and gastric cancers but may be useful to improve treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma, notably in combination with other drugs such as sorafenib. UDCA can also protect from damages induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The potential of UDCA in cancer, as a chemo-protecting or chemotherapeutic agent, is highlighted here as well as the design of tumour-active derivatives, including UDCA-drug conjugates.

Ingestion of TUR before MF breakfast increases the serum concentrations of free and conjugated forms of cholic (CA) and ursodeoxycholic acids (UDCA), as well as the concentrations of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and its taurine-conjugated forms. However, the concentration of conjugated forms of  (DCA) decreases when TUR is taken before HF breakfast.TUR ingestion before MF and HF breakfasts improve BA profiles and may therefore have potential health-promoting effects on BA .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The bile  phospholipid conjugate Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent with hepatoprotective effects in murine high--diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High  diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic  extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and oleic . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of fatty  oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective fatty   during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered  profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, UDCA-LPE may be a promising drug candidate for the management of NAFLD.© 2015 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26350747>Ursodeoxycholic  decreases age-related adiposity and inflammation in mice.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a natural, hydrophilic nontoxic bile , is clinically effective for treating cholestatic and chronic liver diseases. We investigated the chronic effects of UDCA on age-related  homeostasis and underlying molecular mechanisms. Twenty-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were fed a diet with or without 0.3% UDCA supplementation for 25 weeks. UDCA significantly reduced weight gain, adiposity, hepatic triglyceride, and hepatic cholesterol without incidental hepatic injury. UDCA-mediated hepatic triglyceride reduction was associated with downregulated hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and of other genes involved in lipogenesis (Chrebp, Acaca, Fasn, Scd1, and Me1) and fatty  uptake (Ldlr, Cd36). The inflammatory cytokines Tnfa, Ccl2, and Il6 were significantly decreased in liver and/or white adipose tissues of UDCA-fed mice. These data suggest that UDCA exerts beneficial effects on age-related metabolic disorders by lowering the hepatic  accumulation, while concurrently reducing hepatocyte and adipocyte susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli.

However, it usage has been marred by long therapeutic regimes and severe side effects. The less toxic  associated AmB formulations have been limited by their high expense, with some loss in activity. The quest for decreasing AmB cytotoxicity as well as production cost has resulted in the development of AmB super-aggregate as an alternative to its existing  formulations. AmB super-aggregate is spectroscopically distinct from the aggregate present in Fungizone, displaying enhanced thermodynamic stability. The poly-aggregated form of AmB exhibits reduced toxicity in mammalian cells in vitro and to mice in vivo, while maintaining its 'gold standard' antifungal activity. Poly-aggregated AmB interacts predominantly with serum albumin and also attenuates its ability to induce potentially harmful cytokines. Bio-distribution studies have demonstrated that the self-associated AmB shows greater accumulation in reticulo-endothelial organs while sparing kidney, one of the principal organs where its toxic effects are seen. The super-aggregated AmB can thus be used to improve the therapeutic index of AmB against a plethora of fungal infections including candidiasis and cryptococcosis, thus providing a fitting solution to growing demand of an active, less toxic substitute of AmB.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25958728>[Morpho-functional changes in the liver and the possibility of their correction in the offspring of rats with cholestasis].</a></h2><p>The study aims to clarify the influence of experimental cholestasis mother on the structure of the liver of young rats in early postnatal development (Day 2) and to explore the possibility of the correction of these disturbances with Ursofalk drug.

The currently licensed antiviral drugs target viral factors and are prone to viral resistance. In recent years, a few endogenous small molecules from host, such as estradiol and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)-derived  mediator protection D1 (PD1), were demonstrated to be capable of inhibiting IAV infection. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), one of the main primary bile acids, is synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and classically functions in emulsification and absorption of dietary fats. Clinically, CDCA has been used in the treatment of patients with cholesterol gallstones for more than five decades. In this study, we showed that CDCA attenuated the replication of three subtypes of influenza A virus, including a highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, in A549 and MDCK cell cultures with IC ranging from 5.5 to 11.5 μM. Mechanistically, CDCA effectively restrained the nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes. In conclusion, as an endogenous physiological small molecule, CDCA can inhibit IAV replication in vitro, at least in part, by blocking vRNP nuclear export, and affords further studies for development as a potential antiviral agent against IAV infections.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045279>Use of farnesoid X receptor agonists to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a common cause of liver related morbidity and mortality. It is closely linked to underlying insulin resistance. It has recently been shown that bile acids modulate insulin signaling and can improve insulin resistance in cell based and animal studies.

In particular, bile acids stimulate many receptors and ion channels on the cell surface, the mechanisms of which are still poorly understood. Membrane-associating proteins depend on the local spatial distribution of lipids in the plasma membrane (PM) for their function. Here, we report that the highly amphipathic secondary bile   (DCA), a major constituent in the human bile, at doses <1μM enhances the nanoclustering and the PM localization of phosphatidic  (PA) but disrupts the local segregation of phosphatidylserine in the basolateral PM of the human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. PA is a key structural component of the signaling nano-domains of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface. We show that DCA promotes the co-localization between PA and EGFR, the PA-driven EGFR dimerization/oligomerization and EGFR signaling. Depletion of PA abolishes the stimulatory effects of DCA on the EGFR oligomerization and signaling. This effect occurs in the cultured Caco-2 cells and the ex vivo human intestinal enteroids. We propose a novel mechanism, where the amphiphilic DCA monomers alter the nano-assemblies of anionic phospholipids and in turn change the dynamic structural integrity of the lipid-driven oligomerization of cell surface receptors and their signal transduction.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388019>Gut Microbiota-Mediated Bile  Transformations Alter the Cellular Response to Multidrug Resistant Transporter Substrates in Vitro: Focus on P-glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Pharmacokinetic research at the host-microbe interface has been primarily directed toward effects on drug , with fewer investigations considering the absorption process. We previously demonstrated that the transcriptional expression of genes encoding intestinal transporters involved in  translocation are altered in germ-free and conventionalized mice possessing distinct bile  signatures. It was consequently hypothesized that microbial bile  , which is the deconjugation and dehydroxylation of the bile  steroid nucleus by gut bacteria, may impact upon drug transporter expression and/or activity and potentially alter drug disposition. Using a panel of three human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2, T84, and HT-29) that differ in basal transporter expression level, bile  conjugation-, and hydroxylation-status was shown to influence the transcription of genes encoding several major influx and efflux transporter proteins. We further investigated if these effects on transporter mRNA would translate to altered drug disposition and activity. The results demonstrated that the conjugation and hydroxylation status of the bile  steroid nucleus can influence the cellular response to multidrug resistance (MDR) substrates, a finding that did not directly correlate with directionality of gene or protein expression. In particular, we noted that the cytotoxicity of cyclosporine A was significantly augmented in the presence of the unconjugated bile acids  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in P-gp positive cell lines, as compared to their taurine/glycine-conjugated counterparts, implicating P-gp in the molecular response. Overall this work identifies a novel mechanism by which gut microbial metabolites may influence drug accumulation and suggests a potential role for the microbial bile -deconjugating enzyme bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in ameliorating multidrug resistance through the generation of bile  species with the capacity to access and inhibit P-gp ATPase. The physicochemical property of nonionization is suggested to underpin the preferential ability of unconjugated bile acids to attenuate the efflux of P-gp substrates and to sensitize tumorigenic cells to cytotoxic therapeutics in vitro. This work provides new impetus to investigate whether perturbation of the gut microbiota, and thereby the bile  component of the intestinal metabolome, could alter drug pharmacokinetics in vivo. These findings may additionally contribute to the development of less toxic P-gp modulators, which could overcome MDR.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26689835>The anti-atherosclerotic effect of tanshinol borneol ester using fecal metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Tanshinol borneol ester (DBZ) is a novel experimental compound that consists of two chemical structural units from danshensu and borneol.

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal barrier and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA  under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100946>The interaction of phospholipase A with oxidized phospholipids at the -water surface with different structural organization.</a></h2><p>Phospholipase A (PLA IB) activity towards UV-irradiated (λ=180-400nm) phospholipids in comparison to non-irradiated ones was investigated using phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes and mixed micelles of phosphatidylcholine and sodium deoxycholate as a membrane model.

In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut microbiota, generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation.

However, pharmacokinetic studies showed that berberine was poorly absorbed into the body so the levels of berberine in the blood and target tissues were far below the effective concentrations revealed. To probe the underlying mechanism, the effect of berberine on the biological system was studied on a high--diet-induced hamster hyperlipidemia model. Our results showed that intragastrically-administered berberine was poorly absorbed into circulation and most berberine accumulated in gut content. Although the bioavailability of intragastrically administered berberine was much lower than that of intraperitoneally administered berberine, it had a stronger -lowing effect, indicating that the gastrointestinal tract is a potential target for the hypolipidemic effect of berberine. A metabolomic study on both serum and gut content showed that orally administered berberine significantly regulated molecules involved in , and increased the generation of bile acids in the hyperlipidemic model. DNA analysis revealed that the orally administered berberine modulated the gut microbiota, and berberine showed a significant inhibition of the 7α-dehydroxylation conversion of cholic  to , indicating a decreased elimination of bile acids in the gut.

These results were consistently confirmed in both serum and liver of mice with diet-induced obesity, implying that such a metabolic alteration in circulation reflects changes occurring in the liver.  studies of human liver L-02 cell lines under BA treatment revealed that DCA and its conjugated form, TDCA, significantly inhibited mRNA expression of fatty  transport protein 5 in the presence of DGLA, which was involved in hepatocyte DGLA uptake. Thus, the DGLA:DCAS ratio may be a promising biomarker for metabolic abnormalities in obesity.-Lei, S., Huang, F., Zhao, A., Chen, T., Chen, W., Xie, G., Zheng, X., Zhang, Y., Yu, H., Zhang, P., Rajani, C., Bao, Y., Jia, W., Jia, W.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol ,  digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High- diets increase secondary BAs, such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high- diet-related colon cancer. This article reviews the current knowledge concerning the effects of secondary BAs and SCFAs on the proliferation of colon epithelial cells, inflammation, cancer, and the associated microbiome.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30092598>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Affects Lipid  in Atherosclerosis Via CHOP Activation and Over-Expression of miR-33.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important event in atherosclerosis. Recent studies have shown that ER stress deregulates cholesterol  via multiple . This study aimed to determine the relationship between ER stress and lipid  and to verify that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process.An atherosclerosis model was established in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed a Western diet, and THP-1 derived macrophages were used in this study. Hematoxylin-eosin and Oil Red O staining were used to quantify the atherosclerotic plaques. 1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate labeled oxidized low-density lipoprotein binding assay and a Cholesterol Efflux Fluorometric Assay Kit were used to observe cholesterol uptake and efflux. The mRNA and protein levels of biomarkers associated with ER stress and cholesterol  in atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to observe alterations of ABCA1 localization. Small interfering RNAs were used to knock down CHOP and miR-33 in macrophages to alter CHOP and miR-33 expression.Atherosclerotic lesions and systemic lipid levels were ameliorated after inhibition of ER stress (tauroursodeoxycholic ) in vivo. In vitro studies confirmed that ER stress regulated the lipid catabolism of macrophages by promoting cholesterol uptake, inhibiting cholesterol efflux, and modulating the expression of related transporters. CHOP contributed to lipid  disorder following ER stress. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-33 was involved in ER stress that induced lipid  disorder in macrophages. These findings support a model of ER stress induction by oxidized low-density lipoprotein that affects macrophage lipid catabolism disorder.Our data shed new light on the relationship between ER stress and lipid  in vivo and in vitro, and confirm that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process. The relationship between ER stress and miR-33 represents a novel target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Klb-/- mice are refractory to beneficial action of pharmacological FGF21 treatment including stimulation of glucose utilization and thermogenesis. Here, we investigated the energy homeostasis in Klb-/- mice on high- diet in order to better understand the consequences of abrogating both endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 signaling during caloric overload. Surprisingly, Klb-/- mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO) owing to enhanced energy expenditure and BAT activity. Klb-/- mice exhibited not only an increase but also a shift in bile  (BA) composition featured by activation of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative (acidic) pathway. High hepatic production of cholic  (CA) results in a large excess of microbiota-derived  (DCA). DCA is specifically responsible for activating the TGR5 receptor that stimulates BAT thermogenic activity. In fact, combined gene deletion of Klb and Tgr5 or antibiotic treatment abrogating bacterial conversion of CA into DCA both abolish DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice. These results suggested that DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice is caused by high levels of DCA, signaling through the TGR5 receptor. These data also demonstrated that gut microbiota can regulate host thermogenesis via conversion of primary into secondary BA. Pharmacologic or nutritional approaches to selectively modulate BA composition may be a promising target for treating metabolic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384531>Ablation of gut microbiota alleviates obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance by modulating bile   in hamsters.</a></h2><p>Since metabolic process differs between humans and mice, studies were performed in hamsters, which are generally considered to be a more appropriate animal model for studies of obesity-related metabolic disorders. The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high- diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA). The intestinal FXR signaling was suppressed but remained unchanged in the liver.

We hypothesized that a combination of ursodiol (Urso) and ezetimibe (EZ) could increase biliary secretion and reduce cholesterol reabsorption, respectively, to promote cholesterol excretion. Treatment with Urso increased hepatic ABCG5 ABCG8 (G5G8) protein and both biliary and fecal sterols in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether the drug combination (Urso-EZ) further increased cholesterol excretion, mice were treated with Urso alone or in combination with two doses of EZ. EZ produced an additive and dose-dependent increase in fecal neutral sterol (FNS) elimination in the presence of Urso. Finally, we sequentially treated wide-type and G5G8-deficient mice with Urso and Urso-EZ to determine the extent to which these effects were G5G8 dependent. Although biliary and FNS were invariably lower in G5G8 KO mice, the relative increase in FNS following treatment with Urso alone or the Urso-EZ combination was not affected by genotype. In conclusion, Urso increases G5G8, biliary cholesterol secretion, and FNS and acts additively with EZ to promote fecal sterol excretion. However, the stimulatory effect of these agents was not G5G8 dependent.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25455456>Diet supplementation with cholic  promotes intestinal epithelial proliferation in rats exposed to γ-radiation.</a></h2><p>Consumption of a high- diet increases some secondary bile acids (BAs) such as  (DCA) in feces. DCA is derived from cholic  (CA), a primary BA. We evaluated intestinal epithelial proliferation and BA  in response to oral administration of cholic  (CA) in rats to determine the influence of a CA diet on the responses of gut epithelia to γ-rays. WKAH/HkmSlc rats were divided into two dietary groups: control diet or CA-supplemented (2g/kg diet) diet. Some of the rats from each group were irradiated with γ-rays, and epithelial cell proliferation in the colon was analyzed histochemically. Unirradiated CA-fed rats had high levels of DCA and CA in the sera, as well as the presence of taurocholic  in their feces. Significant increases were observed in both epithelial proliferation and the number of epithelial cells in the colon of the CA-fed rats, and this effect was observed at 8 weeks after γ-ray exposure. Furthermore, extracts from both cecal contents and sera of the unirradiated CA-fed rats promoted proliferation of IEC-6 cells. These results indicate that BAs in enterohepatic circulation promote proliferation and survival of the intestinal epithelium after receiving DNA damage.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have examined the influence of carrier oil type and simulated small intestinal fluid (SSIF) composition on the bioaccessibility of emulsified vitamin E using a gastrointestinal model. Oil-in-water emulsions containing vitamin E acetate were prepared using bile salts as emulsifier, and either long chain triacylglycerols (glyceryl trioleate, LCT) or medium chain triacylglycerols (glyceryl trioctanoate, MCT) as carrier oils. The addition of calcium (CaCl₂) to the SSIF increased the extent of  digestion in LCT-emulsions, but had little impact in MCT-emulsions. The bioaccessibility of vitamin E increased in the presence of calcium and phospholipids (DOPC) in LCT-emulsions, but decreased in MCT-emulsions. The highest bioaccessibility (≈66%) was achieved for LCT-emulsions when the SSIF contained both calcium and phospholipids. The conversion of α-tocopherol acetate to α-tocopherol after in vitro digestion was considerably higher for LCT-emulsions when calcium ions were present in the SSIF, but was not strongly affected by SSIF composition for MCT-emulsions.

Glycyrrhizin (GL), extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine liquorice, has potent hepatoprotective effects in both preclinical animal models and in humans. However, little is currently known about its effects and mechanisms in treating NASH. To explore the effects of GL on NASH, GL or its active metabolite glycyrrhetinic  (GA) was administered to mice treated with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model, and histologic and biochemical analyses were used to measure the degree of lipid disruption, liver inflammation, and fibrosis. GL significantly improved MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis and inhibited activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. GL significantly attenuated serum bile  accumulation in MCD diet-fed mice partially by restoring inflammation-mediated hepatic farnesoid X receptor inhibition. In Raw 264.7 macrophage cells, both GL and GA inhibited -induced NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation. Notably, both intraperitoneal injection of GL's active metabolite GA and oral administration of GL prevented NASH in mice, indicating that GL may attenuate NASH via its active metabolite GA. These results reveal that GL, via restoration of bile  homeostasis and inhibition of inflammatory injury, can be a therapeutic option for treatment of NASH.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25594801>Effect of colesevelam on faecal bile acids and bowel functions in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>About one-third of patients with IBS-diarrhoea (irritable bowel syndrome-D) have evidence of increased bile  synthesis or excretion.To assess effects of the bile  sequestrant, colesevelam, on faecal excretion of BAs, hepatic BA synthesis and diarrhoea in IBS-D; to appraise whether individual or random stool samples accurately reflect 48-h total faecal bile  excretion and proportions of the main bile acids excreted and to study the faecal  excretion in response to colesevelam.A single-centre, unblinded, single-dose trial of effects of colesevelam, 1875 mg [3 tablets (625 mg tablets)] orally, twice daily, for 10 days on total 48-h faecal bile  excretion and fasting serum C4 (7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one; surrogate of hepatic bile  synthesis).

Although the cause of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction and severe oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the cell death that characterizes the disease. Under oxidative stress, the master regulator of cellular redox status, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is responsible for activating the transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Nrf2 is a promising target to limit reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in PD. Here, we show that tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) prevents both 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)- and α-synuclein-induced oxidative stress, through Nrf2 activation, in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, we used C57BL/6 male mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to elucidate the effect of TUDCA in this in vivo model of PD. In vivo, TUDCA treatment increases the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1, and Nrf2 downstream target antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and GPx. Moreover, we found that TUDCA enhances GPx activity in the brain. Altogether, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising agent to limit ROS-mediated damage, in different models of PD acting, at least in part, through modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, TUDCA should be considered a promising therapeutic agent to be implemented in PD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Such effects are still unknown in avian (non-mammalian) species. We, therefore, undertook this study to determine the effect of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on growth performance and on the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and hepatic lipogenic genes in broiler chickens. Chickens fed with diet-containing 0.1% or 0.5% CDCA for two weeks exhibited a significant and a dose dependent reduction of feed intake and body weight compared to the control (standard diet). These changes were accompanied with a significant decrease in plasma glucose levels at d10 and d15 post-treatment. At molecular levels, CDCA treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of feeding-related hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY, AgRP, ORX, CRH, Ghrl, and MC1R) and down-regulated the hypothalamic expression of SOCS3. CDCA treatment also decreased the mRNA levels of key hepatic lipogenic genes (FAS, ACCα, ME, ATPcl, and SCD-1) and their related transcription factors SREBP-1/2 and PPARα. In addition, CDCA reduced the hepatic expression of FXR and the adipokine, visfatin, and adiponectin genes compared to the control.

DOC increased the number of intestine tumors by 165.1 % compared with that in untreated Apc (min/+) mice mainly in the middle and distal segments of the small intestine and colon. The numbers of all sizes of tumors in the small intestine were increased. Intestinal carcinogenesis was confirmed in 75 % mice in DOC treated-Apc (min/+) mice compared with 0 % in untreated mice.

A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic  (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between March 16, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 141 patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic  and 142 to placebo. 50 (45%) of 110 patients in the obeticholic  group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and 72 weeks had improved liver histology compared with 23 (21%) of 109 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 2·8; p=0·0002). 33 (23%) of 141 patients in the obeticholic  developed pruritus compared with nine (6%) of 142 in the placebo group.Obeticholic  improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification.National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Intercept Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile -based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut  transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high- diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes,  metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses, obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum  transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal  transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27430612>ATX-101 for reduction of submental : A phase III randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>ATX-101, an injectable form of , causes adipocytolysis when injected subcutaneously into .We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ATX-101.In this phase III trial (REFINE-2), adults dissatisfied with their moderate or severe submental  (SMF) were randomized to ATX-101 or placebo.

HFD was fed for 12 weeks. At the end of two-week HFD, FMT was carried out for two weeks. The gastrointestinal transit, serotonin concentration, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), and the levels of bile acids in intestinal contents were examined.Compared with the control group, the gastrointestinal transit and small intestinal serotonin concentration of HFD-fed rats were increased. In HFD-fed rats, TPH1 protein expression was increased significantly, while SERT protein expression was decreased, but not significant. The levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with the control group. After HFD-fed rats receiving FMT treatment, the gastrointestinal transit, small intestinal serotonin concentration, and TPH1 expression were decreased, while SERT expression was not affected. Moreover, the levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also decreased.FMT could alleviate small intestinal transit in the HFD-fed rats by regulating the serotonin biosynthesis.

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic  accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We have previously shown that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has antioxidative activity through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling-mediated glutathione production. In this study, we investigated the effects of UDCA on insulin response by analyzing intracellular ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. The level of ROS was quantified using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCFDA), and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting assay using appropriate antibodies. The intracellular ROS levels were increased by palmitate but were reduced by treatment with UDCA and insulin. Furthermore, insulin significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt. When the cells were pre-treated with palmitate, insulin-induced Akt-phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. However, when the cells were treated with palmitate and UDCA, the effects of insulin were partially restored.

However, nothing is known about its applicability in exploring the mechanism called membrane remodeling, depicted as changes in membrane fluidity or  raft properties. The aim of this study was, therefore, to substantiate the zebrafish larva as a suitable in vivo model in this context. Ethanol was chosen as a prototype toxicant because it is largely described, both in hepatocyte cultures and in rodents, as capable of inducing a membrane remodeling leading to hepatocyte death and liver injury. The zebrafish larva model was demonstrated to be fully relevant as membrane remodeling was maintained even after a 1-week exposure without any adaptation as usually reported in rodents and hepatocyte cultures. It was also proven to exhibit a high sensitivity as it discriminated various levels of cytotoxicity depending on the extent of changes in membrane remodeling. In this context, its sensitivity appeared higher than that of WIF-B9 hepatic cells, which is suited for analyzing this kind of hepatotoxicity. Finally, the protection afforded by a membrane stabilizer, ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), or by a  raft disrupter, pravastatin, definitely validated zebrafish larva as a reliable model to quickly assess membrane remodeling involvement in chemical-induced hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, this model, compatible with a high throughput screening, might be adapted to seek hepatotoxicants via membrane remodeling, and also drugs targeting membrane features to propose new preventive or therapeutic strategies in chemical-induced liver diseases.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26153518>Evaluation of cholesterol  in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.</a></h2><p>Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a treatable bile  disorder caused by mutations of CYP27A1.

Oral chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) can lead to clinical stabilization, but in a subgroup of patients the disease progresses despite treatment. In the present study, we aimed at clarifying cholesterol  abnormalities and their response to CDCA treatment, in order to identify reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers and understand if differences exist between stable patients and those with neurological progression.We enrolled 19 untreated CTX patients and assessed serum profile of bile acids intermediates, oxysterols, cholesterol, lathosterol, and plant sterols. Then we performed a long-term follow up during CDCA therapy, and compared biochemical data with neurological outcome.We observed increase of cholestanol, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7αC4), lathosterol, and plant sterols, whereas 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) was extremely low or absent. CDCA treatment at a daily dose of 750 mg normalized all biochemical parameters except for 7αC4 which persisted slightly higher than normal in most patients, and 27-OHC which was not modified by therapy. Biochemical evaluation did not reveal significant differences between stable and worsening patients.Cholestanol and 7αC4 represent important markers for CTX diagnosis and monitoring of therapy. Treatment with CDCA should aim at normalizing serum 7αC4 as well as cholestanol, since 7αC4 better mirrors 7α-hydroxylation rate and is thought to be correlated with cholestanol accumulation in the brain. Assessment of serum 27-OHC is a very good tool for biochemical diagnosis at any stage of disease. Lathosterol and plant sterols should be considered as additional markers for diagnosis and monitoring of therapy.

Mice were gavaged with the FXR agonist obeticholic  or vehicle for 11 days. Proteome analyses, as well as targeted metabolomics and chromatin immunoprecipitation, were performed on the livers of these mice. Primary rat hepatocytes were used to validate the role of FXR in amino  catabolism by gene expression and metabolomics studies. Finally, control mice and mice with liver-specific disruption of Nr1h4 (liver FXR-knockout mice) were re-fed with a high-protein diet after 6 hours fasting and gavaged a NHCl tracer. Gene expression and the metabolome were studied in the livers and plasma from these mice.In livers of control mice and primary rat hepatocytes, activation of FXR with obeticholic  increased expression of proteins that regulate amino  degradation, ureagenesis, and glutamine synthesis. We found FXR to bind to regulatory sites of genes encoding these proteins in control livers. Liver tissues from FXR-knockout mice had reduced expression of urea cycle proteins, and accumulated precursors of ureagenesis, compared with control mice. In liver FXR-knockout mice on a high-protein diet, the plasma concentration of newly formed urea was significantly decreased compared with controls. In addition, liver FXR-knockout mice had reduced hepatic expression of enzymes that regulate ammonium detoxification compared with controls. In contrast, obeticholic  increased expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in ureagenesis compared with vehicle in C57Bl/6 mice.In livers of mice, FXR regulates amino  catabolism and detoxification of ammonium via ureagenesis and glutamine synthesis.

Previously we carried out such studies in Cyp7a1(-/-) mice fed physiological levels of cholic  (CA) and achieved BAP restoration, along with an increased CA enrichment, at a dietary level of just 0.03% (w/w). Here we demonstrate that in Cyp7a1(-/-) mice fed chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) at a level of 0.06% (w/w), the BAP was restored to normal size and became substantially enriched with muricholic  (MCA) (>70%), leaving the combined contribution of CA and CDCA to be <15%. This resulted in a partial to complete reversal of the main changes in cholesterol and BA  associated with Cyp7a1 deficiency such as an elevated rate of intestinal sterol synthesis, an enhanced level of mRNA for Cyp8b1 in the liver, and depressed mRNA levels for Ibabp, Shp and Fgf15 in the distal small intestine.

The mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear, and recent studies conflict, pointing to either a modulation of plasma membrane structure or mitochondrial-mediated toxicity through perturbation of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) properties. We conducted a comprehensive comparative study of the impact of cytotoxic and cytoprotective bile acids on the membrane structure of different cellular compartments. We show that DCA increases the plasma membrane fluidity of hepatocytes to a minor extent, and that this effect is not correlated with the incidence of apoptosis. Additionally, plasma membrane fluidity recovers to normal values over time suggesting the presence of cellular compensatory mechanisms for this perturbation. Colocalization experiments in living cells confirmed the presence of bile acids within mitochondrial membranes. Experiments with active isolated mitochondria revealed that physiologically active concentrations of DCA change MOM order in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and that these changes preceded the mitochondrial permeability transition. Importantly, these effects are not observed on liposomes mimicking MOM  composition, suggesting that DCA apoptotic activity depends on features of mitochondrial membranes that are absent in protein-free mimetic liposomes, such as the double-membrane structure,  asymmetry, or mitochondrial protein environment. In contrast, the mechanism of action of cytoprotective bile acids is likely not associated with changes in cellular membrane structure.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832480>Alterations of Bile Acids and Gut Microbiota in Obesity Induced by High  Diet in Rat Model.</a></h2><p>Obesity has become a worldwide health issue and has attracted much public attention. In the current study, we aim to elucidate the roles of bile acids and their associations with gut microbiota during obesity development, employing high  diet (HFD)-induced obesity in a rat model. We collected feces and plasma, liver tissues, and segments of intestinal tissues and a developed bile acids quantification method by employing an ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-MS) strategy. We then assessed bile acids fluxes in the biological matrixes collected. We found that, irrespective of dietary regimes, taurine-conjugated bile acids were the dominant species in the liver whereas unconjugated bile acids were in plasma. However, HFD caused slight increases in the total bile acids pool and particularly the increases in the levels of  (DCA) (138.67 ± 37.225 nmol/L in control group, 242.61 ± 43.16 nmol/L in HFD group, p = 0.014) and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) (2.8 ± 0.247 nmol/g in control group, 4.5 ± 0.386 nmol/g in HFD group, p = 0.0018) in plasma and liver tissues, respectively, which were consistent with the increased levels of DCA in intestinal tissues and feces. These changes are correlated to an increase in abundance of genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Intestinimonas, Lactococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus. Our investigation revealed the fluxes of bile acids and their association with gut microbiota during obesity development and explicated unfavorable impact of HFD on health.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27571266>Bile  Recognition by NAPE-PLD.</a></h2><p>The membrane-associated enzyme NAPE-PLD (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine specific-phospholipase D) generates the endogenous cannabinoid arachidonylethanolamide and other  signaling amides, including oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide. These bioactive molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Recently, we reported the crystal structure of human NAPE-PLD and discovered specific binding sites for the bile  . In this study, we demonstrate that in the presence of this secondary bile , the stiffness of the protein measured by elastic neutron scattering increases, and NAPE-PLD is ∼7 times faster to catalyze the hydrolysis of the more unsaturated substrate N-arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, compared with N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. Chenodeoxycholic  and glyco- or tauro-dihydroxy conjugates can also bind to NAPE-PLD and drive its activation. The only natural monohydroxy bile , lithocholic , shows an affinity of ∼20 μM and acts instead as a reversible inhibitor (IC ≈ 68 μM). Overall, these findings provide important insights into the allosteric regulation of the enzyme mediated by bile  cofactors and reveal that NAPE-PLD responds primarily to the number and position of their hydroxyl groups.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25678132>Fibrates and cholestasis.</a></h2><p>Cholestasis, including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), results from an impairment or disruption of bile production and causes intracellular retention of toxic bile constituents, including bile salts. If left untreated, cholestasis leads to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which eventually results in liver failure and the need for liver transplantation. Currently, the only therapeutic option available for these patients is ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), which slows the progression of PBC, particularly in stage I and II of the disease. However, some patients have an incomplete response to UDCA therapy, whereas other, more advanced cases often remain unresponsive. For PSC, UDCA therapy does not improve survival, and recommendations for its use remain controversial. These considerations emphasize the need for alternative therapies. Hepatic transporters, located along basolateral (sinusoidal) and apical (canalicular) membranes of hepatocytes, are integral determinants of bile formation and secretion. Nuclear receptors (NRs) are critically involved in the regulation of these hepatic transporters and are natural targets for therapy of cholestatic liver diseases. One of these NRs is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which plays a central role in maintaining cholesterol, , and bile  homeostasis by regulating genes responsible for bile  synthesis and transport in humans, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoform 7A1 (CYP7A1), CYP27A1, CYP8B1, uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase enzyme 2A1, multidrug resistance protein 3, and apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter. Expression of many of these genes is altered in cholestatic liver diseases, but few have been extensively studied or had the mechanism of PPARα effect identified. In this review, we examine what is known about these mechanisms and consider the rationale for the use of PPARα ligand therapy, such as fenofibrate, in various cholestatic liver disorders.© 2015 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26988565>Protection of tauroursodeoxycholic  on high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells dysfunction and streptozotocin-induced diabetic retinopathy rats.</a></h2><p>Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), one of the main ingredients from bear gall which hold "Clearing heat and detoxification, Removing liver fire for improving eyesight" functions, is formed by the conjugation of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) with taurine. However, the limited information of TUDCA on protecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been known. The present study was conducted to evaluate the protection of TUDCA on high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) dysfunction and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy (DR) rats and the possible mechanism underlying was also explored.The proliferation of high glucose-induced HRMECs was determined by MTT assay. DR rats' model was established by an administration of high-glucose- diet and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30mg/kg). The cell supernatant and rats' serum were collected for the assays of NO content by ELISA kits. Retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe pathological changes. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in rat retinas. Furthermore, western blot analysis was carried out to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in high glucose-induced HRMECs.After treating with TUDCA, high glucose-induced HRMECs proliferation could be significantly inhibited. TUDCA (5.0μM, 25.0μM and 125.0μM) could decrease NO content in high glucose-induced HRMECs. Furthermore, TUDCA (500mg/kg/d and 250mg/kg/d) also decrease NO content in serum of DR rats. Additionally, both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that the over-expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF were significantly decreased by TUDCA.The data indicated that TUDCA could ameliorate DR by decreasing NO content and down-regulating the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF. Thus, our experimental results suggested that TUDCA might be a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of DR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated  diseases.Copyright © 2018.

While the hydrophilic bile  subtype, ursodeoxycholic , has been shown to attenuate hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and thereby improve glucose regulation in mice, the effect of hydrophobic bile  subtypes on ER stress and glucose regulation in vivo is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the hydrophobic bile  subtype,  (DCA), on ER stress and glucose regulation. Eight week old C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat diet supplemented with or without DCA. Glucose regulation was assessed by oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance testing. In addition, circulating bile  profile and hepatic insulin and ER stress signaling were measured. DCA supplementation did not alter body weight or food intake, but did impair glucose regulation. Consistent with the impairment in glucose regulation, DCA increased the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile  profile, decreased hepatic insulin signaling and increased hepatic ER stress signaling. Together, these data suggest that dietary supplementation of DCA impairs whole body glucose regulation by disrupting hepatic ER homeostasis in mice.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27895393>Emerging role of obeticholic  in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest chronic liver disease and its prevalence is increasing driven by the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic  (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the  profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279683>Dietary Bile Salt Types Influence the Composition of Biliary Bile Acids and Gut Microbiota in Grass Carp.</a></h2><p> can influence host's health. There is increasing evidence for interplay between two key regulating factors in : bile acids (BAs) and gut microbiota. However, very little is known about how types of different diet-supplemented bile salts (BS) influence this interaction . We sought to explore these relationships using grass carp (), which often suffers functional disorder of liver and gallbladder. We studied fluctuations of BAs in the gall and changes of microbial communities in the gut in response to seven different diets: five different BS, chelating BS agent, and control. The BS comprised two primary BS [sodium taurochololate (TCAS) and sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCAS)], sodium tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCAS), and two secondary BS [sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCAS) and sodium taurolithocholate (TLCAS)]. Supplementation of primary BS caused a more significant fluctuation of biliary BAs than secondary BS, and TCAS caused a more prominent increase than TCDCAS and TUDCAS. For the gut microbiota, primary BS tended to increase their diversity and induce community succession, secondary BS resulted in a higher firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio, while TUDCAS had no significant effects. Changes of the gut microbiota triggered by different types of BS caused alteration in BAs biotransformation. Two-obesity-associated families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with biliary cholic  (CA), taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA), and  (DCA). As both primary and secondary BS resulted in increased synthesis of toxic secondary Bas by the gut microbiota, future studies should pay closer attention to gut microbiota when considering BA treatment.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634226>Reduction of Hypothalamic Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Activates Browning of White  and Ameliorates Obesity.</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high- diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28145001>Treatment with the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic  reduces clearance of plasma LDL whilst decreasing circulating PCSK9, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein C-III.</a></h2><p>The natural farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) suppresses hepatic cholesterol and bile  synthesis and reduces biliary cholesterol secretion and triglyceride production. Animal studies have shown that bile acids downregulate hepatic LDL receptors (LDLRs); however, information on LDL  in humans is limited.Kinetics of autologous  I-LDL were determined in 12 male subjects at baseline and during treatment with CDCA (15 mg kg day ). In seven patients with gallstones treated with CDCA for 3 weeks before cholecystectomy, liver biopsies were collected and analysed for enzyme activities and for specific LDLR binding. Serum samples obtained before treatment and at surgery were analysed for markers of , lipoproteins and the LDLR modulator proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).Chenodeoxycholic  treatment increased plasma LDL cholesterol by ~10% as a result of reduced clearance of plasma LDL-apolipoprotein (apo)B; LDL production was somewhat reduced. The reduction in LDL clearance occurred within 1 day after initiation of treatment. In CDCA-treated patients with gallstones, hepatic microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase activities were reduced by 83% and 54%, respectively, and specific LDLR binding was reduced by 20%. During treatment, serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 and total and LDL cholesterol increased, whereas levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, lathosterol, PCSK9, apoA-I, apoC-III, lipoprotein(a), triglycerides and insulin were reduced.Chenodeoxycholic  has a broad influence on , including reducing plasma clearance of LDL.

Aims of the current investigation were to discriminate between nongenomic (≤1 h) and genomic effects (24-48 h) of BAs on β-cells and to evaluate whether FXR can modulate the adverse effects of a high- diet (HFD). TCDC (500 nM) as well as glycine-conjugated and unconjugated CDC (chenodeoxycholate) increased insulin secretion in acute incubations but did not evoke additional effects after 1-2 days of preincubation. The BAs did not stimulate β-cells of FXR-knockout (KO) mice and activation of the G protein-coupled BA receptor TGR5 was ineffective, suggesting that FXR is the sole BA receptor in β-cells activated by TCDC and its analogues. As opposed to lean mice, obese FXR-KO mice did not show HFD-induced glucose intolerance and increased fasting glucose. The beneficial impact of FXR-KO on glucose  cannot be explained by an adaptive compensation of insulin secretion or β-cell mass. Interestingly, in contrast to its effect on islets from lean mice, the FXR agonist GW4064 was ineffective in stimulating insulin secretion of islets from wild type mice fed a HFD or isolated islets kept in a glucolipotoxic medium. Additional feeding of CDC restored the effect of GW4064. CDC prevented HFD-induced impairment of glucose tolerance and in vitro effects of glucolipotoxicity. The data show that the FXR is the most important BA receptor in β-cells and that FXR signaling in β-cells is impaired by overnutrition, which alters activatability of the FXR.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29559521>FXR activation by obeticholic  or nonsteroidal agonists induces a human-like lipoprotein cholesterol change in mice with humanized chimeric liver.</a></h2><p>Obeticholic  (OCA) is a selective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist that regulates bile  and . FXR activation induces distinct changes in circulating cholesterol among animal models and humans. The mechanistic basis of these effects has been elusive because of difficulties in studying lipoprotein homeostasis in mice, which predominantly package circulating cholesterol in HDLs. Here, we tested the effects of OCA in chimeric mice whose livers are mostly composed (≥80%) of human hepatocytes. Chimeric mice exhibited a human-like ratio of serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) at baseline. OCA treatment in chimeric mice increased circulating LDL-C and decreased circulating HDL-C levels, demonstrating that these mice closely model the cholesterol effects of FXR activation in humans. Mechanistically, OCA treatment increased hepatic cholesterol in chimeric mice but not in control mice. This increase correlated with decreased SREBP-2 activity and target gene expression, including a significant reduction in LDL receptor protein. Cotreatment with atorvastatin reduced total cholesterol, rescued LDL receptor protein levels, and normalized serum LDL-C. Treatment with two clinically relevant nonsteroidal FXR agonists elicited similar lipoprotein and hepatic changes in chimeric mice, suggesting that the increase in circulating LDL-C is a class effect of FXR activation.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26349688>Factors Affecting Enhanced Permeation of Amphotericin B Across Cell Membranes and Safety of Formulation.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine amphotericin B (AmB) permeation across  bilayer membranes mounted on Transwell® and to observe the phagocytosis of the AmB and the AmB- formulations by alveolar macrophage (AM) cell lines using a fluorescence microscope. The  bilayer membranes were prepared from phospholipid and ergosterol as well as phospholipid and cholesterol in a ratio (67:33 mol%). AmB- formulations were prepared from AmB incorporated with four  derivatives during a lyophilization process. In vitro cytotoxicity studies were carried out on kidney cells by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The levels of nitric oxide production by AMs exposed to these AmB- formulations were determined by the Griess reaction. Phagocytosis of the AmB- formulations was carried out using AM cells. The  bilayer membranes and AmB- formulations were successfully prepared. In vitro cytotoxicity results showed less toxicity to kidney cells than pure AmB, and a 1,000-fold less production of nitric oxide by NR8383 cell lines was obtained when compared to lipopolysaccharide. Permeation results were two- to fivefold higher than for pure AmB in the ergosterol containing  bilayer and two- to fourfold higher than AmB in the cholesterol containing compositions, both of which were enough to kill the fungi according to their MICs and MFCs. AM phagocytosed the AmB- formulations.
