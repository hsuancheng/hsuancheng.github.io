<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744638>[Cellular senescence and chronic inflammation].</a></h2><p>It has recently become apparent that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation and several common types of cancer development. Although several events were proposed to be involved in these pathologies, the precise mechanisms underlying obesity-associated inflammation and cancer largely remain unclear. Here, we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) plays crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut , thereby increasing the levels of a bacterial metabolite that cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of the bacterial metabolites provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn, secretes various inflammatory and tumour promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Importantly, reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the induction of SASP by the gut bacterial metabolite in HSCs plays key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Interestingly, moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), implying that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights into the development of obesity-associated cancer.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic  metabolism by gut microbes and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat. Saturated fat induces increased bile secretion into the intestine. Increased bile secretion selects for populations of gut microbes capable of altering the bile  pool, generating tumor-promoting secondary bile acids such as  and lithocholic . Epidemiological evidence suggests CRC is associated with increased levels of DCA in serum, bile, and stool. Mechanisms by which secondary bile acids promote CRC are explored. Furthermore, in humans bile  conjugation can vary by diet. Vegetarian diets favor glycine conjugation while diets high in animal protein favor taurine conjugation. Metabolism of taurine conjugated bile acids by gut microbes generates hydrogen sulfide, a genotoxic compound. Thus, taurocholic  has the potential to stimulate intestinal bacteria capable of converting taurine and cholic  to hydrogen sulfide and , a genotoxin and tumor-promoter, respectively.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213609>Gut microbial profile is altered in primary biliary cholangitis and partially restored after UDCA therapy.</a></h2><p>A close relationship between gut  and some chronic liver disorders has recently been described. Herein, we systematically performed a comparative analysis of the gut  in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and healthy controls.We first conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) treatment-naïve patients with PBC and 80 matched healthy controls. Second, an independent cohort composed of 19 treatment-naïve patients and 34 controls was used to validate the results. Finally, a prospective study was performed in a subgroup of 37 patients with PBC who underwent analysis before and after 6 months of UDCA treatment. Faecal samples were collected, and microbiomes were analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.A significant reduction of within-individual microbial diversity was noted in PBC (p=0.03). A signature defined by decreased abundance of four genera and increased abundance of eight genera strongly correlated with PBC (area under curve=0.86, 0.84 in exploration and validation data, respectively). Notably, the abundance of six PBC-associated genera was reversed after 6 months of UDCA treatment. In particular, , enriched in controls, was further decreased in gp210-positive than gp210-negative patients (p=0.002). Of interest was the finding that the increased capacity for the inferred pathway, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells in PBC, highly correlated with the abundance of bacteria belonging to .This study presents a comprehensive landscape of gut  in PBC. Dysbiosis was found in the gut  in PBC and partially relieved by UDCA. Our study suggests that gut  is a potential therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker for PBC.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal  profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (, lithocholic , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight. Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AGO-received mice is still unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AGO administration affects the gut microbial composition and inhibits obesity in mice.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30144429>FXR-Dependent Modulation of the Human Small Intestinal  by the Bile  Derivative Obeticholic .</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria can modify the composition of bile acids and bile acids, which are regulated by the farnesoid X receptor, affect the survival and growth of gut bacteria. We studied the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist, on the intestinal microbiomes of humans and mice.We performed a phase I study in 24 healthy volunteers given OCA (5, 10, or 25 mg/d for 17 days). Fecal and plasma specimens were collected at baseline (day 0) and on days 17 (end of dosing) and 37 (end of study). The fecal specimens were analyzed by shotgun meta-genomic sequencing. A Uniref90 high-stringency genomic analysis was used to assign specific genes to the taxonomic signature of bacteria whose abundance was associated with OCA. Male C57BL/6 mice were gavage fed daily with water, vehicle, or OCA (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Small intestine luminal contents were collected by flushing with saline and fecal pellets were collected at baseline and day 14. Mouse samples were analyzed by 16S-tagged sequencing. Culture experiments were performed to determine the taxonomic-specific effects of bile acids and OCA on bacterial growth.Suppression of endogenous bile  synthesis by OCA in subjects led to a reversible induction of gram-positive bacteria that are found in the small intestine and are components of the diet and oral . We found that bile acids decreased proliferation of these bacteria in minimum inhibitory concentration assays. In these organisms, there was an increase in the representation of microbial genomic pathways involved in DNA synthesis and amino  metabolism with OCA treatment of subjects. Consistent with these findings, mice fed OCA had lower endogenous bile  levels and an increased proportion of Firmicutes, specifically in the small intestine, compared with mice fed water or vehicle.In studying the effects of OCA in humans and mice, we found evidence for interactions between bile acids and features of the small intestinal .

Recent data suggest that faecal  transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal  composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal  taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of  composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and  are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, , and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids, lithocholic and . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved  structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal  due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced obesity and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a newly emerging pharmaceutical target and FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate cholestasis and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of obeticholic  (OCA) treatment in preventing SBS-ALDs.Piglets underwent 75% small-bowel resection (SBS) or sham surgery (sham) and were assigned to either a daily dose of OCA (2.4 mg/kg/day) or were untreated. Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool fat and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced fat malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs. We postulate that extensive small resection impacts the ability of the remnant intestine to respond to FXR activation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30561288>Gut  and health: connecting actors across the metabolic system.</a></h2><p>Overweight-related metabolic diseases are an important threat to health in the Western world. Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut  is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut  is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut  renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut  and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29941869>Magnesium lithospermate B improves the gut  and bile  metabolic profiles in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) is a new drug marketed in China to treat angina, but its low oral bioavailability limits its clinical application to the intravenous route. Paradoxically, orally administered low-dose MLB was found to alleviate kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In recent years, the kidney-gut axis has been suspected to be involved in kidney damage pathogenesis, potentially representing a non-classical pathway for pharmacologic intervention. To ascertain whether MLB targets the kidney-gut axis, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were prepared as a mouse model of DN. The STZ mice were treated with MLB (50 mg kg d, p.o.) for 8 weeks. Twenty-four-hour urinary albumin was detected to mirror kidney function. At week 4, 6, 8, feces were collected; bile acids (BAs) were quantified to examine the alterations in the BA metabolic profiles, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced to identify alterations in gut microbial composition. In STZ mice, 24-h urinary albumin levels and total fecal BAs, especially cholic acids (CAs) and  acids (DCAs) were greatly increased, and the gut  was dramatically shifted compared with control mice. Oral administration of MLB significantly decreased 24-h urinary albumin levels and total BAs, CAs and DCAs, and reversed CA:TCA (taurocholic ) and DCA:CA ratios. It also changed the  composition in STZ mice based on operational units. Thus the therapeutic effect of MLB on kidney injury might be attributed (at least partially) to its ability to modulate the disordered gut  and BA metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192599>A biosynthetic pathway for a prominent class of -derived bile acids.</a></h2><p>The gut bile  pool is millimolar in concentration, varies widely in composition among individuals and is linked to metabolic disease and cancer. Although these molecules are derived almost exclusively from the , remarkably little is known about which bacterial species and genes are responsible for their biosynthesis. Here we report a biosynthetic pathway for the second most abundant class in the gut, 3β-hydroxy(iso)-bile acids, whose levels exceed 300 μM in some humans and are absent in others. We show, for the first time, that iso-bile acids are produced by Ruminococcus gnavus, a far more abundant commensal than previously known producers, and that the iso-bile  pathway detoxifies  and thus favors the growth of the keystone genus Bacteroides.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active . Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly ). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic , p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic , indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia. Metabiotics, a new class of therapeutic agents, e.g. based on microbial metabolites, can correct metabolic dysbiosis, prevent diet- and -relared diseases and increase the effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397356>Gut  and intestinal FXR mediate the clinical benefits of metformin.</a></h2><p>The anti-hyperglycemic effect of metformin is believed to be caused by its direct action on signaling processes in hepatocytes, leading to lower hepatic gluconeogenesis. Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut  community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut . However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts in part through a B. fragilis-GUDCA-intestinal FXR axis to improve metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23333527>Modulation of the fecal bile  profile by gut  in cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>The 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids (BAs), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA) and cholic  (CA) into the secondary BAs, lithocholic (LCA) and  (DCA), is a key function of the gut . We aimed at studying the linkage between fecal BAs and gut  in cirrhosis since this could help understand cirrhosis progression.Fecal  were analyzed by culture-independent multitagged-pyrosequencing, fecal BAs using HPLC and serum BAs using LC-MS in controls, early (Child A) and advanced cirrhotics (Child B/C). A subgroup of early cirrhotics underwent BA and  analysis before/after eight weeks of rifaximin.Cross-sectional: 47 cirrhotics (24 advanced) and 14 controls were included. In feces, advanced cirrhotics had the lowest total, secondary, secondary/primary BA ratios, and the highest primary BAs compared to early cirrhotics and controls. Secondary fecal BAs were detectable in all controls but in a significantly lower proportion of cirrhotics (p<0.002). Serum primary BAs were higher in advanced cirrhotics compared to the rest. Cirrhotics, compared to controls, had a higher Enterobacteriaceae (potentially pathogenic) but lower Lachonospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Blautia (7α-dehydroxylating bacteria) abundance. CDCA was positively correlated with Enterobacteriaceae (r=0.57, p<0.008) while Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with DCA (r=0.4, p<0.05).

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on.

Gut--related organic acids were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure, AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with an over 70% reduction in the high-dose group (75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs, but no significant time effect was found.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  by gut . Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut  on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut  compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut  were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut  composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling.

To distinguish these opposing effects of DCA and butyrate (two major metabolites in colon lumen), we examined the effects of physiologically relevant doses of butyrate (0.5-2 mmol/l) and DCA (0.05-0.3 mmol/l) on colon cell proliferation. We hypothesize that butyrate and DCA each modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis via common and distinct cellular signaling targets. In this study, we demonstrated that both butyrate and DCA inhibited cell proliferation by up to 89% and 92% and increased cell apoptosis rate by up to 3.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. Cell cycle analyses revealed that butyrate led to an increase in G1 and G2 fractions with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction, but DCA induced an increase in only G1 fraction with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction when compared with the untreated cells. The examination of early cellular signaling revealed that DCA but not butyrate increased intracellular reactive oxygen species, genomic DNA breakage, the activation of ERK1/2, caspase-3 and PARP. In contrast, DCA decreased activated Rb protein level, and butyrate but not DCA increased p21 expression.

This report describes a comprehensive investigation of the effect of agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO) on HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, including alterations in short-chain fatty  contents and bile  metabolism in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet or HFD, with or without AGO. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis produced their fecal  profiles. Profiles of cecal organic acids and serum bile acids were determined, respectively, using HPLC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems. T-RFLP analyses showed that an HFD changed the gut  significantly. Changes in the  composition induced by an HFD were characterized by a decrease in the order Lactobacillales and by an increase in the Clostridium subcluster XIVa. These changes of the  community generated by HFD treatment were suppressed by AGO supplementation. As supported by the data of the proportion of Lactobacillales order, the concentration of lactic  increased in the HFD + AGO group. Data from the serum bile  profile showed that the level of , a carcinogenic secondary bile  produced by gut bacteria, was increased in HFD-receiving mice. The upregulation tended to be suppressed by AGO supplementation. Finally, results show that AGO supplementation suppressed the azoxymethane-induced generation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon derived from HFD-treated mice.

The following analyses were performed: C difficile plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry bile  profiling. FMT mixtures were prepared using fresh fecal samples provided by donors enrolled in an FMT program in the United Kingdom. Results from chemostat experiments were validated using human stool samples, C difficile batch cultures, and C57BL/6 mice with CDI. Human stool samples were collected from 16 patients with recurrent CDI and healthy donors (n = 5) participating in an FMT trial in Canada.In the CDI chemostat model, clindamycin decreased valerate and  concentrations and increased C difficile total viable counts and valerate precursors, taurocholic , and succinate concentrations. After we stopped adding clindamycin, levels of bile acids and succinate recovered, whereas levels of valerate and valerate precursors did not. In the CDI chemostat model, FMT increased valerate concentrations and decreased C difficile total viable counts (94% decrease), spore counts (86% decrease), and valerate precursor concentrations; concentrations of bile acids were unchanged. In stool samples from patients with CDI, valerate was depleted before FMT but restored after FMT. Clostridioides difficile batch cultures confirmed that valerate decreased vegetative growth, and that taurocholic  was required for germination but had no effect on vegetative growth. Clostridioides difficile total viable counts were decreased by 95% in mice with CDI given glycerol trivalerate compared with phosphate buffered saline.We identified valerate as a metabolite that is depleted with clindamycin and only recovered with FMT.

If the study is limited to breast cancer risk, it has been suggested that the increase in sex steroid formation that occurs in postmenopausal women plays a role. Obesity is known to be associated with chronic low grade inflammation, but no reason for this association has been offered in the past. The gut , while known to be enormous, has not in the past been considered as a metabolic role player in the body. This is now recognized to be the case. Recent studies have found the obesity is correlated with an alteration in the gut . In obese individual there is a change in the relative proportions of the two major classes of bacteria - bacteroides and firmacutes - with the latter dominant in obesity and resulting in the formation of increased amounts of metabolic endotoxins like  and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Obese individuals show a decrease in the concentration of Akkermansia muciniphila in the mucus that lines the intestinal wall, resulting in thinner mucus and a weakened intestinal lining and permitting metabolic endotoxins formed by other bacterial flora like LPS to enter the blood steam and cause the chronic inflammation associated with obesity. The change in the  profile results in increases in bacterial strains that are more efficient at generating energy, leading to increased obesity. In mice, it has been shown that introducing gut bacterial flora from the cecum of obese mice into germ-free mice results in increased obesity with lesser food consumption while the reverse, introducing bacterial flora from lean mice results in a loss in weight. This raises the attractive possibility that manipulating the gut  could facilitate weight loss or prevent obesity in humans.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089798>Ursodeoxycholic  improves liver function via phenylalanine/tyrosine pathway and  remodelling in patients with liver dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a metabolic by-product of intestinal bacteria, showing hepatoprotective effects.

UDCA significantly improved the liver function scores after 4 weeks of treatment and effectively reduced hepatic  and serum microRNA-122 levels. To better understand its protective mechanism, a global metabolomics study was conducted, and we found that UDCA regulated uremic toxins (hippuric , p-cresol sulphate, and indole-derived metabolites), antioxidants (ascorbate sulphate and N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and the phenylalanine/tyrosine pathway. Furthermore,  involvement, particularly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was demonstrated through metagenomic analysis of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles.

Our focus revolves around the interaction of the gut  with liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. The bile  pool size has recently been shown to be a function of microbial metabolism of bile , and regulation of the  by bile acids is important in the development and progression of several liver diseases. Humans produce a large, conjugated hydrophilic bile  pool, maintained through positive-feedback antagonism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine and liver. Microbes use bile acids, and via FXR signaling this results in a smaller, unconjugated hydrophobic bile  pool. This equilibrium is critical to maintain health. The challenge is to examine the manifold functions of gut bile acids as modulators of antibiotic, probiotic, and disease progression in cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, and alcohol use. Recent studies have shown potential mechanisms explaining how perturbations in the  affect bile  pool size and composition. With advancing liver disease and cirrhosis, there is dysbiosis in the fecal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, in addition to a decrease in bile  concentration in the intestine due to the liver problems. This results in a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa, and increasing production of . Alcohol intake speeds up these processes in the subjects with and without cirrhosis without significant FXR feedback. Taken together, these pathways can impact intestinal and systemic inflammation while worsening dysbiosis. The interaction between bile acids, alcohol, cirrhosis, and dysbiosis is an important relationship that influences intestinal and systemic inflammation, which in turn determines progression of the overall disease process. These interactions and the impact of commonly used therapies for liver disease can provide insight into the pathogenesis of inflammation in humans.2015 S.

Bile salts that are secreted into the intestine may be biotransformed by enzymes produced by the gut bacteria. To date, bile  research at the host-microbe interface has primarily been directed toward effects on host metabolism. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of changes in gut microbial bile  metabolism on the solubilization capacity of bile salt micelles and consequently intraluminal drug solubility. First, the impact of bile  metabolism, mediated in vivo by the microbial enzymes bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and 7α-dehydroxylase, on drug solubility was assessed by comparing the solubilization capacity of (a) conjugated vs deconjugated and (b) primary vs secondary bile salts. A series of poorly water-soluble drugs (PWSDs) were selected as model solutes on the basis of an increased tendency to associate with bile micelles. Subsequently, PWSD solubility and dissolution was evaluated in conventional biorelevant simulated intestinal fluid containing host-derived bile acids, as well as in media modified to contain microbial bile  metabolites. The findings suggest that deconjugation of the bile  steroidal core, as dictated by BSH activity, influences micellar solubilization capacity for some PWSDs; however, these differences appear to be relatively minor. In contrast, the extent of bile  hydroxylation, regulated by microbial 7α-dehydroxylase, was found to significantly affect the solubilization capacity of bile salt micelles for all nine drugs studied (p < 0.05). Subsequent investigations in biorelevant media containing either the trihydroxy bile salt sodium taurocholate (TCA) or the dihydroxy bile salt sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) revealed altered drug solubility and dissolution. Observed differences in biorelevant media appeared to be both drug- and amphiphile (bile salt/lecithin) concentration-dependent. Our studies herein indicate that bile  modifications occurring at the host-microbe interface could lead to alterations in the capacity of intestinal bile salt micelles to solubilize drugs, providing impetus to consider the gut  in the drug absorption process. In the clinical setting, disruption of the gut microbial ecosystem, through disease or antibiotic treatment, could transform the bile  pool with potential implications for drug absorption and bioavailability.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828892>Interplay between bile acids and the gut  promotes intestinal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The gut  and the bile  pool play pivotal roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

Recently developed humanized gnotobiotic mouse models have provided deeper insights into this initial stage and host's immune response.

A general overlapping response to all tested bile acids could be determined particularly in shock experiments which appears plausible in the light of their common steroid structure.

Our results point at a differential induction of the groEL and dnaKJgrpE chaperone systems, both belonging to the class I heat shock genes. Additionally, central metabolic pathways involving butyrate fermentation and the reductive Stickland fermentation of leucine were effected, although CA caused a proteome signature different from the other three bile acids. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics revealed a loss of flagellar proteins in LT stress with LCA.

The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut  and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202273>Effects of barley variety, dietary fiber and β-glucan content on bile  composition in cecum of rats fed low- and high-fat diets.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance have been linked to changes in bile  (BA) profiles, which in turn are highly dependent on the dietary composition and activity of the gut . The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, lithocholic-, - and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is regarded as a chemopreventive beneficial bile  due to its low hydrophobicity. However, it is a minor constituent of human bile acids. Here, we characterized an UDCA-producing bacterium, N53, isolated from human feces. 16S rDNA sequence analysis identified this isolate as Ruminococcus gnavus, a novel UDCA-producer. The forward reaction that produces UDCA from 7-oxo-lithocholic  was observed to have a growth-dependent conversion rate of 90-100% after culture in GAM broth containing 1 mM 7-oxo-lithocholic , while the reverse reaction was undetectable. The gene encoding 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7β-HSDH), which facilitates the UDCA-producing reaction, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Characterization of the purified 7β-HSDH revealed that the kcat/Km value was about 55-fold higher for the forward reaction than for the reverse reaction, indicating that the enzyme favors the UDCA-producing reaction. As R. gnavus is a common, core bacterium of the human gut , these results suggest that this bacterium plays a pivotal role in UDCA formation in the colon.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30737348>Clostridium scindens ATCC 35704: Integration of Nutritional Requirements, the Complete Genome Sequence, and Global Transcriptional Responses to Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>In the human gut,  ATCC 35704 is a predominant bacterium and one of the major bile  7α-dehydroxylating anaerobes.

The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, , and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile   (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response.

Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promote barrier re-establishment; however, we found that persistently elevated PGE2 hinders subsequent repair phases. The bacterial metabolite deoxycholate (DCA) promotes transition through repair phases via PGE2 regulation. During barrier re-establishment, DCA levels are locally diminished in the wound, allowing enhanced PGE2 production and barrier re-establishment. However, during transition to the wound channel formation phase, DCA levels increase to inhibit PGE2 production and promote crypt regeneration. Altering DCA levels via antibiotic treatment enhances PGE2 levels but impairs wound repair, which is rescued with DCA treatment. DCA acts via its receptor, farnesoid X receptor, to inhibit the enzyme cPLA2 required for PGE2 synthesis. Thus, colonic wound repair requires temporally regulated signals from microbial metabolites to coordinate host-associated signaling cascades. VIDEO ABSTRACT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth weight, glucose intolerance, obesity, and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high-fat diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and  composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced obesity in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting insulin, and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal  correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with resistance to the weight-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation. Our findings suggest that BA metabolism may be a previously unrecognized contributor to developmentally programmed diabetes risk.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483538>Morphine induces changes in the gut  and metabolome in a morphine dependence model.</a></h2><p>Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed in the United States and worldwide.

In the current study, a morphine-murine model was used to investigate the role of the gut  and metabolome as a potential mechanism contributing to the negative consequences associated with opioid use. Results reveal a significant shift in the gut  and metabolome within one day following morphine treatment compared to that observed after placebo.

This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles,  composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular-weight (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high-fat diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and  composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels,  composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high-fat diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and ursodeoxycholic acids as well as α-, β-, and ω-muricholic acids to a greater extent than other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal - and hyodeoxycholic  were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ω-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF32. These results indicate that the molecular properties of guar gum and pectin are important for their ability to modulate cecal BA formation, gut  composition, and high-fat diet induced inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891992>Three measurable and modifiable enteric microbial biotransformations relevant to cancer prevention and treatment.</a></h2><p>Interdisciplinary scientific evaluation of the human  has identified three enteric microbial biotransformations of particular relevance for human health and well-being, especially cancer.

We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to body fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice.GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut  of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut . In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile  and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile  metabolism. Decreased cecal bile  levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut  and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile  levels and specific bacteria of the order  (phylum ) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut  and host metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal , gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal , metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group).

LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in obesity-associated HCC. The gut -driven COX2 pathway produced the lipid mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immunity, suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic NASH-associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177942>The ' lifestyle' of bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria: comparative genomics, metatranscriptomic, and bile  metabolomics analysis of a defined microbial community in gnotobiotic mice.</a></h2><p>The formation of secondary bile acids by gut microbes is a current topic of considerable biomedical interest.

Subsequently, bile salt hydrolases from B. pseudocatenulatum and B. longum subsp. suis were purified using a two-step chromatographic procedure.

Bile acids are one class of these signaling molecules, synthesized by the host and chemically transformed by the gut . Among bile  metabolizers, bile  7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids.

We previously demonstrated that the transcriptional expression of genes encoding intestinal transporters involved in lipid translocation are altered in germ-free and conventionalized mice possessing distinct bile  signatures. It was consequently hypothesized that microbial bile  metabolism, which is the deconjugation and dehydroxylation of the bile  steroid nucleus by gut bacteria, may impact upon drug transporter expression and/or activity and potentially alter drug disposition. Using a panel of three human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2, T84, and HT-29) that differ in basal transporter expression level, bile  conjugation-, and hydroxylation-status was shown to influence the transcription of genes encoding several major influx and efflux transporter proteins. We further investigated if these effects on transporter mRNA would translate to altered drug disposition and activity. The results demonstrated that the conjugation and hydroxylation status of the bile  steroid nucleus can influence the cellular response to multidrug resistance (MDR) substrates, a finding that did not directly correlate with directionality of gene or protein expression. In particular, we noted that the cytotoxicity of cyclosporine A was significantly augmented in the presence of the unconjugated bile acids  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in P-gp positive cell lines, as compared to their taurine/glycine-conjugated counterparts, implicating P-gp in the molecular response. Overall this work identifies a novel mechanism by which gut microbial metabolites may influence drug accumulation and suggests a potential role for the microbial bile -deconjugating enzyme bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in ameliorating multidrug resistance through the generation of bile  species with the capacity to access and inhibit P-gp ATPase. The physicochemical property of nonionization is suggested to underpin the preferential ability of unconjugated bile acids to attenuate the efflux of P-gp substrates and to sensitize tumorigenic cells to cytotoxic therapeutics in vitro. This work provides new impetus to investigate whether perturbation of the gut , and thereby the bile  component of the intestinal metabolome, could alter drug pharmacokinetics in vivo.

Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition.

Here, we investigated the energy homeostasis in Klb-/- mice on high-fat diet in order to better understand the consequences of abrogating both endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 signaling during caloric overload. Surprisingly, Klb-/- mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO) owing to enhanced energy expenditure and BAT activity. Klb-/- mice exhibited not only an increase but also a shift in bile  (BA) composition featured by activation of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative (acidic) pathway. High hepatic production of cholic  (CA) results in a large excess of -derived  (DCA). DCA is specifically responsible for activating the TGR5 receptor that stimulates BAT thermogenic activity. In fact, combined gene deletion of Klb and Tgr5 or antibiotic treatment abrogating bacterial conversion of CA into DCA both abolish DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice. These results suggested that DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice is caused by high levels of DCA, signaling through the TGR5 receptor.

As compared to the post-intervention phase of control diet, the cranberry diet modified 9 taxonomic clades, including a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes. Further, the cranberry diet attenuated control diet-induced increase in secondary bile acids and decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and increased urinary anthocyanins and bacterially derived phenolic acids. No changes were found in fecal trimethylamine and plasma cytokines. In conclusion, an animal-based diet altered the  composition to a less favorable profile, increased carcinogenic bile acids, and decreased beneficial SCFA.

SS and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cannot be distinguished by clinical or laboratory features. Dysregulation of the gut  is involved in NASH pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between -derived metabolites and the degrees of NAFLD; also, to investigate whether these metabolites could be included in a panel of NASH biomarkers.We used liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole-mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ) analysis to quantify choline and its derivatives, betaine, endogenous ethanol, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids and soluble TLR4 in serum from women with normal weight (n = 29) and women with morbid obesity (MO) (n = 82) with or without NAFLD. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to evaluate the hepatic and intestinal expression level of all genes studied (TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, LXRα, SREBP1C, ACC1, FAS, PPARα, CPT1α, CROT, SREBP2, ABCA1, ABCG1 and FXR in the liver; TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, GLP-1R, DPP-4, FXR and PPARɣ in the jejunum) in 82 women with MO with normal liver histology (NL, n = 29), SS (n = 32), and NASH (n = 21).Hepatic FAS, TLR2, and TLR4 expression were overexpressed in NAFLD patients. TLR2 was overexpressed in NASH patients. In women with MO with NAFLD, we found upregulation of intestinal TLR9 expression and downregulation of intestinal FXR expression in women with NASH. Circulating TMAO, glycocholic  and  levels were significantly increased in NAFLD patients. Endogenous circulating ethanol levels were increased in NASH patients in comparison to those in SS patients.These findings suggest that the intestine participates in the progression of NAFLD. Moreover, levels of certain circulating -related metabolites are associated with NAFLD severity and could be used as a "liquid biopsy" in the noninvasive diagnosis of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29459807>[Primary biliary cholangitis.

Decreasing bile  concentration in the colon in cirrhosis is also associated with decreases in Clostridium cluster XIVa, which includes bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria which produce DCA. Rifaximin treatment appears to act by suppressing DCA production, reducing endotoxemia and harmful metabolites without significantly altering  structure. Taken together, the bile  pool size and composition appear to be a major regulator of  structure, which in turn appears to be an important regulator of bile  pool size and composition.

However, whether metabolism of bile acids is involved in the metabolic complications of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the effects of bile acids on the prognosis of ESRD remain obscure. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between altered bile  profile and the prognosis of ESRD patients.A targeted metabolomics approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine the changes in serum bile acids between ESRD patients ( = 77) and healthy controls ( = 30). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to screen the differential proportions of bile acids between the two groups.Six differentially expressed bile acids were identified as potential biomarkers for differentiating ESRD patients from healthy subjects. The decreased concentrations of chenodeoxycholic ,  and cholic  were significantly associated with dyslipidemia in ESRD patients. Subgroup analyses revealed that the significantly increased concentrations of taurocholic , taurochenodeoxycholic , taurohyocholic  and tauro α-muricholic  were correlated to the poor prognosis of ESRD patients.The serum bile  profile of ESRD patients differed significantly from that of healthy controls.

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes,  profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice.  transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

Due to our incomplete understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease, the therapeutic options are still rather limited. Bile acids play a key role in mediating cholangiocellular and hepatocellular injury in cholangiopathies such as PSC. Therefore, strategies targeting bile composition and homeostasis are valid approaches in PSC. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the paradigm therapeutic bile  and its role in medical therapy of PSC is still under debate. Promising novel bile -based therapeutic options include 24-norursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA), a side chain-shortened C23 homologue of UDCA, and bile  receptor/farnesoid X receptor agonists (e.g. obeticholic ). Other nuclear receptors such as fatty -activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, vitamin D receptor and vitamin A receptors (retinoic  receptor, retinoid X receptor) are also of potential interest and can be targeted by already available drugs. Furthermore, drugs targeting the gut-liver axis (e.g. intregrin blockers such as vedolizumab, antibiotics) appear promising, based on the close link of PSC to inflammatory bowel disease and the emerging relevance of the gut  for the development of PSC. Finally, fibrosis represents a valid therapeutic target for anti-fibrotic drugs (e.g. simtuzumab) in PSC as paradigm fibro-obliterative disease. This review summarizes the current status and recent progress in the development of targeted therapeutic approaches based on increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of this disease.© 2015 S.

To investigate how dietary fat influences risk, we compared the colonic contents of 12 adult high-risk African Americans (AAs) and 10 Caucasian Americans (CAs) who consumed a high-fat diet (123 ± 11 g/d and 129 ± 17 g/d, respectively) to 13 native Africans (NAs) who subsisted on a low-fat (38 ± 3.0 g/d) diet, all aged 50-60 yr. The colonic bile acids were measured by LC-MS and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by GC. The chief secondary colonic bile acids,  and lithocholic , were correlated with fat intake and similar between AAs and CAs, but 3-4 times higher than in AAs (p < 0.05). The major SCFAs were lower in AAs (p < 0.001) and CAs (p < 0.001) compared to AAs, but conversely, the branched chain fatty acids (BFCA) were higher. Our results suggest that the higher risk of colon cancer in Americans may be partly explained by their high-fat and high-protein, low complex carbohydrate diet, which produces colonic residues that promote microbes to produce potentially carcinogenic secondary bile acids and less antineoplastic SCFAs.

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut  modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary fat content on BA profiles and associated gut , and their correlates with cardiometabolic risk factors.In a randomized controlled-feeding trial, healthy young adults were assigned to one of the three diets: a lower-fat diet (fat 20%, carbohydrate 66% and protein 14%), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30%, carbohydrate 56% and protein 14%) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40%, carbohydrate 46% and protein 14%) for 6 months. All the foods were provided during the entire intervention period. The BA profiles, associated gut  and markers of cardiometabolic risk factors were determined before and after intervention.The higher-fat diet resulted in an elevated concentration of total BAs (p < 0.001), and unconjugated BAs (p = 0.03) compared with lower-fat diet.

Consistently, the abundances of gut bacteria (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) which affect bile salt hydrolase gene expression were significantly increased after higher-fat consumption. The change of DCA was positively associated with the relative abundance of Bacteroides (r = 0.31, p = 0.08 after FDR correction). In addition, the changes of fecal concentrations of DCA and 12keto-LCA were positively associated with serum total cholesterol (r > 0.3, p = 0.02 and p = 0.008 after FDR correction, respectively).

Our primary aim was to examine how the host adapts to the stress of microbe-derived secondary BAs by P450-mediated oxidative modifications on the steroid nucleus. Five unconjugated tri-hydroxyl BAs that were structurally and/or biologically associated with deoxycholate (DCA) were determined in human biologic samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in combination with enzyme-digestion techniques.

Metabolic inhibition assays in human liver microsomes and recombinant P450 assays revealed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 were responsible for the regioselective oxidations of both DCA and its conjugated forms, glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA).

As the worldwide obesity epidemic has shown no signs of abating, better understanding of the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated cancer is urgently needed. Although several events were proposed to be involved in obesity-associated cancer, the exact molecular mechanisms that integrate these events have remained largely unclear. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut , thereby increasing the levels of  (DCA), a gut bacterial metabolite known to cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn secretes various inflammatory and tumour-promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Notably, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the DCA-SASP axis in HSCs has key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, indicating that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, lithocholic , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142907>Electrochemical Oxidation of Primary Bile Acids: A Tool for Simulating Their Oxidative Metabolism?</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a subgroup of sterols and important products of cholesterol catabolism in mammalian organisms. Modifications (e.g., oxidation and 7-dehydroxylation) are predominantly exerted by the intestinal . Bile acids can be found in almost all living organisms, and their concentration and metabolism can be used for the assessment of the pathological and nutritional status of an organism. Electrochemical oxidation is a rapid, relatively inexpensive approach to simulate natural metabolic redox processes in vitro. This technique further allows the identification of oxidative degradation pathways of individual substances, as well as the demonstration of binding studies of generated oxidation products with biologically relevant molecules. When coupling an electrochemical and a high-resolution mass spectrometric system, oxidation products can be generated and identified directly by non-targeted ESI-MS. Here, a method for the generation of oxidation products of the primary bile acids cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  was exemplarily developed. Most products and the highest intensities were observed at a pH value of 6. For cholic , a high potential of 3 V was necessary, while for chenodeoxycholic , a potential of 2.4 V led to a higher number of oxidation products. In a second approach, a binding study with glutathione was performed to simulate phase II metabolism. It was possible to detect signals of free glutathione, free bile acids, and adducts of both reactants. As the resulting mass spectra also showed some new signals of the oxidized bile , which could not be observed without glutathione, it can be assumed that glutathione is able to bind reactive oxidation species before reacting with other products.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29688473>Detection of Gut Dysbiosis due to Reduced Clostridium Subcluster XIVa Using the Fecal or Serum Bile  Profile.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis, especially a reduced Clostridium subcluster XIVa (XIVa), has been reported in several gastrointestinal diseases. Since XIVa is thought to be the main bacterial cluster that metabolizes bile acids (BAs) in the human intestine, we hypothesized that the BA profile in feces, and possibly in serum, could be a convenient biomarker for intestinal XIVa activity.First, blood and feces were collected from 26 healthy controls and 20 patients with gastrointestinal diseases, and the relationships among fecal microbiomes and fecal and serum BA compositions were studied. Second, serum BA compositions of 30 healthy controls and the remission and exacerbation states of 14 Crohn's disease (CD) and 12 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were compared. Fecal microbiomes were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and BA compositions were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS.The highest positive correlation was observed between the fecal XIVa proportion and fecal unconjugated  (DCA)/(DCA+unconjugated cholic  [CA]) (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001) or serum DCA/(DCA+CA) (r = 0.52, P < 0.001). Diurnal variation in serum XIVa candidate markers also showed that DCA/(DCA+CA) was most stable and not affected by the contraction of the gallbladder. Serum DCA/(DCA+CA) was not significantly different between remission and exacerbation states in either CD or UC patients, but was significantly reduced in those in the remission state of CD and the remission and exacerbation states of UC compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05).Decreased XIVa exhibits a strong correlation with reduced intestinal BA metabolism.

Here, we present a novel  approach to determine the bacterial genera associated with the metabolism of different primary bile acids and their potential to contribute to inter-individual variation in this processing.

Data fusion techniques were used to identify statistical bacterial-metabolic linkages. An increase in gut bacteria associated bile acids was observed over 24 h with variation in the rate of bile  metabolism across the volunteers ( = 7).

However, there are still some doubts about TCM because of the questionable TCM theories and unclear biological active compounds. In recent years, gut  has emerged as an important frontier to understand the development and progress of diseases.

In this context, more and more studies pertaining to TCM have paid attention to gut  and have yield rich information for understanding TCM. After oral administration, TCM can interact with gut : (1) TCM can modulate the composition of gut ; (2) TCM can modulate the metabolism of gut ; (3) gut  can transform TCM compounds. During the interactions, two types of metabolites can be produced: gut  metabolites (of food and host origin) and gut  transformed TCM compounds.

In the lumen, enteric bacteria metabolize BAs from conjugated, primary forms into more toxic unconjugated, secondary metabolites. Secondary BAs can be injurious to the intestine and may contribute to disease. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are known to interact with BAs. In this study we examined the effects of BAs on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and investigated the possible roles for EGFR and FXR in these effects. We report that taurine-conjugated cholic  (TCA) induced proliferation, while its unconjugated secondary counterpart  (DCA) inhibited proliferation. TCA stimulated phosphorylation of Src, EGFR, and ERK 1/2. Pharmacological blockade of any of these pathways or genetic ablation of EGFR abrogated TCA-stimulated proliferation. Interestingly, Src or EGFR inhibitors eliminated TCA-induced phosphorylation of both molecules, suggesting that their activation is interdependent. In contrast to TCA, DCA exposure diminished EGFR phosphorylation, and pharmacological or siRNA blockade of FXR abolished DCA-induced inhibition of proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that TCA induces intestinal cell proliferation via Src, EGFR, and ERK activation. In contrast, DCA inhibits proliferation via an FXR-dependent mechanism that may include downstream inactivation of the EGFR/Src/ERK pathway. Since elevated secondary BA levels are the result of specific bacterial modification, this may provide a mechanism through which an altered  contributes to normal or abnormal intestinal epithelial cell proliferation.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279683>Dietary Bile Salt Types Influence the Composition of Biliary Bile Acids and Gut  in Grass Carp.</a></h2><p>Lipid metabolism can influence host's health.

We sought to explore these relationships using grass carp (), which often suffers functional disorder of liver and gallbladder. We studied fluctuations of BAs in the gall and changes of microbial communities in the gut in response to seven different diets: five different BS, chelating BS agent, and control. The BS comprised two primary BS [sodium taurochololate (TCAS) and sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCAS)], sodium tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCAS), and two secondary BS [sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCAS) and sodium taurolithocholate (TLCAS)]. Supplementation of primary BS caused a more significant fluctuation of biliary BAs than secondary BS, and TCAS caused a more prominent increase than TCDCAS and TUDCAS. For the gut , primary BS tended to increase their diversity and induce community succession, secondary BS resulted in a higher firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio, while TUDCAS had no significant effects. Changes of the gut  triggered by different types of BS caused alteration in BAs biotransformation. Two-obesity-associated families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with biliary cholic  (CA), taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA), and  (DCA).

Bile  dysregulation leads to intestinal dysbiosis, that allows enterogenous pathogenic bacteria, including Gram‑negative bacteria and their products lipopolysaccharide (LPS), into the liver via the portal vein, triggering inflammation in the liver. The inflammasome serves as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects pathogens or danger signals and mediates innate immunity in the liver or gut. Specifically, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains‑containing protein (NLRP)6 inflammasome maintains intestinal microbial balance, by promoting interleukin (IL)‑18‑dependent antimicrobial peptide synthesis and mucus secretion from goblet cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome, in contrast, primarily induces IL‑1β and aggravates inflammatory liver injury. Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome affects the epithelial integrity of cholangiocytes by inducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. In addition, bile acids, including  and chenodeoxycholic , are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages; however, bile acids have the potential to exert the opposite role by interacting with the membrane‑bound Takeda G‑protein receptor 5 or by activating nuclear farnesoid‑X receptor.

Variations in gut flora were also analysed in the process of in vitro digestion of pastry products in a bioreactor. Enzymes: pepsin, pancreatin and bile salts: cholic ,  and lithocholic  were added to the culture. Faecal bacteria, isolated from human large intestine, were added in the section of large intestine. The influence of dietary fibre content in cookies and concentration of bile acids in two stages of digestion were analysed. Generally, pastry goods with bioactive substances were characterized by a higher content of total fibre compared with the control samples. These products also differ in the profile of dietary fibre fractions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the bile  profile after two stages of digestion depends on the quality and quantity of fibre. The bile  profile after digestion of BM and BC forms one cluster, and with the CM and CC forms a separate cluster. High concentration of H (hemicellulose) is positively correlated with LCA (low binding effect) and negatively correlated with CA and DCA contents. The relative content of bile acids in the second stage of digestion was in some cases above the content in the control sample, particularly LCA. This means that the bacteria introduced in the 2nd stage of digestion synthesize the LCA.</p><p>Keyword: microbiome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874313>New therapeutic perspectives in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is focused on restitution of metabolic derangement, weight loss and drugs able to improve steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis. Life-style interventions based on Mediterranean diet and increasing physical activity are the first line therapy. In patients with unsuccessful life-style intervention several drugs are under development: agonist PPAR, agonist GLP-1R and agonist FXR together with drugs focussing on inflammation, ballooning, apoptosis and fibrosis. Bariatric surgery or advanced endoscopy are reserved for morbid obese without response to life-style intervention and weighting loss drugs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier España, S.L.U.
