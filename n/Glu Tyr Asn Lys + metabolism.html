In vitro activities of sitafloxacin were evaluated against clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae resistant to levofloxacin (MIC of levofloxacin > or = 4 mg/L), which were characterized genetically.The quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE of these strains were analysed by PCR-based sequencing. MICs of sitafloxacin and other quinolones were determined by a microdilution broth method.All 18 strains had at least one amino acid substitution in the QRDRs of GyrA and ParC, which included Ser-81-->/Phe and -85--> in GyrA and Ser-79-->Phe/Ile/, Asp-83-->, -91-->Asp, Ser-107-->Phe, -137--> and Ala-142-->Ser in ParC. Most isolates had Asp-435-->/Ile-460-->Val/Ala-596-->Thr substitutions in ParE, while no amino acid substitution in GyrB was noted in all isolates. Ten isolates for which levofloxacin MICs were 16 or 32 mg/L had multiple mutations in both GyrA and ParC. The MIC80 value of sitafloxacin for levofloxacin-resistant isolates was 0.25 mg/L. The range of MICs of sitafloxacin for isolates resistant to levofloxacin (MIC 4-32 mg/L) was 0.016-0.5 mg/L.These findings warrant further studies to evaluate the usefulness of sitafloxacin in the treatment of levofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae infection.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18753605>Select nutrients in the ovine uterine lumen. I. Amino acids, glucose, and ions in uterine lumenal flushings of cyclic and pregnant ewes.</a></h2><p>Nutrients in uterine secretions are essential for development and survival of conceptuses (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) during pregnancy; however, little is known about changes in the amounts of specific nutrients in the uterine fluids of cyclic and pregnant ruminants. This study determined quantities of glucose, amino acids, glutathione, calcium, sodium, and potassium in uterine lumenal fluid from cyclic (Days 3-16) and pregnant (Days 10-16) ewes. Total recoverable glucose, Arg, Gln, Leu, Asp, , , His, beta-Ala, , Trp, Met, Val, Phe, Ile, , Cys, Pro, glutathione, calcium, and sodium were greater in the uterine fluid of pregnant compared with cyclic ewes between Days 10 and 16. In cyclic ewes, only modest changes in the total amounts of glucose, , Cit, , Trp, Met, Val, Cys, glutathione, calcium, and potassium were detected between Days 3 and 16. However, in pregnant ewes, amounts of glucose, Arg, Gln, , Gly, Cys, Leu, Pro, glutathione, calcium, and potassium in uterine fluids increased 3- to 23-fold between Days 10 and 14 and remained high to Day 16. Of particular interest were increases in glucose, Arg, Leu, and Gln in uterine flushings of pregnant ewes between Days 10 and 16 of pregnancy. Total amounts of His, ornithine, , Ser, Thr, Ile, Phe, Trp, Met, and Cit in uterine fluids also increased, but to a lesser extent during early pregnancy. These novel results indicate activation of pregnancy-associated mechanisms for transport of nutrients into the uterine lumen, and they provide a framework for future studies of nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and glutathione, required to activate nutrient-sensing cell signaling  for growth, development, and survival of conceptuses, as well as for optimization of culture media for in vitro studies of conceptus development.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10671523>The molecular structure of hyperthermostable aromatic aminotransferase with novel substrate specificity from Pyrococcus horikoshii.</a></h2><p>Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase (ArATPh), which has a melting temperature of 120 degrees C, is one of the most thermostable aminotransferases yet to be discovered. The crystal structure of this aminotransferase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was determined to a resolution of 2.1 A. ArATPh has a homodimer structure in which each subunit is composed of two domains, in a manner similar to other well characterized aminotransferases. By the least square fit after superposing on a mesophilic ArAT, the ArATPh molecule exhibits a large deviation of the main chain coordinates, three shortened alpha-helices, an elongated loop connecting two domains, and a long loop transformed from an alpha-helix, which are all factors that are likely to contribute to its hyperthermostability. The pyridine ring of the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate covalently binding to (233) is stacked parallel to F121 on one side and interacts with the geminal dimethyl-CH/pi groups of Val(201) on the other side. This tight stacking against the pyridine ring probably contributes to the hyperthermostability of ArATPh. Compared with other ArATs, ArATPh has a novel substrate specificity, the order of preference being  > Phe >  > Trp > His>> Met > Leu > Asp > . Its relatively weak activity against Asp is due to lack of an arginine residue corresponding to Arg(292)* (where the asterisk indicates that this is a residues supplied by the other subunit of the dimer) in pig cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase. The enzyme recognizes the aromatic substrate by hydrophobic interaction with aromatic rings (Phe(121) and (59)*) and probably recognizes acidic substrates by a hydrophilic interaction involving a hydrogen bond network with Thr(264)*.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19393676>Purification, characterization and biological activities of the L-amino acid oxidase from Bungarus fasciatus snake venom.</a></h2><p>L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs) are widely distributed in snake venoms, which contribute to the toxicity of venoms. However, LAAO from Bungarus fasciatus (B. fasciatus) snake venom has not been isolated previously. In the present study, LAAO from B. fasciatus snake venom was purified by SP-Sepharose HP anion exchange chromatography followed by Heparin-Sepharose FF affinity chromatography procedure and the purified enzyme was named BF-LAAO. BF-LAAO presented an estimated molecular weight of 55kDa in SDS-PAGE and an apparent molecular weight of 70kDa in size-exclusion chromatography suggesting that BF-LAAO is a monomeric protein. Kinetics studies showed that BF-LAAO was very active against L-, L-Asp, L-Phe, L-, L-Trp, L-His, L-Gln, L-Ile, L-Met, L-Leu and moderately active against L-, L-Arg, L-Ala and L-. BF-LAAO exhibited a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells and caused up to 41.2% apoptosis of A549 cells following 12h incubation period. In the mouse peritoneum, BF-LAAO provoked a marked increase in the number of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages following injection. It also induced rabbit platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. At 3h following injection, BF-LAAO elicited severe inflammation in the gastrocnemius muscles of mice, but failed to induce significant organ damage. In conclusion, the cytotoxic and proinflammatory activities of BF-LAAO could be the main cause of the local inflammation, which helps us to understand the pathogenesis of snakebite.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17901056>Clostridium difficile glucosyltransferase toxin B-essential amino acids for substrate binding.</a></h2><p>Recently the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Clostridium difficile toxin B was solved ( Reinert, D. J., Jank, T., Aktories, K., and Schulz, G. E. (2005) J. Mol. Biol. 351, 973-981 ). On the basis of this structure, we studied the functional role of several amino acids located in the catalytic center of toxin B. Besides the (286)DXD(288) motif and Trp(102), which were shown to be necessary for Mn(2+) and UDP binding, respectively, we identified by alanine scanning Asp(270), Arg(273), (284), (384), and Trp(520) as being important for enzyme activity. The amino acids Arg(455), Asp(461), (463), and (472) and residues of helix alpha17 (e.g. (449)) of toxin B are essential for enzyme-protein substrate recognition. Introduction of helix alpha17 of toxin B into Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin inhibited modification of Ras subfamily proteins but enabled glucosylation of RhoA, indicating that helix alpha17 is involved in RhoA recognition by toxin B. The data allow the design of a model of the interaction of the glucosyltransferase domain of toxin B with its protein substrate RhoA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10873472>Effects of side-chain characteristics on stability and oligomerization state of a de novo-designed model coiled-coil: 20 amino acid substitutions in position "d".</a></h2><p>We describe the de novo design and biophysical characterization of a model coiled-coil protein in which we have systematically substituted 20 different amino acid residues in the central "d" position. The model protein consists of two identical 38 residue polypeptide chains covalently linked at their N termini via a disulfide bridge. The hydrophobic core contained Val and Ile residues at positions "a" and Leu residues at positions "d". This core allowed for the formation of both two-stranded and three-stranded coiled-coils in benign buffer, depending on the substitution at position "d". The structure of each analog was analyzed by CD spectroscopy and their relative stability determined by chemical denaturation using GdnHCI (all analogs denatured from the two-stranded state). The oligomeric state(s) was determined by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis in benign medium. Our results showed a thermodynamic stability order (in order of decreasing stability) of: Leu, Met, Ile, , Phe, Val, Gln, Ala, Trp, , His, Thr, , Ser, Asp, , Arg, Orn, and Gly. The Pro analog prevented coiled-coil formation. The overall stability range was 7.4 kcal/mol from the lowest to the highest analog, indicating the importance of the hydrophobic core and the dramatic effect a single substitution in the core can have upon the stability of the protein fold. In general, the side-chain contribution to the level of stability correlated with side-chain hydrophobicity. Molecular modelling studies, however, showed that packing effects could explain deviations from a direct correlation. In regards to oligomerization state, eight analogs demonstrated the ability to populate exclusively one oligomerization state in benign buffer (0.1 M KCl, 0.05 M K(2)PO(4)(pH 7)). Ile and Val (the beta-branched residues) induced the three-stranded oligomerization state, whereas , , Arg, Orn,  and Asp induced the two-stranded state. , Gln, Ser, Ala, Gly, Phe, Leu, Met and Trp analogs were indiscriminate and populated two-stranded and three-stranded states. Comparison of these results with similar substitutions in position "a" highlights the positional effects of individual residues in defining the stability and numbers of polypeptide chains occurring in a coiled-coil structure. Overall, these results in conjunction with other work now generate a relative thermodynamic stability scale for 19 naturally occurring amino acid residues in either an "a" or "d" position of a two-stranded coiled-coil. Thus, these results will aid in the de novo design of new coiled-coil structures, a better understanding of their structure/function relationships and the design of algorithms to predict the presence of coiled-coils within native protein sequences.Copyright 2000 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19811930>Electron capture dissociation product ion abundances at the X amino acid in RAAAA-X-AAAAK peptides correlate with amino acid polarity and radical stability.</a></h2><p>We present mechanistic studies aimed at improving the understanding of the product ion formation rules in electron capture dissociation (ECD) of peptides and proteins in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. In particular, we attempted to quantify the recently reported general correlation of ECD product ion abundance (PIA) with amino acid hydrophobicity. The results obtained on a series of model H-RAAAAXAAAAK-OH peptides confirm a direct correlation of ECD PIA with X amino acid hydrophobicity and polarity. The correlation factor (R) exceeds 0.9 for 12 amino acids (Ile, Val, His, , Asp, , Gln, Ser, Thr, Gly, Cys, and Ala). The deviation of ECD PIA for seven outliers (Pro is not taken into consideration) is explained by their specific radical stabilization properties (Phe, Trp, , Met, and Leu) and amino acid basicity (, Arg). Phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and  decreases the efficiency of ECD around phosphorylated residues, as expected.

An experiment was conducted to analyze the serum concentrations (SC) of free AA in pigs exposed to diurnal variations in AT. Six pigs (27.1 ±1.3kg body weight) implanted with a thermometer to register the body temperature (BT) at 15-min intervals were used. Blood samples were collected on the last 3 d of the 14-d study, at 0700h (lowest AT), 1200h (mild HS), and 1600h (severe HS). The pigs received 1.2kg/d of an AA-supplemented, wheat-soybean meal diet, in two equal meals (0700 and 1900h).

APHs share structural and functional homology with Ser/Thr and  kinases, yet only five amino acids are invariant between the two groups of enzymes and these residues are all located within the nucleotide binding regions of the proteins. We have performed site-directed mutagenesis on all five conserved residues in the aminoglycoside kinase APH(3')-IIIa: (44) and (60) involved in ATP capture, a putative active site base required for deprotonating the incoming aminoglycoside hydroxyl group Asp(190), and the Mg(2+) ligands (195) and (208), which coordinate two Mg(2+) ions, Mg1 and Mg2. Previous structural and mutagenesis evidence have demonstrated that (44) interacts directly with the phosphate groups of ATP; mutagenesis of invariant (60), which forms a salt bridge with the epsilon-amino group of (44), demonstrated that this residue does not play a critical role in ATP recognition or catalysis. Results of mutagenesis of Asp(190) were consistent with a role in proper positioning of the aminoglycoside hydroxyl during phosphoryl transfer but not as a general base. The Mg1 and Mg2 ligand Asp(208) was found to be absolutely required for enzyme activity and the Mg2 ligand (195) is important for Mg.ATP recognition. The mutagenesis results together with solvent isotope, solvent viscosity, and divalent cation requirements are consistent with a dissociative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer where initial substrate deprotonation is not essential for phosphate transfer and where Mg2 and Asp(208) likely play a critical role in stabilization of a metaphosphate-like transition state. These results lay the foundation for the synthesis of transition state mimics that could reverse aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18786993>Molecular basis of the interaction between complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21) and Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein gp350.</a></h2><p>The binding of the Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein gp350 by complement receptor type 2 (CR2) is critical for viral attachment to B lymphocytes. We set out to test hypotheses regarding the molecular nature of this interaction by developing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the efficient analysis of the gp350-CR2 interaction by utilizing wild-type and mutant forms of recombinant gp350 and also of the CR2 N-terminal domains SCR1 and SCR2 (designated CR2 SCR1-2). To delineate the CR2-binding site on gp350, we generated 17 gp350 single-site substitutions targeting an area of gp350 that has been broadly implicated in the binding of both CR2 and the major inhibitory anti-gp350 monoclonal antibody (MAb) 72A1. These site-directed mutations identified a novel negatively charged CR2-binding surface described by residues -21, Asp-22, -155, Asp-208, -210, and Asp-296. We also identified gp350 amino acid residues involved in non-charge-dependent interactions with CR2, including -151, Ile-160, and Trp-162. These data were supported by experiments in which phycoerythrin-conjugated wild-type and mutant forms of gp350 were incubated with CR2-expressing K562 cells and binding was assessed by flow cytometry.

A detailed pharmacological analysis of receptor mutants possessing either increased constitutive activity or impaired activation or ligand recognition allowed us to propose key residues participating in intramolecular interaction  stabilizing receptor inactive or active conformations: (113) and (115) (TM III), Trp(256) and Phe(259) (TM VI), (295) (TM VII) which are homologous of the rhodopsin residues Gly(120), (122), Trp(265), (268), and (296), respectively. An essential experimental finding was the spatial proximity between (113), which is the cornerstone of inactive conformations, and Trp(256) which plays a subtle role in controlling the balance between active and inactive conformations. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis data showed that Trp(256) and (295) constitute, together with Gln(288), receptor contact points with original nonpeptidic ligands.

P1, which was radiolabelled by [14C]NEM only in the absence of NADP+, showed the following sequence; H2N---Pro-Val-Xaa--Gln-Val-- NEM.Cys-His-Pro--Phe--Gln-Ser--COOH (Xaa indicates a possible cysteine residue). This sequence was very similar to that of rat liver 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid/dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD/DD) (residues 184 to 201) and was also highly conserved in the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The sequence of P2, which had radioactivity in both the absence and presence of NADP+, also contained an NEM-modified cysteine and was similar in sequence to the regions located in loop A of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD. The present study suggests that P1, which may have a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-193 of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD, functions in the alteration of DD3 activity depending on the modulation of NADP(+)-binding ability through a thiol/disulphide exchange reaction similar to that of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD shown in our previous results; while P2, which may have a cysteine residue corresponding to Cys-145 of rat 3 alpha-HSD/DD, may be located near the surface of the enzyme molecule.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16519541>TNP-8N3-ADP photoaffinity labeling of two Na,K-ATPase sequences under separate Na+ plus K+ control.</a></h2><p>ATP has high- and low-affinity effects on the sodium pump and other P-type ATPases. We have approached this question by using 2',3'-O-(trinitrophenyl)-8-azidoadenosine 5'-diphosphate (TNP-8N(3)-ADP) to photoinactivate and label Na,K-ATPase, both in its native state and after covalent FITC block of its high-affinity ATP site. With the native enzyme, the photoinactivation rate constant increases hyperbolically with a K(D(TNP-8N)3(-)(ADP)) of 0.11 microM; TNP-ATP and ATP protect the site with high affinities. The inactivation does not require Na(+), but K(+) inhibits with a K(K)' of 12 microM; Na(+) reverses this effect, with a K(Na) of 0.17 mM. This pattern suggests that Na(+) and K(+) are binding at sites in their "intracellular" conformation. It was known that FITC did not abolish the reverse phosphorylation by P(i), or the K(+)-phosphatase activity, and that TNP-8N(3)-ADP could subsequently photoinactivate the latter with >100-fold lower affinity; in that case, the cation sites acted as if facing outward [Ward, D. G., and Cavieres, J. D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14277-14284, 33759-33765]. Native and FITC-modified enzymes have now been photolabeled with TNP-8N(3)-[alpha-(32)P]ADP and alpha-chain soluble tryptic peptides separated by reverse-phase HPLC. With native Na,K-ATPase, three labeled peaks lead to the unique sequence alpha-(470)Ile-Val--Ile-Pro-Phe--Ser-Thr--X--Gln-Leu-Ser-Ile-His-(487), the dropped residue being alphaLys480. With the FITC enzyme, instead, two independent labeling and purification cycles return the sequence alpha-(721)Ala-Asp-Ile-Gly-Val-Ala-Met-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-(736). These results suggest that Na,K-ATPase also has a low-affinity nucleotide binding region, one that is under distinctive allosteric control by Na(+) and K(+). Moreover, the cation effects seem compatible with a slow, passive Na(+)/K(+) carrier behavior of the FITC-modified sodium pump.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17123703>Comparison of codon usage and tRNAs in mitochondrial genomes of Candida species.</a></h2><p>To gain insight into the nature of the mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) of different Candida species, the synonymous codon usage bias of mitochondrial protein coding genes and the tRNAs in C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. stellata, C. glabrata and the closely related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed. Common features of the mtDNA in Candida species are a strong A+T pressure on protein coding genes, and insufficient mitochondrial tRNA species are encoded to perform protein synthesis. The wobble site of the anticodon is always U for the NNR (NNA and NNG) codon families, which are dominated by A-ending codons, and always G for the NNY (NNC and NNU) codon families, which is dominated by U-ending codons, and always U for the NNN (NNA, NNU, NNC and NNG) codon families, which are dominated by A-ending codons and U-ending codons. Patterns of synonymous codon usage of Candida species can be classified into three groups: (1) optimal codon-anticodon usage, , , Leu (translated by anti-codon UAA), Gln, Arg (translated by anti-codon UCU) and Trp are containing NNR codons. NNA, whose corresponding tRNA is encoded in the mtDNA, is used preferentially. (2) Non-optimal codon-anticodon usage, Cys, Asp, Phe, His, , Ser (translated by anti-codon GCU) and  are containing NNY codons. The NNU codon, whose corresponding tRNA is not encoded in the mtDNA, is used preferentially. (3) Combined codon-anticodon usage, Ala, Gly, Leu (translated by anti-codon UAG), Pro, Ser (translated by anti-codon UGA), Thr and Val are containing NNN codons. NNA (tRNA encoded in the mtDNA) and NNU (tRNA not encoded in the mtDNA) are used preferentially. In conclusion, we propose that in Candida species, codons containing A or U at third position are used preferentially, regardless of whether corresponding tRNAs are encoded in the mtDNA. These results might be useful in understanding the common features of the mtDNA in Candida species and patterns of synonymous codon usage.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696676>Severity of experimental traumatic brain injury modulates changes in concentrations of cerebral free amino acids.</a></h2><p>In this study, concentrations of free amino acids (FAA) and amino group containing compounds (AGCC) following graded diffuse traumatic brain injury (mild TBI, mTBI; severe TBI, sTBI) were evaluated.

Increase in  and Gln, depletion of NAA and Asp increase, suggested a link between NAA hydrolysis and excitotoxicity after sTBI. Additionally, sTBI rats showed net imbalances of the -Gln/GABA cycle between neurons and astrocytes, and of the methyl-cycle (demonstrated by decrease in Met, and increase in SAH and l-Cystat), throughout the post-injury period.

The enzyme consisted of a single-chain form with M(r) 30,000. Its hydrolytic properties toward synthetic substrates were similar to those of cathepsin L in other tissues.

It was revealed that 12 hours after haemodialysis a significant drop of the filtered amount of all investigated amino acids occurred. Renal clearance of Ser, Pro, , Gly, Ala, , Met, Leu and Cit after haemodialysis declined significantly (p < 0.05-0.001). Haemodialysis was not associated with significant changes of fractionated excretions (FE) of amino acids with the exception of Gly (p < 0.01) and Trp (p < 0.05) where an increase of FE was recorded. Hitherto assembled results are consistent with the idea that a reduction of the tubular resorption of amino acids in the residual nephrons in subjects with chronic renal failure cannot be explained by a change of their filtered amount (as "overflow" aminoaciduria) nor as the consequence of retention of some dialyzable substances which could inhibit tubular transport of amino acids. The reduced tubular transport of some of the investigated amino acids (Cys, , Cit, Met, +Gln, Orn, Ile) was significantly related with the drop of tubular sodium transport.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969427>Sequence composition and environment effects on residue fluctuations in protein structures.</a></h2><p>Structure fluctuations in proteins affect a broad range of cell phenomena, including stability of proteins and their fragments, allosteric transitions, and  transfer. This study presents a statistical-thermodynamic analysis of relationship between the sequence composition and the distribution of residue fluctuations in protein-protein complexes. A one-node-per-residue elastic network model accounting for the nonhomogeneous protein mass distribution and the interatomic interactions through the renormalized inter-residue potential is developed. Two factors, a protein mass distribution and a residue environment, were found to determine the scale of residue fluctuations. Surface residues undergo larger fluctuations than core residues in agreement with experimental observations. Ranking residues over the normalized scale of fluctuations yields a distinct classification of amino acids into three groups: (i) highly fluctuating-Gly, Ala, Ser, Pro, and Asp, (ii) moderately fluctuating-Thr, , Gln, , , Arg, Val, and Cys, and (iii) weakly fluctuating-Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, , Trp, and His. The structural instability in proteins possibly relates to the high content of the highly fluctuating residues and a deficiency of the weakly fluctuating residues in irregular secondary structure elements (loops), chameleon sequences, and disordered proteins. Strong correlation between residue fluctuations and the sequence composition of protein loops supports this hypothesis. Comparing fluctuations of binding site residues (interface residues) with other surface residues shows that, on average, the interface is more rigid than the rest of the protein surface and Gly, Ala, Ser, Cys, Leu, and Trp have a propensity to form more stable docking patches on the interface. The findings have broad implications for understanding mechanisms of protein association and stability of protein structures.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374643>Effects of systemic progesterone during the early luteal phase on the availabilities of amino acids and glucose in the bovine uterine lumen.</a></h2><p>The uterine histotroph provides essential nutrition to the developing conceptus during the preimplantation period of pregnancy. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of cycle stage and progesterone (P4) concentrations in the blood on the recoverable quantities of amino acids and glucose in the histotroph during the preimplantaion period of conceptus development. Following oestrus, dairy heifers were assigned to low, control or high P4 groups (n=6 heifers per treatment and time point). The uterine horn ipsilateral to the corpus luteum was flushed on either Day 7 or Day 13. The present study quantified 24 amino acids and glucose in the uterine flushings using HPLC and fluorometry, respectively. Heifers in the low P4 group had lower plasma concentrations of P4 throughout the cycle, whereas heifers in the high group had higher plasma concentrations of P4 between Days 3 and 7 compared with the control group (P<0.05). Total recoverable neutral (Ser, Gln, Gly, Thr, Cit, β-Ala, Tau, Ala, , Trp, Met, Val, Phe, Ile, Leu, Pro and Cys), acidic () and basic (His, Arg, Orn and ) amino acids were greater (P<0.05) on Day 13 than on Day 7. There was no significant difference in the amount of Asp or  between Day 7 and Day 13. The amount of amino acids recovered on Day 7 was similar across treatment groups. On Day 13, the amount of , His and Thr was lower (P<0.05) in the low P4 heifers compared with the controls and/or high P4 heifers. Quantities of glucose were not altered by cycle stage or P4 treatment.

The mutations were designed to alter the electrostatic environment of P, a bacteriochlorophyll dimer, without greatly affecting its structure or molecular orbitals. Two arginine residues at homologous positions in the L and M subunits [residues (L135) and (M164)], Asp (L155),  (L164), and Cys (L247) were changed independently. Arginine (L135) was replaced by , Leu, Gln, or ; Arg (M164), by Leu or ; Asp (L155), by ;  (L164), by Phe; and Cys (L247), by  or Asp. The R(L135)E/C(L247)K double mutant also was made. The shift in the E(m)() of P/P(+) was measured in each mutant and was compared with the effect predicted by electrostatics calculations using several different computational approaches. A simple distance-dependent dielectric screening factor reproduced the effects remarkably well. By contrast, microscopic methods that considered the reaction field in the protein and solvent but did not include explicit counterions overestimated the changes in the E(m)() considerably. Including counterions for the charged residues reduced the calculated effects of the mutations in molecular dynamics calculations. The results show that electrostatic interactions of P with ionizable amino acid residues are strongly screened, and suggest that counterions make major contributions to this screening. The screening also could reflect penetration of water or other relaxations not taken into account because of incomplete sampling of configurational space.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9271505>Functional effects on the acetylcholine receptor of multiple mutations of gamma Asp174 and delta Asp180.</a></h2><p>Residues gamma Asp174 and delta Asp180, previously implicated in the binding of acetylcholine (ACh) by the mouse muscle ACh receptor, were each mutated to nine other residues, , , Thr, Ala, Cys, His, Val, , and . The effects of the mutations on ACh-induced current was determined on surface receptors containing wild-type alpha and beta subunits and mutant gamma and delta subunits. The mutations increased the concentration of ACh eliciting half-maximal current (EC50) by factors from 22 for the  mutant to 660 for the  mutant. Analysis of the effects in terms of the difference in the accessible surface areas of the mutant and wild-type side chains and the difference in side-chain charges indicated that, per binding site, Delta DeltaG0 for activation was a sum of 10 cal mol-1 A-2 of change in side-chain accessible surface area and of 0.95 kcal mol-1 positive step-1 in side-chain charge, equivalent to 1 mol of charge falling through 42 mV. The effects on the concentration of ACh (IC50, ACh) and of d-tubocurarine (IC50,dTC) causing half-maximal retardation of alpha-bungarotoxin binding were determined on complexes containing wild-type alpha and beta subunits and either mutant gamma or mutant delta subunit. The effects on IC50,ACh correlated well with the effects on EC50, with a similar magnitude for the influence of side-chain charge on the free energy of binding (in this case to the desensitized state) and on the electrostatic potential at the binding site. The effects on IC50,dTC were in all cases less than the effects on IC50,ACh, and the two sets of effects were poorly correlated. In line with the higher ACh affinity and lower d-tubocurarine affinity of the alpha-delta binding site compared to the alpha-gamma binding site, mutations of delta Asp180 had a greater effect on IC50,ACh than did the same mutations of gamma Asp174, and vice versa for effects on IC50,dTC.

Thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide induced production of both t-PA and PAI-1 and the elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Baicalein isolated from Scutellariae Radix dose-dependently inhibited PAI-1 production induced by thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide; its concentrations for 50% inhibition (IC50) were 6.8 and 3.5 microM, respectively.

Barrows (44.2 +/- 1.3 kg of BW) were assigned to 4 diets in a randomized complete block design. Diets consisted of 16.1% CP with no CAA, and 12.8, 10.1, and 7.8% CP containing CAA. As the CP concentration decreased, CAA were gradually increased to meet requirements on a true ileal digestibility basis. Barrows were weighed on d 0 and 13. Blood samples were collected before the morning feeding on d 0, 6, and 12 (prefeeding), and 2 h after the morning feeding on d 13 (postfeeding). Pigs were euthanized on d 13, and liver and right LM were removed and weighed. The reduction in the dietary CP concentration linearly decreased (P < 0.01) ADG, G:F, LM weight, and the CP content of LM. Reducing the CP concentration decreased pre- and postfeeding plasma concentrations of IGF-I (linear, P < 0.01) and insulin (linear, P < 0.10). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased prefeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, Gln, Gly, and total AA but decreased Arg, , His, Ile, Phe, Trp, and  (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentration of total indispensable AA decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.01). The reduction in the dietary CP concentration increased postfeeding plasma concentrations of Ala, , Met (linear, P < 0.01), and Gly (linear, P = 0.073) and decreased , Ser, , Arg, His, and Leu (linear, P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of Ile, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05). In muscle tissue, concentrations of free Ala, Asp, , Gln, Gly, and  increased (linear, P < 0.05) as the dietary CP concentration decreased. Concentrations of free His, Ile, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val in muscle tissue decreased initially and increased thereafter as the dietary CP concentration decreased from 16.1 to 7.8% (quadratic, P < 0.05). In summary, the reduction in the dietary protein-bound AA decreased whole-body and LM growth, altered the free AA pool profile in muscle tissue, and decreased plasma insulin and IGF-I. As the replacement of protein-bound AA with CAA increased, 1) free Ala and Gln in muscle tissue increased, indicating an increase of muscle tissue protein breakdown; and 2) utilization of indispensable AA in muscle tissue decreased.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16926512>Effects of orally administrated amino acids on myofibrillar proteolysis in chicks.</a></h2><p>We examined the effects of orally administrated amino acids on myfibrillar proteolysis in food-deprived chicks.

Manganese exposure is considered to be an environmental risk factor connected to PD and PD-like syndrome. Research into the genetic and environmental risk factors involved in disease susceptibility has recently uncovered a link existing between Park9 and manganese. It seems that manganese binding to Park9 (YPk9) protein is involved in the detoxification mechanism exerted by this protein against manganese toxicity. In this study, we used potentiometric, mono- and bi-dimensional (TOCSY, HSQC) NMR, EPR and ESI-MS measurements to analyze complex formation and metal binding sites in the peptide fragment. Presumably octahedral species, in which the Mn(II) ion was bound to oxygens of the carboxyl groups of  and Asp, and species where the involvement of sulfur from Cys and nitrogen from His residues, depending on the metal to ligand molar ratio, were detected for manganese coordination. Structural changes in the 30-amino acid fragment were triggered by Zn(II) interaction. A general decrease in the intensity of NMR signals was detected, suggesting the occurrence of chemical exchange among some coordinated species in an intermediate NMR timescale.

The biological activity of siren insulin was not investigated in this study but the substitutions at B28 (involved in dimer formation) and at B14 and B17 (involved in hexamer formation) may be expected to influence conformation and therefore biological potency.

The amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation is as follows: A-chain (21-amino-acid peptide), H-Gly-Ile-Val--Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Ser-Pro-Cys-Ser-Leu--Asp-Leu--As n--Cys--OH; and B-chain (31-amino-acid peptide), H-Ala-Ala--Gln-His-Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser-His-Leu-Val--Ala-Leu--Leu-Va l-Cys-Gly--Arg-Gly-Phe-Phe--Thr-Pro---Val-OH. The sturgeon insulin appears to be identical with one of two forms of paddlefish insulin and differs from the other form by a single substitution in the A-chain, Asp15: His15. The amino acid sequence of sturgeon insulin is more similar to the amino acid sequence of mammalian insulins than of other fish insulins.

The studies presented in this paper, when compared with our previous results (Makowska et al., Spectrochim. Acta A 153: 451-456), show that the affinity of the peptide to metal ions is conformation-dependent. All the measurements were carried out in 20mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution, pH6.0. The Stern-Volmer equations, along with spectroscopic observations, were used to determine the quenching and binding parameters. The obtained results unequivocally suggest that Cu(2+) ions quench the fluorescence of HZ1 only through a static quenching mechanism, in contrast to the fragment from the N-terminal part of the FPB28 protein, with sequence Ac---Thr-Ala-Asp-Gly--Thr-- NH2 (D9) and its derivative with a single point mutation: Ac---Thr-Ala--Gly--Thr-- NH2 (D9_M), where dynamic quenching occurred. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔITCH, ΔITCS) for the interactions between Cu(2+) ions and the HZ1 peptide were determined from the calorimetric data. The conditional thermodynamic parameters suggest that, under the experimental conditions, the formation of the Cu(2+)-HZ1 complex is both an enthalpy and entropy driven process.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesize that a wholly different mechanism of deamidation might occur in the presence of aerobic nitric oxide (NO). Accordingly, we examined the deamidating ability of aerobic NO toward three model peptides, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-Pro-Gln-Gly, -Trp-Asp--Gln, and Ser----Pro-Ile-Val, incubating them with the NO-generating compound, Et(2)N[N(O)NO]Na (DEA/NO, 30-48 mM), in aerobic, pH 7.4, buffer at 37 degrees C. DNP-Pro--Gly was detected after 2 h, while -Trp-Asp-Asp-Gln, -Trp-Asp--, and Ser--Asp--Pro-Ile-Val were detected within 10 min, accumulating in apparent yields of up to approximately 10%. In the latter case, tyrosine nitration was also observed, producing the expected nitrotyrosine residue. DEA/NO solutions preincubated to exhaust the NO before the peptides were added did not induce detectable deamidation. The data demonstrate that aerobic NO exposures can lead to nitrosative deamidation of peptides, a pathway that differs from the established hydrolytic deamidation mechanism in several key respects: the by-products of the former are molecular nitrogen and an acid (HONO) while that of the latter is a base (NH(3)); the nitrosative path can in principle proceed in the absence of water molecules;  is much more easily deamidated than Gln in the hydrolytic pathway, while the two amino acid residues were deamidated to a similar extent by exposure to NO in the presence of oxygen.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23923535>Crystal structure of a novel phospholipase A2 from crude venom of Indian cobra sub-species Naja naja sagittifera at 1.48 angstoms resolution.</a></h2><p>Secretory phospholipase A2s (PLA2s), the structurally-homologous enzymes share a common qualitative catalytic site, but differ greatly in their pharmacological properties and toxicities. There has been a recognizable pattern of mutations in the primary sequence of PLA2s that alter their catalytic properties significantly. In the present study, the amino acid sequence and the three-dimensional structure of a new isoform of PLA2 from crude venom of Indian cobra sub-species Naja naja sagittifera (N.n.s.) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure has revealed several novel features of PLA2 folding and function. It contains 913 protein atoms and one each of Ca2+, phosphate and acetate ions with 142 solvent water molecules. A Ca2+ ion is present in the calcium-binding loop and forms a seven-fold coordination with a distorted pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. One of the coordination linkages is with the acetate ion, instead of the conserved water molecule. The presence of  at position 31 has a stabilizing effect on the loop  25-Cys 29 by interacting with carbonyl oxygen atoms of  25, Gly 26 and Cys 29. In turn, it lends stability to the Ca(2+)-binding loop as well. Another unique feature of the PLA2 structure is the formation of an intrastrand hydrogen bond, involving Ogamma of Thr 73 and Oepsilon2 of  71, thus helping the beta-wing to act as a sharp arrow for insertion into other molecules. Yet another important feature of this PLA2 pertains to the conformation of its C-terminal segment, which is stabilized by a unique hydrogen bond through carbonyl oxygen of  116 and Ndelta2 of  120. This structural feature may be useful in the molecular recognition of the PLA2 through C-terminal segment.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10820007>Snapping of the carboxyl terminal tail of the catalytic subunit of PKA onto its core: characterization of the sites by mutagenesis.</a></h2><p>A set of 45 mutants of the carboxyl terminal tail of the PKA catalytic subunit was prepared and used to assess the contribution of this tail to the structure and function of the kinase.

There are major differences in the interactions of the two types of protein-protein complex. Protease-inhibitor complexes interact predominantly through a main-chain-main-chain mechanism while antibody-antigen complexes interact predominantly through a side-chain-side-chain or a side-chain-main-chain mechanism. However, there is no simple correlation between the main-chain-main-chain interaction energy and the percentage of main-chain surface area buried on binding. The interaction energy is equally effected by the presence of nonrotameric side-chain conformations, which constitute approximately 20% of the interaction energy. The ability to reproduce the interface interaction energy of the crystal structure if original side-chain conformations are removed from the calculation is much greater in the protease-inhibitor complexes than the antibody-antigen complexes. The success of a rotameric model for protein-protein docking appears dependent on the extent of the main-chain-main-chain contribution to binding. Analysis of (1) residue type and (2) residue pair interactions at the interface show that antibody-antigen interactions are very restricted with over 70% of the antibody energy attributable to just six residue types ( > Asp >  > Ser >  > Trp) in agreement with previous studies on residue propensity. However, it is found here that 50% of the antigen energy is attributable to just four residue types (Arg =  >  > Asp). On average just 12 residue pair interactions (6%) contribute over 40% of the favorable interaction energy in the antibody-antigen complexes, with charge-charge and charge/polar-tyrosine interactions being prominent.

Its toxic function is related to zinc-endopeptidase activity of the N-terminal light chain (LC) on synaptosome-associated protein-25 kDa (SNAP-25) of the SNARE complex. To understand the determinants of substrate specificity and assist the development of strategies for effective inhibitors, we used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the effects of 13 polar residues of the LC on substrate binding and catalysis. Selection of the residues for mutation was based on a computational analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the LC modeled with a 17-residue substrate fragment of SNAP-25. Steady-state kinetic parameters for proteolysis of the substrate fragment were determined for a set of 16 single mutants. Of the mutated residues non-conserved among the serotypes, replacement of Arg-230 and Asp-369 by polar or apolar residues resulted in drastic lowering of the catalytic rate constant (k(ca)), but had less effect on substrate affinity (K(m)). Substitution of Arg-230 with  decreased the catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) by 50-fold, whereas replacement by Leu yielded an inactive protein. Removal of the electrostatic charge at Asp-369 by mutation to  resulted in 140-fold decrease in k(cat)/K(m). Replacement of other variable residues surrounding the catalytic cleft (-54, -63, -66, Asp-130, -161, -163, -170, -256), had only marginal effect on decreasing the catalytic efficiency, but unexpectedly the substitution of -165 with Leu resulted in fourfold increase in k(cat)/K(m). For comparison purposes, two conserved residues Arg-362 and -365 were investigated with substitutions of Leu and Phe, respectively, and their catalytic efficiency decreased 140- and 10-fold, respectively, whereas substitution of the tyrosine ring with  abolished activity. The altered catalytic efficiencies of the mutants were not due to any significant changes in secondary or tertiary structures, or in zinc content and thermal stability. We suggest that, despite the large minimal substrate size for catalysis, only a few non-conserved residues surrounding the active site are important to render the LC competent for catalysis or provide conformational selection of the substrate.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8546696>Characterization of an insulin from the three-toed amphiuma (Amphibia: Urodela) with an N-terminally extended A-chain and high receptor-binding affinity.</a></h2><p>Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of a urodele, the three-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma tridactylum), and its primary structure established as Ala-Arg-Gly-Ile-Val--Gln-Cys-Cys-His10--Thr-Cys- Ser-Leu--Gln-Leu--Asn20--Cys- for the A-chain and Ile-Thr--Gln--Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser-His10-Leu-Val--Ala- Leu--Leu-Val-Cys-Gly20-Asp-Arg-Gly-Phe-Phe--Ser-Pro- for the B-chain.

The mutations at L155, L164, and M164 have little effect on the absorption spectrum, whereas those at L135 and L247 shift the long-wavelength absorption band of P to higher energies. Fits to the ground-state absorption and hole-burned spectra indicate that the blue shift and increased width of the absorption band in the L135 mutants are due partly to changes in the distribution of energies for the zero-phonon absorption line and partly to stronger electron-phonon coupling. The initial electron-transfer kinetics are not changed significantly in most of the mutants, but the time constant increases from 3.0 +/- 0.2 in wild-type RCs to 4.7 +/- 0.2 in C(L247)D and 7.0 +/- 0.3 ps in C(L247)K. The effects of the mutations on the solvation free energies of the product of the initial electron-transfer reaction (P(+)) and the charge-transfer states that contribute to the absorption spectrum ( and ) were calculated by using a distance-dependent electrostatic screening factor. The results are qualitatively in accord with the view that electrostatic interactions of the bacteriochlorophylls with ionized residues of the protein are strongly screened and make only minor contributions to the energetics and dynamics of charge separation. However, the slowing of electron transfer in the Cys L247 mutants and the blue shift of the spectrum in some of the Arg L135 and Cys L247 mutants cannot be explained consistently by electrostatic interactions of the mutated residues with P and B(L); we ascribe these effects tentatively to structural changes caused by the mutations.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10542245>Interaction between collagen and the alpha(2) I-domain of integrin alpha(2)beta(1). Critical role of conserved residues in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) region.</a></h2><p>A docking model of the alpha(2) I-domain and collagen has been proposed based on their crystal structures (Emsley, J., King, S., Bergelson, J., and Liddington, R. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28512-28517). In this model, several amino acid residues in the I-domain make direct contact with collagen (-154, Asp-219, Leu-220, -256, His-258, -285, -289, Leu-291, -295, and -298), and the protruding C-helix of alpha(2) (residues 284-288) determines ligand specificity. Because most of the proposed critical residues are not conserved, different I-domains are predicted to bind to collagen differently. We found that deleting the entire C-helix or mutating the predicted critical residues had no effect on collagen binding to whole alpha(2)beta(1), with the exception that mutating -154, Asp-219, and His-258 had a moderate effect. We performed further studies and found that mutating the conserved surface-exposed residues in the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) (-157 and Gln-215) significantly blocks collagen binding. We have revised the docking model based on the mutagenesis data. In the revised model, conserved -157 makes contact with collagen in addition to the previously proposed -154, Asp-219, His-258, and -285 residues. These results suggest that the collagen-binding I-domains (e.g. alpha(1), alpha(2), and alpha(10)) bind to collagen in a similar fashion.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8351403>Primary structure of neuropeptide Y from brains of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis).</a></h2><p>The purification of NPY from brains of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) was achieved using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Alligator NPY is the first non-mammalian vertebrate to have 100% sequence identity to human NPY. The conservation of alligator NPY suggests that serine in position 7 of chicken NPY evolved after the birds and reptiles diverged from a common Archosaurian ancestor.

The growth kinetics, physiological state, and nutrient requirement profiles of S. thermophilus were analyzed in chemically defined media. The results showed that the intracellular ATP concentration, H -ATPase activity, NADH/NAD , and NH concentrations varied with intracellular pH. The nutrient components with the highest amounts required were Leu and Asp; ascorbic acid and p-amino benzoic acid; K and PO  ; and guanine and uracil. The nutrient components with the largest required ratios were Arg, His, and Met; folic acid, cyanocobalamine, biotin, and nicotinic acid; Ca and Mg ; and guanine and uracil. In this study, different nutrient components were primarily used at different phase. Trp, , calcium pantothenate, thiamine, guanine, and Mg were mainly used from late-lag to midexponential phase. Met, Pro, Phe, Ala, Gly, nicotinic acid, and riboflavin were mainly used from midexponential to late-exponential phase. The highest bioavailabilities of nutrient components were also found at diverse phase. Met, Leu, Ile, , , , Pro, Gly, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, adenine, uracil, inosine, and Ca had the highest bioavailability from late-lag to midexponential phase. Lactose, , Asp, His, Trp, Cys, Val, Arg, Phe, Ala, Ser, Thr, , folate and cobalamin, calcium pantothenate, ascorbic acid, thiamine, biotin, p-amino benzoic acid, vitamin B , K , Mg , guanine, xanthine, and PO  had the highest bioavailability from midexponential to late-exponential phase. This study elucidated the nutrient requirement profiles with culture time and biomass at various average growth rates during the growth of S. thermophilus.

Both radioligand binding with [125I][Lys5,(I2)7,MeLeu9, Nle10] NKA(4-10) and functional studies were performed and correlated. In membrane binding experiments loss of His1 and Lys2, or replacement of Lys2 with Ala did not substantially alter binding affinity of NKA. NKA(4-10) free acid was unable to compete with the radioligand. [Nle10]NKA(4-10) binding affinity to rat fundus membrane preparations was decreased when substituting Asp4 with Gln or , or Val7 with either  or Ile. Replacement of Ser5 with the negatively charged  also decreased the binding affinity, but substitution with the positively charged  substantially increased the affinity of [Nle10] NKA(4-10) for the NK-2 receptor. Lengthening NKA(4-10) or [Nle10]NKA(4-10) with Ala11 or Nle11, respectively, decreased the binding affinity of the peptide. In both binding and functional studies, replacement of any of the residues of NKA(4-10), except for Ser5, with alanine decreased the affinity of the peptide for the NK-2 receptor. Ala substitutions at positions 4, 6, and very obviously at 8, 9 and 10 of NKA(4-10) yielded peptides unable to achieve a maximum contractile response, although they did not demonstrate antagonist activity. These data confirm the importance of the NKA carboxyl terminus, and the requirement for Phe6, Val7, Gly8, Leu9 and Met10 integrity for interaction with the NK-2 receptor. They also suggest that Ser5 is a good site to target modifications leading to the design of new potential drugs.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19158091>Novel determinants of epithelial sodium channel gating within extracellular thumb domains.</a></h2><p>Activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) is modulated by Na(+) self-inhibition, an allosteric down-regulation of channel open probability by extracellular Na(+). We searched for determinants of Na(+) self-inhibition by analyzing changes in this inhibitory response resulting from specific mutations within the extracellular domains of mouse ENaC subunits. Mutations at gammaMet(438) altered the Na(+) self-inhibition response in a substitution-specific manner. Fourteen substitutions (Ala, Arg, Asp, Cys, Gln, , His, Ile, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, , and Val) significantly suppressed Na(+) self-inhibition, whereas three mutations (, Gly, and Leu) moderately enhanced the inhibition. Met to  mutation did not alter Na(+) self-inhibition. Mutations at the homologous site in the alpha subunit (G481A, G481C, and G481M) dramatically increased the magnitude and speed of Na(+) self-inhibition. Mutations at the homologous betaAla(422) resulted in minimal or no change in Na(+) self-inhibition. Low, high, and intermediate open probabilities were observed in oocytes expressing alphaG481Mbetagamma, alphabetagammaM438V, and alphaG481M/betagammaM438V, respectively. This pair of residues map to thealpha5 helix in the extracellular thumb domain in the chicken acid sensing ion channel 1 structure. Both residues likely reside near the channel surface because both alphaG481Cbetagamma and alphabetagammaM438C channels were inhibited by an externally applied and membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl reagent. Our results demonstrate that alphaGly(481) and gammaMet(438) are functional determinants of Na(+) self-inhibition and of ENaC gating and suggest that the thumb domain contributes to the channel gating machinery.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9219544>Envelope protein of parasitic wasp symbiont virus, polydnavirus, protects the wasp eggs from cellular immune reactions by the host insect.</a></h2><p>Cotesia kariyai polydnavirus (CkPDV) virions are present in the oviducts of C. kariyai wasp and are injected with eggs into the hemocoel of the host armyworm Pseudaletia separata larvae during parasitization. Evidence that the presence of polydnavirus particles on the surface of the wasp eggs may be essential for prevention of cellular immune reactions by the host hemocytes was obtained by isolating an immunoevasive factor from CkPDV virions. The purified proteinaceous factor protects foreign materials from adhesion and encapsulation by hemocytes of the host P. separata larvae but not by those of common cutworm Spodoptera litura larvae which is an incompatible host for the C. kariyai wasp.

Though many hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity scales have been generated, an "intrinsic" scale has yet to be achieved. "Intrinsic" implies the maximum possible hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of side chains in the absence of nearest-neighbor or conformational effects that would decrease the full expression of the side-chain hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity when the side chain is in a polypeptide chain. Such a scale is the fundamental starting point for determining the parameters that affect side-chain hydrophobicity and for quantifying such effects in peptides and proteins. A 10-residue peptide sequence, Ac-X-G-A-K-G-A-G-V-G-L-amide, was designed to enable the determination of the intrinsic values, where position X was substituted by all 20 naturally occurring amino acids and norvaline, norleucine, and ornithine. The coefficients were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using six different mobile phase conditions involving different pH values (2, 5, and 7), ion-pairing reagents, and the presence and absence of different salts.

In celiac disease (CD), the AA imbalance is frequently observed. Prebiotics are found to alleviate nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the impact of oligrofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1), administered for 3 months as a gluten-free diet (GFD) supplement to children with CD, on the plasma and urine concentrations of AAs. CD children (N = 34) were randomised into two groups, receiving Synergy 1 (10 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin) for 3 months. The AA profile and concentration was determined in plasma and urine before and after the dietary intervention by gas chromatography. 22 and 28 AAs were determined in plasma and urine samples, respectively. After the intervention, the plasma concentrations of several AAs (Ala, Pro, , , , , His, Orn) increased significantly in both experimental groups, while Gln increased only in the Synergy 1 group. The urinary excretion of ,  and Aaa increased significantly in the Synergy 1 group, and the excretion of Asp and Met decreased (p < 0.05) in the placebo group. The Gln: ratio in urine increased in both groups after the intervention. An increased urinary excretion of AAs observed in Synergy 1 group with a simultaneous increase in the content of circulating AAs could be attributed to higher absorption or intensified  of AAs, and on the other hand further healing of the intestinal mucosa being the result of continuous treatment with GFD. Moreover, the observed changes in  concentration suggest that oligofructose-enriched inulin could improve the intestinal condition and permeability.

These prodrug conjugates included SQV-cysteine-PEG3400, SQV-cysteine-PEG3400-biotin, SQV-cysteine(R.I.CK-Tat9) [a cationic retro-inverso-cysteine-lysine-Tat nonapeptide]-PEG3400, and SQV-cysteine(R.I.CK(stearate)-Tat9)-PEG3400. SQV was linked to cysteine to form a releasable SQV-cysteine ester bond in all of the conjugates. The amino group of the cysteine moiety provided an attachment site for a slower-degrading amide bond with N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated forms of PEG- and PEG-biotin. Disulfide bonds were used to attach the cationic peptides, R.I.CK-Tat9 and R.I.CK(stearate)-Tat9 to the cysteine moiety in order to provide cell-specific release. An assay was established and validated for measuring the activity of SQV and other protease inhibitors in biological samples. In this assay, cleavage of an internally quenched fluorescent substrate, Arg-(EDANS)-Ser-Gln---Pro-Ile-Val-Gly-(DABCYL)-Arg by HIV-1 protease was inhibited by SQV in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 0.05-0.5 microM. All prodrug conjugates were shown to be inactive in this assay until the ester bond was cleaved and active SQV was released. The prodrug reconversion half-lives in 0.1 N HCl, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and in spiked plasma at 37 degrees C were 9, 14, and 0.9 h, respectively. The anti-HIV-1 activity (ED(50)) of the PEG-based SQV prodrug conjugates was evaluated in MT-2 cells using an MTT assay. The activity of conjugated SQV was reduced (ED(50) = 900 nM) for the PEG only conjugate, but restored with the addition of biotin (ED(50) = 125 nM), R.I.CK-Tat9 (ED(50) = 15 nM), and R.I.CK(stearate)-Tat9 (ED(50) = 62 nM) as compared to maximum achievable anti-HIV-1 activity (unconjugated SQV, control, ED(50) = 15 nM), suggesting enhanced cellular uptake of conjugates. Cytotoxicity (LD(50)) was assessed for all prodrug conjugates using non-HIV-1 infected cells and was found to be in the micromolar range. The difference between the LD(50) and ED(50) suggests a favorable therapeutic index for the prodrug conjugates. In conclusion, these promising initial results demonstrate that the reconversion of the conjugate prodrugs was complete and that active SQV was released. Since the major delivery advantages of PEG prodrug conjugates can only be observed in vivo, issues of reconversion and elimination half-lives in plasma will have to be further studied in an in vivo model. The current results also demonstrate that the protease inhibition assay is a simple yet effective bioanalytical tool that can be used to assess the release and anti-HIV-1 activity of HIV-1 PIs from their prodrug forms.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902847>Effect of modification of all loop regions in the alpha- and beta-subunits of human choriogonadotropin on its signal transduction activity.</a></h2><p>Human choriogonadotropin (hCG), according to its three dimensional structure as determined by X-ray diffraction, has three beta-hairpin loops each in the alpha and beta subunit designated as alpha 1, alpha 2 alpha 3 and beta 1 beta 2 and beta 3, respectively. Since similar beta-hairpin loops in NGF and TNF beta have been implicated in their direct interaction with the receptor, it prompted the present investigation to determine the role of such loops in receptor binding and post-receptor signaling events in hCG. Based on the three dimensional structure of hCG, radical mutations were introduced in the alpha loops by replacing hydrophobic alpha 18Phe and alpha 74Phe by hydrophilic Thr residues in the alpha 1 and alpha 3 loops, respectively, and positively charged alpha 45Lys by negatively charged Asp in the helical segment in the alpha 2 loop. The beta loops were mutated by replacement of the beta 1, beta 2 and beta 3 sequences with the corresponding hFSH sequences. These replacements included beta 22Gly, beta 24Pro and beta 25Val with , Arg and Phe in beta 1, 45Leu Gln Gly Val Leu Pro Ala Leu Pro53 with    Pro Ala Arg Pro Leu Ile in beta 2 and 73Pro Arg Gly with Ala His His in the beta 3 loop. Six mutants, hCG alpha 1 beta, hCG alpha 2 beta and hCG alpha 3 beta and hCG alpha beta 1, hCG alpha beta 2 and h CG alpha beta 3, were obtained by co-infection of the insect High-Five cells with baculovirus containing mutant alpha or beta cDNAs and that containing complimentary wild type beta or alpha cDNAs. The mutants were almost completely secreted in the culture medium and were over expressed at levels ranging between 4.5 to 29 micrograms/ml indicating that mutations had no effect on the secretion or subunit assembly of hCG. In order to remove any contaminating beta-subunit, the culture medium was passed through a column of an hCG beta-specific monoclonal antibody, B158. The receptor binding activity of the mutant hCG alpha 1 beta, in which alpha 18Phe was replaced with Thr, increased almost 200% relative to rehCG. Similarly, increase in the cAMP and progesterone stimulation by the mutant ranged between 150 to 200%. This increase is believed to be due to a short range conformational change in the mutant as a result of the mutation rather than direct involvement of alpha 18Phe in the receptor binding. The evidence in support of this was derived from the fact that the affinity or interaction between the two subunits was impaired as indicated by the first order rate constant of hCG alpha 1 beta (km = 4.1 x 10(-2) min-1) at pH 3.0 at 23 degrees C which is one order of magnitude greater relative to rehCG (kw = 4.6 x 10(-3) min-1). All other mutations had no effect on the receptor binding or signal transduction of hCG indicating that, unlike NGF or TNF beta, beta-hairpin loops in hCG were not directly involved in receptor binding or post-receptor signaling events. However, since the mutation in the alpha 1 loop affects the receptor binding site, its presence in the vicinity of the alpha 1 loop is highly likely.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8143731>Human tumor necrosis factor mutants with preferential binding to and activity on either the R55 or R75 receptor.</a></h2><p>Previously, we reported that the cytotoxic activity of human (h) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on murine (m) L929 cells requires the integrity of three loops (positions 30-36, 84-88 and 138-150) which cluster around the interface between each two subunits of the trimeric hTNF structure. The collection of hTNF mutants was further characterized by their activity on various human cell systems as well as by their binding to the two types of hTNF receptor (R), R55 and R75. It turned out that two amino acids (Leu29 and Arg32) were specifically involved in hR75 binding, as Leu29-->Ser (L29S) and Arg32-->Trp (R32W) mutant molecules had largely lost binding to hR75, but not to hR55. In order to screen for more highly R55-specific mutants, nine other amino acids were inserted at these two positions; only the substitutions L29G and L29Y showed an increased differential binding as compared to L29S, while no further improvement was found with mutations at position 32 compared to R32W. Biological assays mediated either by hR55 or hR75 confirmed the results obtained by physical binding to purified receptors. A similar substitution in mTNF, Arg32-->, also resulted in a preferential loss of binding to hR75 and a large decrease in mR75-mediated bioactivity. Except for the double mutant L29S-R32W, all other tested amino acid substitutions in the loops at positions 30-36 or 84-88 of hTNF led to a substantial loss of affinity for both receptors and a concomitant reduction of biological activity. In the loop at positions 138-150, the non-conservative replacement of  by  at position 146 (E146K) resulted in an even lower binding to R75 as compared to R32W, while binding on and bioactivity through R55 was only slightly reduced. Remarkably, a reversed differential binding was observed after substitution at position 143 in hTNF; replacing Asp by non-conservative residues such as , Phe or  resulted in a much larger decrease in binding to R55 than to R75. In conclusion, receptor-specific mutants such as R32W, E146K and D143N can be used to study the function either of R55 or R75 on different human cell types. In vivo, we presume that the R55-specific mutants will retain antitumor activity in the absence of R75-dependent, severe side effects.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11036021>Fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae: contributions of type II topoisomerase mutations and efflux to levels of resistance.</a></h2><p>We report on amino acid substitutions in the quinolone resistance-determining region of type II topisomerases and the prevalence of reserpine-inhibited efflux for 70 clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae for which the ciprofloxacin MIC is >/=4 microgram/ml and 28 isolates for which the ciprofloxacin MIC is </=2 microgram/ml.

Maximum levels of response to TRH in oocytes expressing wild-type TRH-Rs were indistinguishable from those of oocytes expressing receptors mutated to , , or Asp in position 105. However, the EC50 values for activation of oocyte responses increased more than 500 times in oocytes expressing mutant Glu105 receptors, in which the amido group of Gln105 has been removed by site-directed mutagenesis. Charge effects do not seem to be involved in the huge effect of mutating Gln105 to , since mutation of Gln105 to Asp induces only a 15-fold increase in EC50. Furthermore, no change in EC50 is observed after mutation of Asn110 to Asp. The affinity shift (identified by changes in EC50 values for systems of comparable efficacy) in Glu105 mutant receptors was partially recovered in oocytes expressing Asn105 mutant receptors. These results and those obtained after substitution of , Leu, , and Ser for Gln105 suggest that the presence and the correct position of the Gln hydrogen bond-donor amido group are important for normal functionality of the receptor. In wild type or Asp105 mutant receptors showing the same maximal responses, decreases in affinity with TRH and methyl-histidyl-TRH correlated with increased dissociation rates of hormone from the receptor. Rapid dilution experiments following subsecond stimulation indicate that the TRH-R is converted rapidly from a form showing fast dissociation kinetics to a form from which the hormone dissociates slowly. Mutation of residue 105 impairs the receptor shift between these two forms. This effect was demonstrated in a direct way by comparing [3H]methyl-histidyl-TRH dissociation rates in COS-7 cells transfected with either wild type or Asp105 mutant TRH-Rs. Thus, residues located in transmembrane helix III positions equivalent to those of the counterions for biogenic amines, regulate hormone-receptor interactions in the TRH receptor (and perhaps other receptors). Furthermore, the nature of the amino acid in these positions may also play a role, directly or indirectly, in conformational changes leading to receptor activation, and hence to signal transduction.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9685374>Identification of active site residues in the "GyrA" half of yeast DNA topoisomerase II.</a></h2><p>Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out at 10 highly conserved polar residues within the C-terminal half of yeast DNA topoisomerase II, which corresponds to the A subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase, to identify amino acid side chains that augment the active site tyrosine -782 in the breakage and rejoining of DNA strands. Complementation tests show that alanine substitution at Arg-690, Asp-697, -700, Arg-704, or Arg-781, but not at His-735, His-736, -738, Gln-750, or -828, inactivates the enzyme in vivo. Measurements of DNA relaxation and cleavage by purified mutant enzymes show that these activities are abolished in the R690A mutant and are much reduced in the mutants D697A, K700A, R704A, and R781A. When a Y782F polypeptide with a phenylalanine substituting for the active site tyrosine was expressed in cells that also express the R690A polypeptide, the resulting heterodimeric yeast DNA topoisomerase II was found to nick plasmid DNA. Thus in a dimeric wild-type enzyme, -782 in one protomer and Arg-690 in the other cooperate in trans in the catalysis of DNA cleavage. For the residues D697A, K700A, R704A, and R781A, their locations in the crystal structures of type II DNA topoisomerase fragments suggest that Arg-781 and -700 might be involved in anchoring the 5' and 3' sides of the broken DNA, respectively, and the roles of Asp-697 and Arg-704 are probably less direct.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10801319>Crystallographic evidence for  157 functioning as the active site base in human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase.</a></h2><p>UDP-galactose 4-epimerase catalyzes the interconversion of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose during normal galactose . In humans, deficiencies in this enzyme lead to the complex disorder referred to as epimerase-deficiency galactosemia. Here, we describe the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of human epimerase in the resting state (i.e., with bound NAD(+)) and in a ternary complex with bound NADH and UDP-glucose. Those amino acid side chains responsible for anchoring the NAD(+) to the protein include Asp 33,  37, Asp 66,  157, and  161. The glucosyl group of the substrate is bound to the protein via the side-chain carboxamide groups of  187 and  207. Additionally, O(gamma) of Ser 132 and O(eta) of  157 lie within 2.4 and 3.1 A, respectively, of the 4'-hydroxyl group of the sugar. Comparison of the polypeptide chains for the resting enzyme and for the protein with bound NADH and UDP-glucose demonstrates that the major conformational changes which occur upon substrate binding are limited primarily to the regions defined by  199 to Asp 240 and Gly 274 to  308. Additionally, this investigation reveals for the first time that a conserved tyrosine, namely  157, is in the proper position to interact directly with the 4'-hydroxyl group of the sugar substrate and to thus serve as the active-site base. A low barrier hydrogen bond between the 4'-hydroxyl group of the sugar and O(gamma) of Ser 132 facilitates proton transfer from the sugar 4'-hydroxyl group to O(eta) of  157.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8536944>Urotensin II from the river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), and the paddlefish (Polyodon spathula).</a></h2><p>Urotensin II was isolated from extracts of the whole brain of the river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).

The primary structure of the paddlefish urotensin II (Gly-Ser-Thr-Ser--Cys-Phe-Trp---Cys-Val) is the same as that of another chondrostean, the sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus).

Insulin was isolated from an extract of the pancreas of N. forsteri and its primary structure established as: A-Chain, Gly-Ile-Val--Gln-Cys-Cys-His-Thr-Pro(10)-Cys-Ser-Leu--Gln-Leu-G lu---Cys(20)---Thr-; B-Chain, Ala-Ala-Val--Gln-His-Leu-Cys-Gly-Ser(10)-His-Leu-Val--Ala-Leu- -Phe-Val-Cys(20)-Gly--Arg-Gly-Phe-Phe--Leu-Pro- (30)-Gly. This amino acid sequence is more similar to that of human insulin than to insulins from present-day amphibians. All the residues in human insulin that are considered to be important in receptor binding, dimerization, and hexamerization are conserved in lungfish insulin except for the substitution (Leu --> Phe) at the position corresponding to B17 in human insulin. Consistent with the assertion that the Dipnoi is a monophyletic group, insulins from N. forsteri and from the African lungfish Protopterus annectens contain extensions to the C-terminus of the A-chain and to the N-terminus of the B-chain that have not been found in other sarcopterygian species. However, the unusual amino acid substitutions found in insulin from P. annectens (e.g., GlyB21 --> Ala, GluB22 --> Asp, and ArgB23 --> ) are not present in N. forsteri insulin, suggesting that they occurred in the Protopterus lineage after divergence of the genera.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7685964>HIV-1-specific reverse transcriptase inhibitors show differential activity against HIV-1 mutant strains containing different amino acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase.</a></h2><p>Serial passage of HIV-1 in CEM or MT-4 cell cultures in the presence of different HIV-1-specific reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors yielded mutant viruses which were resistant (i.e., 200- to 1000-fold less sensitive) to the homologous compounds.

The free carboxyl-terminus is important for the function of several peptide hormones, including neurotensin. Therefore, for the pGEV-NT(1-13) construct, the C-terminal pGEV-encoded 6xHis tag was removed and an N-terminal 8xHis tag was introduced for affinity purification. To facilitate removal of tags using CNBr cleavage, a methionine was introduced at the N-terminal of the peptide. Furthermore, this pGEV-NT(1-13) plasmid was used as a template to include a Pro-7 to Met mutation for CNBr cleavage, giving NT(8-13), the sub-fragment crucial for the biological activity of this peptide. These two constructs are being used to produce uniformly labelled NT(1-13) and NT(8-13) in high yield and in a cost effective way, using cheap (15)N and/or (13)C source.

Treatment of mesangial cells with cAMP-elevating agents causes fragmentation of stress fibers, loss of the vitronectin receptor from sites of focal adhesion, and produces a change in shape from a flat to a more arborized configuration. These effects are prevented by both thrombin and SFLL. Thrombin and SFLL also initiate biochemical signaling events in mesangial cells by stimulating the  of phospholipids. Both thrombin and SFLL stimulate release of inositol phosphates from [3H]inositol-labeled cells, elevation of cytosolic calcium, the formation of [3H]myristic acid-labeled diacylglycerol, an increase in the mass of diacylglycerol, 32P incorporation into phospholipids, and release of unesterified [3H]arachidonic acid from cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid. When present together, the effects of SFLL and thrombin on diacylglycerol formation, arachidonic acid production, and inositol phosphate production were not additive. This suggested that SFLL and thrombin were acting on the same receptor. This was further supported by our observations that cells pretreated with SFLL and subsequently exposed to thrombin (or vice versa) did not show elevated cytosolic calcium. We also show that phospholipase D is activated by demonstrating production of radiolabeled phosphatidylethanol when cells are treated with SFLL in the presence of ethanol. These findings indicate that SFLL can be used to study the receptor-mediated effects of thrombin in mesangial cells, thereby avoiding thrombin's proteolytic actions.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11983426>Legumain from bovine kidney: its purification, molecular cloning, immunohistochemical localization and degradation of annexin II and vitamin D-binding protein.</a></h2><p>Legumain (asparaginyl endopeptidase) was purified to homogeneity from bovine kidneys.

This sequence is highly homologous to the sequences in the N-terminal of pig kidney legumain. We screened a bovine kidney cortex cDNA library using a DNA probe that originated from rat legumain, and we determined the bovine kidney cDNA structure and deduced the amino acid sequence. The cDNA is composed 1934 bp and encodes 433 amino acids in the coding region. The enzyme was strongly stained in the proximal tubules of the rat kidney in an immunohistochemical study. Vitamin D-binding protein which is known to be a ligand to megalin existing in the proximal tubules, was cleaved in a limited proteolytic manner by bovine kidney legumain.

Here, we investigate the mechanism of this enhancement by analyzing the effects of alanine mutations of six putative antithrombin exosite residues and three complementary protease exosite residues on antithrombin reactivity with these proteases in unactivated and heparin-activated states. Mutations of antithrombin (253) and His(319) exosite residues produced massive 10-200-fold losses in reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in both unactivated and heparin-activated states, indicating that these residues made critical attractive interactions with protease independent of heparin activation. By contrast, mutations of (233), Arg(235), (237), and (255) exosite residues showed that these residues made both repulsive and attractive interactions with protease that depended on the activation state and whether the critical (253)/His(319) residues were mutated. Mutation of factor Xa Arg(143), (148), and Arg(150) residues that interact with the exosite in the x-ray structure of the Michaelis complex confirmed the importance of all residues for heparin-activated antithrombin reactivity and Arg(150) for native serpin reactivity. These results demonstrate that the exosite is a key determinant of antithrombin reactivity with factors Xa and IXa in the native as well as the heparin-activated state and support a new model of allosteric activation we recently proposed in which a balance between attractive and repulsive exosite interactions in the native state is shifted to favor the attractive interactions in the activated state through core conformational changes induced by heparin binding.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17383581>The biodistribution of NC100668 and the effect of excess NC100668 on the biodistribution and kidney retention of (99m)Tc-NC100668 in the rat.</a></h2><p>(99m)Tc-NC100668 is being developed to aid the diagnosis of thromboemboli. The purpose of this study was to investigate if the presence of excess NC100668 interferes with the biodistribution and blood clot uptake of (99m)Tc-NC100668. The secondary aim was to investigate the causes underlying the kidney retention of (99m)Tc-NC100668.The uptake of a (14)C-labelled analogue of NC100668, as well as (99m)Tc-NC100668, into plasma (in vitro) and blood (in vivo) clots was determined. The biodistribution of (99m)Tc-NC100668 at a range of NC100668 doses was studied in normal Wistar rats and those bearing experimentally induced deep venous thrombosis. The biodistribution of a negative control peptide and (99m)Tc-NC100668 plus L-lysine was studied in healthy male Wistar rats.The biodistribution as well as plasma clot uptake of [-U-(14)C]NC100668 and (99m)Tc-NC100668 was similar. Apart from some reduction in kidney retention, the biodistribution and uptake of radioactivity into the blood clot were not significantly affected by the presence of up to 1000 times the clinical dose of NC100668. Kidney retention of radioactivity could be more effectively reduced by coadministration of 889 microg/kg NC100668 than 450 mg/kg L-lysine. A negative control peptide with no affinity for FXIIIa demonstrated very little kidney retention.The biodistribution and blood clot uptake of (99m)Tc-NC100668 and [-U-(14)C]NC100668 are similar. With the exception of the kidneys, (99m)Tc-NC100668 biodistribution and blood clot uptake are unaffected by the presence of unlabelled NC100668. The kidney retention of radioactivity is probably due to transglutaminase activity and, to a lesser extent, nonspecific charge-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844736>Structure and binding studies of proliferating cell nuclear antigen from Leishmania donovani.</a></h2><p>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr--Ser--Val--Ala--Val--Ala--Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp---Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg---Gly--Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala--Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224--Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, -Arg-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser-Met-Thr-Asp-Phe--His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and -Thr-Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser-Phe-Phe-Thr-Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29±0.09μM, 0.37±0.08μM, 0.35±0.09μM and 1.20±0.08μM respectively.

The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approx. 185,000 and 200,000 on Superdex 200 column chromatography and non-denatured PAGE, respectively, and to be 58,000 and 61,000 on SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-ME), respectively. These findings suggested that the enzyme is composed of three identical subunits. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates -Ala-MCA and Gly-Pro-MCA at acidic pH. The Km and V(max) values of DPP II at optimal pH (pH 6.0) were 1330 microM and 2.9 mumol/mg per min for Gly-Pro-MCA, and 360 microM and 1.43 mumol/mg per min for -Ala-MCA, respectively. It was strongly inhibited by diisopropylphosphofluoride (DFP), and moderately by 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). These findings suggest that DPP II is a serine peptidase. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was also strongly inhibited by copper ions. The amino-acid sequence of the first 41 residues of the enzyme was determined as Ala1-Ser-Pro-Pro--Pro-Gly-Phe-Arg- Glu10-Val--Phe--Gln-Leu-Leu-Asp-His-Phe20--Phe-- Arg-Phe- Gly---Thr-Phe30-Arg-Gln-Arg-Phe-Leu-Val-Ser-Asp--Phe40 -Trp.

Two of those are reported in this paper. In Hb Villeparisis, the beta 77 (EF1) His--> mutation is identical to that of Hb Fukuyama while the other mutation, beta 80 (EF4) -->Ser, has not yet been described. These 2 abnormalities are located almost within interacting distance. They lead to decreased oxygen affinity and, according to molecular simulations, to a remodeling of the surface of the molecule. Hb Corbeil associates 2 substitutions, that of Hb E [beta 26 (B8) -->], and of Hb Sherwood Forest [beta 104 (G6) Arg-->Thr], which are far from one another. The resulting properties consist only in the additive effects of both abnormalities. Hb Corbeil is, thus, a thalassemic Hb, like Hb E, and a molecule having altered oxygen binding properties, characterized by decreased heterotropic effects, similar to those of Hb Sherwood Forest. The simultaneous presence of more than 1 structural abnormality leads to a large spectrum of possible consequences on the function of the molecule, from local effects to a perturbation of intermolecular interactions. The genetic mechanism resulting in Hb with more than 1 point mutation is discussed: in some cases it is very likely that the second mutation arose on a chromosome already carrying a point mutation, in contrast a single mutational event involving a micro gene conversion has been proposed in other cases.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1459125>Characterization of peptides related to neuropeptide tyrosine and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine from the brain and gastrointestinal tract of teleost fish.</a></h2><p>Neuropeptide Y was isolated from the brain of the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua and its primary structure established as -Pro-Ile*--Pro-*--Pro-Gly-Glu10-Asp-Ala-Pro-Ala-Asp*-G lu*-Leu*-Ala- *-Tyr20--Ser-Ala-Leu-Arg-His--Ile--Leu30-Ile-Thr -Arg-Gln-Arg-- CONH2.

Trout neuropeptide Y contains four substitutions (Ile3-->Val, Ala14-->Thr, Asp15--> and Ser22-->Thr) compared with cod neuropeptide Y. A second peptide of the neuropeptide Y family was identified in the trout brain and this component was structurally similar to peptide tyrosine-tyrosine previously isolated from frog intestine (six amino acid substitutions) and identical to a peptide isolated from the pancreas of the closely related species, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Coho salmon). Peptide tyrosine-tyrosine, with the same primary structure as the brain peptide, was also isolated from an extract of the trout stomach. The data indicate that a peptide analogous to mammalian neuropeptide Y is present in the brain of teleost fish and a peptide analogous to mammalian peptide tyrosine-tyrosine is present in brain, gastrointestinal tissue and pancreas.

The  profile of (99m)Tc-NC100668 exposed to human and rat hepatic S9 (a liver homogenate-rich cytochrome P450) was also studied. The profile of (99m)Tc-labeled species in plasma, urine, and bile was investigated following i.v. administration of (99m)Tc-NC100668 to rat. The major species observed in vitro and in vivo consisted of the (99m)Tc-chelator (NC100194) [N,N-Bis(N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-(hydroxylimino-)propyl)aminoethyl)aminoethylamine] attached to the C-terminal amino acid residue and referred to as (99m)Tc-complex of Gly-NC100194.

The minor metabolites were sodium pertechnetate ((99m)Tc) and (99m)Tc-NC100194. In addition, a small number of other species were transiently observed in vitro; they were not investigated further. The biodistribution of the major metabolite was studied in male Wistar rats. The affinity of the major metabolite toward plasma clot was established using a plasma clot-forming assay. A minor uptake of (99m)Tc-complex of Gly-NC100194 in the plasma clot and a rapid removal from the body were noted.

The pulse-dosages of AA were 75, 150, 300, and 600 mmol. Polyethylene glycol was used as the liquid marker. Rates of apparent degradation during the first 60 min (initial degradation) varied markedly among the AA; rates were highest for Ser, , , and Gln and lowest for , Val, Arg, and His. At the 75-mmol dosage, which corresponded to an initial substrate concentration of about 1 mM of rumen fluid, initial degradation varied between 95 and 40% of the dosage, depending on the AA. Rates, expressed as percentages of the dosage, decreased as dosages increased. During the first 8 h after administration, escape of the AA increased from a mean of 9% at the lowest dosage to a mean of 21% at the highest dosage. At the highest dosage, Met caused a net increase in the concentration of 11 of the other AA in rumen fluid. Twelve of the AA administered caused a net increase in the concentration of Ala in rumen fluid. Methionine and  are among the AA considered to be limiting to milk yield.

In the present study, the structural basis for the recognition of two RI ligands, human angiogenin (Ang) and bovine RNase A, has been investigated by site-specific mutagenesis of human RI and Ang. The RI residues examined were those that appear to form strong contacts with RNase A in the crystal structure of the porcine RI x RNase A complex [Kobe, B. & Deisenhofer, J. (1995) Nature (London) 374, 183-186] that would not be replicated in the Ang complex. Ala substitutions of five of these residues (-287, -320, -401, Cys-408, and Arg-457) were found to have little or no effect on binding of RNase A. In contrast, replacements of -434, Asp-435, and -437 and deletion of the C-terminal residue Ser-460 substantially weakened affinity for RNase A: the losses of binding energy associated with the mutations were 5.9, 3.6, 2.6, and 3.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus these four residues, which are neighbors in the tertiary structure, appear to constitute a "hot spot" for the RNase A interaction. However, only one of them, Asp-435, was equally important for binding of Ang; the Ki increases produced by mutations of the others were 20- to 93-fold smaller for Ang than for RNase A. Consequently, -434 plays a significant but lesser role in the Ang complex, whereas -437 and Ser-460 make only minor contributions. Ala mutations of four Ang residues (His-8, Gln-12, -68, and -108) that correspond to RI contacts on RNase A produced no major changes in affinity for RI. These findings indicate that RI uses largely different interactions to achieve its extremely tight binding of RNase A and Ang.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9172371>Specificity of an extracellular proteinase from Brevibacterium linens ATCC 9174 on bovine beta-casein.</a></h2><p>The specificity of the extracellular proteinase from Brevibacterium linens ATCC 9174 on bovine beta-casein was studied.

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 ± 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less  and Thr than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 ± 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free -Thr-Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 °C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 °C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, , Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, , Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, Thr, and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum  and  were higher, and Cys and  were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and  were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.© The Author(s) 2019.

A synthetic peptide of 14 amino acids corresponding to the sequence of the newly generated N-terminus was found to possess thrombin-like activity in several cells endowed with thrombin receptors. The relaxant and contractile effects of this thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP, Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg--Pro--Asp----Pro-Phe) were investigated in porcine pulmonary arteries and compared with the action of thrombin. In PGF2 alpha-precontracted vessels with intact endothelium, TRAP (0.3-10 mumol/l) caused reversible transient and concentration-dependent relaxation which was absent after mechanical removal of the endothelium. Preincubation of the vessels with NG-nitro-L-arginine (200 mumol/l) markedly reduced the relaxation. The TRAP-induced relaxation was associated with an increase in cGMP in the arteries. In comparison to thrombin, TRAP (EC50: 0.8 mumol/l) was less potent by more than three orders of magnitude. In endothelium-denuded pulmonary arteries TRAP (1-20 mumol/l) caused a concentration-dependent contraction which was reversible after washout. The TRAP-induced contractile response was preceded by an increase in generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3); the peak of IP3 accumulation was reached after 30 s. Compared with the contractile effect of thrombin, that of TRAP was weaker by three of magnitude. The vascular effect of TRAP was not inhibited by the thrombin inhibitors hirudin or heparin while the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (0.1 mumol/l) preferentially inhibited the tonic phase of contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8289284>Determination of alpha-helix propensity within the context of a folded protein. Sites 44 and 131 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of different amino acids on the structure and stability of an alpha-helix in the context of a globular protein, all 19 naturally-occurring amino acids were substituted for Ser44 in phage T4 lysozyme. A more restricted set of nine replacements was also made for Val131. Ser44 and Val131 are two of a very limited number of possible sites in T4 lysozyme that are well within alpha-helices, are solvent-exposed and relatively free of interactions with neighboring residues, and are not involved in crystal contacts. High resolution structures for the majority of the mutants, some of which crystallized non-isomorphously with wild-type, were determined. With the exception of proline, the amino acid substitutions caused little if any perturbation of the alpha-helix backbone. Also the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and Ile show no indication of either side-chain or backbone distortion. Therefore, other than proline, there is no evidence that differences in helix propensities are associated with different amounts of strain introduced into the helix. For reference, and also to allow estimates of side-chain entropy, a survey was made of side-chain conformations in 100 well-refined protein structures. As noted previously all side-chains within alpha-helices strongly avoid the g- conformation (chi 1 approximately 60 degrees). This restricts the beta-branched residues Thr, Val and Ile to a single conformer (g+, chi 1 approximately -60 degrees). Asp, , Met and Ser within helices also overwhelmingly prefer the g+ conformation. For Arg, Cys, Gln, , Leu and  the t (chi 1 approximately 180 degrees) and g+ conformers are populated roughly equally. Only the aromatic residues, His, , Trp and Phe prefer the t conformation. These preferences are the same whether the side-chain is buried or solvent-exposed. In general, the side-chain conformations adopted by the residues substituted at positions 44 and 131 correspond to the most commonly observed conformation for the same amino acid in helices in known protein structures. The changes in protein stability for the replacements at site 131 in general agree well with those at site 44 (correlation r = 0.97), suggesting that these may be representative of substitutions at fully solvent-exposed sites in the middle of alpha-helices. The free energy values also agree quite well with those observed for equivalent replacements in a number of soluble alpha-helical model peptides and with data from "host-guest" studies and statistical surveys (r = 0.69 to 0.93).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11279165>Crystal structure of activated CheY. Comparison with other activated receiver domains.</a></h2><p>The crystal structure of BeF(3)(-)-activated CheY, with manganese in the magnesium binding site, was determined at 2.4-A resolution. BeF(3)(-) bonds to Asp(57), the normal site of phosphorylation, forming a hydrogen bond and salt bridge with Thr(87) and (109), respectively. The six coordination sites for manganese are satisfied by a fluorine of BeF(3)(-), the side chain oxygens of Asp(13) and Asp(57), the carbonyl oxygen of (59), and two water molecules. All of the active site interactions seen for BeF(3)(-)-CheY are also observed in P-Spo0A(r). Thus, BeF(3)(-) activates CheY as well as other receiver domains by mimicking both the tetrahedral geometry and electrostatic potential of a phosphoryl group. The aromatic ring of (106) is found buried within a hydrophobic pocket formed by beta-strand beta4 and helix H4. The tyrosine side chain is stabilized in this conformation by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of (89). This hydrogen bond appears to stabilize the active conformation of the beta4/H4 loop. Comparison of the backbone coordinates for the active and inactive states of CheY reveals that only modest changes occur upon activation, except in the loops, with the largest changes occurring in the beta4/H4 loop. This region is known to be conformationally flexible in inactive CheY and is part of the surface used by activated CheY for binding its target, FliM. The pattern of activation-induced backbone coordinate changes is similar to that seen in FixJ(r). A common feature in the active sites of BeF(3)(-)-CheY, P-Spo0A(r), P-FixJ(r), and phosphono-CheY is a salt bridge between (109) Nzeta and the phosphate or its equivalent, beryllofluoride. This suggests that, in addition to the concerted movements of Thr(87) and (106) (Thr- coupling), formation of the (109)-PO(3)(-) salt bridge is directly involved in the activation of receiver domains generally.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10874031>Inhibition of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase by calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha through Ser847 phosphorylation in NG108-15 neuronal cells.</a></h2><p>We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) at Ser(847) by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) attenuates the catalytic activity of the enzyme in vitro (Hayashi Y., Nishio M., Naito Y., Yokokura H., Nimura Y., Hidaka H., and Watanabe Y. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 20597-20602). In the present study we determined that CaM kinase IIalpha (CaM-K IIalpha) can directly phosphorylate nNOS on Ser(847), leading to a reduction of nNOS activity in cells. The phosphorylation abilities of purified CaM kinase Ialpha (CaM-K Ialpha), CaM-K IIalpha, and CaM-kinase IV (CaM-K IV) on Ser(847) were analyzed using the synthetic peptide nNOS-(836-859) (--Arg--Ser---Val-Arg-Phe--Ser-Val-Ser-Ser--Ser- Asp-Ser-Arg--Ser-Ser-Gly) from nNOS as substrate. The relative V(max)/K(m) ratios of CaM kinases for nNOS-(836-859) were found to be as follows: CaM-K IIalpha, 100; CaM-K Ialpha, 54.5; CaM-K IV, 9.1. Co-transfection of constitutively active CaM-K IIalpha1-274 but not inactive CaM-K IIalpha1-274, generated by mutation of (42) to Ala, with nNOS into NG108-15 cells, resulted in increased Ser(847) phosphorylation in the presence of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP)1 and PP2A, with a concomitant inhibition of NOS enzyme activity. In addition, this latter decrease could be reversed by treatment with exogenous PP2A. Cells expressing mutant nNOS (S847A) proved resistant to phosphorylation and a decrease of NOS activity. Thus, our results indicate that Ca(2+) triggers cross-talk signal transduction between CaM kinase and NO and CaM-K IIalpha phosphorylating nNOS on Ser(847), which in turn decreases the gaseous second messenger NO in neuronal cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400241>From topical antidote against skin irritants to a novel counter-irritating and anti-inflammatory peptide.</a></h2><p>The primary purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of the counter-irritating activity of topical iodine against skin lesions induced by chemical and thermal stimuli. The hypothesis that iodine exerts its activity by inducing an endogenous anti-inflammatory factor was confirmed by exposing guinea pig skin to heat stimulus followed by topical iodine treatment and skin extraction. Injection of the extract into naïve guinea pigs reduced heat-induced irritation by 69%. The protective factor, identified as a new nonapeptide (histone H2A 36-44, H--Gly---Ala--Arg-Ileu-Ala-OH), caused reduction of 40% in irritation score in heat-exposed guinea pigs. The murine analog (H--Gly-His--Ala--Arg-Val-Gly-OH, termed IIIM1) reduced sulfur mustard (SM)-induced ear swelling at a dose-dependent bell-shape manner reaching peak activity of 1 mg/kg. Cultured keratinocytes transfected with the peptide were more resistant towards SM than the control cells. The peptide suppressed oxidative burst in activated neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the peptide reduced glucose oxidase-induced skin edema in mice at a dose-dependent bell-shape manner. Apart from thermal and chemical-induced skin irritation this novel peptide might be of potential use in chronic dermal disorders such as psoriasis and pemphigus as well as non-dermal inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, arthritis and colitis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733187>Molecular dynamics of sialic acid analogues complex with cholera toxin and DFT optimization of ethylene glycol-mediated zinc nanocluster conjugation.</a></h2><p>Cholera is an infectious disease caused by cholera toxin (CT) protein of bacterium Vibrio cholerae. A sequence of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuNAc or Neu5Ac) analogues modified in its C-5 position is modelled using molecular modelling techniques and docked against the CT followed by molecular dynamics simulations. Docking results suggest better binding affinity of NeuNAc analogue towards the binding site of CT. The NeuNAc analogues interact with the active site residues :11, :12, HIS:13, GLY:33, :34, :51, GLN:56, HIE:57, ILE:58, GLN:61, TRP:88, :90 and :91 through intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Stable nature of CT-N-glycolyl-NeuNAc, CT-N-Pentanoyl-NeuNAc and CT-N-Propanoyl-NeuNAc complexes was verified through molecular dynamics simulations, each for 40 ns using the software Desmond. All the nine NeuNAc analogues show better score for drug-like properties, so could be considered as suitable candidates for drug development for cholera infection. To improve the enhanced binding mode of NeuNAc analogues towards CT, the nine NeuNAc analogues are conjugated with Zn nanoclusters through ethylene glycol (EG) as carriers. The NeuNAc analogues conjugated with EG-Zn nanoclusters show better binding  towards CT than the unconjugated nine NeuNAc analogues. The electronic structural optimization of EG-Zn nanoclusters was carried out for optimizing their performance as better delivery vehicles for NeuNAc analogues through density functional theory calculations.

It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of obesity and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L-Val N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-Phe, D-, D-Orn and D-. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, Val, Thr, Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+), Glx (+Gln), Met, Phe, , Orn and . Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D-Phe and higher values were found in the GDM group.

Following injection of [-U-14C]NC100668 (labeling close to the C-terminal amino acid), radioactivity was cleared more slowly, with only 8% recovered in urine and approximately 80% of the radioactivity present in the body after 3 days. The highest concentration of radioactivity in the body following injection of [-U-14C]NC100668 was observed in the kidney inner cortex; this probably represents 14C-labeled , which is reabsorbed in the kidney tubules and incorporated into protein . Metabolite profiling by high-performance liquid chromatography with radiochemical detection revealed that following injection of [-U-14C]NC100668, there is a rapid appearance in blood of one peak containing radioactive metabolite(s) originating from the N-terminal part of the molecule.

Absorption ability of the mammary gland was not reduced in vivo. Relationships between mammary arteriovenous differences and arterial concentrations were positive and linear in every cow for all AA except , Ser, Gly, and Ala. Some essential AA (, Arg, and branched-chain AA) were therefore taken up in excess of their output into milk proteins, but others (His, Thr, Met, and Phe) were almost exclusively extracted by the udder in a direct ratio to their output.

To elucidate the structural mechanisms of DNA binding and selective dimerization of CREB, we determined to 3.0 A resolution, the structure of the CREB bZIP (residues 283-341) bound to a 21-base pair deoxynucleotide that encompasses the canonical 8-base pair somatostatin cAMP response element (SSCRE). The CREB dimer is stabilized in part by ionic interactions from Arg(314) to (319') and (328) to (333') as well as a hydrogen bond network that links the carboxamide side chains of Gln(322')-(321)-(321')-Gln(322). Critical to family selective dimerization are intersubunit hydrogen bonds between basic region residue (307) and leucine zipper residue (312), which are conserved in all CREB/CREM/ATF-1 family members. Strikingly, the structure reveals a hexahydrated Mg(2+) ion bound in the cavity between the basic region and SSCRE that makes a water-mediated DNA contact.

The aim of this study was to define the topology and structure of the CRP site that binds C1q, the recognition protein of the classical pathway. We have previously reported that residue Asp(112) of CRP plays a major role in the formation of the C1q-binding site, while the neighboring (114) hinders C1q binding. The three-dimensional structure of CRP shows the presence of a deep, extended cleft in each protomer on the face of the pentamer opposite that containing the phosphocholine-binding sites. Asp(112) is part of this marked cleft that is deep at its origin but becomes wider and shallower close to the inner edge of the protomer and the central pore of the pentamer. The shallow end of the pocket is bounded by the 112-114 loop, residues 86-92 (the inner loop), the C terminus of the protomer, and the C terminus of the pentraxin alpha-helix 169-176, particularly (175). Mutational analysis of residues participating in the formation of this pocket demonstrates that Asp(112) and (175) are important contact residues for C1q binding, that (88) influences the conformational change in C1q necessary for complement activation, and that (158) and His(38) probably contribute to the correct geometry of the binding site. Thus, it appears that the pocket at the open end of the cleft is the C1q-binding site of CRP.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177028>Ammonium mediated changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolisms induce resistance against Pseudomonas syringae in tomato plants.</a></h2><p>Predominant NH nutrition causes an "ammonium syndrome" that induces  changes and thereby provides resistance against Pseudomonas syringae infection through the activation of systemic acquired acclimation (SAA). Hence, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying NH-mediated SAA, the changes in nutrient balance and C and N skeletons were studied in NH-treated plants upon infection by P. syringae. A general decrease in cation and an increase in anion levels was observed in roots and leaves of NH-treated plants. Upon NH-based nutrition and infection, tomato leaves showed an accumulation of S, P, Zn, and of Mn. Mn accumulation might be required for ROS detoxification since it acts as a cofactor of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Primary  was modified in both tissues of NH-fed plants to counteract NH toxicity by decreasing TCA intermediates.

Three types of regions were present in the hydrophobic core of both proteins: stabilizing clusters and destabilizing clusters, defined as three or more consecutive core residues of either stabilizing (Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Phe, and ) or destabilizing (Gly, Ala, Cys, Ser, Thr, , Gln, Asp, , His, Arg, , and Trp) residues, and intervening regions that consist of both stabilizing and destabilizing residues in the hydrophobic core but no clusters. Subsequently, we designed a series of two-stranded coiled-coils to determine what defines a destabilizing cluster and varied the length of the destabilizing cluster from 3 to 7 residues to determine the length effect of the destabilizing cluster on protein stability. The results showed a dramatic destabilization, caused by a single Leu to Ala substitution, on formation of a 3-residue destabilizing cluster (DeltaT(m) of 17-21 degrees C) regardless of the stability of the coiled-coil. Any further substitution of Leu to Ala that increased the size of the destabilizing cluster to 5 or 7 hydrophobic core residues in length had little effect on stability (DeltaT(m) of 1.4-2.8 degrees C).

SERCA2b displayed a 10-fold decrease in the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from E1Ca2 relative to SERCA2a (i.e. SERCA2b enzyme manifests true high affinity at cytosolic Ca2+ sites) and a lower rate of dephosphorylation. These fundamental kinetic differences explain the increased apparent affinity for activation by cytosolic Ca2+ and the reduced catalytic turnover rate in SERCA2b. Relative to SERCA1a, both SERCA2 isoforms displayed a 2-fold decrease of the rate of E2 to E1Ca2 transition. Furthermore, seven DD mutants were expressed at similar levels as wild type. The expression level was 2-fold reduced for Gly23 -->  and Ser920 -->  and 10-fold reduced for Gly749 --> Arg.

To identify the residues binding to the amino-terminal basic amino acid of the substrate, rat cDNA encoding ApB was cloned into pGEX-4T-3 so that recombinant protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein. Twelve acidic amino acid residues ( or Asp) in ApB were replaced with a Gln or  using site-directed mutagenesis. These mutants were isolated to characterize the kinetic parameters of enzyme activity toward Arg-NA and compare them to those of the wild-type ApB. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the mutant D405N was 1.7 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), markedly decreased compared with that of the wild-type ApB (6.2 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)). The replacement of Asp405 with an  residue resulted in the change of substrate specificity such that the specific activity of the mutant D405N toward -NA was twice that toward Arg-NA (in the case of wild-type ApB; 0.4). Moreover, when Asp405 was replaced with an Ala residue, the kcat/Km ratio was 1000-fold lower than that of the wild-type ApB for hydrolysis of Arg-NA; in contrast, in the hydrolysis of -NA, the kcat/Km ratios of the wild-type (1.1 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) and the mutated (8.2 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1)) enzymes were similar. Furthermore, the replacement of Asp-405 with a  residue led to the reduction of the kcat/Km ratio for the hydrolysis of Arg-NA by a factor of 6 and an increase of that for the hydrolysis of -NA. Then the kcat/Km ratio of the D405E mutant for the hydrolysis of -NA was higher than that for the hydrolysis of Arg-NA as opposed to that of wild-type ApB.

As expected, hydrophobic and slightly polar amino acids are commonly found in the hydrophobic core of the membrane whereas aromatic (Trp and ), Pro, and the hydrophilic amino acids (, His, and Gln) occur more frequently in the interface regions. Charged amino acids are also statistically prevalent outside the hydrophobic core of the membrane, and whereas acidic amino acids are frequently found at both cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic interfaces, basic amino acids cluster at the cytoplasmic interface.

Python insulin was slightly more potent (1.8-fold) than human insulin in inhibiting the binding of [125I--A14] insulin to the soluble full-length recombinant human insulin receptor but was slightly less potent (1.5-fold) than human insulin for inhibiting binding to the secreted extracellular domain of the receptor.

Role of beta-turn structure in the vicinity of the Arg- cleavage site.</a></h2><p>Proline residues located near the processing sites of human prosomatostatin were previously shown to be important for cleavage of the precursor into somatostatin 28 and somatostatin 14 [Gomez, S., Boileau, G., Zollinger, L., Nault, C., Rholam, M. & Cohen, P. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 2911-2916]. In this study, site-directed and regional mutagenesis of the human prosomatostatin cDNA coupled with analysis by circular-dichroism and Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopies of the native and mutated peptide sequences were used to elucidate the role of proline in proteolytic processing. Glycine was substituted for proline a position -5 and the beta-turn-promoting sequence Pro-Arg--Arg, located near the somatostatin-14 cleavage site and predicted to form a beta-turn structure, was replaced by Ser-Ser--Arg or --Gly-Arg, which have been shown by X-ray diffraction to form beta turns in other proteins. Analysis of the prosomatostatin-derived peptides produced by expression of the mutated cDNA species in Neuro2A cells indicated that while Pro-5-->Ala abolished cleavage at the dibasic site, the formation of mutants [Gly-5] prosomatostatin, [Ser-5, Ser-4, Arg-3] prosomatostatin and [-5, -4, Gly-3] prosomatostatin did not affect cleavage at the dibasic site but produced modifications in both the relative proportions of the generated hormones and in precursor processing efficiency. Moreover, spectroscopical analysis showed that whereas these substitutions did not modify the presence of a beta turn structure in the corresponding peptide sequences, replacement of Pro-5-->Ala resulted in a dramatic increase in alpha-helix accompanied by the significant decrease of other structures including beta turn. The data support the hypothesis that the proline residue near the processing site for somatostatin-14 production is an important structural feature for conferring on the cleavage domain the adequate conformation for accessibility to processing enzymes and permitting production of equivalent amounts of both hormones.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12836065>Syntheses of two neuromedin U (NMU) analogues and their comparative reducing food intake effect in rats.</a></h2><p>To examine the roles of aromatic rings  residues at positions 1 and 6 and Phe residues at positions 16, 17 and 19 of rat neuromedin U-23 (NMU-23) (--Val----Gln-Gly-Pro-Val-Ala-Pro-Ser-Gly-Phe-Phe-Leu-Phe-Arg-Pro-Arg--NH(2)) for reducing food intake activity in male Wistar rats, two NMU-23 analogues, [Phe(4F)(16,17,19)]NMU-23 and [(Me)(1,6)]NMU-23, were synthesized by Fmoc strategy of manual solid-phase method.

Desensitization induced by NT was rapid and monophasic with 85% of the initial response lost by a 30-s exposure. Once initiated, the rate and extent of desensitization were similar for different concentrations of a given agonist, for agonists of different potencies, and for agonists of different efficacies, which suggests that desensitization may be independent of receptor occupancy or agonist efficacy. Resensitization was a much slower process, requiring 60 min before the full agonist response to NT was recovered. ATP, via P2-purinoceptors, also activated cellular acidification rates in a concentration-dependent manner. ATP induced a biphasic desensitization of purinoceptors with a loss of ca. 50% of the initial stimulation detectable between 30 and 90 s of exposure to the agonist. Desensitization of NT receptors did not influence the activation of P2-purinoceptors by ATP, suggesting there was no heterologous desensitization between the two types of receptors. Superfusion with NT receptor agonists for 15 min at concentrations that did not elicit changes in extracellular acidification rates blocked, in a concentration-dependent manner, the agonist response induced by 100 nM NT. This may reflect sequestration of the receptor. These results suggest that the high agonist affinity state of NT receptors may modulate receptor sequestration, whereas activation of the low agonist affinity state may be linked to cellular . Comparison of our results with published data found differences as well as similarities of NT responses among three lines of HT-29 cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1475012>Isolation and characterization of hypothalamic growth-hormone releasing factor from common carp, Cyprinus carpio.</a></h2><p>A growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF)-like peptide was isolated from the hypothalamus of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, by acid extraction, gel filtration chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography using antiserum directed against rat GRF, and multiple steps of HPLC using octadecyl columns.

The enzyme from Escherichia coli is composed of two identical subunits. The structures of the enzyme/UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose complexes, in which the catalytic nucleophile His 166 has been replaced with a glycine residue, have been determined and refined to 1.8 A resolution by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Crystals employed in the investigation belonged to the space group P2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 68 A, b = 58 A, c = 189 A, and beta = 100 degrees and two dimers in the asymmetric unit. The models for these enzyme/substrate complexes have demonstrated that the active site of the uridylyltransferase is formed by amino acid residues contributed from both subunits in the dimer. Those amino acid residues critically involved in sugar binding include  153 and Gly 159 from the first subunit and  311, Phe 312, Val 314,  316,  317, and Gln 323 from the second subunit. The uridylyltransferase is able to accommodate both UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose substrates by simple movements of the side chains of  317 and Gln 323 and by a change in the backbone dihedral angles of Val 314. The removal of the imidazole group at position 166 results in little structural perturbation of the polypeptide chain backbone when compared to the previously determined structure for the wild-type enzyme. Instead, the cavity created by the mutation is partially compensated for by the presence of a potassium ion and its accompanying coordination sphere. As such, the mutant protein structures presented here represent valid models for understanding substrate recognition and binding in the native galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500966>Statistical analysis of atomic contacts at RNA-protein interfaces.</a></h2><p>Forty-five crystals of complexes between proteins and RNA molecules from the Protein Data Bank have been statistically surveyed for the number of contacts between RNA components (phosphate, ribose and the four bases) and amino acid side chains. Three groups of complexes were defined: the tRNA synthetases; the ribosomal complexes; and a third group containing a variety of complexes. The types of atomic contacts were a priori classified into ionic, neutral H-bond, C-H...O H-bond, or van der Waals interaction. All the contacts were organized into a relational database which allows for statistical analysis. The main conclusions are the following: (i) in all three groups of complexes, the most preferred amino acids (Arg, , Ser, ) and the less preferred ones (Ala, Ile, Leu, Val) are the same; Trp and Cys are rarely observed (respectively 15 and 5 amino acids in the ensemble of interfaces); (ii) of the total number of amino acids located at the interfaces 22% are hydrophobic, 40% charged (positive 32%, negative 8%), 30% polar and 8% are Gly; (iii) in ribosomal complexes, phosphate is preferred over ribose, which is preferred over the bases, but there is no significant preference in the other two groups; (iv) there is no significant prevalence of a base type at protein-RNA interfaces, but specifically Arg and  display a preference for phosphate over ribose and bases; Pro and  prefer bases over ribose and phosphate; Met, Phe and  prefer ribose over phosphate and bases. Further, Ile, Pro, Ser prefer A over the others; Leu prefers C; Asp and Gly prefer G; and  prefers U. Considering the contact types, the following conclusions could be drawn: (i) 23% of the contacts are via potential H-bonds (including CH...O H-bonds and ionic interactions), 72% belong to van der Waals interactions and 5% are considered as short contacts; (ii) of all potential H-bonds, 54% are standard, 33% are of the C-H...O type and 13% are ionic; (iii) the Watson-Crick sites of G, O6(G) and principally N2(G) and the hydroxyl group O2' is more often involved in H-bonds than expected; the protein main chain is involved in 32% and the side chains in 68% of the H-bonds; considering the neutral and ionic H-bonds, the following couples are more frequent than expected-base A-Ser, base G-Asp/, base U-. The RNA CH groups interact preferentially with oxygen atoms (62% on the main chain and 19% on the side chains); (iv) the bases are involved in 38% of all H-bonds and more than 26% of the H-bonds have the H donor group on the RNA; (v) the atom O2' is involved in 21% of all H-bonds, a number greater than expected; (vi) amino acids less frequently in direct contact with RNA components interact frequently via their main chain atoms through water molecules with RNA atoms; in contrast, those frequently observed in direct contact, except Ser, use instead their side chain atoms for water bridging interactions.Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10973966>The critical role of the conserved Thr247 residue in the functioning of the osmosensor EnvZ, a histidine Kinase/Phosphatase, in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>The histidine kinase/phosphatase EnvZ helps Escherichia coli adapt to osmotic shock by controlling the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor OmpR, which regulates the levels of the outer membrane porin proteins OmpF and OmpC.

Using purified C-terminal domains of wild-type and mutant EnvZ proteins, we demonstrate that Thr(247) plays a vital role in EnvZ function, variously affecting its autokinase and phosphotransferase activities, but mostly its function as a phosphatase.

The linear analogue [Arg91,Ala96]MBP(87-99), in which Arg substitutes Lys91 and Ala substitutes Pro96, was found to be a strong inhibitor which when administered to Lewis rats together with the encephalitogenic agonist MBP(72-85) completely prevented the induction of EAE. In contrast, three N- and C-termini amide-linked cyclic semi-mimetic peptides, [cyclo-Phe-Arg--Ile-Val-Thr-Ala-Acp (1), cyclo-Phe-Ala-Arg-Gln-Acp (2), cyclo--Ala--Gln-Acp (3)] as well as a  side chain and C-terminous cyclic semi mimetic peptide cyclo(, Acp)-Phe---Ile-Val-Thr-Ala-Acp (4) which contain segments of MBP(87-99) or are constituted from immunophoric residues of copolymer 1, were ineffective in inducing or inhibiting EAE in Lewis rats.

Moreover blockade of MBP(72-85) induced EAE by the unrelated peptide [Arg91,Ala56]MBP(87-99) could indicate that the mechanism of inhibition is not due to binding competition but rather due to the delivery of a negative signal by the antagonist which overcomes the agonist response possibly through the activation of antigen specific regulatory T cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20614939>Chromatographic separation and tandem MS identification of active peptides in potato protein hydrolysate that inhibit autoxidation of soybean oil-in-water emulsions.</a></h2><p>A previously developed antioxidative potato protein hydrolysate was fractionated using gel filtration.

We recently established a mouse model of a psychophysiological stress-induced chronic sleep disorder (CSD) characterized by reduced amplitude of circadian wheel-running activity and sleep-wake cycles, sleep fragmentation and hyperphagia. Here, we evaluate day-night fluctuations in plasma concentrations of free amino acids (FAA), appetite hormones and prolactin as well as the hepatic expression of circadian clock-related genes in mice with CSD (CSD mice). Nocturnal increases in wheel-running activity and circadian rhythms of plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly disrupted in CSD mice. Hyperphagia with a decreased leptin/ghrelin ratio was found in CSD mice. Day-night fluctuations in plasma FAA contents were severely disrupted without affecting total FAA levels in CSD mice. Nocturnal increases in branched-chain amino acids such as Ile, Leu, and Val were further augmented in CSD mice, while daytime increases in Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, , Arg, His, , Met, Cys, , and  were significantly attenuated. Importantly, the circadian expression of hepatic clock genes was completely unaffected in CSD mice.

Glycation, the reaction of sugars with free amino groups of proteins, is one of a variety of non-enzymic post-translational modifications. The aim of the present study was to identify some of the most reactive proteins in the lens when incubated under physiological conditions. Fresh intact bovine lenses were incubated with [14C]glucose in a conventional tissue-culture medium with added antibiotics. After 3 and 6 days of incubation, the water-soluble proteins were separated by size-exclusion chromatography. Glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions were separated by using a sugar affinity column (Affi-Gel 601). Then the radioactive fractions were identified on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the whole bovine lenses were incubated with 10 mM fructose and glucose for 3 and 6 days. The glycated proteins from the water-soluble fractions in parallel with the radioactive fractions were separated by affinity chromatography, and were identified further by amino-acid sequencing. A progressive uptake of radioactive label showed that the majority of proteins incorporating both glucose and fructose were water-soluble fractions. Chromatography and SDS/polyacrylamide gel results showed that alpha- and gamma-crystallin and some proteins of a mean molecular mass of 36-37 kDa incorporated sugars early during incubation. After 6 days of incubation, more crystallins were glycated compared with 3 days, in particular beta-crystallin. Affinity-chromatography results indicated that proteins with subunit masses of 36 kDa and 20 kDa were possibly radiolabelled at an early stage. The purified glycated proteins following incubation with both glucose and fructose, which corresponded to 20 kDa and 36 kDa bands on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, were sequenced by Edman degradation. N-terminal sequences of both 20 kDa bands were Gly--Ile-Thr, characteristic of gamma-crystallins, but the N-termini of both 36 kDa bands were blocked. Further sequencing after digestion of 36 kDa bands with trypsin and running on HPLC revealed that the glucose sample gave the peptide sequences as Gly---Pro-Asp--Gln-Gln and --Leu-Pro---Arg, which match with bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin. The peptide sequence --Leu-Pro---Arg is only present in the published sequence of bovine gammaIIIb-crystallin and not in any other type of gamma-crystallin. The fructose sample gave the peptide sequences Ile-Thr-Phe---Asp-Arg, Arg-Gly-Asp--Pro-Asp--Gln-Gln-Trp, Gln--Leu-Leu-Arg and Val-Val-Asp-Leu-, which all matched with bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. The sequence Val-Val-Asp-Leu- only appears in the sequence of bovine gammaIIIa-crystallin. gammaIII-Crystallin is the most susceptible lens protein to glycation. The primary target of glucose is gammaIIIb-crystallin, whereas that of fructose is gammaIIIa-crystallin. The early glycation of gammaIII-crystallin by glucose and fructose could result in structural alterations, leading to aggregation of crystallin and eventually cataract formation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15687374>Endothelin (ET)-1-induced inhibition of ATP release from PC-12 cells is mediated by the ETB receptor: differential response to ET-1 on ATP, neuropeptide Y, and dopamine levels.</a></h2><p>During sympathetic neurotransmitter release, there is evidence for differential modulation of cotransmitter release by endothelin (ET)-1. Using nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells, the effects of ET-1 on K(+)-stimulated release of ATP, dopamine (DA), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography or radioimmunoassay. ET-1, in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited the release of ATP, but not DA and NPY. Preincubation with the ET(A/B) antagonist, PD 142893 (N-acetyl-beta-phenyl-D-Phe-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp), reversed the inhibitory effect of ET-1 on ATP release, which remained unaffected in the presence of the ET(A)-specific antagonist BQ123 [cyclo(D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu-D-Trp)].

Preincubation of PC12 cells with pertussis toxin reversed the ET-1-induced inhibition of the K(+)-evoked ATP release. Real-time intracellular calcium level recordings were performed on PC-12 cell suspensions, and ET-1 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the K(+)-evoked calcium levels. Nifedipine, the L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel antagonist, caused inhibition of the K(+)-stimulated ATP release, but the N-type Ca(2+) channel antagonist, omega-conotoxin GVIA, did not reverse the effect on ATP release. These data suggest that ET-1 modulates the release of ATP via the ET(B) receptor and its associated G(i/o) G-protein through attenuation of the influx of extracellular Ca(2+) through L-type channels.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9687021>Isolation and characterization of an alanyl aminopeptidase from rat liver cytosol as a puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidase.</a></h2><p>Alanyl aminopeptidase (AAP-S) was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytosol. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was calculated to be approximately 100,000 on Sephacryl S-200 HR and to be 90,000 on SDS-PAGE in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. These findings suggested that the enzyme exists as a monomeric form in rat liver cytosol. The enzyme rapidly hydrolyzed the substrates Ala-, - and Met-MCAs, and moderately hydrolyzed Arg-, -, Leu-, Phe- and -Ala-MCAs at pHs ranging from 7.5to 8.0. The enzyme also hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order for k(cat)/Km values of AAP-S at the optimal pH (pH 7.5) was ->Met->Arg->Ala->Leu->Phe->->-Ala-MCAs. It was strongly inhibited by bestatin, leuhistin, actinonin, amastatin, 1, 10-phenanthroline, PCMBS, Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+ and Hg2+, and puromycin. The amino acid sequence of the first 43 residues of the enzyme was determined as Pro1---Arg-Pro5-Phe--Arg-Leu-Pro10-Thr--Val-Ser-Pro 15-Ile---Ser-Leu20-(Cys)-Leu--Pro-Asp25-Leu-Leu- Asp-Phe-Thr30-Phe--Gly--Leu35--Ala-Ala-Ala-Gln40 -Val-Arg-Gln-. This N-terminal amino acid sequence is almost identical with those of puromycin-sensitive enkephalin-degrading aminopeptidases in rat and human brains, and the mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A. These findings suggest that the AAP-S from rat liver cytosol is a puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase.

RC-RNase, the most active among frog ribonucleases, has a unique base preference for pyrimidine-guanine rather than pyrimidine-adenine in RNase A. Residues of RC-RNase involved in base specificity and catalytic activity were determined by site-directed mutagenesis, k(cat)/K(m) analysis toward dinucleotides, and cleavage site analysis of RNA substrate. The results show that Pyr-1 (N-terminal pyroglutamate), -9, and -38 along with His-10, -35, and His-103 are involved in catalytic activity, whereas Pyr-1, Thr-39, Thr-70, -95, and -97 are involved in base specificity. The cytotoxicity of RC-RNase is correlated, but not proportional to, its catalytic activity. The crystal structure of the RC-RNase.d(ACGA) complex was determined at 1.80 A resolution. Residues -9, His-10, -35, and His-103 interacted directly with catalytic phosphate at the P(1) site, and -9 was stabilized by hydrogen bonds contributed by Pyr-1, -28, and -38. Thr-70 acts as a hydrogen bond donor for cytosine through Thr-39 and determines B(1) base specificity.

A cysteine residue attached to the N-terminus of the peptide during synthesis allowed coupling in a specific orientation via the thiol group to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet haemocyanin. Antiserum raised in rabbits bound specifically to CYP1A2 in the rat and mouse. To determine those amino acid residues involved in binding of the antibody, related peptides of various lengths were synthesised and the binding of the antibody was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These studies show that the minimum epitope is the C-terminal tripeptide sequence, -Asp-. Other than in rat and mouse CYP1A2, this tripeptide is found as an internal sequence in a large number of proteins including bovine fibronectin, chicken gizzard myosin heavy chain, and the P450 enzymes, rabbit CYP3A6 and human CYP3A4, but the antibody did not bind to any of these proteins. However, the antibody did bind to yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in which the tripeptide sequence is the C-terminus. Antibodies raised against a truncated peptide (--Asp-), representing the C-terminal half of the peptide, also bound to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, but failed to bind to CYP1A2; thus although the C-terminal region of the peptide 290-296 is strongly immunogenic, it appears that it is not this population of antibodies that binds to CYP1A2. As antibodies were found to bind strongly to the C-terminus of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the C-termini of proteins as targets for anti-peptide antibodies were investigated further by immunising rabbits with four 5-residue peptides which represent the C-termini of the P450 enzymes, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP2A6. The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin through their N-termini via cysteine residues added to the sequences. All four antisera bound specifically to their respective target proteins, as demonstrated by immunoblotting using hepatic microsomal fractions from rat, rabbit and human. It is suggested that this method of antibody production could be of general use for the reliable production of antisera against proteins where their sequence at the C-terminus is known, and such antibodies can be highly specific as they do not bind to internal sequences.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9106189>Characterisation of the binding sites of monoclonal antibodies reacting with the Plasmodium falciparum rhoptry protein RhopH3.</a></h2><p>Twenty one mouse monoclonal antibodies reacting or cross-reacting with the Plasmodium falciparum RhopH3 protein reacted with Ag44, a recombinant antigen expressing the 134 C-terminal RhopH3 residues. Using overlapping peptides scanning this region, two major binding sites were identified. The first one, recognised by eight anti-RhopH3 and seven cross-reacting mAbs, was mapped to the sequence Thr Asp  Thr  or Thr Asp  Thr   (aa 823-828), depending on the support used for synthesis. Binding specificity and affinity were investigated for a subset of four mAbs reacting with this epitope, including one growth inhibitory mAb. Systematic replacements showed that the various mAbs had similar requirements. The inhibitory mAb presented a higher affinity for this sequence and bound to the adjacent sequence,    Met  Leu (aa 827-832). A 2nd binding site, located around residue 850, was recognised by two anti-RhopH3 mAbs, which reacted exclusively with the 110 kDa RhopH3 polypeptide, unlike the other mAbs, which reacted with the 110 and 105 kDa RhopH3 antigens. This suggested that the 105 kDa RhopH3 polypeptide derives from the 110 kDa by C-terminal processing. Experimental evidence substantiating this conclusion was provided by the observation that antisera raised to peptides located upstream of the putative cleavage site reacted with both the 110 kDa and 105 kDa polypeptides, whereas antisera raised to the 45 C-terminal amino acids of RhopH3 reacted exclusively with the larger, 110 kDa product.

NC100668 is a 13-amino acid peptide with a Tc-binding chelator [NC100194; -NH-CH2-CH2-N(CH2-CH2-NH-C(CH3)2-C(CH3)=N-OH)2] linked to the C-terminal end. The present study was performed following injection of (99m)Tc-NC100668 in healthy human volunteers with five dose levels of NC100668 (20-2000 microg) and a constant radioactivity dose. The rate at which the radioactivity was cleared from blood was independent of gender and dose of NC100668; more than half of the 82% urinary clearance of radioactivity was obtained 2 h postinjection. The radioactivity in blood was reduced to 50% of initial values within 12 min; this was followed by a more gradual decrease with a half-life of 1.2 h and a terminal elimination half-life of 10.5 h. The plasma concentration of NC100668 decreased rapidly with an initial half-life of 5 to 10 min. The half-life after this initial phase could be estimated for only two of the subjects in the highest-dose group because the NC100668 concentration in the other samples at these time points was below the limit of detection of the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. LC/MS analyses of urine samples revealed the identity of two metabolites generated from the C-terminal end of the molecule; Gly-NC100194 was identified as the major metabolite and NC100194 as a minor metabolite. The estimated sum of these two metabolites is in the same magnitude as the recoveries of (99m)Tc in these samples, indicating that most of the (99m)Tc excreted in urine is bound to one of these metabolites.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8902848>Isolation and characterization of eight myoinhibiting peptides from the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria: new members of the cockroach allatostatin family.</a></h2><p>Eight myoinhibiting peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography from a methanolic extract of 7000 brains of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria.

Proteins that are resistant to degradation and efficient RNA-binders protect the RNAs. Replication becomes elongational producing poly-tRNAs from which the mRNAs and ribosomes are derived. Attributions are successively fixed to tRNAs paired through the perfect palindromic anticodons, with the same bases at the extremities (5'ANA: UNU 3'; GNG: CNC; principal dinucleotides, pDiN). The 5' degeneracy is then developed. The first pairs to be encoded correspond to the hydropathy correlation outliers (Gly-CC: Pro-GG and Ser-GA: Ser-CU) and to the sector of homogeneous pDiN, composed by two pyrimidines or two purines. These amino acids are preferred in the N-ends of proteins, stabilizers of proteins against catabolism and strong RNA-binders. The next pairs complete the sector of homogeneous pDiN (Asp, -UC: Leu-AG and , -UU: Phe-AA). This set of nine amino acids forms the protein cores with the predominant aperiodic conformation. Next enter the pairs with mixed pDiN (one purine and one pyrimidine), the RY attributions composing the protein N-ends and the YR attributions the C-ends. The last pair contains the main punctuation signs (Ile, Met, iMet-AU: , Stop-UA). The model indicates that genetic information emerged during the process of formation of the coding/decoding system and that genes were defined by the proteins. Stable proteins constructed the nucleoprotein system by binding to the RNAs that produced them. In this circular rationale, genes are memories in a  system for production of proteins that stabilize it. The simplicity and the highly deterministic character of the process suggest that the Last Universal Common Ancestor populations could be composed, in early stages, of lineages bearing similar genetic codes.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27438891>Role of Conserved Gly-Gly Pairs on the Periplasmic Side of LacY.</a></h2><p>On the periplasmic side of LacY, two conserved Gly-Gly pairs in helices II and XI (Gly46 and Gly370, respectively) and helices V and VIII (Gly159 and Gly262, respectively) allow close packing of each helix pair in the outward (periplasmic)-closed conformation.

To further investigate the role of the Gly-Gly pairs, 11 double-replacement mutants were constructed for each pair at positions 46 (helix II) and 262 (helix VIII). Replacement with Ala or Ser results in decreased but significant transport activity, while replacements with Thr, Val, Leu, , Gln, , Trp, , or  exhibit very little or no transport. Remarkably, however, the double mutants bind galactoside with affinities 10-20-fold higher than that of the pseudo-WT or WT LacY. Moreover, site-directed alkylation of a periplasmic Cys replacement indicates that the periplasmic cavity becomes readily accessible in the double-replacement mutants.

Hydropathically complementary peptides designed de novo show enough selectivity to be used successfully as peptide ligands for protein purification from crude extracts. Recognition specificity and selectivity in the interaction between the complementary peptide pair His-Leu-Leu-Phe-Pro-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu and ---Pro----Met---Arg-Phe have been demonstrated by other authors. In this work, we designed a recombinant protein purification method using a peptide affinity tag that binds to a peptide-binding partner immobilized on a chromatographic matrix. The enhanced green fluorescent protein expressed (EGFP) in Escherichia coli was used as the model. The peptide Gly-Gly-Gly-His-Leu-Leu-Phe-Pro-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ser-Leu was synthesized by solid phase using the Fmoc chemistry and immobilized in NHS-Sepharose (PC-Sepharose). Gly residues were added as a spacer arm at the N terminus. The EGFP was expressed either with the fusion tag ---Pro----Met---Arg-Phe on the C terminus (EGFP-CPTag) or without any fusion tag. After cell disruption, the extract was directly applied to the PC-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The adsorbed EGFP-CPTag was then eluted with 1M Tris. The yield was 98% and the purification factor 4.6. By contrast, EGFP without tag pass through without interacting with the PC-Sepharose column.

The protein is rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and leucine. Two internal octapeptides from the proteoglycan contained the sequences -Ile--Leu-Ser-His-- and Arg-Asp-Leu--Phe---Ile. These sequences are not previously described, and support the notion that osteoadherin belongs to the family of leucine-rich repeat proteins. A monospecific antiserum was raised in rabbits. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed, and showed the osteoadherin content of bone extracts to be 0.4 mg/g of tissue wet weight, whereas none was found in extracts of various other bovine tissues.  labeling of primary bovine osteoblasts followed by immunoprecipitation showed the cells to synthesize and secrete the proteoglycan. Digesting the immunoprecipitated osteoadherin with N-glycosidase reduced its apparent size to 47 kD, thus showing the presence of several N-linked oligosaccharides. Digestion with keratanase indicated some of the oligosaccharides to be extended to keratan sulfate chains. In immunohistochemical studies of the bovine fetal rib growth plate, osteoadherin was exclusively identified in the primary bone spongiosa. Osteoadherin binds to hydroxyapatite. A potential function of this proteoglycan is to bind cells, since we showed it to be as efficient as fibronectin in promoting osteoblast attachment in vitro.

The addition of a membrane H+,K(+)-ATPase preparation with Mg2+ accelerated the liberation of 32P from (P) residues in the alpha-chain. Mild tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin treatment solubilized 32P-containing peptides from the alpha-chain almost completely. A reverse-phase column chromatography of the supernatant gave two peaks of 32P-peptide with similar total radioactivities. The amino acid sequence of both peaks was shown to be Gly--Ala-----Leu--Gln--, which is consistent with the amino-terminal sequence of the alpha-chain of H+,K(+)-ATPase deduced from cDNA from pig stomach except that the initial Met was absent. The comparison of the recovery of amino acid from each Edman cycle showed that the phosphorylation of Tyr10 occurred preceding the phosphorylation of Tyr7.

Naphthoquinone is synthesized from chorismate of the shikimate pathway in microorganisms. Due to its absence in humans and animals, menaquinone biosynthesis has been an attractive target for development of antibiotics against a number of important microbial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In shikimate pathway, O-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) plays a major role and is one of the major potential drug targets. For Mtb-OSBS, a systematic study was conducted to get an insight about Mtb-OSBS enzyme and the corresponding inhibitors using in silico methods. The 3-D model of Mtb-OSBS was built using structure coordinates of Thermobifida fusca. O-succinylbenzoate synthase, the model, was further refined. The active site amino acids have been identified by comparing the template sequence with the Mtb-OSBS sequence. We identified that (108), (140), Asp(138), (110), (189), Ser(236), Asp(188), Arg(27), (52), and Ser(237) are highly conserved, and these may play a vital role as active residues, similar to that in template protein. As per the competitive binding of substrate (2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC)), we screened the SHCHC through AutoDock 4.0. The SHCHC molecule was further modified structurally and optimized through PRODRG server. Docking of the 12 lead molecules for best interactions with Mtb-OSBS has given an insight that all the lead molecules have shown interactions with active site amino acids of Mtb-OSBS. MD simulation analysis report has shown the stable conformation annotations of Mtb-OSBS.

To search for smaller peptide segments of CRF that might retain anti-inflammatory activity, the authors tested peptides similar to the carboxy terminals of ovine (o) and human/rat (h/r) CRF. Also, because h/rCRF(35-39), -Arg--Leu-Met--, resembles Arg--Leu-Leu--, a sequence found in many intermediate filament proteins, analogous peptides were evaluated.

Two of these contacts are located in the C-terminal half of this region of caldesmon which has been designated domain 4b (658-756). To investigate the spatial relationship between the two sites and to determine whether their corresponding contacts on actin are sequentially distinct, we have used NMR spectroscopy to compare the actin binding properties of the minimal inhibitory peptide LW30 comprising residues 693-722 with those of the recombinant domain 4b constructs 658C (658-756) and Cg1 (a mutant of 658C in which the sequence (691)-Trp-Leu-Thr--Thr(696) is changed to Pro-Gly-His---). Cg1 retains dual-sited actin attachment but displays lowered actin affinity. In the presence of tropomyosin, domain 4b-actin contacts were stronger but not qualitatively different, indicating that tropomyosin affected the conformational equilibrium of caldesmon binding. Simultaneous dual-sited attachment of domain 4b to actin is enabled by the conformational properties of the site-spanning sequence common to 658C, Cg1, and LW30 as reflected in the corresponding NOE and other NMR spectral parameters. A backbone turn region ((713)Gly-Asp-Val-Ser(716)) preceded by an extended segment (Ser(702)-Pro-Ala-Pro--Pro) acts to constrain the relative disposition of the flanking actin contact sites of domain 4b. In tests with a library of actin peptides, only the C-terminus, 350-375, bound to 658C and LW30. The use of Cu(2+) as a paramagnetic spectral probe bound to the unique His-371 provided evidence of a well-defined geometry for the complex between LW30 and actin residues 350-375 with the N-terminal, site B of domain 4b close to the C-terminal residues of actin.

The molecular mechanism(s) of such a depressed reactivity remains unclear. To further address this problem we studied neonatal platelet activation with thrombin, TRAP (thrombin receptor activating peptide, Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg--Pro--Asp----Pro-Phe) and ADP in 42 healthy 1-2 day old neonates using a whole peripheral blood flow cytometry. The neonates did not show an increased fraction of P-selectin-positive circulating platelets, whereas the expression of GPIb (glycoprotein Ib) in resting neonatal platelets was significantly lower compared to adults. Neonatal platelets were significantly less reactive than adult platelets to thrombin and TRAP, especially at lower agonist concentrations, but not to ADP or when incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Activation of neonatal platelets with agonists resulted in a marked alterations in the expression of P-selectin, whereas the internalization of GPIb was not affected. The reduced neonatal platelet sensitivity to thrombin and TRAP was accompanied by significantly reduced ATIII (antithrombin III) and increased prothrombin fragment F(1+2) in neonatal plasma. We conclude that various receptor systems potentially able to bind thrombin are relatively insensitive in neonatal platelets. The novelty of our work is that neonatal platelet hyposensitivity is not a generalized phenomenon, but concerns only selected agonists and selected receptor systems.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23603742>Mutations in Escherichia coli ExbB transmembrane domains identify scaffolding and signal transduction functions and exclude participation in a proton pathway.</a></h2><p>The TonB system couples cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force (pmf) to active transport of diverse nutrients across the outer membrane. Current data suggest that cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB and ExbD harness pmf . Transmembrane domain (TMD) interactions between TonB and ExbD allow the ExbD C terminus to modulate conformational rearrangements of the periplasmic TonB C terminus in vivo. These conformational changes somehow allow energization of high-affinity TonB-gated transporters by direct interaction with TonB. While ExbB is essential for  transduction, its role is not well understood. ExbB has N-terminus-out, C-terminus-in topology with three TMDs. TMDs 1 and 2 are punctuated by a cytoplasmic loop, with the C-terminal tail also occupying the cytoplasm. We tested the hypothesis that ExbB TMD residues play roles in proton translocation. Reassessment of TMD boundaries based on hydrophobic character and residue conservation among distantly related ExbB proteins brought earlier widely divergent predictions into congruence. All TMD residues with potentially function-specific side chains (, Cys, Ser, Thr, , , and ) and residues with probable structure-specific side chains (Trp, Gly, and Pro) were substituted with Ala and evaluated in multiple assays. While all three TMDs were essential, they had different roles: TMD1 was a region through which ExbB interacted with the TonB TMD. TMD2 and TMD3, the most conserved among the ExbB/TolQ/MotA/PomA family, played roles in signal transduction between cytoplasm and periplasm and the transition from ExbB homodimers to homotetramers.

(1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6067-6072). Exposure of a positively charged NH2-terminal amino acid after hydrolysis of Sak is a major determinant of the plasminogen-activating potential, but in itself is neither necessary nor sufficient. Here, the structural motifs of the NH2-terminal region Lys11-Gly-Asp-Asp-Ala-Ser16--Phe- of processed Sak, required for plasminogen activating potential, were studied by deletion and substitution mutagenesis. Expression in Escherichia coli of variants with deletion of 11, 14, 15, or 16 NH2-terminal amino acids yielded correctly processed but inactive molecules. Expression of their homologues with the NH2-terminal amino acid substituted with -generated derivatives from which the NH2-terminal initiation Met was no longer removed, yielding inactive (</= 10%) Sak42DDeltaN11(M),G12K, active (>50%) Sak42DDeltaN14(M), A15K and Sak42DDeltaN15(M),S16K, and inactive Sak42DDeltaN16(M),Y17K.  variants without NH2-terminal Met, generated from fusion proteins in which a His6 tag and a factor Xa recognition sequence were linked to the NH2 terminus of the Sak variants, were indistinguishable from their NH2-terminal Met-containing counterparts. All variants studied had intact affinities for plasminogen as measured by biospecific interaction analysis. The activity of Sak42DDeltaN11(M),G12K could be restored by additional substitution of both Asp13 and Asp14 with , yielding active Sak42DDeltaN11(M),G12K, D13N, D14N, whereas substitution in Sak42DDeltaN16(M),Y17K of Phe18 and Glu19 with  yielded inactive Sak42DDeltaN16(M),Y17K,F18N,E19N. These data, in combination with the recent finding that the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids of Sak lack secondary structure, suggest that the NH2-terminal region of Sak is not required for binding to plasmin/plasminogen, but that a positively charged amino acid in the ultimate or penultimate NH2-terminal position corresponding to amino acids 11-16 of this flexible region participates in the reconfiguration of the active site of the plasmin molecule to endow it with plasminogen-activating potential.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9680305>Purification and properties of mangano-superoxide dismutase from a strain of alkaliphilic Bacillus.</a></h2><p>A mangano-superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) was purified to homogeneity from a strain of alkaliphilic Bacillus for the first time.

All of the 19 substitutions for the  (P2) residue in the cleavage site were made. The wild-type and mutant precursors were expressed in a yeast strain lacking the chromosomal genes encoding Kex2 and prepro-alpha-factor. Cleavage of the 20 sites by Kex2, expressed at the wild-type level, was assessed by using a quantitative-mating assay with an effective range greater than six orders of magnitude. All substitutions for  at P2 decreased mating, from 2-fold for Arg to >10(6)-fold for Trp. Eviction of the Kex2-encoding plasmid indicated that cleavage of mutant sites by other cellular proteases was not a complicating factor. Mating efficiencies of strains expressing the mutant precursors correlated well with the specificity (kcat/KM) of purified Kex2 for comparable model peptide substrates, validating the in vivo approach as a quantitative method.

Despite its excellent tumor binding capacity, FROP-DOTA (H-----Leu-Met-Asp-Leu-Leu-Ala--Leu-(DOTA)-NH2), a peptide that we had identified in phage display libraries, revealed slow binding kinetics. Consequently, biodistribution studies showed that its excretion forestalled a significant tumor accumulation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the conjugation of PEG to FROP-DOTA resulted in a derivative with a prolonged residence time in the blood. A synthetic method for the PEGylation of the tumor specific peptide FROP-DOTA was developed. Thereafter, binding studies were done in vitro and a biodistribution was performed in tumor bearing animals. These were compared to the data obtained with FROP-DOTA. The binding kinetics of the PEGylated FROP-DOTA was even slower than that of FROP-DOTA. Biodistribution studies of the labeled conjugate in mice bearing human FRO82-2 tumors showed a time dependent increased uptake of the PEGylated peptide with a high retention (at 24 h p.i. 76% of the maximal activity concentration persisted in the tumor). The highest uptake values were determined at 120 min p.i. reaching 2.3%ID/g tumor as compared to 0.06%ID/g observed for the non-PEGylated derivative at 135 min p.i.

In this study, R143 of the E/DRY sequence in the alpha(1b)-AR was mutated into several amino acids (, His, , Asp, Ala, , and Ile). The charge-conserving mutation of R143 into lysine not only preserved the maximal agonist-induced response of the alpha(1b)-AR, but it also conferred high degree of constitutive activity to the receptor. Both basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation levels were significantly increased for the R143K mutant compared with those of the wild-type receptor. Other substitutions of R143 resulted in receptor mutants with either a small increase in constitutive activity (R143H and R143D), impairment (R143H, R143D), or complete loss of receptor-mediated response (R143E, R143A, R143N, R143I). The R413E mutant displayed a small, but significant increase in basal phosphorylation despite being severely impaired in receptor-mediated response.

A correlation was found between the extent of the affinity shift and the intrinsic activity of the agonists. The analysis of the receptor mutants using the allosteric ternary complex model in conjunction with the results of molecular dynamics simulations on the receptor models support the hypothesis that mutations of R143 can drive the isomerization of the alpha(1b)-AR into different states, highlighting the crucial role of this residue in the activation process of the receptor.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8719037>Neurotensin receptors: binding properties, transduction , and structure.</a></h2><p>Neurotensin is a 13-amino acid peptide (pGlu-Leu-----Pro-Arg-Arg-Pro--Ile-Leu) originally isolated from hypothalami (Carraway and Leeman, 1973) and later from intestines (Kitabgi et al., 1976) of bovine. The peptide is present throughout the animal kingdom, suggesting its participation to important processes basic to animal life (Carraway et al., 1982). Neurotensin and its analogue neuromedin-N (-Ile-Pro--Ile-Leu) (Minamino et al., 1984) are synthesized by a common precursor in mammalian brain (Kislauskis et al., 1988) and intestine (Dobner et al., 1987). The central and peripheral distribution and effects of neurotensin have been extensively studied. In the brain, neurotensin is exclusively found in nerve cells, fibers, and terminals (Uhl et al., 1979), whereas the majority of peripheral neurotensin is found in the endocrine N-cells located in the intestinal mucosa (Orci et al., 1976; Helmstaedter et al., 1977). Central or peripheral injections of neurotensin produce completely different pharmacological effects (Table I) indicating that the peptide does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Many of the effects of centrally administered neurotensin are similar to those of neuroleptics or can be antagonized by simultaneous administration of TRH (Table I). The recently discovered nonpeptide antagonist SR 48692 (Gully et al., 1993) can inhibit several of the central and peripheral effects of neurotensin (Table I). Like many other neuropeptides, neurotensin is a messenger of intracellular communication working as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the brain (Nemeroff et al., 1982) and as a local hormone in the periphery (Hirsch Fernstrom et al., 1980). Thus, several pharmacological, morphological, and neurochemical data suggest that one of the functions of neurotensin in the brain is to regulate dopamine neurotransmission along the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic  (Quirion, 1983; Kitabgi, 1989). On the other hand, the likely role of neurotensin as a parahormone in the gastrointestinal tract has been well documented (Rosell and Rökaeus, 1981; Kitabgi, 1982). Both central and peripheral modes of action of neurotensin imply as a first step the recognition of the peptide by a specific receptor located on the plasma membrane of the target cell. Formation of the neurotensin-receptor complex is then translated inside the cell by a change in the activity of an intracellular enzyme. This paper describes the binding and structural properties of neurotensin receptors as well as the signal transduction  that are activated by the peptide in various target tissues and cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12270939>Comparison of the functional insulin binding epitopes of the A and B isoforms of the insulin receptor.</a></h2><p>The human insulin receptor is expressed as two isoforms that are generated by alternate splicing of its mRNA; the B isoform has 12 additional amino acids (718-729) encoded by exon 11 of the gene. The isoforms have been reported to have different ligand binding properties. To further characterize their insulin binding properties, we have performed structure-directed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a major insulin binding site of the receptor, formed from the receptor L1 domain (amino acids 1-470) and amino acids 705-715 at the C terminus of the alpha subunit. Alanine mutants of each isoform were transiently expressed as recombinant secreted extracellular domain in 293 cells, and their insulin binding properties were evaluated by competitive binding assays. Mutation of Arg(86) and Phe(96) of each isoform resulted in receptors that were not secreted. The Kds of unmutated receptors were almost identical for both isoforms. Several new mutations compromising insulin binding were identified. In L1, mutation of Leu(37) decreased affinity 20- to 40-fold and mutations of Val(94), (97), (120), and (121) 3 to 10-fold for each isoform. A number of mutations produced differential effects on the two isoforms. Mutation of (15) in the L1 domain and Phe(714) at the C terminus of the alpha subunit inactivated the A isoform but only reduced the affinity of the B isoform 40- to 60-fold. At the C terminus of the alpha subunit, mutations of Asp(707), Val(713), and Val(715) produced 7- to 16-fold reductions in affinity of the A isoform but were without effect on the B isoform. In contrast, alanine mutations of (708) and (711) inactivated the B isoform but only reduced the affinities of the A isoform 11- and 6-fold, respectively. In conclusion, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the insulin receptor A and B isoforms has identified several new side chains contributing to insulin binding and indicates that the energetic contributions of certain side chains differ in each isoform, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms are used to obtain the same affinity.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21486028>Isolation and characterization of antioxidant protein fractions from melinjo (Gnetum gnemon) seeds.</a></h2><p>The protein from the seeds of melinjo ( Gnetum gnemon ) was purified using a precipitation method and ion exchange chromatographic techniques to identify the potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities.

The data obtained by the in vitro systems obviously established the antioxidant potency of Gg-AOPs.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300648>Dynamic monitoring of plasma amino acids and carnitine during chemotherapy of patients with alimentary canal malignancies and its clinical value.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to observe the plasma amino acid and carnitine characteristics in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies during chemotherapy and to identify markers for the early diagnosis and evaluation of adverse reactions and prognosis of the digestive tract malignant tumor patients.Blood samples of 30 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies were collected at four time points: before chemotherapy, the first day after chemotherapy (+1 day), bone marrow depression period (+14 days), and hematopoietic recovery period (+21 days). The plasma amino acids and carnitine from those 30 patients were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Simultaneously, the levels of 21 amino acids were detected in 30 healthy individuals, who were considered as control. Biochemical indexes were also detected at four time points, adverse reactions were recorded during the chemotherapy process, and patients were followed up for 1 year to observe time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival (PFS).Compared to healthy people in the control group, patients with malignancies showed significantly increased levels of plasma amino acids such as Arg, Asp, Cit, Gly, Orn, , Val, and carnitine (such as C2). The levels of compounds such as C3, , Leu, , Pip, Pro, C0, C5:1 decreased significantly before chemotherapy. The levels of Cit, Cys, , Pro, , Val, C0, and C2 decreased significantly on the second day of chemotherapy (+1 day), whereas the level of C3 increased significantly. During myelosuppression (+14 days), the levels of Asp, Cit, Met, and Orn were observed to still decrease significantly, whereas the level of Val appeared to increase significantly. The levels of Asp, , and Met were clearly different among patients with gastric carcinoma, rectal cancer, and colon cancer. Compared to the control group, aspartate amino transferase and alanine aminotransferase were found to be higher in eight patients with hypocarnitinemia, yet TTP, PFS, and RR (response rate) were lower. No significant difference was observed for adverse reactions. The indexes in 12 patients with citrullinemia showed no difference compared with control group. All the results showed statistically significant differences (P<0.05).Real-time monitoring of plasma amino acids and carnitine in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies can directly reflect the body's  and nutritional status. The results provide a reference for nutrition therapy or support for patients with alimentary canal malignancies. Hypocarnitinemia is a risk factor for gastrointestinal cancer patients and affects TTP, PFS, and RR by liver function. This study shows that tandem mass spectrometry can be used to detect blood amino acids and carnitine spectrum may be used for an early diagnosis and evaluation of adverse reactions and prognosis of the digestive tract malignant tumor patients.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16013872>Radiolytic modification and reactivity of amino acid residues serving as structural probes for protein footprinting.</a></h2><p>Hydroxyl radical-mediated protein footprinting is a convenient and sensitive technique for mapping solvent-accessible surfaces of proteins and examining the structure and dynamics of biological assemblies. In this study, the reactivities and tendencies to form easily detectable products for all 20 (common) amino acid side chains along with cystine are directly compared using various standards. Although we have previously reported on the oxidation of many of these residues, this study includes a detailed examination of the less reactive residues and better defines their usefulness in hydroxyl radical-mediated footprinting experiments. All 20 amino amides along with cystine and a few tripeptides were irradiated by gamma-rays, the products were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and rate constants of modification were measured. The reactivities of amino acid side chains were compared based on their loss of mass spectral signal normalized to the rate of loss for Phe or Pro that were radiolyzed simultaneously to serve as internal standards. In this way, accurate quantitation of relative rates could be assured. A reactivity order of amino acid side chains was obtained as Cys > Met > Trp >  > Phe > cystine > His > Leu, Ile > Arg, , Val > Ser, Thr, Pro > Gln,  > Asp,  > Ala > Gly. Ala and Gly are far too unreactive to be useful probes in typical experiments and Asp and  are unlikely to be useful as well. Although Ser and Thr are more reactive than Pro, which is known to be a useful probe, their oxidation products are not easily detectable. Thus, it appears that 14 of the 20 side chains (plus cystine) are most likely to be useful in typical experiments. Since these residues comprise approximately 65% of the sequence of a typical protein, the footprinting approach provides excellent coverage of the side-chain reactivity for proteins.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, , Val and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, , Phe, Ser, Tau, Thr and Val) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs ( and ) and Type III AAs ( and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11810552>Mechanism of quinolone resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p>The resistance mechanisms to fluoroquinolones in Staphylococcus aureus were clarified by analyzing mutations in the genes encoding target enzymes, and examining the expression of the efflux pump, and determining the inhibitory activities of fluoroquinolones against the altered enzymes. Mutations in the grlA and gyrA genes of 344 clinical strains of S. aureus isolated in 1994 in Japan were identified by combinations of methods - single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, restriction fragment length analysis, and direct sequencing - to identify possible relationships with fluoroquinolone resistance. Five types of single-point mutations and four types of double mutations were observed in the grlA gene in 204 strains (59.3%). Four types of single-point mutations and four types of double mutations were found in the gyrA gene in 188 strains (54.7%). Among these mutations, the grlA mutation of TCC --> TTC or TAC (Ser-80 --> Phe or ) and the gyrA mutation of TCA --> TTA (Ser-84 --> Leu) were the principal ones, being detected in 137 (39.8%) and 121 (35.2%) isolates, respectively. A total of 15 types of mutation combinations within both genes were related to ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC greater than or equal 3.13 microg/ml) and were present in 193 mutants (56.1%). Strains containing mutations in both genes were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC50 =50 microg/ml). Those strains with the Ser-80 --> Phe or  alteration in grlA, but wild type in gyrA showed a lower level of ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC50 less than or equal 12.5 microg/ml). Levofloxacin was active against 68 of 193 isolates (35.2%) with mutations at codon 80 of grlA in the presence or absence of concomitant mutations at codons 73, 84, or 88 in gyrA (MIC less than or equal 6.25 microg/ml). Sitafloxacin (DU-6859a) showed good activity in 186 of 193 isolates (96.4%), with an MIC of less than or equal 6.25 microg/ml. The contribution of membrane-associated multidrug efflux protein (NorA) expression to fluoroquinolone resistance was clarified by the checker-board titration method for determining the MIC of norfloxacin alone and in combination with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Among 344 clinical isolates, 139 strains (40.4%), in which the MIC of norfloxacin varied from 1.56 to >800 microg/ml, overexpressed the NorA protein. GrlA and GrlB proteins of topoisomerase IV, and GyrA and GyrB proteins of DNA gyrase encoded by genes with or without mutations were purified separately. The inhibitory activities of fluoroquinolones against the topoisomerase IV which contained a single amino acid change (Ser --> Phe at codon 80,  -->  at codon 84 of grlA, and Asp -->  at codon 432 of grlB) were from 5 to 95 times weaker than the inhibitory activities against the non-altered enzyme. These results suggest that the mutations in the corresponding genes may confer quinolone resistance; the active efflux pump, NorA, was considered to be the third quinolone-resistance mechanism. The numerous and complicated mutations seen may explain the rapid and widespread development of quinolone resistance described in S. aureus. Sitafloxacin showed good antibacterial activity against ciprofloxacin- or levofloxacin-resistant mutants because of its high inhibitory activity against both topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12814265>Geometry of interaction of the histidine ring with other planar and basic residues.</a></h2><p>Among the aromatic residues in protein structures, histidine (His) is unique, as it can exist in the neutral or positively charged form at the physiological pH. As such, it can interact with other aromatic residues as well as form hydrogen bonds with polar and charged (both negative and positive) residues. We have analyzed the geometry of interaction of His residues with nine other planar side chains containing aromatic (residues Phe, , Trp, and His), carboxylate (Asp and ), carboxamide ( and Gln) and guanidinium (Arg) groups in 432 polypeptide chains. With the exception of the aspartic (Asp) and glutamic () acid side-chains, all other residues prefer to interact in a face-to-face or offset-face-stacked orientation with the His ring. Such a geometry is different from the edge-to-face relative orientation normally associated with the aromatic-aromatic interaction. His-His pair prefers to interact in a face-to-face orientation; however, when both the residues bind the same metal ion, the interplanar angle is close to 90 degrees. The occurrence of different interactions (including the nonconventional N-H...pi and C-H...pi hydrogen bonds) have been correlated with the relative orientations between the interacting residues. Several structural motifs, mostly involved in binding metal ions, have been identified by considering the cases where His residues are in contact with four other planar moieties. About 10% of His residues used here are also found in sequence patterns in PROSITE database. There are examples of the amino end of the  side chain interacting with His residues in such a way that it is located on an arc around a ring nitrogen atom.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8103425>Further study on the specificity of D-amino acid oxidase and D-aspartate oxidase and time course for complete oxidation of D-amino acids.</a></h2><p>1.

The maximal activity of the recombinant enzyme for L-ribulose isomerization was observed at pH 7.0 and 75°C in the presence of 0.5 mM Cu(2+). Among all of the pentoses and hexoses evaluated, the enzyme exhibited the highest activity for the conversion of L-ribulose to L-ribose, a potential starting material for many L-nucleoside-based pharmaceutical compounds.

The analysis of side chain flexibility gives insights valuable to improve docking algorithms and can provide an index of amino-acid side-chain flexibility potentially useful in molecular biology and protein engineering studies. In this study we analyzed side-chain rearrangements upon ligand binding. We constructed two non-redundant databases (980 and 353 entries) of "paired" protein structures in complexed (holo-protein) and uncomplexed (apo-protein) forms from the PDB macromolecular structural database. The number and identity of binding pocket residues that undergo side-chain conformational changes were determined. We show that, in general, only a small number of residues in the pocket undergo such changes (e.g., approximately 85% of cases show changes in three residues or less). The flexibility scale has the following order:  > Arg, Gln, Met > , Ile, Leu > , Thr, Val, , Ser, His, Asp > Cys, Trp, Phe; thus,  side chains in binding pockets flex 25 times more often then do the Phe side chains. Normalizing for the number of flexible dihedral bonds in each amino acid attenuates the scale somewhat, however, the clear trend of large, polar amino acids being more flexible in the pocket than aromatic ones remains. We found no correlation between backbone movement of a residue upon ligand binding and the flexibility of its side chain. These results are relevant to 1. Reduction of search space in docking algorithms by inclusion of side-chain flexibility for a limited number of binding pocket residues; and 2. Utilization of the amino acid flexibility scale in protein engineering studies to alter the flexibility of binding pockets.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18215127>Interaction of acetylcholinesterase with the G4 domain of the laminin alpha1-chain.</a></h2><p>Although the primary function of AChE (acetylcholinesterase) is the synaptic hydrolysis of acetylcholine, it appears that the protein is also able to promote various non-cholinergic activities, including cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth and amyloidosis. We have observed previously that AChE is able to bind to mouse laminin-111 in vitro by an electrostatic mechanism. We have also observed that certain mAbs (monoclonal antibodies) recognizing AChE's PAS (peripheral anionic site) inhibit both laminin binding and cell adhesion in neuroblastoma cells. Here, we investigated the interaction sites of the two molecules, using docking, synthetic peptides, ELISAs and conformational interaction site mapping. Mouse AChE was observed on docking to bind to a discontinuous, largely basic, structure, Val(2718)-Arg--Arg-Leu(2722), (2738)-(2739), (2789)-Ile--Arg-(2793) and Val(2817)--Arg-(2820), on the mouse laminin alpha1 G4 domain. ELISAs using synthetic peptides confirmed the involvement of the AG-73 site (2719-2729). This site overlaps extensively with laminin's heparin-binding site, and AChE was observed to compete with heparan sulfate for laminin binding. Docking showed the major component of the interaction site on AChE to be the acidic sequence Arg(90)--Leu-Ser--Asp(95) on the omega loop, and also the involvement of Pro(40)-Pro-Val(42), Arg(46) (linked to (94) by a salt bridge) and the hexapeptide Asp(61)-Ala-Thr-Thr-Phe-Gln(66). Epitope analysis, using CLiPS technology, of seven adhesion-inhibiting mAbs (three anti-human AChE, one anti-Torpedo AChE and three anti-human anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies) showed their major recognition site to be the sequence Pro(40)-Pro-Met-Gly-Pro-Arg-Arg-Phe(48) (AChE human sequence). The antibodies, however, also reacted with the proline-containing sequences Pro(78)-Gly-Phe--Gly-Thr-(84) and Pro(88)--Arg--Leu-Ser--Asp(95). Antibodies that recognized other features of the PAS area but not the Arg(90)-Gly-Leu-Ser--Asp(95) motif interfered neither with laminin binding nor with cell adhesion. These results define sites for the interaction of AChE and laminin and suggest that the interaction plays a role in cell adhesion. They also suggest the strong probability of functional redundancy between AChE and other molecules in early development, particularly heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which may explain the survival of the AChE-knockout mouse.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8454163>Goldfish calcitonin: purification, characterization, and hypocalcemic potency.</a></h2><p>A novel teleost calcitonin was isolated from the goldfish, Carassius auratus, and its amino acid sequence was determined to be H-Cys-Ser-Ser-Leu-Ser-Thr-Cys-Val-Leu-Gly- -Leu-Ser-Gln--Leu-His--Leu-Gln-Thr--Pro-Arg-Thr--Val-Gly- Ala-Gly-Thr-Pro-NH2.

We utilized PTH(1-11), PTH(1-14), and PTH(1-34) analogues substituted with alanine at one or both of these positions and functionally evaluated the peptides in cell lines (HKRK-B7 and HKRK-B28) stably expressing the P1R, as well as in COS-7 cells transiently expressing either the P1R or a P1R construct that lacks the amino-terminal extracellular domain (P1R-DelNt). In HKRK-B7 cells, the single substitutions of Gln(6) --> Ala and Gln(10) --> Ala reduced the cAMP-stimulating potency of [Ala(3),Gln(10),Arg(11)]rPTH(1-11)NH(2) approximately 60- and approximately 2-fold, respectively, whereas the combined Ala(6,10) substitution resulted in a approximately 2-fold gain in potency, relative to the single Ala(6) substitution. Similar effects on P1R-mediated cAMP-signaling potency and P1R-binding affinity were observed for these substitutions in [Aib(1,3),Gln(10),Har(11),Ala(12),Trp(14)]rPTH(1-14)NH(2). Installation of a lactam bridge between the (6) and the (10) side chains of [Ala(3,12),(6),(10),Har(11),Trp(14)]rPTH(1-14)NH(2) increased signaling potency 6-fold, relative to the nonbridged linear analogue. Alanine substitutions at positions 6 and/or 10 of [(34)]hPTH(1-34)NH(2) did not affect signaling potency nor binding affinity on the intact P1R; however, Ala(6) abolished PTH(1-34) signaling on P1R-DelNt, and this effect was reversed by Ala(10). The overall data support the hypothesis that the N-terminal portion of PTH is alpha-helical when bound to the activation domain of the PTH-1 receptor and they further suggest that intrahelical side chain interactions between residues 6 and 10 of the ligand can contribute to the receptor interaction process.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146597>Structure-guided engineering of the substrate specificity of a fungal β-glucuronidase toward triterpenoid saponins.</a></h2><p>Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) have attracted special attention in research aimed at modifying natural products by partial removal of sugar moieties to manipulate their solubility and efficacy. However, these modifications are challenging to control because the low substrate specificity of most GHs often generates undesired by-products. We previously identified a GH2-type fungal β-glucuronidase from  (GUS) exhibiting promiscuous substrate specificity in hydrolysis of triterpenoid saponins. Here, we present the GUS structure, representing the first structure of a fungal β-glucuronidase, and that of an inactive GUS mutant in complex with the native substrate glycyrrhetic acid 3--mono-β-glucuronide (GAMG). GUS displayed a homotetramer structure with each monomer comprising three distinct domains: a sugar-binding, an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich, and a TIM barrel domain. Two catalytic residues,  and , acted as acid/base and nucleophile, respectively. Structural and mutational analyses indicated that the GAMG glycan moiety is recognized by polar interactions with nine residues (Asp, His, Asp, , , Asp, Arg, , and ) and that the aglycone moiety is recognized by aromatic stacking and by a π interaction with the four aromatic residues , Phe, Trp, and  Finally, structure-guided mutagenesis to precisely manipulate GUS substrate specificity in the biotransformation of glycyrrhizin into GAMG revealed that two amino acids, Ala and Arg, are critical for substrate specificity. Moreover, we obtained several mutants with dramatically improved GAMG yield (>95%). Structural analysis suggested that modulating the interaction of β-glucuronidase simultaneously toward glycan and aglycone moieties is critical for tuning its substrate specificity toward triterpenoid saponins.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10318778>Contulakin-G, an O-glycosylated invertebrate neurotensin.</a></h2><p>We have purified contulakin-G, a 16-amino acid O-linked glycopeptide (pGlu-Ser---Gly-Gly-Ser--Ala-Thr---Pro--Ile-Leu-OH, pGlu is pyroglutamate) from Conus geographus venom. The major glycosylated form of contulakin-G was found to incorporate the disaccharide beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-GalpNAc-(1-->) attached to Thr10. The C-terminal sequence of contulakin-G shows a high degree of similarity to the neurotensin family of peptides. Synthetic peptide replicates of Gal(beta-->3) GalNAc(alpha-->)Thr10 contulakin-G and its nonglycosylated analog were prepared using an Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) protected solid phase synthesis strategy. The synthetic glycosylated con- tulakin-G, when administered intracerebroventricular into mice, was found to result in motor control-associated dysfunction observed for the native peptide. Contulakín-G was found to be active at 10-fold lower doses than the nonglycosylated Thr10 contulakin-G analog. The binding affinities of contulakin-G and the nonglycosylated Thr10 contulakin-G for a number of neurotensin receptor types including the human neurotensin type 1 receptor (hNTR1), the rat neurotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors, and the mouse neurotensin type 3 receptor were determined. The binding affinity of the nonglycosylated Thr10 contulakin-G was approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of neurotensin1-13 for all the receptor types tested. In contrast, the glycosylated form of contulakin-G exhibited significantly weaker binding affinity for all of the receptors tested. However, both contulakin-G and nonglycosylated Thr10 contulakin-G were found to be potent agonists of rat neurotensin receptor type 1. Based on these results, we conclude that O-linked glycosylation appears to be a highly unusual strategy for increasing the efficacy of toxins directed against neurotransmitter receptors.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21209787>Expression, identification and purification of Dictyostelium acetoacetyl-coa thiolase expressed in Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AT) is an enzyme that catalyses the CoA-dependent thiolytic cleavage of acetoacetyl-CoA to yield 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA, or the reverse condensation reaction.

The wild-type protein has a KD of 1200 nM for maltose; mutation of residues Met-321 and Gln-325, both to alanine, resulted in a KD for maltose of 70 nM; deletion of 4 residues, -172, -173, -175, and -176, which are part of a poorly ordered loop, results in a KD for maltose of 110 nM. Combining the mutations yields an increased affinity for maltodextrins and a KD of 6 nM for maltotriose. Comparison of ligand binding by the mutants, using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, indicates that decreases in the off-rate are responsible for the increased affinity. Small-angle x-ray scattering was used to demonstrate that the mutations do not significantly affect the solution conformation of MBP in either the presence or absence of maltose. The crystal structures of selected mutants showed that the mutations do not cause significant structural changes in either the closed or open conformation of MBP. These studies show that interactions in the interface opposite the ligand binding cleft, which we term the "balancing interface," are responsible for modulating the affinity of MBP for its ligand. Our results are consistent with a model in which the ligand-bound protein alternates between the closed and open conformations, and removal of interactions in the balancing interface decreases the stability of the open conformation, without affecting the closed conformation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7531752>Sequence analysis of proviral HIV RT amplified directly by a semi-quantitative technique from AZT treated patients.</a></h2><p>To minimise possible arbitrary selective effects of culturing HIV, proviral RT DNA was isolated directly from PBMCs of four patients treated for 6-14 months with AZT.

The monosaccharide is non-enzymatically converted to 4-deoxy-L-ery thro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH), then reduced to 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate (KDG) by a specific reductase, and metabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Recently, the NADPH-dependent reductase A1-R that belongs to short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily was identified as the DEH-reductase in Sphingomonas sp. A1. We have subsequently noticed that an SDR-like enzyme gene, flred, occurred in the genome of an alginolytic bacterium Flavobacterium sp. strain UMI-01. In the present study, we report on the deduced amino-acid sequence of flred and DEH-reducing activity of recombinant FlRed. The deduced amino-acid sequence of flred comprised 254 residues and showed 34% amino-acid identities to that of A1-R from Sphingomonas sp. A1 and 80%-88% to those of SDR-like enzymes from several alginolytic bacteria. Common sequence motifs of SDR-superfamily enzymes, e.g., the catalytic tetrad ---Ser and the cofactor-binding sequence Thr-Gly-x-x-x-Gly-x-Gly in Rossmann fold, were completely conserved in FlRed. On the other hand, an Arg residue that determined the NADPH-specificity of Sphingomonas A1-R was replaced by  in FlRed. Thus, we investigated cofactor-preference of FlRed using a recombinant enzyme. As a result, the recombinant FlRed (recFlRed) was found to show high specificity to NADH. recFlRed exhibited practically no activity toward variety of aldehyde, ketone, keto ester, keto acid and aldose substrates except for DEH.

All peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methods using BOC chemistry for all but one peptide (8), which required the use of Fmoc chemistry. The binding and functional properties of these position 4 substituted analogues of dAVP (d[X(4)]AVP) and the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP (Derick et al. Endocrinology 2002, 143, 4655-4664) were evaluated on human arginine vasopressin (AVP) V(1a), V(1b), and V(2) receptors and on the human oxytocin (OT) receptor expressed in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Binding studies revealed that broad modifications of the fourth residue of dAVP do not significantly alter affinity for the human V(1b) receptor. Only aromatic (Phe, , Trp) or negatively charged () residues reduce V(1b) affinity. By contrast, the human V(1a) and more particularly the human V(2) and the OT receptors are more sensitive to many of these modifications. Thus, the replacement of the Gln(4) residue of dAVP by aliphatic (Leu, Cha) or positively charged (Orn, , Arg, Har) amino acids led to analogues exhibiting drastic reductions of their affinity for the human V(1a), V(2), and OT receptors. Consequently, in addition to the previously reported d[Cha(4)]AVP, peptides 6 and 17-20 display excellent selectivities for the human V(1b) receptor. The key structural requirement responsible for optimal V(1b) selectivity appears to be the length and branching of the aliphatic side chain of the fourth residue of dAVP. Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing the different human AVP/OT receptors confirm the V(1b) selectivity of peptides 6, 17, 18, 20, and d[Cha(4)]AVP. However, d[Arg(4)]AVP (19), which triggers an excellent coupling between the human V(2) receptor and adenylyl cyclase, was found to exhibit both V(1b) and V(2) agonism in functional tests. More interestingly, these functional experiments revealed that, depending on the AVP/OT receptor, a given d[X(4)]AVP analogue may behave as a full agonist or as a partial agonist. This strongly suggests that the fourth residue of dAVP plays an important role in the coupling between the hormone-receptor complex, the heterotrimeric G protein, and the effectors. In conclusion, the synthesis of these d[X(4)]AVP analogues led to the discovery of new V(1b) agonists with high affinity and greatly enhanced selectivities. Thus, in addition to d[Cha(4)]AVP, d[Leu(4)]AVP (6), d[Orn(4)]AVP (17), d[(4)]AVP (18), and d[Har(4)]AVP (20) are useful new tools for studying the structure and the function of the human V(1b) receptor.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p></html>
