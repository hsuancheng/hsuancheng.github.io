Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, , and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose .Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403782>-1 Transgene Is Associated With Improved Reproductive Outcomes.</a></h2><p>High intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been associated with a variety of health benefits. However, the role of ω-3 PUFAs in female reproductive function is unclear, with studies showing both positive and negative effects. The type of diet that ω-3 fatty acids are consumed with, for example, a balanced diet vs a high- diet (HFD), may influence how ω-3 fatty acids affect female reproductive function. To address the role of ω-3 PUFAs in female reproduction, we used the -1 mouse both with and without HFD exposure. -1 mice constitutively express the -1 transgene, allowing the conversion of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids to yield an optimal tissue ratio of ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids (∼1:1). In our study, at 15 weeks of age, -1 mice had elevated primordial follicles compared with wild-type controls with both standard chow and HFD feeding. Higher serum levels of the ω-3 docosahexaenoic  (DHA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were positively associated with primordial follicle numbers, whereas the ratio of the ω-6  to EPA + DPA + DHA had the opposite effect. Furthermore, -1 mice had increased pregnancy rates and shorter time to pregnancy when fed an HFD compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, our novel preclinical model suggests that high tissue levels of long-chain ω-3 PUFAs are associated with an improved ovarian reserve and improved reproductive outcomes. Further studies are needed to evaluate ω-3 PUFAs as a potential intervention strategy in women with diminished ovarian reserve.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058102>Advances in Cardiovascular Disease  Research Can Provide Novel Insights Into Mycobacterial Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in industrialized nations and an emerging health problem in the developing world. Systemic inflammatory processes associated with alterations in  are a major contributing factor that mediates the development of CVDs, especially atherosclerosis. Therefore, the pathways promoting alterations in  and the interplay between varying cellular types, signaling agents, and effector molecules have been well-studied. Mycobacterial species are the causative agents of various infectious diseases in both humans and animals. Modulation of host  by mycobacteria plays a prominent role in its survival strategy within the host as well as in disease pathogenesis. However, there are still several knowledge gaps in the mechanistic understanding of how mycobacteria can alter host . Considering the in-depth research available in the area of cardiovascular research, this review presents an overview of the parallel areas of research in host -mediated immunological changes that might be extrapolated and explored to understand the underlying basis of mycobacterial pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366209>Intervention effect of Qi-Yu-San-Long Decoction on Lewis lung carcinoma in C57BL/6 mice: Insights from UPLC-QTOF/MS-based metabolic profiling.</a></h2><p>Qi-Yu-San-Long Decoction (QYSLD) has been used to treat lung carcinoma for over twenty years in clinical practices, and its curative effect is considered credible. However, the therapeutic mechanism of this effect has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, a MTT dye reduction assay and DAPI staining were first used to evaluate the cell viability and apoptosis of A549 cells with and without QYSLD-treatment, respectively. The weight/volume of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) sarcoma was used to assess the therapeutic effect of QYSLD on LLC mice. Second, an UPLC-QTOF/MS-based untargeted metabolomics method was employed to identify and relatively quantify functional metabolites that were responsible for the intervention effect of QYSLD on LLC. As a result, the MTT dye reduction assay and DAPI staining demonstrated that QYSLD could inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of A549 cells. The weight/volume test of LLC sarcoma showed that QYSLD could restrain the development of LLC. Next, 21 potential biomarkers that could contribute to the curative mechanism of QYSLD on LLC were screened by the untargeted metabolomics method. The down-regulated metabolites induced by QYSLD included PC(16:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PC(20:2(11Z,14Z)/16:0), PC(22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)/14:0), PC(22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/14:0), , gamma-glutamylisoleucine, cholesterol sulfate, CL (8:0/10:0/11:0/a-13:0) and CDP-DG (16:0/18:1(11Z)). The up-regulated metabolites were LysoPC(16:0), LysoPC(18:0), LysoPE(18:2(9Z,12Z)/0:0), LysoPE(22:0/0:0), LysoPE(22:1(13Z)/0:0), LysoPE(22:2(13Z,16Z)/0:0), triglylcarnitine, 1‑arachidonoylglycerophosphoinositol, 1‑palmitoylglycerophosphoinositol, 2‑stearoylglycerophosphoinositol, sphingosine 1‑phosphate(d19:1-P) and SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)). The metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the potential biomarkers were primarily involved in glycerophospholipid , sphingolipid , steroid hormone biosynthesis, fatty  degradation and  . This study demonstrated that QYSLD has a good antitumor effect and that a UPLC-QTOF/MS-based untargeted metabolomics method is a promising means of elucidating the intervention mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine formulas.Copyright © 2018.

In the study of transcription regulation of gene encoding the Δ6Δ5 fatty acyl desaturase (Δ6Δ5 Fads), a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the first step of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish, a binding site for the transcription factor (TF), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), was predicted in Δ6Δ5 fads2 promoter by bioinformatics analysis, and thus the present study focused on the regulatory roles of Pparγ on Δ6Δ5 fads2. First, the activity of the Δ6Δ5 fads2 promoter was proved to be downregulated by pparγ overexpression and upregulated by treatment of Pparγ antagonist (GW9662), respectively, in HEK 293T cells with the dual luciferase reporter assay. Pparγ was further confirmed to interact with the promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Moreover, in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells, GW9662 decreased the expression of pparγ together with increase of Δ6Δ5 fads2 mRNA. Besides, Δ6Δ5 fads2 expression was increased by pparγ RNAi knockdown and reduced by its mRNA overexpression. Furthermore, knockdown of pparγ induced a high conversion of 18:3n-3 to 18:4n-3 and 18:2n-6 to 18:3n-6, while pparγ mRNA overexpression led to a lower conversion of that, and finally a significant decrease of 20:4n-6(ARA), 20:5n-3(EPA), and 22:6n-3(DHA) production. The results indicate that Pparγ is involved in the transcriptional regulation of liver LC-PUFA biosynthesis by targeting Δ6Δ5 fads2 in rabbitfish, which is the first report of Pparγ involvement in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315768>Modulation of the inflammatory response of immune cells in human peripheral blood by oxidized arachidonoyl aminophospholipids.</a></h2><p>Aminophospholipids (APL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS), can be oxidized upon oxidative stress. Oxidized PE and PS have been detected in clinical samples of different pathologies and may act as modulators of the inflammatory response. However, few studies have focused on the effects of oxidized APL (ox-APL) esterified with , even though a considerable number of studies have assessed the modulation of the immune system by oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphocholine (OxPAPC). In the present study, we have used flow cytometry to evaluate the ability of oxidized PAPE (OxPAPE) and PAPS (OxPAPS) to promote or suppress an inflammatory phenotype on monocytes subsets and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). The results indicate that OxPAPE increases the frequency of all monocyte subpopulations expressing TNF-α, which promotes an inflammatory response. However, immune cell stimulation with OxPAPE in the presence of LPS results in a decrease of TNF-α expressed by classical monocytes. Incubation with OxPAPS and LPS induces a decrease in TNF-α produced by monocytes, and a significant decrease in IL-1β expressed by monocytes and mDCs, indicating that OxPAPS reduces the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory expression in these populations. These results show the importance of OxPAPE and OxPAPS as modulators of the inflammatory response and demonstrate their possible contribution to the onset and resolution of human diseases related to oxidative stress and inflammation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Inflammation and abnormal redox status are believed to be key pathogenic mechanisms for AAA. In light of evidence correlating inflammation with aberrant fatty  profiles, this study compared erythrocyte fatty  content in 43 AAA patients (diameter 3.0-4.5 cm) and 52 healthy controls. In addition, the effect of omega-3 PUFA (n-3 PUFA) supplementation on erythrocyte fatty  content was examined in a cohort of 30 AAA patients as part of a 12 week randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. Blood analyses identified associations between AAA and decreased linoleic  (LA), and AAA and increased Δ6-desaturase activity and biosynthesis of  (AA) from LA. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation (1.5 g DHA + 0.3 g EPA/day) decreased red blood cell distribution width (14.8 ± 0.4% to 13.8 ± 0.2%;  = 0.003) and levels of pro-inflammatory n-6 PUFAs (AA, 12.46 ± 0.23% to 10.14 ± 0.3%,  < 0.001; adrenic , 2.12 ± 0.13% to 1.23 ± 0.09%;  < 0.001). In addition, Δ-4 desaturase activity increased (DHA/docosapentaenoic  ratio, 1.85 ± 0.14 to 3.93 ± 0.17;  < 0.001) and elongase 2/5 activity decreased (adrenic /AA ratio, 0.17 ± 0.01 to 0.12 ± 0.01;  < 0.01) following supplementation.

(AA) is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), vasoactive and natriuretic metabolites that contribute to blood pressure (BP) regulation. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may compete with AA for CYP450-dependent bioactive  mediator formation. We aimed at investigating the role of AA, EPA and DHA and their CYP450-dependent metabolites in BP control and vascular function in 66 overweight/obese children. Fatty  profile moderately correlated with the corresponding CYP450-derived metabolites but their levels did not differ between children with normal BP (NBP) and high BP (HBP), except for higher EPA-derived epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs) and their diols in HBP group, in which also the estimated CYP450-epoxygenase activity was higher. In the HBP group, EPA inversely correlated with BP, EEQs inversely correlated both with systolic BP and carotid Intima-Media Thickness (cIMT). The DHA-derived epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) were inversely correlated with diastolic BP. Omega-3 derived epoxymetabolites appeared beneficially associated with BP and vascular structure/function only in obese children with HBP. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of omega-3/omega-6 epoxymetabolites in children's hemodynamics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30591632>Mechanism of  Rhizoma on Acute Blood Stasis in Rats Based on a UPLC-Q/TOF-MS Metabolomics and Network Approach.</a></h2><p>Rhizome of , which is called EZhu in China, is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat blood stasis for many years. However, the underlying mechanism of EZhu is not clear at present. In this study, plasma metabolomics combined with network pharmacology were used to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of EZhu in blood stasis from a metabolic perspective. The results showed that 26 potential metabolite markers of acute blood stasis were screened, and the levels were all reversed to different degrees by EZhu preadministration. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the improvement of blood stasis by  rhizome was mainly related to  (linoleic  , ether , sphingolipid , glycerophospholipid , and  ) and amino  metabolisms (tryptophan , lysine degradation). The component-target-pathway network showed that 68 target proteins were associated with 21 chemical components in EZhu. Five metabolic pathways of the network, including linoleic  , sphingolipid , glycerolipid ,  , and steroid hormone biosynthesis, were consistent with plasma metabolomics results. In conclusion, plasma metabolomics combined with network pharmacology can be helpful to clarify the mechanism of EZhu in improving blood stasis and to provide a literature basis for further research on the therapeutic mechanism of EZhu in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525294>Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Q Exactive Orbitrap/Mass Spectrometry-Based Lipidomics Reveals the Influence of Nitrogen Sources on  Biosynthesis of .</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to reveal the effects of four types of nitrogen sources (soymeal, yeast extract, KNO, and ammonium tartrate) on the  of the oleaginous fungus  using untargeted lipidomics, targeted fatty , and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis.

Several reports have indicated the presence of specific fatty  alterations in CF patients, most notably decreased levels of plasmatic and tissue docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the precursor of specialized pro-resolving mediators. We hypothesized that DHA supplementation could restore the production of DHA-derived products and possibly contribute to a better control of the chronic pulmonary inflammation observed in CF subjects. Sputum samples from 15 CF and 10 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects were collected and analyzed by LC/MS/MS, and blood fatty  were profiled by gas chromatography upon  extraction and transmethylation. Interestingly, CF subjects showed increased concentrations of leukotriene B (LTB), prostaglandin E (PGE), and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), when compared with COPD patients, whereas the concentrations of DHA metabolites did not differ between the two groups. After DHA supplementation, not only DHA/ (AA) ratio and highly unsaturated fatty  index were significantly increased in the subjects completing the study ( < 0.05) but also a reduction in LTB and 15-HETE was observed, together with a tendency for a decrease in PGE and an increase in 17-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic  (17OH-DHA) levels. At the end of the washout period, LTB, PGE, 15-HETE, and 17OH-DHA showed a trend to return to baseline values. In addition, 15-HETE/17OH-DHA ratio in the same sample significantly decreased after DHA supplementation ( < 0.01) when compared with baseline. In conclusion, our results show here that in CF patients, an impairment in fatty  , characterized by increased AA-derived metabolites and decreased DHA-derived metabolites, could be partially corrected by DHA supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31292301>Changes in plasma lipids predict pravastatin efficacy in secondary prevention.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUNDStatins have pleiotropic effects on . The relationship between these effects and future cardiovascular events is unknown. We characterized the changes in lipids upon pravastatin treatment and defined the relationship with risk reduction for future cardiovascular events.METHODSPlasma lipids (n = 342) were measured in baseline and 1-year follow-up samples from a Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease () study subcohort (n = 4991). The associations of changes in lipids with treatment and cardiovascular outcomes were investigated using linear and Cox regression. The effect of treatment on future cardiovascular outcomes was examined by the relative risk reduction (RRR).RESULTSPravastatin treatment was associated with changes in 206 lipids. Species containing  were positively associated while phosphatidylinositol species were negatively associated with pravastatin treatment. The RRR from pravastatin treatment for cardiovascular events decreased from 23.5% to 16.6% after adjustment for clinical risk factors and change in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and to 3.0% after further adjustment for the change in the  ratio PI(36:2)/PC(38:4). Change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) mediated 58% of the treatment effect. Stratification of patients into quartiles of change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) indicated no benefit of pravastatin in the fourth quartile.CONCLUSIONThe change in PI(36:2)/PC(38:4) predicted benefit from pravastatin, independent of change in LDL-C, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical benefit of statin treatment in secondary prevention.TRIAL REGISTRATIONAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry identifier ACTRN12616000535471.FUNDINGBristol-Myers Squibb; NHMRC grants 211086, 358395, and 1029754; NHMRC program grant 1149987; NHMRC fellowship 108026; and the Operational Infrastructure Support Program of the Victorian government of Australia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30773209>Relationship between polyunsaturated fatty  and eating disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>Eating disorders result in poor nutrition, poor physical conditions and even suicidality and mortality. Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , oleic , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and oleic  and lower levels of adrenic , , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to body weight outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific  under starvation state. To investigate the role of PUFAs on psychopathological and therapeutic effects in eating disorders, further larger clinical studies are warranted.Copyright © 2019.

Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds (endocannabinoid metabolome, ECM) are endogenous  mediators derived from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that have been identified in HM. Previous research has shown that arachidonoylglycerol might play a role in establishing the infant's suckling response during lactation by activating the type 1 cannabinoid receptor in the infant's brain. The mechanisms of action and the role of the ECM in HM are not fully understood. Transitional and mature milk samples were collected from lactating women ( = 24) for ECM characterization, quantification, and to evaluate differences among the two stages. HM samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Identified members of the ECM were: arachidonoylethanolamine, palmitoylethanolamine, oleoylethanolamine, docosahexaenoylethanolamine, eicoapentaenoylethanolamine, eicosenoylethanolamine, arachidonoylglycerol, palmitoyglycerol, oleoylglycerol, docosahexaenoylglycerol, eicosapentaenoylglycerol, eiconenooylglycerol, , docosahexaenoic , and eicosapentaenoic . Only docosahexaenoylglycerol was different across transitional and mature milk ( ≤ 0.05).

Herein, we assessed the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty  metabolites by infective and noninfective stages of  and further explored the role of these metabolites in macrophage polarization. The concentration of docosahexaenoic  metabolites, precursors of proresolving  mediators, was increased in the infective stage of the parasite compared with the noninfective stage, and cytochrome P450-like proteins were shown to be implicated in the biosynthesis of these metabolites. The treatment of macrophages with lipids extracted from the infective forms of the parasite led to M2 macrophage polarization and blocked the differentiation into the M1 phenotype induced by IFN-γ. In conclusion,  polyunsaturated fatty  metabolites, produced by cytochrome P450-like protein activity, are implicated in parasite/host interactions by promoting the polarization of macrophages into a proresolving M2 phenotype.Copyright © 2019 Paloque et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296489>Isolevuglandins and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Isolevuglandins are 4-ketoaldehydes formed by peroxidation of .

This study aimed to examine whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and  (ARA) supplementation can protect fish cells against the negative impact of chlorpyrifos (CPF). Atlantic salmon hepatocytes were exposed to either 100 μM CPF, 200 μM EPA, 200 μM ARA, or combinations of these for 48 h, and endpoints included  droplet formation, gene expression, and global metabolomic analysis. The results showed that polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) supplementation modified the cell  composition, reduced uptake of CPF and increased the cellular number and size of  droplets. CPF exposure induced the transcription of ppara and fabp3, and reduced the levels of several PUFAs, and lead to accumulation of monoacylglycerols (MAGs) in the cells. Supplementation of EPA or ARA did not prevent CPF-induced accumulation of MAGs and only to a limited degree rescued the response on other lipids. CPF exposure further reduced energy , a response partly restored by PUFA supplementation. Reduced levels of glutathione indicated oxidative stress; an effect not ameliorated by the PUFAs.

In this study, we addressed the metabolic fate of non-retinoid lipids originating from  droplet loss during HSCs activation. UPLC/MS/MS and qRT-PCR were used to monitor the  composition and mRNA expression of selected genes regulating  in freshly isolated, overnight-, 3- and 7-day cultures or primary mouse HSCs. A preferential accumulation of specific C20-C24 fatty  species, especially  (C20:4) and docosahexaenoic acids (C22:6), was revealed in culture-activated HSCs along with an upregulation of transcription of fatty  desaturases (Scd1, Scd2) and elongases (Elovl5, Elovl6). This was accompanied with an enrichment of activated HSCs with 36:4 and 38:4 phosphatidylcholine species containing polyunsaturated fatty acids and associated accumulation of selective  mediators, including endocannabinoids and related N-acylethanolamides, as well as ceramides. An increase in 2-arachidonoylglycerol and N-arachydonoylethanolamide concentrations was observed along with an upregulation of Daglα mRNA expression in HSCs during culture activation. N-palmitoylethanolamide was identified as the most abundant endocannabinoid-like species in activated HSCs. An increase in total ceramide levels and enrichment with N-palmitoyl (C16:0), N-tetracosenoyl (C24:1), N-tetracosanoyl (C24:0) and N-docosanoyl (C22:0) ceramides was detected in activated HSC cultures and was preceded by increased mRNA expression of ceramide synthesizing enzymes (CerS2, CerS5 and Smpd1). Our data suggest an active redistribution of non-retinoid lipids in HSCs underlying the formation of low abundance, highly bioactive  species that may affect signaling during HSC activation, as well as extracellularly within the liver.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Overexpression of ApoD in mouse neural tissue induces the development of a non-inflammatory hepatic steatosis in 12-month-old transgenic animals. Previous data indicates that accumulation of , ApoD's preferential ligand, and overactivation of PPARγ are likely the driving forces in the development of the pathology. However, the lack of inflammation under those conditions is surprising. Hence, we further investigated the apparent repression of inflammation during hepatic steatosis development in aging transgenic animals. The earliest modulation of  and inflammation occurred at 6 months with a transient overexpression of L-PGDS and concomitant overproduction of 15d-PGJ, a PPARγ agonist. Hepatic  accumulation was detectable as soon as 9 months. Inflammatory polarization balance varied in time, with a robust anti-inflammatory profile at 6 months coinciding with 15d-PGJ overproduction. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were preferentially stored in the liver of 12-month-old transgenic mice and resulted in a higher omega-3/omega-6 ratio compared to wild type mice of the same age. Thus, inflammation seems to be controlled by several mechanisms in the liver of transgenic mice: first by an increase in 15d-PGJ production and later by a beneficial omega-3/omega-6 ratio. PPARγ seems to play important roles in these processes. The accumulation of several omega fatty acids species in the transgenic mouse liver suggests that ApoD might bind to a broader range of fatty acids than previously thought.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the cellular and molecular processes in asthma are highly complex and relatively unknown. To discover novel biomarkers and the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma, several studies have been conducted by focusing on gene expression patterns in epithelium through microarray analysis. However, few robust specific biomarkers were identified and some inconsistent results were observed. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct a robust analysis to solve these problems. Herein, an integrated gene expression analysis of ten independent, publicly available microarray data of bronchial epithelial cells from 348 asthmatic patients and 208 healthy controls was performed. As a result, 78 up- and 75 down-regulated genes were identified in bronchial epithelium of asthmatics. Comprehensive functional enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that response to chemical stimulus, extracellular region, pathways in cancer, and   were the four most significantly enriched terms. In the protein-protein interaction network, three main communities associated with cytoskeleton, response to , and regulation of response to stimulus were established, and the most highly ranked 6 hub genes (up-regulated , , , and down-regulated  and ) were identified and should be considered as new biomarkers. Pathway cross-talk analysis highlights that signaling pathways mediated by IL-4/13 and transcription factor HIF-1α and FOXA1 play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. Interestingly, three chemicals, polyphenol catechin, antibiotic lomefloxacin, and natural alkaloid boldine, were predicted and may be potential drugs for asthma treatment. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the common molecular pathogenesis mechanisms of asthma and provide theoretical support for further clinical therapeutic studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553982>Lipidomic analysis reveals the efficiency of Eclipta prostrata on diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in rats.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a leading cause of chronic liver disease in western countries. The current study aimed to detect and evaluate lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD as well as the potential efficiency of methanolic extract of Eclipta prostrata (E. prostrata) on disease management. In this study, Phytochemical screening of E. prostrata methanolic extract was performed using HPLC. NAFLD was induced in albino rats using a high- diet together with cholesterol and cholic . Comprehensive lipidomic analyses on sera from rats bearing NAFLD as well as normal healthy animals were carried out based on GCMS and multivariate data analysis. The results showed that high doses (300&200 mg/kg.BW) of E. prostrata extract exhibited significant improvement in liver enzymes (ALT & AST) and  profile [total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerides (TAGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)] in rats bearing NAFLD. Glycerol, linoleic ,  and cholest-5-en-3-ol (3β) acetate were detected as lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD in rats' sera. Furthermore, E. prostrata extract showed a significant amelioration in the levels of these metabolic biomarkers in both protective and treated groups. These finding devoutly recommend using of lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD and E. prostrata could be used as a protective agent as well as ameliorate this disease through its probable action on the fore-mentioned metabolites.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Fu-Fang-Jin-Qian-Chao granules (FFJQC), a traditional Chinese herb formula, is commonly used in treatment of nephrolithiasis. However, the therapeutic mechanism of FFJQC on kidney stone has still been a mystery. The objective of the present study is to explore the therapeutic mechanism of FFJQC on kidney injury and identify unique metabolomics patterns using a mouse model of kidney stone induced by a calcium oxalate (CaOx) deposition. Von Kossa staining and immuno-histopathological staining of osteopontin (OPN), cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) and calbindin-D28k were conducted on renal sections. Biochemical analysis was performed on serum, urine, and kidney tissues. A metabolomics approach based on ultra-HPLC coupled with quadrupole-TOF-MS (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used for serum metabolic profiling. The immunohistopathological and biochemical analysis showed the therapeutic benefits of FFJQC. The expression levels of OPN and CD44 were decreased while calbindin-D28k increased after the CaOx injured mice were treated with FFJQC. In addition, total of 81 serum metabolites were identified to be associated with protective effects of FFJQC on CaOx crystal injured mice. Most of these metabolites were involved in purine, amino , membrane  and energy . Potential metabolite biomarkers were found for CaOx crystal-induced renal damage. Potential metabolite biomarkers of CaOx crystal-induced renal damage were found.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanisms of quercetin in high-fat-sucrose diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development using nontargeted metabolomics. A rat model of NAFLD was established by feeding with an HFD for 30 and 50 days. The results indicated quercetin exhibited hepatoprotective activity in 30-day HFD-induced NAFLD rats by regulating fatty  related metabolites (adrenic , etc.), inflammation-related metabolites (, etc.), oxidative stress-related metabolites (2-hydroxybutyric ) and other differential metabolites (citric , etc.). However, quercetin did not improve NAFLD in the 50-day HFD; perhaps quercetin was unable to reverse the inflammation induced by a long-term high-fat diet. These data indicate that dietary quercetin may be beneficial to NAFLD in early stages. Furthermore, combining metabolomics and experimental approaches opens avenues to study the effects and mechanisms of drugs for complex diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433740> and  Polymorphisms Modulate Fatty   and Dietary Impact on Health.</a></h2><p>Variants in the  gene cluster modify the activity of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) desaturation and the  composition in human blood and tissue.  variants have been associated with plasma  concentrations, risk of cardiovascular diseases, overweight, eczema, pregnancy outcomes, and cognitive function. Studies on variations in the  genecluster provided some of the first examples for marked gene-diet interactions in modulating complex phenotypes, such as eczema, asthma, and cognition. Genotype distribution differs markedly among ethnicities, apparently reflecting an evolutionary advantage of genotypes enabling active long-chain PUFA synthesis when the introduction of agriculture provided diets rich in linoleic  but with little  and eicosapentaenoic acids.

Through the measurement of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), oxidative stress, and inflammation status in liver and heart tissues of apolipoprotein E (ApoE  ), mice fed with high  diet (HFD) or HFD with oat bran (HFD + Oat) were investigated. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), PUFA and over 40 types of its oxidized products were assessed. The HFD + Oat group had augmented adrenic  (ADA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and suppressed n-3 docosapentaenoic  levels in the liver tissues compared to the HFD group.  (ARA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) levels were elevated and ADA was suppressed in the heart tissues of the HFD + Oat group compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, enzymatically mediated oxidized ARA product levels (9-, 11- and 20-HETE [hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ], and PGF ) were augmented and those of the oxidized DHA products (4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, and 14-HDHA [hydroxy-docosahexaenoic ]) were reduced in the liver tissues of the HFD + Oat group. It also increased 17-F -dihomo-isoprostane and 7-F -dihomo-isofuran derived from nonenzymatic oxidation of ADA in the heart and liver tissues, and those from ALA namely 16-F -phytoprostane and 16(RS)-13-epi-STΔ -9-phytofuran. Our study showed oat bran to be a weak antioxidant and lacked anti-inflammatory properties in atherosclerotic mice. Elevation of oxidized PUFA products that are potentially proinflammatory and vasoconstrictors (HETE, PGF ) with simultaneous reduction of those that are anti-inflammatory (HDHA) may not be desirable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108195>Leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes as therapeutic targets.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are powerful immune-regulating  mediators with established pathogenic roles in inflammatory allergic diseases of the respiratory tract - in particular, asthma and hay fever.

Limited information exists on the changes in circulating eCBs following bariatric surgery.This study aims to (i) assess the circulating levels of eCBs and related molecules and (ii) examine the association between their levels and numerous clinical/metabolic features pre- and post-operatively.Sixty-five morbidly obese patients (age 42.78 ± 9.27 years; BMI 42.00 ± 5.01 kg/m) underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) surgery, and were followed up for 12 months. Data collected included anthropometrics and metabolic parameters. The serum levels of the eCBs, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), anandamide (AEA); and their related molecules,  (AA) and oleoylethanolamine (OEA) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Levels of 2-AG, AEA, and AA were reduced post operatively with no differences in serum OEA levels. The delta changes in eCB levels between pre- and post-operation were correlated with the delta of different metabolic parameters. Positive correlations were found between delta AA and waist circumference (WC) (r = 0.28, P < 0.05), free  mass (r = 0.26, P < 0.05), SteatoTest score (r = 0.45, P < 0.05), and ALT (r = 0.32, P < 0.05). Delta AEA levels positively correlated with WC (r = 0.30, P < 0.05). Delta 2-AG levels positively correlated with total cholesterol (r = 0.27, P < 0.05), triglycerides (r = 0.55, P < 0.05), and SteatoTest score (r = 0.27, P < 0.05). Delta OEA levels negatively correlated with fasting glucose levels (r = - 0.27, P < 0.05).This study provides compelling evidence that LSG surgery induces reductions in the circulating 2-AG, AEA, and AA levels, and that these changes are associated with clinical benefits related to the surgery including reduced  mass, hepatic steatosis, glucose, and improved  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595424>Untargeted metabolomics reveals alterations in metabolites of  and immune pathways in the serum of rats after long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana.</a></h2><p>Amalaki rasayana, a traditional preparation, is widely used by Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee + honey (GH) for 18 months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic acids, and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of  , fatty  , leukotriene , G-protein mediated events, phospholipid , and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic , ellagic , and  components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered metabolic profile following long-term AR administration. AR also activates IGF1R-Akt-Foxo3 signaling axis in heart tissues of rats administered with AR.

CysLTs then produce their potent inflammatory actions by activating CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors. Inhibitors of cysLTs are indicated in asthma, allergic rhinitis and other inflammatory disorders. Earlier studies have associated cysLTs and their receptors in several neurodegenerative disorders diseases like, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These inflammatory  mediators have previously shown effects on various aggravating factors of AD. However, not much data has been elucidated to test their role against AD clinically. Herein, through this review, we have provided the current and emerging information on the role of cysLTs and their receptors in various neurological complications responsible for the development of AD. In addition, literature evidences for the effect of cysLT inhibitors on distinct aspects of abnormalities in AD has also been reviewed. Promising advancement in understanding on the role of cysLTs on the various neuromodulatory processes and mechanisms may contribute to the development of newer and safer therapy for the treatment of AD in future.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Laying broiler breeder (LBB) hens were supplemented with 40 mg/kg genistein (GEN), while the control group was fed with the low-soybean meal diet. The offspring chicks were grouped according to the mother generation with 8 replicates each. Hepatic transcriptome data revealed 3915 differentially expressed genes (DEGs,  adjusted < 0.05, fold change > 1.5 or fold change < 0.67) between chicks in the two groups. Maternal GEN activated the GH-IGF1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which promoted the developmental processes and cellular amino  metabolic processes, as well as inhibited the apoptotic process. GEN treatment significantly increased the weight gain, breast muscle percentage, and liver index in chicks. PANTHER clustering analysis suggested that maternal GEN enhanced the antioxidant activity of chicks by the upregulation of gene (SOD3, MT1, and MT4) expression. Accordingly, the activities of T-AOC and T-SOD in the liver were increased after GEN treatment. The overrepresentation tests revealed that maternal GEN influenced the glycolysis, unsaturated fatty  biosynthesis, acyl-coenzyme A ,  transport, and cholesterol  in the chick livers. Hepatic cholesterol and long-chain fatty  were significantly decreased after GEN treatment. However, the level of  was higher in the livers of the GEN-treated group compared with the CON group. Moreover, GEN treatment enhanced fatty  -oxidation and upregulated PPAR expression in the chick liver. ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that maternal GEN might induce histone H3-K36 trimethylation in the promoter region of PPAR gene (PPARD) through Iws1, methyltransferases. It also induced histone H4-K12 acetylation at the PPARD promoter through MYST2, which activated the PPAR signaling pathways in the chick livers. In summary, supplementing LBB hens with GEN can alter  in the offspring chicks through epigenetic modification and improve the antioxidative capability as well as growth performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096434>F-isoprostanes affect macrophage migration and CSF-1 signalling.</a></h2><p>F-isoprostanes (F-IsoP) are formed in vivo via free radical peroxidation of . Enhanced oxidative stress is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis in humans and F-IsoP have been detected in atherosclerotic plaque. Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is essential to macrophage survival, proliferation and differentiation and has been detected in human atherosclerotic plaques. Accumulation of macrophages within the vascular wall is an important component of atherosclerosis but little is known about the effect of F-IsoP on the migration of these cells. Our aim was to examine the effect of free and -bound 15-F-isoprostane (15-F-IsoP) on macrophage migration and investigate the signalling pathways involved. Mouse macrophages (cell line BAC1.2F5) were pre-incubated with 15-F-IsoP (free, bound to cholesterol or monoacylglycerol or within oxidized phospholipid) and cell migration was assessed using chemotaxis towards CSF-1 in Boyden chambers. Migration was also measured using the wound healing assay with primary mouse bone marrow derived macrophages. We showed that 15-F-IsoP dose-dependently inhibited BAC1.2F5 macrophage spreading and adhesion but stimulated their migration towards CSF-1, with maximum effect at 10 µM. Analysis of CSF-1 stimulated signalling pathways in BAC1.2F5 macrophages showed that phosphorylation of Akt, a key mediator of cell migration, and one of its regulators, the mTORC2 component, Rictor, was significantly decreased. In contrast, phosphorylation of the adhesion kinases, FAK and Pyk2, and the adhesion scaffold protein, paxillin, was enhanced after treatment with 15-F-IsoP. Mouse bone marrow macrophages were transfected with FAK or Pyk2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to examine the role of FAK and Pyk2 in 15-F-IsoP signalling. Pyk2 silencing inhibited 15-F-IsoP-induced reduction in cell area and phospho-paxillin adhesion numbers. The size distribution of adhesions in the presence of 15-F-IsoP was also affected by Pyk2 silencing and there was a trend for Pyk2 silencing to reduce 15-F-IsoP-stimulated macrophage migration. These results demonstrate that 15-F-IsoP affects macrophage adhesions and migration, which are integral components of macrophage involvement in atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Lobosphaera incisa is a fresh water unicellular alga, which in response to nutrient stress accumulates a high amount of TAGs with a high proportion of  (ARA). The final committed step of de novo TAG biosynthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), which add a fatty  (FA) to the final sn-3 position of diacylglycerol (DAG).Genome analysis revealed the presence of five putative DGAT isoforms in L. incisa, including one DGAT of type 1, three DGATs of type 2 and a single isoform of a type 3 DGAT. For LiDGAT1, LiDGAT2.1, LiDGAT2.2 and LiDGAT2.3 enzyme activity was confirmed by expressing them in the TAG-deficient yeast strain H1246. Feeding experiments of yeast transformants with fatty acids suggest a broad substrate specificity spectrum for LiDGAT1. A significant TAG production in response to exogenous ARA was found for LiDGAT2.2. Cellular localization of the four type 1 and type 2 DGATs expressed in yeast revealed that they all localize to distinct ER domains. A prominent association of LiDGAT1 with ER domains in close proximity to forming  droplets (LDs) was also observed.The data revealed a distinct molecular, functional and cellular nature of type 1 and type 2 DGATs from L. incisa, with LiDGAT1 being a major contributor to the TAG pool. LiDGATs of type 2 might be in turn involved in the incorporation of unusual fatty acids into TAG and thus regulate the composition of TAG.

The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound oleic, myristic, and linolenic  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of  in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of  from linoleic  may tend to promote patency.

However, they have the potential to cause serious complications, such as gastrointestinal (GI) lesions, bleeding and cardiovascular (CV) problems. NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic actions by inhibiting the cyclooxygenases (COX)-1 and COX-2, key enzymes of the  (AA) cascade. However, not all the AA products or their receptors are pro-inflammatory. Therefore, given the multifaceted interactions of these  mediators where a single precursor can trigger multiple events with synergic or opposed function, it is easy to predict that any perturbation of this interplay will cause several unavoidable side effects. Today, we do not have a truly safe NSAID that minimizes GI damage and CV toxicity. One possibility to interfere with this intricate network, while trying to keep its fine balance, is to develop molecules affecting several targets. Different strategies have been proposed for a multitargeted intervention at different levels of the AA cascade, like inhibition of multiple upstream enzymes, such as COX, 5-lipoxygenase, or even soluble epoxide hydrolase and prostaglandin E synthase. Alternative strategies are more focused in the inhibition of targets downstream in the metabolic pathway, such as thromboxane synthase and/or blocking selective receptors. In this review we will briefly summarize the new strategies that have been proposed for a multitargeted pharmacological intervention on this metabolic cascade aimed at developing novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We found that stimulation of dendritic cells with the fungal surrogate zymosan causes decreases of pyruvate, citrate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate, while increasing oxaloacetate, succinate, lactate, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Expression of IL10 and IL23A (the gene encoding the p19 chain of IL-23) depended on pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Mechanistically, pyruvate reinforced histone H3 acetylation, and acetate rescued the effect of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibition, most likely because it is a substrate of the acetyl-CoA producing enzyme ACSS2. Mice lacking the receptor of the  mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) showed reduced production of IL-10 and IL-23 that is explained by the requirement of acetyl-CoA for PAF biosynthesis and its ensuing autocrine function. Acetyl-CoA therefore intertwines fatty  remodeling of glycerophospholipids and energetic  during cytokine induction.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Oligodendrocytes are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which populate the adult central nervous system, but their physiological capability to myelin synthesis is limited. The low intake of essential lipids for sphingomyelin synthesis in the human diet may account for increased demyelination and the reduced efficiency of the remyelination process. In our study on  profiling in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis brain, we revealed that during acute inflammation, nervonic  synthesis is silenced, which is the effect of shifting the  pathway of common substrates into proinflammatory  production. In the experiments on the human model of maturating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (hOPCs) in vitro, we demonstrated that fish oil mixture (FOM) affected the function of hOPCs, resulting in the improved synthesis of myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and proteolipid protein, as well as sphingomyelin. Additionally, FOM reduces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and enhances fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis by hOPCs was also demonstrated. Based on these observations, we propose that the intake of FOM rich in the nervonic  ester may improve OL function, affecting OPC maturation and limiting inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832728>Monoraphidium sp. HDMA-20 is a new potential source of α-linolenic  and eicosatetraenoic .</a></h2><p>ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are synthesized from α-Linolenic  (ALA, C18:3ω3) and play important roles in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in mammal cells. ALA is an essential fatty  which cannot be produced within the human body and must be acquired through diet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel microalgal strain (HDMA-20) as a source of ω-3 PUFAs including ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3).Phylogenetic Neighbor-Joining analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequence was used to identify the microalga strain HDMA-20. Autotrophic condition was chosen to cultivate HDMA-20 to reduce the cultivation cost. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty  composition of HDMA-20 lipid.A microalgal strain (HDMA-20) from Lake Chengfeng (Daqing, Heilongjiang province, China) was found to accumulate high content of ω-3 PUFAs (63.4% of total lipid), with ALA and eicosatetraenoic  (ETA, C20:4ω3) accounting for 35.4 and 9.6% of total lipid, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences suggested that the HDMA-20 belonged to genus Monoraphidium (Selenastraceae, Sphaeropleales) and its 18S rDNA sequence information turned out to be new molecular record of Monoraphidium species. The biomass productivity and lipid content of HDMA-20 were also investigated under autotrophic condition. The biomass productivity of HDMA-20 reached 36.3 mg L day, and the lipid contents was 22.6% of dry weight.HDMA-20 not only represent an additional source of ALA, but also a totally new source of ETA. The high content of ω-3 PUFAs, especially ALA, of HDMA-20, makes it suitable as a source of nutrition supplements for human health. In addition, HDMA-20 exhibited good properties in growth and lipid accumulation, implying its potential for cost-effective ω-3 PUFAs production in future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30564087>Disruption in Brain Phospholipid Content in a Humanized Tau Transgenic Model Following Repetitive Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.</a></h2><p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy typified by immunoreactive tau aggregates in the depths of the sulci. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved have not been largely explored. Phospholipids are important molecules which form membrane  bilayers; they are ubiquitous to every cell in the brain, and carry out a host of different functions. Imbalance in phospholipid , signaling and transport has been documented in some neurological conditions. However, not much is currently known about their roles in repetitive mTBI and how this may confer risk for the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. To address this question, we designed a longitudinal study (24 h, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-injury) to comprehensively investigate mTBI dependent brain phospholipid profiles compared to sham counterparts. We use our established mouse model of repetitive mTBI that has been extensively characterized up to 1-year post-injury in humanized tau (hTau) mice, which expresses all six human tau isoforms, on a null murine background. Our data indicates a significant increase in sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and derivative lysoPE and lysoPC at acute and/or sub-acute time points post-injury within the cortex and hippocampus. There was also a parallel increase at early time points in monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Omega-6 () to omega-3 (docosahexaenoic ) fatty  ratio for PE and PC species was increased also at 24 h and 3 months post-injury in both hippocampus and cortex. The long-term consequences of these early changes in phospholipids on neuronal and non-neuronal cell function is unclear, and warrants further study. Understanding phospholipid , signaling and transport following TBI could be valuable; they may offer novel targets for therapeutic intervention not only in TBI but other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30188757>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induces potent anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo by S1P receptor 4-mediated suppression of 5-lipoxygenase activity.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is involved in the regulation of important cellular processes, including immune-cell trafficking and proliferation. Altered S1P signaling is strongly associated with inflammation, cancer progression, and atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms underlying its pathophysiologic effects are only partially understood. This study evaluated the effects of S1P in vitro and in vivo on the biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs), which form a class of  mediators involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Here, we report for the first time that S1P potently suppresses LT biosynthesis in Ca-ionophore-stimulated intact human neutrophils. S1P treatment resulted in intracellular Ca mobilization, perinuclear translocation, and finally irreversible suicide inactivation of the LT biosynthesis key enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Agonist studies and S1P receptor mRNA expression analysis provided evidence for a S1P receptor 4-mediated effect, which was confirmed by a functional knockout of S1P4 in HL60 cells. Systemic administration of S1P in wild-type mice decreased both macrophage and neutrophil migration in the lungs in response to LPS and significantly attenuated 5-LO product formation, whereas these effects were abrogated in 5-LO or S1P4 knockout mice. In summary, targeting the 5-LO pathway is an important mechanism to explain S1P-mediated pathophysiologic effects. Furthermore, agonism at S1P4 represents a novel effective strategy in pharmacotherapy of inflammation.-Fettel, J., Kühn, B., Guillen, N.

Quèl as a potential medicinal mushroom possesses multiple biological activities including hepatoprotection, but the hepatoprotective mechanism is not clear.To elucidate the hepatoprotective effect and potential target of P. igniarius.The male C57BL/6 mice were fed with the Lieber-DeCarli diet containing alcohol or isocaloric maltose dextrin as control diet with or without P. igniarius decoction (PID) in the dosage of 0.65 g/kg and 2.6 g/kg. The levels of serum biomarkers were detected by an automatic biochemistry analyser. The histopathological changes of liver were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) was applied for investigating the dynamic changes of serum metabolites in chronic ethanol-induced liver injury mice and after treatment with PID. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was employed to identify the potential target of PID.PID could significantly reduce the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG) and total bile  (TBA) in serum and improved hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In terms of , a total of 36 serum differential metabolites were identified, and PID intervention regulated 24 of them, involving the key metabolic pathways such as the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, primary bile  biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid , fatty acids biosynthesis, ether  and  . On the mechanism, IPA showed that farnesol X receptor (FXR) was the major potential target for PID, and PID could improve chronic alcohol intake induced by the inhibition of mRNA expression of FXR in the liver and the activation of mRNA expression of FXR in the intestine in mice.The present study for the first time systematically illustrated the hepatoprotective effect of P. igniarius and preliminarily explored its potential target FXR.

Genome-wide association studies have reported associations between FADS1-FADS2 polymorphisms and the plasma concentrations of PUFAs, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, much remains unknown regarding the molecular mechanisms explaining how variants affect the function of FADS1-FADS2 genes.Here, we sought to identify the functional variant(s) within the FADS gene cluster.To address this question, we (1) genotyped individuals (n = 540) for the rs174547 polymorphism to confirm associations with PUFA levels used as surrogate estimates of desaturase activities and (2) examined the functionality of variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs174547 using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays.The rs174547 minor allele was associated with higher erythrocyte levels of dihomo-γ-linolenic  and lower levels of , suggesting a lower Δ5-desaturase activity. In silico analyses suggested that rs174545 and rs174546, in perfect linkage disequilibrium with rs174547, might alter miRNA binding sites in the FADS1 3'UTR. In HuH7 and HepG2 cells transfected with FADS1 3'UTR luciferase vectors, the haplotype constructs bearing the rs174546T minor allele showed 30% less luciferase activity. This relative decrease reached 60% in the presence of miR-149-5p and was partly abolished by cotransfection with an miR-149-5p inhibitor.This study identifies FADS1 rs174546 as a functional variant that may explain the associations between FADS1-FADS2 polymorphisms and -related phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 National  Association.

Their essentiality is largely due to their function as prostaglandin (PG) precursors. I spent most of my career in biochemistry determining how PG biosynthesis is regulated. PGs are  mediators formed in response to certain circulating hormones and cytokines. PGs act near their sites of synthesis to signal neighboring cells to coordinate their responses ( when platelets interact with blood vessels). The committed step in PG synthesis is the conversion of a 20-carbon omega-6 fatty  called  to prostaglandin endoperoxide H (PGH). Depending on the tissue and the hormone or cytokine stimulus, this reaction is catalyzed by either cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1 or COX-2). Once formed, PGH is converted, again depending on the context, to one of several downstream PG subtypes that act via specific G protein-coupled receptors. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) block PG synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 is also inhibited by COX-2-selective inhibitors. Inhibition of COX-1 by low-dose aspirin prevents thrombosis. COX-2 inhibition reduces inflammation and pain. Investigating the mysteries of COXs anchored my scientific career. I attribute my successes to the great good fortune of having been surrounded by people who helped me make the most of my talents.

Increasing evidences suggest that the alterations in tumor , including metabolite abundance and accumulation of metabolic products, lead to local immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. An integrated analysis of  in cancers from different tissues using multiple omics data may provide novel insight into the understanding of tumorigenesis and progression.Through systematic analysis of the multiple omics data from TCGA, we found that the most-widely altered  pathways in pan-cancer are fatty  ,  , cholesterol  and PPAR signaling.

Several hypertensive stimuli contribute to formation of IsoLG-protein adducts including excess dietary salt and catecholamines. The precise intracellular mechanisms by which these hypertensive stimuli lead to IsoLG-protein adduct formation are still not well understood; however, there is now evidence implicating NADPH-oxidase derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process. ROS oxidize  leading to formation of IsoLGs, which non-covalently adduct to lysine residues and alter protein structure and function. Recent studies suggest that these altered proteins act as neo-antigens leading to an autoimmune state that results in hypertension. The goal of this mini-review is to highlight some of the hypertensive stimuli and the mechanisms contributing to IsoLG-protein adduct formation leading to inflammation and hypertension.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

EETs elicit endothelial angiogenic activity linked to tumor growth in various cancer models that can be attenuated in vivo by COX-2 inhibitors. This study further defines the relationship between endothelial EET  and COX-2 in promoting angiogenesis. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX-2 inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-2, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET). When exogenously dosed into HAEC, synthetic 8,9,11-EHET enhanced angiogenesis at all concentrations tested, whereas 8,9,15-EHET was inactive. Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-2  in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET. This  mediator may play a role in regulating physiological angiogenesis, and it may be especially important under circumstances where COX-2 is induced, such as in cancer tumor growth and inflammation. Finally, the generation of 8, 9, 11-EHET from 8, 9-EET may help explain why EETs are weakly angiogenic under some conditions yet block tumor growth under other conditions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927246>Sodium Orthovanadate Changes Fatty  Composition and Increased Expression of Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Vanadium compounds are promising antidiabetic agents. In addition to regulating glucose , they also alter lipid . Due to the clear association between diabetes and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-oleic  and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA. This was associated with a lack of influence on the expression of FADS1 and FADS2.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306767>Role of acyl-CoA synthetase ACSL4 in  .</a></h2><p>The activation of long-chain free fatty acids is the first step reaction of their usage in the cells and tissues, which are catalyzed by a family of enzymes called acyl-coenzyme A synthetases long-chain isoform (ACSL).

Cell-cell interactions with component cells (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts) also enhance this machinery to augment allergic responses. Nasal polyp-derived eosinophils from patients with eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present a characteristic fatty   with selectively higher production of leukotriene D.

An alternative approach is to exploit the altered fitness of cells imposed by loss-of-wild-type p53. Here we identify niclosamide through a HTS screen for compounds selectively killing p53-deficient cells. Niclosamide impairs the growth of p53-deficient cells and of p53 mutant patient-derived ovarian xenografts. Metabolome profiling reveals that niclosamide induces mitochondrial uncoupling, which renders mutant p53 cells susceptible to mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis through preferential accumulation of  (AA), and represents a first-in-class inhibitor of p53 mutant tumors. Wild-type p53 evades the cytotoxicity by promoting the transcriptional induction of two key  oxygenation genes, ALOX5 and ALOX12B, which catalyzes the dioxygenation and breakdown of AA. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers defective in the p53 pathway, by exploiting their vulnerability to niclosamide-induced mitochondrial uncoupling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30184109>An omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  derivative, 18-HEPE, protects against CXCR4-associated melanoma metastasis.</a></h2><p>Melanoma has a high propensity to metastasize and exhibits a poor response to classical therapies. Dysregulation of the chemokine receptor gene CXCR4 is associated with melanoma progression, and although n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are known to be beneficial for melanoma prevention, the underlying mechanism of this effect is unclear. Here, we used the n-3 fatty  desaturase (-1) transgenic mouse model of endogenous n-3 PUFA synthesis to investigate the influence of elevated n-3 PUFA levels in a mouse model of metastatic melanoma. We found that relative to wild-type (WT) mice, -1 mice exhibited fewer pulmonary metastatic colonies and improved inflammatory indices, including reduced serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels and pulmonary myeloperoxidase activity. Differential PUFA metabolites in serum were considered a key factor to alter cancer cell travelling to lung, and we found that n-6 PUFAs such as  induced CXCR4 protein expression although n-3 PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) decreased CXCR4 levels. In addition, serum levels of the bioactive EPA metabolite, 18-HEPE, were elevated in -1 mice relative to WT mice, and 18-HEPE suppressed CXCR4 expression in B16-F0 cells. Moreover, relative to controls, numbers of pulmonary metastatic colonies were reduced in WT mice receiving intravenous injections either of 18-HEPE or 18-HEPE-pretreated melanoma cells. Our results indicate that 18-HEPE is a potential anticancer metabolite that mediates, at least in part, the preventive effect of n-3 PUFA on melanoma metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241945>Identification of biologically active δ-lactone eicosanoids as paraoxonase substrates.</a></h2><p>The mammalian paraoxonases (PONs 1, 2 and 3) are a family of esterases that are highly conserved within and between species. They exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, their physiological function(s) and native substrates are uncertain. Previous structure-activity relationship studies demonstrate that PONs have a high specificity for lipophilic lactones, suggesting that such compounds may be representative of native substrates. This report describes the ability of PONs to hydrolyze two bioactive δ-lactones derived from , 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic  lactone (5,6-DHTL) and cyclo-epoxycyclopentenone (cyclo-EC). Both lactones were very efficiently hydrolyzed by purified PON3. PON1 efficiently hydrolyzed 5,6-DHTL, but with a specific activity about 15-fold lower than PON3. 5,6-DHTL was a poor substrate for PON2. Cyclo-EC was a poor substrate for PON1 and not hydrolyzed by PON2. Studies with the PON inhibitor EDTA and a serine esterase inhibitor indicated that the PONs are the main contributors to hydrolysis of the lactones in human and mouse liver homogenates. Studies with homogenates from PON3 knockout mouse livers indicated that >80% of the 5,6-DHTL and cyclo-EC lactonase activities were attributed to PON3. The findings provide further insight into the structural requirements for PONs substrates and support the hypothesis that PONs, particularly PON1 and PON3, evolved to hydrolyze and regulate a class of lactone  mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This is partly due to bioactive  that drives both platelet and cancer biology. The two primary eicosanoid metabolites that maintain platelet rapid response homeostasis are prostacyclin made by endothelial cells that inhibits platelet function, which is counterbalanced by thromboxane produced by platelets during activation, aggregation, and platelet recruitment. Both of these  metabolites are inherently unstable due to their chemical structure. Tumor cells by contrast predominantly make more chemically stable prostaglandin E, which is the primary bioactive  associated with inflammation and oncogenesis. Pharmacological, clinical, and epidemiologic studies demonstrate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which target cyclooxygenases, can help prevent cancer. Much of the molecular and biological impact of these drugs is generally accepted in the field. Cyclooxygenases catalyze the rate-limiting production of substrate used by all synthase molecules, including those that produce prostaglandins along with prostacyclin and thromboxane.

Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation is involved in NMOSD pathogenesis. Resolution of inflammation, which is a highly regulated process mediated by specialized pro-resolving  mediators (SPMs) is important to prevent over-responsive inflammation. Deficiency in resolution of inflammation may lead to or accelerates inflammatory diseases. However, whether resolution of inflammation is impaired in NMOSD is not known. The objective of this study was to analyze the levels of SPMs in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of NMOSD patients, and to explore the roles of SPMs in clinical features of NMOSD.Thirty-five patients with NMOSD, 34 patients with multiple sclerosis, and 36 patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases were enrolled in this study. Pro-resolving mediators including Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and resolvin D1 (RvD1), as well as pro-inflammatory  mediator leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokine levels were analyzed using cytometric beads array (CBA).Our results showed RvD1 levels were significantly decreased, whereas LTB4 levels were significantly increased in the CSF of NMOSD patients.

This study aims to investigate the mechanism of AR intervention in liver fibrosis based on comprehensive metabolomics combined with network pharmacology approach.UPLC-Q-TOF/MS based metabolomics technique was used to explore the specific metabolites and possible pathways of AR affecting the pathological process of liver fibrosis. Network pharmacology analysis was introduced to explore the key targets of AR regarding the mechanisms on liver fibrosis.AR significantly reduced the levels of ALT, AST and AKP in serum, and improved pathological characteristics. Metabolomics analysis showed that the therapeutic effect of AR was mainly related to the regulation of nine metabolites, including sphingosine, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a, LysoPC (O-18:0), 3-dehydrosphinganine, 5,6-epoxy-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic , leukotriene C4, taurochenodesoxycholic , LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)) and 2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Pathway analysis indicated that the treatment of AR on liver fibrosis was related to  , ether , sphingolipid , glycerophospholipid  and primary bile  biosynthesis. Validation of the key targets by network pharmacology analysis of potential metabolic markers showed that AR significantly down-regulated the expression of CYP1B1 and up-regulated the expression of CYP1A2 and PCYT1A.Metabolomics combined with network pharmacology was used for the first time to clarify that the treatment of AR on liver fibrosis, which is related to the regulation of   and ether  by modulating the expression of CYP1A2, CYP1B1 and PCYT1A.

Very-low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to improve glucose control and the inflammatory response. We aimed to determine the effects of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD) enriched with ω-3 fatty acids (O3KD) on glucose levels and inflammation in mice with endotoxemia.Adult mice were fed 1 of 3 diets (control diet [CD], EKD, or O3KD). After 4 weeks, each group received saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally during the postprandial (PPP) or postabsorptive (PAP) periods. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL) 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Distribution of serum fatty acids was determined by gas liquid chromatography. Hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation, as well as glucose and , were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.During the PPP, glucose curves were comparable among the experimental groups. During the PAP, EKD showed a more pronounced increase in glucose levels at the first hour after LPS challenge compared with the CD-LPS group. During the PAP, IL6 was lower in O3KD-LPS compared with CD-LPS and EKD-LPS groups. These differences disappeared in the PPP. Similarly, TNF-α was lower in the O3KD-LPS group compared with the EKD-LPS group. The O3KD significantly increased the serum levels of the ω-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids and decreased the ω-6 .An O3KD leads to reduced inflammation and maintains glucose homeostasis in mice with endotoxemia.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277010>The green microalga Lobosphaera incisa harbours an arachidonate 15S-lipoxygenase.</a></h2><p>The green microalga Lobosphaera incisa is an oleaginous eukaryotic alga that is rich in  (20:4). Being rich in this polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), however, makes it sensitive to oxidation. In plants, lipoxygenases (LOXs) are the major enzymes that oxidise these molecules. Here, we describe, to our best knowledge, the first characterisation of a cDNA encoding a LOX (LiLOX) from a green alga. To obtain first insights into its function, we expressed it in E. coli, purified the recombinant enzyme and analysed its enzyme activity. The protein sequence suggests that LiLOX and plastidic LOXs from bryophytes and flowering plants may share a common ancestor. The fact that LiLOX oxidises all PUFAs tested with a consistent oxidation on the carbon n-6, suggests that PUFAs enter the substrate channel through their methyl group first (tail first). Additionally, LiLOX form the fatty  hydroperoxide in strict S configuration. LiLOX may represent a good model to study plastid LOX, because it is stable after heterologous expression in E. coli and highly active in vitro. Moreover, as the first characterised LOX from green microalgae, it opens the possibility to study endogenous LOX pathways in these organisms.© 2018 The Authors.

Recently, oxylipins derived from linoleic  (LA), the most abundantly consumed polyunsaturated fatty  in the modern diet, have been implicated as mediators of pain in the periphery and spinal cord. However, oxidized linoleic  derived mediators (OXLAMs) remain understudied in the brain, particularly during pain states. In this study, we employed a mouse model of chronic inflammatory pain followed by a targeted lipidomic analysis of the animals' amygdala and periaqueductal grey (PAG) using LC-MS/MS to investigate the effect of chronic inflammatory pain on oxylipin concentrations in these two brain nuclei known to participate in pain sensation and perception. From punch biopsies of these brain nuclei, we detected twelve OXLAMs in both the PAG and amygdala and one  derived mediator, 15-HETE, in the amygdala only. In the amygdala, we observed an overall decrease in the concentration of the majority of OXLAMs detected, while in the PAG the concentrations of only the epoxide LA derived mediators, 9,10-EpOME and 12,13-EpOME, and one trihydroxy LA derived mediator, 9,10,11-TriHOME, were reduced. This data provides the first evidence that OXLAM concentrations in the brain are affected by chronic pain, suggesting that OXLAMs may be relevant to pain signaling and adaptation to chronic pain in pain circuits in the brain and that the current view of OXLAMs in nociception derived from studies in the periphery is incomplete.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488836>Gut microbiota confers host resistance to obesity by metabolizing dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota mediates the effects of diet, thereby modifying host  and the incidence of metabolic disorders. Increased consumption of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) that is abundant in Western diet contributes to obesity and related diseases. Although gut-microbiota-related metabolic pathways of dietary PUFAs were recently elucidated, the effects on host physiological function remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that gut microbiota confers host resistance to high- diet (HFD)-induced obesity by modulating dietary PUFAs . Supplementation of 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic  (HYA), an initial linoleic -related gut-microbial metabolite, attenuates HFD-induced obesity in mice without eliciting -mediated adipose inflammation and by improving metabolic condition via free fatty  receptors. Moreover, Lactobacillus-colonized mice show similar effects with elevated HYA levels. Our findings illustrate the interplay between gut microbiota and host energy  via the metabolites of dietary omega-6-FAs thereby shedding light on the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders by targeting gut microbial metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30690640>Early Mechanistic Events Induced by Low Molecular Weight Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Mouse Lung Epithelial Cells: A Role for Eicosanoid Signaling.</a></h2><p>Low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (LMW PAHs; < 206.3 g/mol) are under regulated environmental contaminants (eg, secondhand smoke) that lead to gap junction dysregulation, p38 MAPK activation, and increased mRNA production of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and cyclooxygenase (COX2), in lung epithelial cells. However, the early mechanisms involving  signaling through the  pathway and subsequent eicosanoid production leading to these downstream events are not known. Common human exposures are to mixtures of LMW PAHs, thus C10 cells (a mouse lung epithelial cell line) were exposed to a representative binary PAH mixture, 1-methylanthracene (1-MeA) and fluoranthene (Flthn), for 30 min-24 h with and without p38 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitors. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibition reversed PAH-induced phospho-p38 MAPK activation and gap junction dysregulation at 30 min. A significant biphasic increase in cPLA2 protein was observed at 30 min, 2, and 4 h, as well as COX2 protein at 2 and 8 h. Untargeted metabolomics demonstrated a similar trend with significantly changing metabolites at 30 min and 4 h of exposure relative to 1 h; a "cPLA2-like" subset of metabolites within the biphasic response were predominately phospholipids. Targeted metabolomics showed several eicosanoids (eg, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), PGE2α) were significantly increased at 4, 8, and 12 h following exposure to the binary PAH mixture and this effect was p38-dependent. Finally, PAH  was not observed until after 8 h. These results indicate an early  signaling mechanism of LMW PAH toxicity in lung epithelial cells due to parent PAH compounds.© The Author(s) 2019.

The microalga  (WT) and its Δ5-desaturase mutant P127 (MUT) are unique photosynthetic sources for ARA and DGLA, respectively. This study explores the effect of dietary supplementation with  and P127 biomass on tissue fatty  composition, immune function, and disease resistance in zebrafish (). The broken microalgal biomass was added to commercial fish feed at 7.5 and 15% (w/w), providing 21.8 mg/g feed ARA for the WT-supplemented group and 13.6 mg/g feed DGLA for the MUT-supplemented group at the 15% inclusion levels. An unsupplemented group was used as the control. After 1 month of feeding, fish were challenged with . Fish were sampled before the challenge and 1 week after the challenge for various analyses. Tissue ARA and DGLA levels significantly increased in the liver, corresponding to microalgal supplementation levels. The elevated expression of specific immune-related genes was evident in the kidneys in all treatment groups after 1 month of feeding, including genes related to eicosanoid synthesis, lysozyme, and NF-κB. In the liver, microalgal supplementation led to the upregulation of genes related to immune function and antioxidant defense while the expression of examined genes involved in ARA  was downregulated. Importantly, fish fed with 15% of both WT- and MUT-supplemented feed showed significantly ( < 0.05) higher survival percentages (78 and 68%, respectively, as compared to only 46% in the control group). The elevated expression of genes related to inflammatory and immune responses was evident post-challenge. Collectively, the results of the current study demonstrate the potential of microalgae-derived dietary ARA and DGLA in improving immune competence and resistance to bacterial infection in zebrafish as a model organism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31357612>  and Kidney Inflammation.</a></h2><p>As a major component of cell membrane lipids,  (AA), being a major component of the cell membrane  content, is mainly metabolized by three kinds of enzymes: cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Based on these three metabolic pathways, AA could be converted into various metabolites that trigger different inflammatory responses. In the kidney, prostaglandins (PG), thromboxane (Tx), leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are the major metabolites generated from AA. An increased level of prostaglandins (PGs), TxA and leukotriene B4 (LTB) results in inflammatory damage to the kidney. Moreover, the LTB-leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1) axis participates in the acute kidney injury via mediating the recruitment of renal neutrophils. In addition, AA can regulate renal ion transport through 19-hydroxystilbenetetraenoic  (19-HETE) and 20-HETE, both of which are produced by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) generated by the CYP450 enzyme also plays a paramount role in the kidney damage during the inflammation process. For example, 14 and 15-EET mitigated ischemia/reperfusion-caused renal tubular epithelial cell damage. Many drug candidates that target the AA  pathways are being developed to treat kidney inflammation. These observations support an extraordinary interest in a wide range of studies on drug interventions aiming to control AA  and kidney inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30971474>Replication of Marek's Disease Virus Is Dependent on Synthesis of  Fatty  and Prostaglandin E.</a></h2><p>Marek's disease virus (MDV) causes deadly lymphoma and induces an imbalance of the  in infected chickens. Here, we discovered that MDV activates the fatty  synthesis (FAS) pathway in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). In addition, MDV-infected cells contained high levels of fatty acids and showed increased numbers of  droplets (LDs). Chemical inhibitors of the FAS pathway (TOFA and C75) reduced MDV titers by approximately 30-fold. Addition of the downstream metabolites, including malonyl-coenzyme A and palmitic , completely restored the inhibitory effects of the FAS inhibitors. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that MDV infection activates the COX-2/prostaglandin E (PGE) pathway, as evident by increased levels of , COX-2 expression, and PGE synthesis. Inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway by chemical inhibitors or knockdown of COX2 using short hairpin RNA reduced MDV titers, suggesting that COX-2 promotes virus replication. Exogenous PGE completely restored the inhibition of the COX-2/PGE pathway in MDV replication. Unexpectedly, exogenous PGE also partially rescued the inhibitory effects of FAS inhibitors on MDV replication, suggesting that there is a link between these two pathways in MDV infection. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the FAS and COX-2/PGE pathways play an important role in the replication of this deadly pathogen. Disturbances of the  in chickens infected with MDV contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However, the role of  in MDV replication remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDV infection activates FAS and induces LD formation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that MDV replication is highly dependent on the FAS pathway and the downstream metabolites. Finally, our results reveal that MDV also activates the COX-2/PGE pathway, which supports MDV replication by activating PGE/EP2 and PGE/EP4 signaling pathways.Copyright © 2019 Boodhoo et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830399>Italian cohort of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease is characterised by variation in glycerophospholipid, free fatty acids and amino  levels.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of pathologies characterised by chronic inflammation of the intestine and an unclear aetiology.

Currently, biopsies are the most used diagnostic tests for these diseases and metabolomics could represent a less invasive approach to identify biomarkers of disease presence and progression.The  and the polar metabolite profile of plasma samples of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have been compared with healthy individuals with the aim to find their metabolomic differences. Also, a selected sub-set of samples was analysed following solid phase extraction to further characterise differences between pathological samples.A total of 200 plasma samples were analysed using drift tube ion mobility coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for the  metabolite profile analysis, while liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the polar metabolite profile analysis.Variations in the  profile between inflammatory bowel disease and healthy individuals were highlighted. Phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and fatty acids were significantly changed among pathological samples suggesting changes in phospholipase A and  metabolic pathways. Variations in the levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids were also found. Furthermore, a decrease in amino acids levels suggests mucosal damage in inflammatory bowel disease.Given good statistical results and predictive power of the model produced in our study, metabolomics can be considered as a valid tool to investigate inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30301768>Inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase, an anti-inflammatory and antifibrogenic strategy in the liver.</a></h2><p>Sustained inflammation originating from macrophages is a driving force of fibrosis progression and resolution. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of monoacylglycerols. It is a proinflammatory enzyme that metabolises 2-arachidonoylglycerol, an endocannabinoid receptor ligand, into . Here, we investigated the impact of MAGL on inflammation and fibrosis during chronic liver injury.C57BL/6J mice and mice with global invalidation of MAGL (MAGL  ), or myeloid-specific deletion of either MAGL (MAGL), ATG5 (ATG) or CB2 (CB2), were used. Fibrosis was induced by repeated carbon tetrachloride (CCl) injections or bile duct ligation (BDL). Studies were performed on peritoneal or bone marrow-derived macrophages and Kupffer cells.MAGL  or MAGL mice exposed to CCl or subjected to BDL were more resistant to inflammation and fibrosis than wild-type counterparts. Therapeutic intervention with MJN110, an MAGL inhibitor, reduced hepatic macrophage number and inflammatory gene expression and slowed down fibrosis progression. MAGL inhibitors also accelerated fibrosis regression and increased Ly-6C macrophage number. Antifibrogenic effects exclusively relied on MAGL inhibition in macrophages, since MJN110 treatment of MAGL BDL mice did not further decrease liver fibrosis. Cultured macrophages exposed to MJN110 or from MAGL mice displayed reduced cytokine secretion. These effects were independent of the cannabinoid receptor 2, as they were preserved in CB2 mice. They relied on macrophage autophagy, since anti-inflammatory and antifibrogenic effects of MJN110 were lost in ATG5 BDL mice, and were associated with increased autophagic flux and autophagosome biosynthesis in macrophages when MAGL was pharmacologically or genetically inhibited.MAGL is an immunometabolic target in the liver. MAGL inhibitors may show promising antifibrogenic effects during chronic liver injury.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

The inflammation in joint tissue and system endanger the human health seriously. Methotrexate have exhibited a satisfactory therapeutic effect in clinical practice. The aim of this research was to establish the pharmacological mechanism of methotrexate on RA therapy. Collagen induced arthritic rats were used to identify how methotrexate alleviates inflammation in vivo. Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory proliferation in macrophages was also be detected in vitro. The activation level of Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and Nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin 3 domain (NLRP3)/Caspase-1 and related cytokines were examined by real-time PCR and western blotting or quantified with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis was performed to identify the alteration of metabolites. Results showed that treating with methotrexate could alleviate the inflammatory condition, downregulate the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3/Caspase-1 inflammatory pathways and reduce the level of related cytokines. Docking interaction between methotrexate and caspase-1 was visualized as six H-bonds indicating a potential inhibitory effect.

In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated oleic  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and metabolic consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane  composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in  droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic  remodelling, metabolic signatures of energy deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ALD stems from the production of toxic-reactive metabolites, oxidative stress and  accumulation in hepatocytes which ultimately results in hepatocyte death promoting hepatitis and fibrosis deposition. Monocyte-derived infiltrating Ly6C and Ly6C macrophages are instrumental in perpetuating and resolving the hepatitis and fibrosis associated with ALD pathogenesis. In the present study we isolated liver infiltrating macrophages from mice on an ethanol diet and subjected them to metabolomic and proteomic analysis to provide a broad assessment of the cellular metabolite and protein differences between infiltrating macrophage phenotypes. We identified numerous differentially regulated metabolites and proteins between Ly6C and Ly6C macrophages. Bioinformatic analysis for pathway enrichment of the differentially regulated metabolites showed a significant number of metabolites involved in the processes of glycerophospholipid ,   and phospholipid biosynthesis. From analysis of the infiltrating macrophage proteome, we observed a significant enrichment in the biological processes of antigen presentation, actin polymerization and organization, phagocytosis and apoptotic regulation.

While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment in obesity have been delineated, the signals directing macrophage persistence in VAT are poorly understood. We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in obesity, we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance  handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in  handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport,  droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of  localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in  , and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT.

Separate mice from each group were used solely for serial blood draws for measurement of biomarkers of bone formation and resorption.At the microstructural level, although some parameters in cortical bone reached differences that were statistically significant in female mice, these were too small to be considered biologically relevant. Similarly, trabecular bone parameters in male mice were statistically different in some dietary groups, although the biological interpretation of such subtle changes translate into a lack of effect in favor of any of the experimental diets. No differences were noted at the mechanical level and in blood-based biomarkers of bone  across dietary groups within gender.Subtle differences were noted at the bones' microstructural level, however these are likely the result of random effects that do not translate into changes that are biologically relevant. Similarly, differences were not seen at the mechanical level, nor were they reflected in blood-based biomarkers of bone . Altogether, dietary consumption of PUFA do not seem to affect bone structure or  in a healthy model of growing mice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits lipid storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased lipid accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic lipid accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated fat accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30407793>5 S,15 S-Dihydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (5,15-diHpETE) as a Lipoxin Intermediate: Reactivity and Kinetics with Human Leukocyte 5-Lipoxygenase, Platelet 12-Lipoxygenase, and Reticulocyte 15-Lipoxygenase-1.</a></h2><p>The reaction of 5 S,15 S-dihydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (5,15-diHpETE) with human 5-lipoxygenase (LOX), human platelet 12-LOX, and human reticulocyte 15-LOX-1 was investigated to determine the reactivity and relative rates of producing lipoxins (LXs). 5-LOX does not react with 5,15-diHpETE, although it can produce LXA when 15-HpETE is the substrate. In contrast, both 12-LOX and 15-LOX-1 react with 5,15-diHpETE, forming specifically LXB. For 12-LOX and 5,15-diHpETE, the kinetic parameters are k = 0.17 s and k/ K = 0.011 μM s [106- and 1600-fold lower than those for 12-LOX oxygenation of  (AA), respectively]. On the other hand, for 15-LOX-1 the equivalent parameters are k = 4.6 s and k/ K = 0.21 μM s (3-fold higher and similar to those for 12-HpETE formation by 15-LOX-1 from AA, respectively). This contrasts with the complete lack of reaction of 15-LOX-2 with 5,15-diHpETE [Green, A. R., et al. (2016) Biochemistry 55, 2832-2840]. Our data indicate that 12-LOX is markedly inferior to 15-LOX-1 in catalyzing the production of LXB from 5,15-diHpETE. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by the addition of 5,15-diHpETE, with an IC of 1.3 μM; however, LXB did not significantly inhibit collagen-mediated platelet activation up to 10 μM. In summary, LXB is the primary product of 12-LOX and 15-LOX-1 catalysis, if 5,15-diHpETE is the substrate, with 15-LOX-1 being 20-fold more efficient than 12-LOX. LXA is the primary product with 5-LOX but only if 15-HpETE is the substrate. Approximately equal proportions of LXA and LXB are produced by 12-LOX but only if LTA is the substrate, as described previously [Sheppard, K. A., et al. (1992) Biochim. Biophys.

This study proposed a new LC-MS/MS method to quantify the main vitamin E forms, their metabolites and main PUFA species in human blood, since, at present, there are not procedures able to simultaneously determine these two classes of compounds. After the optimization of sample treatment and reverse-phase separation conditions, tandem mass spectrometry detection was evaluated experimenting both positive and negative electrospray ionisation modes. The procedure was also preliminarily adapted to assess five -derived eicosanoids that could be under the influence of vitamin E function, such as LTB4 (leukotriene B4), 20-HETE (20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ) and their ω-oxidation metabolites. After the validation study, the performance characteristics were confirmed analysing a certified reference material (SRM 1950 - frozen human plasma by NIST). Finally, an application of the method in the analysis of  abnormalities of chronic kidney disease patients was shown.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to metabolic diseases are still less understandable.Previously, we screened a group of spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys. Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143  species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C20:4), FFA especially palmitic  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys. Conversely, the levels of most PE species were obviously reduced in the obese monkeys.Collectively, our work suggests that lipids such as FFA C16:0 and 16:0-LPA may be potential candidates for the diagnosis and study of obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593874>Lysophosphatidic  precursor levels decrease and an -containing phosphatidylcholine level increases in the dorsal root ganglion of mice after peripheral nerve injury.</a></h2><p>In the current study, we aimed to analyze the  changes in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after sciatic nerve transection (SNT) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). We found that the -containing phosphatidylcholine (AA-PC), PC(16:0/20:4) largely increased, while PC(16:0/18:1), PC(18:0/18:1) and phosphatidic  (PA)(36:2) levels largely decreased in the DRG following nerve injury. Previous studies show that the increase in PC(16:0/20:4) was associated with neuropathic pain and that decrease in PC(16:0/18:1), PC(18:0/18:1), and PA(36:2) were due to producing lysophosphatidic  (LPA), an initiator for neuropathic pain. These results suggest that the  changes in DRG after SNT could be the result of changes for the cause of neuropathic pain. Thus, blocking of LPA could be potential for treatment of neuropathic pain.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Because the APOE is central to the transport and  of lipids, we examined associations between plasma fatty acids and the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and mortality by APOE-ε4 genotype. Methods- We included 943 FHS (Framingham Heart Study) and 1406 3C (Three-City) Bordeaux Study participants. Plasma docosahexaenoic, linoleic, , and palmitic fatty acids were measured at baseline by gas chromatography. All-cause stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality events were identified prospectively using standardized protocols. Each cohort used Cox models to separately relate fatty  levels to the risk of developing each event during ≤10 years of follow-up adjusting for potential confounders and stratifying by APOE genotype (ε4 carriers versus noncarriers). We then meta-analyzed summary statistics using random-effects models. Results- On average, participants had a mean age of 74 years, 61% were women, and 21% (n=483) were APOE-ε4 carriers. Meta-analysis results showed that, only among APOE-ε4 carriers, every SD unit increase in linoleic  was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.38-0.78]), ischemic stroke (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.33-0.71]), and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.85]). In contrast, every SD unit increase in palmitic  was related to an increased risk of all-cause stroke (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.16-2.17]), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.26-2.45]), and coronary heart disease (HR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.09-2.01]), also in APOE-ε4 carriers only. Results for docosahexaenoic  and  were heterogeneous between cohorts. Conclusions- These exploratory results suggest that APOE-ε4 carriers may be more susceptible to the beneficial or adverse impact of fatty acids on cardiovascular disease and mortality. In this subgroup, higher linoleic  was protective for stroke and mortality, whereas palmitic  was a risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease. The mechanisms underlying these novel findings warrant further investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121835>Metabolites of prostaglandin synthases as potential biomarkers of Lyme disease severity and symptom resolution.</a></h2><p>Lyme disease or Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the commonest vector-borne disease in the North America. It is an inflammatory disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The role of the inflammatory processes mediated by prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes and leukotrienes (LTs) in LB severity and symptoms resolution is yet to be elucidated.We aim to systematically review and evaluate the role of PGs and related  mediators in the induction and resolution of inflammation in LB.We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic to identify cell-culture, animal and human studies reporting the changes in PGs and related  mediators of inflammation during the course of LB.We identified 18 studies to be included into this systematic review. The selected reports consisted of seven cell-culture studies, seven animal studies, and four human studies (from three patient populations). Results from cell-culture and animal studies suggest that PGs and other  mediators of inflammation are elevated in LB and may contribute to disease development. The limited number of human studies showed that subjects with Lyme meningitis, Lyme arthritis (LA) and antibiotic-refractory LA had increased levels of an array of PGs and  mediators (e.g., LTB 8-isoPGF, and phospholipases A activity). Levels of these markers were significantly reduced following the treatment with antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Dysregulation of prostaglandins and related  mediators may play a role in the etiology of LB and persistence of inflammation that may lead to long-term complications. Further investigation into the precise levels of a wide range of PGs and related factors is critical as it may propose novel markers that can be used for early diagnosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562622>Novel n-3 Docosapentaneoic -Derived Pro-resolving Mediators Are Vasculoprotective and Mediate the Actions of Statins in Controlling Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a fundamentally protective process that guards the host from invading pathogens and is central in the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. However, when uncontrolled, the overzealous response leads to tissue damage and malaise. Indeed, this process is now appreciated to be at the center of many chronic inflammatory diseases including vascular disease and arthritis. Studies investigating the mechanisms through which acute inflammation is actively turned off allowing tissues to regain function demonstrated that the essential fatty acids,  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are enzymatically converted to bioactive mediators. These autacoids carry distinct structures and biological actions, actively reprogramming the inflammatory reaction to promote its termination by counter-regulating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and regulate leukocyte trafficking as well as phenotype. Recently we found that n-3 docosapentaenoic  (DPA), which was until then only regarded as a biosynthetic intermediate in the formation of DHA from EPA, is also converted to structurally distinct bioactive mediators that reprogram the host immune response. In the present review we will discuss the evidence underpinning the biological actions of these novel n-3 DPA-derived autacoids in particular as they pertain to the vascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30684234>Complete NMR chemical shift assignments of odorant binding protein 22 from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, bound to .</a></h2><p>Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the vector for transmission of Dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. These mosquitos feed exclusively on human hosts for a blood meal. Previous studies have established that Dengue virus infection of the mosquito results in increased expression of the odorant binding proteins 22 and 10 within the mosquito salivary gland and silencing of these genes dramatically reduces blood-feeding behaviors. Odorant binding proteins are implicated in modulating the chemosensory perception of external stimuli that regulate behaviors such as host location, feeding and reproduction. However, the role that AeOBP22 plays in the salivary gland is unclear. Here, as a first step to a more complete understanding of the function of AeOBP22, we present the complete backbone and side chain chemical shift assignments of the protein in the complex it forms with . These assignments reveal that the protein consists of seven α-helices, and that the  is bound tightly to the protein.

The identification of regio- and stereospecific LOXs is important because their specific products are involved in different physiological activities in various organisms. Bacterial LOXs are found only in some proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, and they are not stable in vitro. Here, we used C20 and C22 PUFAs such as  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  to identify an 11-specific LOX from the proteobacterium  and explore its in vitro stability and activity. The activity and stability of  ARA 11-LOX as well as the production of 11-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  from ARA were significantly increased by the addition of phosphatidylcholine, Ca, and coactosin-like protein (newly identified in the yeast ) as stimulatory factors; in fact, LOX activity in the presence of all three factors increased approximately 3-fold. Our results indicate that these stimulatory factors can be used to increase the activity and stability of bacterial LOX and the production of bioactive hydroxy fatty acids, which can contribute to new academic research.Copyright © 2018 An and Oh.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403679>Characterization of the endocannabinoid system in subcutaneous adipose tissue in periparturient dairy cows and its association to metabolic profiles.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue (AT) plays a major role in metabolic adaptations in postpartum (PP) dairy cows. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key regulator of  and energy homeostasis; however, information about this system in ruminants is scarce. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the eCB system in subcutaneous AT, and to determine its relation to the metabolic profile in peripartum cows. Biopsies of AT were performed at 14 d prepartum, and 4 and 30 d PP from 18 multiparous peripartum cows. Cows were categorized retrospectively according to those with high body weight (BW) loss (HWL, 8.5 ± 1.7% BW loss) or low body weight loss (LWL, 2.9 ± 2.5% BW loss) during the first month PP. The HWL had higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids and a lower insulin/glucagon ratio PP than did LWL. Two-fold elevated AT levels of the main eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were found 4 d PP compared with prepartum in HWL, but not in LWL cows. AT levels of the eCB-like molecules oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and of  were elevated PP compared with prepartum in all cows. The abundance of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), the 2-AG degrading enzyme, was lower in HWL vs. LWL AT PP. The relative gene expression of the cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 in AT tended to be higher in HWL vs. LWL PP. Proteomic analysis of AT showed an enrichment of the inflammatory pathways' acute phase signaling and complement system in HWL vs. LWL cows PP. In summary, eCB levels in AT were elevated at the onset of lactation as part of the metabolic adaptations in PP dairy cows. Furthermore, activating the eCB system in AT is most likely associated with a metabolic response of greater BW loss, lipolysis, and AT inflammation in PP dairy cows.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616913>Analysis of the Uterine Lumen in Fertility-Classified Heifers: I. Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h2><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling,  , and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main  class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several  genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty acids were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

We recently showed that the phospholipid composition of rainbow trout liver cells (RTL-W1 cell line) modulates their tolerance to an acute cadmium (Cd) challenge. Here, we investigated (i) the extent to which PUFAs and Cd impact fatty  homeostasis and  in these cells and (ii) possible mechanisms by which specific PUFAs may confer cytoprotection against Cd. First, RTL-W1 cells were cultivated for one week in growth media spiked with 50 μmol L of either alpha-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) or  (AA, 20:4n-6) in order to modulate their fatty  profile.

We observed that the fatty  supply and, to a lesser extent, the exposure to Cd influenced cellular fatty  homeostasis and . The cellular fatty  composition of fish liver cells modulated their tolerance to an acute Cd challenge. Enrichments in ALA, EPA, and, to a lesser extent, AA conferred cytoprotection while enrichment in LA had no impact on cell viability. The present study ruled out the possibility that cytoprotection reflects a decreased Cd burden. Our results rather suggest that the PUFA-derived cytoprotection against Cd occurs through a reduction of the oxidative stress induced by Cd and a differential induction of the eicosanoid cascade, with a possible role of peroxiredoxin and glutaredoxin (antioxidant enzymes) as well as cytosolic phospholipase A2 (enzyme initiating the eicosanoid cascade).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of our present work was to investigate changes in the cardiac metabolome following relaxin-2 treatment.Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with human recombinant relaxin-2 using osmotic minipumps at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. Body composition was measured with a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system seven days after surgery and on the final day of the experiment. The last two days of treatment, respiratory quotient, locomotor activity and energy expenditure were measured with a calorimetric system. The plasma levels of relaxin-2, total cholesterol, high- and low- density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL), triglycerides and the hepatic enzymes glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GTP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were analyzed. The metabolic profiling of both atria from relaxin-2-treated and control rats was carried out using two separate ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Time of Flight-MS based platforms analyzing methanol and chloroform/methanol extracts combined with a UHPLC-single quadrupole-MS based platform used to analyze aminoacids and with a methanol/water extract platform that covered polar metabolites. Identified ion features in the methanol extract platform included fatty acids, acyl carnitines, bile acids, monoacylglycerophospholipids, monoetherglycerophospholipids, free sphingoid bases, and oxidized fatty acids. The chloroform / methanol extract platform provided coverage over glycerolipids, cholesterol esters, sphingolipids, diacylglycerophospholipids, and acyl-ether-glycerophospholipids. Gene expression levels of the adipokines adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1 in visceral adipose tissue and cardiac gene expression levels of key enzymes of desaturation and elongation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs were assessed by Real Time-PCR.Twenty-eight metabolites out of three hundred sixty-two were significantly altered by human relaxin-2. These included fifteen glycerophospholipids: three phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) and twelve phosphatidylcholines (PC); eight sphingolipids: three ceramides (Cer) and five sphingomyelins (SM); and also five aminoacids and one carboxylic . Interestingly, the majority of changes correspond to  classes, twelve of them polyunsaturated diacylglycerophosphatidylcholines with long acyl chains, containing mainly docosahexaenoic  (22:6) and  (20:4). Atrial levels of Elovl5 (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5), Fads1 (Δ5-fatty  desaturase) and Fads2 (Δ6-fatty  desaturase), key enzymes of elongation and desaturation of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs like  and DHA, respectively, were significantly increased by relaxin-2 treatment. Atrial tissues from rats treated with relaxin-2 showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of Srebf1, a transcription factor that activates the gene expression of Elovl5, Fads1 and Fads2. The treatment with relaxin-2 significantly decreased the visceral  mRNA expression levels of adiponectin, leptin and nesfatin-1, adipokines known to exert an important influence on the regulation of cardiovascular function.Serelaxin (human recombinant relaxin-2) treatment induces significant changes in cardiac major components of the membrane  bilayer such as glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, known to have structural roles but also very relevant regulatory effects in cardiac function. Serelaxin induced also modifications in several aminoacids of high influence in cardiac energy  regulation.

The precursor leukotriene A (LTA) is synthesized from  (AA) by 5‑lipoxygenase (5-LOX), a membrane-associated enzyme, with the help of 5‑lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), a nuclear transmembrane protein. In lipoxygenases the main chain carboxylate of the C-terminus is a ligand for the non-heme iron and thus part of the catalytic center. We investigated the role of a lysine-rich sequence (KKK) 20 amino acids upstream of the C-terminus unique to 5-LOX that might displace the main-chain carboxylate in the iron coordination sphere. A 5-LOX mutant in which KKK is replaced by ENL was transfected into HEK293 cells in the absence and presence of FLAP. This mutant gave ~20-fold higher 5-LOX product levels in stimulated HEK cells relative to the wild-type 5-LOX. Co-expression of the enzymes with FLAP led to an equalization of 5-LOX products detected, with wild-type 5-LOX product levels increased and those from the mutant enzyme decreased. These data suggest that the KKK motif limits 5-LOX activity and that this attenuated activity must be compensated by the presence of FLAP as a partner protein for effective LT biosynthesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We incorporated targeted and untargeted approaches for profiling oxylipins and complex lipids such as glycerol (phospho) lipids, sphingolipids, and sterols, respectively, which led to the characterization of 1026  molecules from the mouse tissues. The lipidomic analysis indicated that the intake of PUFAs strongly impacted the  profiles of metabolic organs such as the liver and kidney, while causing less impact on the brain. Moreover, we revealed a unique  modulation in most tissues, where phospholipids containing linoleic  were significantly decreased in mice on the ARA-supplemented diet, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) selectively incorporated DHA over ARA and EPA.

Hepatic ACSL4 is coregulated with the phospholipid (PL)-remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acyltransferase 3 by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ to modulate the plasma triglyceride (TG) . In this study, we investigated the acute effects of hepatic ACSL4 deficiency on  in adult mice fed a high- diet (HFD). Adenovirus-mediated expression of a mouse ACSL4 shRNA (Ad-shAcsl4) in the liver of HFD-fed mice led to a 43% reduction of hepatic arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity and a 53% decrease in ACSL4 protein levels compared with mice receiving control adenovirus (Ad-shLacZ). Attenuated ACSL4 expression resulted in a substantial decrease in circulating VLDL-TG levels without affecting plasma cholesterol. Lipidomics profiling revealed that knocking down ACSL4 altered liver PL compositions, with the greatest impact on accumulation of abundant LPC species (LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species (LPE 16:0 and LPE 18:0). In addition, fasting glucose and insulin levels were higher in Ad-shAcsl4-transduced mice versus control (Ad-shLacZ). Glucose tolerance testing further indicated an insulin-resistant phenotype upon knockdown of ACSL4. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that ACSL4 plays a role in plasma TG and glucose  and hepatic PL synthesis of hyperlipidemic mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558277>Deuterated  Acids Library for Regulation of Inflammation and Controlled Synthesis of Eicosanoids: An In Vitro Study.</a></h2><p>The synthesis of signal lipids, including eicosanoids, is not fully understood, although it is key to the modulation of various inflammatory states. Recently, isotopologues of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) deuterated at bis-allylic positions (D-PUFAs) have been proposed as inhibitors of non-enzymatic  peroxidation (LPO) in various disease models.  (AA, 20:4 n-6) is the main precursor to several classes of eicosanoids, which are produced by cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX). In this study we analyzed the relative activity of human recombinant enzymes COX-2, 5-LOX, and 15-LOX-2 using a library of  acids variably deuterated at the bis-allylic (C7, C10, and C13) positions. Kinetic parameters (KM, V) and isotope effects calculated from kH/kD for seven deuterated  derivatives were obtained. Spectroscopic methods have shown that deuteration at the 13th position dramatically affects the kinetic parameters of COX-2 and 15-LOX-2. The activity of 5-LOX was evaluated by measuring hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (8-HETE and 5-HETE) using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Deuteration at the seventh and 10th positions affects the performance of the 5-LOX enzyme. A flowchart is proposed suggesting how to modulate the synthesis of selected eicosanoids using the library of deuterated isotopologues to potentially fine-tune various inflammation stages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528790>Dynamic differences in dietary polyunsaturated fatty   in sputum of COPD patients and controls.</a></h2><p>Disturbances in onset and resolution of inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are incompletely understood. Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can be converted into  mediators here collectively named oxylipins. These include classical eicosanoids, but also pro-resolving mediators. A balanced production of pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving oxylipins is of importance for adequate inflammatory responses and subsequent return to homeostasis.Here we investigated if PUFA  is disturbed in COPD patients.Free PUFA and oxylipin levels were measured in induced sputum samples from the Bergen COPD cohort and COPD exacerbation study using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Additionally, effects of whole cigarette smoke on PUFA  in air-liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells were assessed.Significantly lower levels of free alpha-linolenic , linoleic  and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) were detected in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. During acute exacerbation (AE), levels of free  and docosapentaenoic  were higher than in stable COPD patients. Furthermore, levels of omega-3 EPA- and docosahexaenoic -derived oxylipins were lower in sputum from stable COPD patients compared to controls. Cyclooxygenase-2-converted mediators were mostly increased during AE. In vitro studies additionally showed that cigarette smoke exposure may also directly contribute to altered epithelial PUFA , and indirectly by causing airway epithelial remodelling.Our findings show significant differences in PUFA  in COPD patients compared to controls, further changed during AE. Airway epithelial remodelling may contribute to these changes. These findings provide new insight in impaired inflammatory resolution in COPD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Oxylipins and more specifically eicosanoids, which are  mediators formed from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are known to regulate reproduction together with other physiological processes in insects. In D. magna, the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and their putative role in the regulation of reproduction has been studied using transcriptomics, genomics and exposures to cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Quantification of eicosanoids and oxylipins derived from PUFAs upon exposure to pharmaceuticals is therefore crucial for a better understanding of the mode of action of neuro-active pharmaceuticals on aquatic invertebrates. The aim of this study was to investigate shifts in the oxylipin profile in D. magna adults upon exposure to environmental concentrations of the three psychiatric drugs, fluoxetine, diazepam and carbamazepine, with known effects of enhancing offspring production. Oxylipin profiles were determined in whole organism tissues using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Up to 28 different oxylipins belonging to  (AA), linoleic  (LA), α-linoleic  (α-LA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) pathways were detected and quantified in D. magna adults. Exposure to the selected psychiatric drugs showed that fluoxetine enhanced the accumulation of the cyclooxygenase (COX) product 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic  (12-HHTrE), whereas diazepam increased the concentration of eicosanoids belonging to the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways (HETEs, EpOMEs, HODEs, HOTrEs and HEPEs) from the AA, LA, αLA and EPA pathways. Carbamazepine had little effect and only one LA-derived compound from the LOX pathway (13-HODE) increased significantly. This means that despite having different modes of action in humans, fluoxetine and diazepam up-regulated eicosanoid pathways in D. magna, closely related to known biologically active products that regulate reproduction in insects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The degradation in quality and excessive  accumulation in cultured C. idellus have long been attributed to possible alterations in the  of fish muscle tissues as a result of overnutrition from artificial diets. To investigate the effects of different diets on fish muscle quality, a large-scale metabolomics study was performed on 250 tails of C. idellus.The experimental fish were divided into four groups based on sex and diet-female artificial feed (FAF), female grass feed, male artificial feed (MAF), and male grass feed (MGF). After a 113-day rearing period, the artificial feed (AF) group showed a significantly higher total mass of muscle  (P < 0.01), with the FAF group being the highest. Metabolomics profiling based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed distinctive patterns of clustering according to the four groups. Overall, artificial feeding was associated with higher concentrations of docosapentaenoic , dihomo-gamma-linolenic , and , whereas grass feeding was associated with elevated n-3 unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic , alpha-linolenic , and gamma-linolenic . Artificial feeding also resulted in significant increased docosahexaenoic  in MAF muscle than in MGF fish, whereas there was no significance in the comparison of female samples. Metabolic pathway analyses using both targeted and untargeted approaches consistently revealed that   and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathways were significantly different between AF and grass fed groups.Our results suggest that grass is a better source of dietary fatty  and protein when compared to artificial feed. Grass feeding could effectively lower triglycerides in serum, reduce  accumulation, and alter  compositions in fish muscle by increasing the concentrations of n-3 UFAs, leading to better nutrition and health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30383833>Tumor-promoting effects of pancreatic cancer cell exosomes on THP-1-derived macrophages.</a></h2><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor growth is enhanced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), yet the mechanisms by which tumor cells and TAMs communicate are not fully understood. Here we show that exosomes secreted by PDAC cell lines differed in their surface proteins,  composition, and efficiency of fusing with THP-1-derived macrophages in vitro. Exosomes from AsPC-1, an ascites-derived human PDAC cell line, were enriched in ICAM-1, which mediated their docking to macrophages through interactions with surface-exposed CD11c on macrophages. AsPC-1 exosomes also contained much higher levels of  (AA), and they fused at a higher rate with THP-1-derived macrophages than did exosomes from other PDAC cell lines or from an immortalized normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) H6c7. Phospholipase A2 enzymatic cleavage of  from AsPC-1 exosomes reduced fusion efficiency. PGE2 secretion was elevated in macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes but not in macrophages treated with exosomes from other cell lines, suggesting a functional role for the AsPC-1 exosome-delivered  in macrophages. Non-polarized (M0) macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had increased levels of surface markers indicative of polarization to an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype (CD14hi CD163hi CD206hi). Furthermore, macrophages treated with AsPC-1 exosomes had significantly increased secretion of pro-tumoral, bioactive molecules including VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, MMP-9, and TNFα. Together, these results demonstrate that compared to exosomes from other primary tumor-derived PDAC cell lines, AsPC-1 exosomes alter THP-1-derived macrophage phenotype and function. AsPC-1 exosomes mediate communication between tumor cells and TAMs that contributes to tumor progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30996346>Fatty  transport protein 2 reprograms neutrophils in cancer.</a></h2><p>Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are pathologically activated neutrophils that are crucial for the regulation of immune responses in cancer. These cells contribute to the failure of cancer therapies and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances in the understanding of PMN-MDSC biology, the mechanisms responsible for the pathological activation of neutrophils are not well defined, and this limits the selective targeting of these cells. Here we report that mouse and human PMN-MDSCs exclusively upregulate fatty  transport protein 2 (FATP2). Overexpression of FATP2 in PMN-MDSCs was controlled by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, through the activation of the STAT5 transcription factor. Deletion of FATP2 abrogated the suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs. The main mechanism of FATP2-mediated suppressive activity involved the uptake of  and the synthesis of prostaglandin E. The selective pharmacological inhibition of FATP2 abrogated the activity of PMN-MDSCs and substantially delayed tumour progression. In combination with checkpoint inhibitors, FATP2 inhibition blocked tumour progression in mice. Thus, FATP2 mediates the acquisition of immunosuppressive activity by PMN-MDSCs and represents a target to inhibit the functions of PMN-MDSCs selectively and to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237701>The whole transcriptional profiling of cellular  during adipogenesis from hMSCs.</a></h2><p> homeostasis plays an important role in progenitor-cell differentiation to adipocytes, but less is known about the whole transcriptional profiling of cellular  during adipogenesis.

Although FABP1 regulates hepatic uptake and  of ARA, almost nothing is known regarding FABP1's impact on AEA and 2-AG uptake, intracellular distribution, and targeting of AEA and 2-AG to degradative hepatic enzymes. In vitro assays revealed that FABP1 considerably enhanced monoacylglycerol lipase hydrolysis of 2-AG but only modestly enhanced AEA hydrolysis by fatty- amide hydrolase. Conversely, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of lipids from Fabp1 gene-ablated (LKO) hepatocytes confirmed that loss of FABP1 markedly diminished hydrolysis of 2-AG. Furthermore, the real-time imaging of novel fluorescent NBD-labeled probes (NBD-AEA, NBD-2-AG, and NBD-ARA) resolved FABP1's impact on uptake vs intracellular targeting/hydrolysis. FABP1 bound NBD-ARA with 2:1 stoichiometry analogous to ARA, but bound NBD-2-AG and NBD-AEA with 1:1 stoichiometry-apparently at different sites in FABP1's binding cavity. All three probes were taken up, but NBD-2-AG and NBD-AEA were targeted to  droplets. LKO reduced the uptake of NBD-ARA as expected, significantly enhanced that of NBD-AEA, but had little effect on NBD-2-AG. These data indicated that FABP1 impacts hepatocyte EC levels by binding EC and differentially impacts their intracellular hydrolysis (2-AG) and uptake (AEA).© 2018 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063920>Maternal short and medium chain fatty acids supply during early pregnancy improves embryo survival through enhancing progesterone synthesis in rats.</a></h2><p>Exploring strategies to prevent miscarriage in women or early pregnancy loss in mammals is of great importance. Manipulating maternal  to maintain sufficient progesterone level is an effective way. To investigated the embryo loss and progesterone synthesis impacts of short and medium chain fatty acids on the , pregnancy outcome and embryo implantation were investigated in rats fed the pregnancy diets supplemented without or with 0.1% sodium butyrate (SB), 0.1% sodium hexanoate (SH), or 0.1% sodium caprylate (SC) during the entire pregnancy and early pregnancy, respectively, followed with evaluation of potential mechanisms. Maternal SB, SH, or SC supply significantly improved live litter size and embryo implantation in rats. Serum progesterone, , and phospholipid metabolites levels were significantly increased in response to maternal SB, SH, and SC supply. The expression of key genes involved in ovarian steroidogenesis and granulosa cell luteinization were elevated in ovaries and primary cultured granulosa cells, including cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1). Additionally, the expression of lysophosphatidic  receptor 3 (LPA) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX) related with phospholipid  were enhanced in uterus in vivo and in in vitro cultured uterine tissue. In conclusion, maternal SB, SH and SC supply reduced early pregnancy loss through modulating maternal phospholipid  and ovarian progesterone synthesis in rats. Our results have important implications that short or medium chain fatty acids have the potential to prevent miscarriage in women or early pregnancy loss in mammals.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Since the aneurysm can rupture, AAA is a life-threatening vascular disease, which may be amenable to surgical repair. At present, no pharmacological therapy for AAA is available. The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway of   leads to biosynthesis of leukotrienes (LTs), potent  mediators with pro-inflammatory biological actions. Among the LTs, cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cys-LT) are well-recognized signaling molecules in human asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, the effects of these molecules in cardiovascular diseases have only recently been explored. Drugs antagonizing the CysLT1 receptor, termed lukasts and typified by montelukast, are established therapeutics for clinical management of asthma. Lukasts are safe, well-tolerated drugs that can be administered during long time periods. Here we describe recent data indicating that montelukast may be used for prevention and treatment of AAA, thus representing a promising pharmacological tool for a deadly vascular disease with significant socio-economic impact.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In general, all epoxy PUFAs including ω-3 epoxides are quickly metabolized/inactivated by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to form diol products. The aims of this study were to determine the effect and mechanism of -1 transgene, and ω-3 PUFA combined with sEH gene knockout or inhibitor on inhibiting pancreatic cancer and the related mechanisms involved.PK03-mutant Kras murine pancreatic carcinoma cells were inoculated into mouse models including -1, sEH and C57BL/6J mice. The mice were fed with AIN-76A diet with or without ω-3 PUFA supplementation or treated with sEH inhibitor. In addition to tumor growth (tumor size and weight), cell proliferation, mutant Kras-mediated signaling, inflammatory reaction and angiogenesis were analyzed immunohisto-chemically and by western blot assay. ω-3 PUFA , particularly focusing on ω-3 epoxy fatty acids (ω-3 epoxides), was measured using a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach.Significant decreases of weight and size of the PK03 pancreatic carcinoma were observed in the -1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor compared to those of C57BL/6J control mice fed with AIN-76A diet (weight: 0.28±0.04 g vs. 0.58±0.06 g; size: 187.0±17.5 mm vs. 519.3±60.6 mm). In a separate experiment, sEH mice fed ω-3 PUFA supplement and C57BL/6J mice treated with sEH inhibitor and fed ω-3 PUFA supplement exhibited a significant reduction in the weight and size of the pancreatic carcinoma compared to C57BL/6J control mice (weight: 0.26±.26 g and 0.39±.39 g vs. 0.69±0.11 g, respectively; size: 274.2±36.2 mm and 296.4±99.8 mm vs. 612.6±117.8 mm, respectively). Moreover, compared to the pancreatic tumors in C57BL/6J control mice, the tumors in -1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor showed a significant less inflammatory cell infiltrate (62.6±9.2/HPF (high power field) vs. 8.0±1.2/HPF), tumor cell proliferation (48.5±1.7% vs. 16.5±1.6%), and angiogenesis (micro-vessel density (MVD): 35.0±1.0 vs. 11.1±0.5) immunohistochemically, as well as significantly increased caspase-3 labeled apoptosis (0.44±0.06% vs. 0.69±0.06%, respectively). Using western blot approach, significant inhibition of mutant Kras-activated signals including phosphorylated Serine/threonine kinases (cRAF), Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were identified in pancreatic carcinoma of -1 transgenic mice treated with sEH inhibitor. Eicosanoic  metabolic profiling of the serum specimens detected a significant increase of the ratios of epoxides to dihydroxy fatty  (DiHDPE) for docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and epoxides/dihydroxy octadecenoic  (DiHOME) for  (ARA) and linoleic  (LA), as well as a significant increase of epoxy metabolites of DHA, EPA, ARA and LA in -1 transgenic mice treated with a sEH inhibitor.ω-3 epoxy products from ω-3 PUFA  play a crucial role in inhibiting pancreatic cancer growth, and use of ω-3 PUFAs combined with sEH inhibition is a strategy with high potential for pancreatic cancer treatment and prevention.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Study suggests that down-regulation of Cyp4a14 has an anti-inflammatory response in intestine. The present study was to test the function of Cyp4a14 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.Female Cyp4a14-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with DSS for 6 days to induce colitis. The colon of mice was histologically observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic  Schiff (PAS) staining. The serum malondialdehyde (MDA), an endogenous indicator of oxidative stress, was chemically measured. Proinflammatory and NADPH oxidase genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).Cyp4a14-KO mice had a significantly higher number of goblet cells in the colon and were more resistant to DSS-induced colitis compared with the WT mice. The DSS-treated KO mice had lower levels of MDA. Consistent with the milder inflammatory pathological changes, DSS-treated KO mice had lower levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA in the liver and the colon. Moreover, the colon of DSS-treated Cyp4a14-KO and WT mice had higher mRNA levels of two members of NADPH oxidases, Nox2 and Nox4, suggesting that both Nox2 and Nox4 are inflammatory markers. By contrast, DSS-treated WT and KO mice had drastically decreased epithelium-localized Nox1 and dual oxidase (Duox) 2 mRNA levels, coinciding with the erosion of the mucosa induced by DSS.These results suggests a hypothesis that the increased goblet cell in the colon of Cyp4a14-KO mice provides protection from mucosal injury and Cyp4a14-increased oxidative stress exacerbates DSS-induced colitis. Therefore, Cyp4a14 may represent a potential target for treating colitis.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

In the present study, targeted metabolomics and contaminant data were analyzed together to assess potential influences of contaminant exposure on the hepatic metabolome of male polar bears (n = 29) from the southern and western Hudson Bay (SHB and WHB respectively), Canada. The 29 metabolites identified as important in the differentiation of the two subpopulations after partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) included phosphatidylcholines (PCs), acylcarnitines (ACs; involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids), and the fatty  (FA)  (ARA). Perfluorinated alkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and some highly chlorinated ortho-polychlorinated biphenyl congeners were greater in the SHB bears and were consistently inversely correlated with discriminating ACs and PCs between the subpopulations. The concentrations of discriminatory, legacy organochlorine pesticides along with one tetrachlorobiphenyl were greater in the WHB and were directly correlated with the VIP-identified ACs and PCs. ARA, glycerophospholipid and several amino  metabolic pathways were identified as different between subpopulations and/or were impacted. ARA is an important, conditionally essential, dietary n-6 FA and is also part of the inflammation response, and elevated concentrations in the SHB could be related to differences in chronic contaminant exposure and/or differences in diet and/or season, among a number of possible explanations. Dietary tracers (stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) were correlated with some discriminatory metabolites, supporting the hypothesis that dietary variation was also an important factor in the differentiation of the subpopulations.

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and  in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

The purpose of this study was to characterise mutations in the promoter of the porcine FADS2, evaluating in particular the effect of one haplotype tagging polymorphism (rs321384923A > G) on the biosynthesis pathway of C20:4. A total of 1,192 Duroc barrows with records on fatty  composition in muscle and subcutaneous  were genotyped. Pigs carrying the A allele showed, irrespective of  content, both enhanced FADS2 expression and higher C20:4 in muscle and exhibited increased ratios of C20:4 to C18:2 and of C20:4 to eicosadienoic  (C20:2) in both muscle and adipose tissue. Despite the inverse relationship observed between C20:4 and  content, the rs321384923 polymorphism had no impact on lean weight. It is concluded that the haplotype encompassing the rs321384923 polymorphism at the porcine FADS2 affects the n-6 fatty  profile by specifically modifying the desaturation efficiency of C18:2 to C20:4 rather than by concomitant variations in C18:2 following changes in  content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883776>Peripheral Artery Disease Is Associated with a Deficiency of Erythrocyte Membrane n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>Population-based data suggest that individuals who consume large dietary amounts of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have lower odds of peripheral artery disease (PAD); however, clinical studies examining n-3 PUFA levels in patients with PAD are sparse. The objective of this study is to compare erythrocyte membrane fatty  (FA) content between patients with PAD and controls. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 179 vascular surgery outpatients (controls, 34; PAD, 145). A blood sample was drawn and the erythrocyte FA content was assayed using capillary gas chromatography. We calculated the ratio of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) to the n-6 PUFA  (ARA) as well as the omega-3 index (O3I), a measure of erythrocyte content of the n-3 PUFA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), expressed as a percentage of total erythrocyte FA. Compared with controls, patients with PAD smoked more and were more likely to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia (p < 0.05). Patients with PAD had a lower mean O3I (5.0 ± 1.7% vs 6.0 ± 1.6%, p < 0.001) and EPA:ARA ratio (0.04 ± 0.02 vs 0.05 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), but greater mean total saturated fats (39.5 ± 2.5% vs 38.5 ± 2.6%, p = 0.01). After adjusting for several patient characteristics, comorbidities, and medications, an absolute decrease of 1% in the O3I was associated with 39% greater odds of PAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.86, and p = 0.03). PAD was associated with a deficiency of erythrocyte n-3 PUFA, a lower EPA:ARA ratio, and greater mean total saturated fats. These alterations in FA content may be involved in the pathogenesis or development of poor outcomes in PAD.© 2019 AOCS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200184> and Calcium signaling in epithelial ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Epithelial Ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy and represents the fifth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in women. The majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease that has spread beyond the ovaries to the peritoneum or to distant organs (stage FIGO III-IV) with a 5-year overall survival of about 29%. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Among the factors that contribute to cancer development, lipids and ion channels have been described to be associated to cancerous diseases particularly in breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Here, we reviewed the literature data to determine how lipids or  metabolites may influence EOC risk or progression. We also highlighted the role and the expression of the calcium (Ca) and calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels in EOC and how lipids might regulate them. Although lipids and some subclasses of nutritional lipids may be associated to EOC risk,  of LPA (lysophosphatidic ) and AA () emerges as an important signaling network in EOC. Clinical data showed that they are found at high concentrations in EOC patients and in vitro and in vivo studies referred to them as triggers of the Caentry in the cancer cells inducing their proliferation, migration or drug resistance. The cross-talk between  mediators and Ca and/or KCa channels needs to be elucidated in EOC in order to facilitate the understanding of its outcomes and potentially suggest novel therapeutic strategies including treatment and prevention.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) and monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) were analyzed by LC-MS.After macrophage activation by KLA, CL shifted to saturated species, but did not affect the quantity of CL. Inhibition of delta 6 desaturase also resulted in the same trend of CL species shift. We further examined the changes in CL and MLCL species induced by polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation during inflammation. After supplementation of AA, EPA and DHA, the MLCL/CL ratio increased significantly in all treatments. The percentages of the long-chain species highly elevated and those of short-chain species reduced in both CL and MLCL.Comparisons of AA, EPA and DHA supplementation revealed that the 20-carbon EPA (20:5) and AA (20:4) triggered higher incorporation and CL remodeling efficiency than 22-carbon DHA (22:6). EPA supplementation not only efficiently extended the chain length of CL but also increased the unsaturation of CL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30451244>The role of eicosanoids in renal diseases - potential therapeutic possibilities.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids are biologically active molecules that are created in the process of oxidation of  (AA) which is a constituent of the cell membrane phospholipids. Throughout the years it was evidenced by experiments that the  and -derived metabolites play an important role in physiological and pathological processes in the kidneys. They are being considered as biomarkers in detecting acute kidney injury, nephrotoxicity, glomerulonephritis and early stages of diabetic nephropathy because of their participation in inflammatory processes and in oxidative stress. They might be also considered as potential novel targets of therapy. However, the role of eicosanoids is still not fully clear and needs to be explored in future studies.

Although these metabolites exert numerous biological effects, attempts to study their complex biology have been hampered by difficulty in obtaining the epoxides as pure regioisomers and enantiomers. To remedy this, we synthesized 19,20- and 16,17-epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) (the two most abundant EDPs in vivo) by epoxidation of DHA with WT and the mutant (F87V) P450 enzyme BM3 from  WT epoxidation yielded a 4:1 mixture of 19,20:16,17-EDP exclusively as (,) enantiomers. Epoxidation with the mutant (F87V) yielded a 1.6:1 mixture of 19,20:16,17-EDP; the 19,20-EDP fraction was ∼9:1 (,):(,), but the 16,17-EDP was exclusively the (,) enantiomer. To access the (,) enantiomers of these EDPs, we used a short (four-step) chemical inversion sequence, which utilizes 2-(phenylthio)ethanol as the epoxide-opening nucleophile, followed by mesylation of the resulting alcohol, oxidation of the thioether moiety, and base-catalyzed elimination. This short synthesis cleanly converts the (,)-epoxide to the (,)-epoxide without loss of enantiopurity. This method, also applicable to eicosapentaenoic  and , provides a simple, cost-effective procedure for accessing larger amounts of these metabolites.Copyright © 2018 Cinelli et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30763676>Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the expression of -metabolizing Cyp450 genes in mouse hearts, kidneys and livers.</a></h2><p> (ARA) metabolites are involved in cardiovascular diseases and drug-induced cardiotoxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the gene expression of ARA-metabolizing cyp450 genes in the hearts, kidneys and livers of experimental mice. Thirty five Balb/c mice were divided into 5 groups, and each group contained 7 mice. Then, the groups were administered different NSAIDs, diclofenac mefenamic , ibuprofen, or meloxicam, for 14 days in doses equivalent to those used in human treatment. Subsequently, liver, kidney and heart samples were isolated for analysis of the expression of ARA-metabolizing cyp450 genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the histological alterations induced by mefenamic  were examined. It was found that 20-HETE synthesizing gene cyp4a12 was upregulated (> 2.2 fold) in the hearts of NSAID-treated mice, which was associated with the 2-fold downregulation of the cardio-protective biomarker GATA4 gene and the induction of cox2 expression (p value < 0.05). In the kidneys, the expression of cyp4a12 was significantly reduced (p value <0.05) while cyp2c29 expression was upregulated by more than 2 fold. In the liver, all NSAIDs except diclofenac significantly decreased the expression of all genes tested (p value <0.05) and were associated with abnormal accumulation of  in the liver. Furthermore, these molecular findings were in parallel to histological alterations induced in the liver, kidney, and heart after mefenamic  administration. This study concluded that NSAIDs altered the expression of ARA-metabolizing cyp450 genes and induced histological alterations that may influence the function of the vital organs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Over the last years, neuronal  species have been implicated in biological mechanisms underlying amyloid plaque pathology. While these processes comprise genetic features along with  signaling as well as direct chemical interaction of  species with Aβ mono- and oligomers, more efforts are needed to spatially delineate the exact -Aβ plaque interactions in the brain. Chemical imaging using mass spectrometry (MS) allows to probe the spatial distribution of lipids and peptides in complex biological tissues comprehensively and at high molecular specificity. As different imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) modalities provide comprehensive molecular and spatial information, we here describe a multimodal ToF-SIMS- and MALDI-based IMS strategy for probing  and Aβ peptide changes in a transgenic mouse model of AD (tgAPP). Both techniques identified a general AD-associated depletion of cortical sulfatides, while multimodal MALDI IMS revealed plaque specific  as well as Aβ peptide isoforms. In addition, MALDI IMS analysis revealed chemical features associated with morphological heterogeneity of individual Aβ deposits. Here, an altered GM1 to GM2/GM3 ganglioside  was observed in the diffuse periphery of plaques but not in the core region. This was accompanied by an enrichment of Aβ1-40arc peptide at the core of these deposits. Finally, a localization of  (AA) conjugated phosphatidylinositols (PI) and their corresponding degradation product, lyso-phosphatidylinositols (LPI) to the periphery of Aβ plaques was observed, indicating site specific macrophage activation and ganglioside processing.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Four trials were undertaken with gilthead seabream of different ages, fed on diets with fishmeal and fish oil as the main dietary protein and  sources and 21-25%  contents. Larvae of 4 days after hatching (dah) to 9 dah were fed rotifers with different fatty  profiles: control (2.8% eicosapentaenoic , EPA; 1.6% docosahexaenoic , DHA; 5.4% n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, n-3 LC-PUFAs; and 0.2% , ARA), low EPA (1.38% EPA, 1.6% DHA, 3.9% n-3 LC-PUFA and 0.4% ARA) or low LC-PUFA (0.7% EPA, 1.0% DHA, 1.8% n-3 LC-PUFA and 0.0% ARA) (% dry weight). Larvae fed the low-LC-PUFA diet showed a significantly lower growth at 10 dah. BAL activities were significantly higher in larvae fed the control diet than in those fed low-EPA and low-LC-PUFA diets at 9 dah. BAL activity increased with age across life cycle (49 μg to 300 g). PLA activity could not be detected in larvae but increased with age in juvenile and adult gilthead seabream (86 g to 295 g), similar to BAL. Results suggested a correspondence between the stimulation of  digestion capacity and growth performance in gilthead seabream by dietary essential fatty acids, particularly by EPA when DHA requirements are met in the diet especially in the very early stages of life cycle, when the progression of BAL and PLA activities could be used as indicators of the nutritional status of cultured gilthead seabream larvae. Finally, regarded that PLA activity was not detected in 4-dah to 44-dah gilthead seabream larvae, future works are suggested to assess the dietary effect on PLA activity and the PLA activity pattern along the larval stage of this species using a more sensitive detection method.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30127087>The PGI Analog Cicaprost Inhibits IL-33-Induced Th2 Responses, IL-2 Production, and CD25 Expression in Mouse CD4 T Cells.</a></h2><p>IL-33 has pleiotropic functions in immune responses and promotes the development of allergic diseases and asthma. IL-33 induces Th2 differentiation and enhances type 2 cytokine production by CD4 T cells. However, the regulation of IL-33-driven type 2 cytokine responses is not fully defined. In this study, we investigated the effect of PGI, a  mediator formed in the cyclooxygenase pathway of  , on naive CD4 T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation by IL-33. Using wild-type and PGI receptor (IP) knockout mice, we found that the PGI analog cicaprost dose-dependently inhibited IL-33-driven IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production by CD4 T cells in an IP-specific manner. In addition, cicaprost inhibited IL-33-driven IL-2 production and CD25 expression by CD4 T cells. Furthermore, IP knockout mice had increased IL-5 and IL-13 responses of CD4 T cells to  sensitization and challenge in mouse lungs. Because IL-33 is critical for induced type 2 responses, these data suggest that PGI not only inhibits IL-33-stimulated CD4 Th2 cell responses in vitro but also suppresses IL-33-induced Th2 responses caused by protease-containing allergens in vivo.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654597>Characterization of the Lipidomic Profile of Human Coronavirus-Infected Cells: Implications for  Remodeling upon Coronavirus Replication.</a></h2><p>Lipids play numerous indispensable cellular functions and are involved in multiple steps in the replication cycle of viruses. Infections by human-pathogenic coronaviruses result in diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations. Understanding how cellular lipids may modulate the pathogenicity of human-pathogenic coronaviruses remains poor. To this end, we utilized the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model coronavirus to comprehensively characterize the host cell  response upon coronavirus infection with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC⁻MS)-based lipidomics approach. Our results revealed that glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) were significantly elevated in the HCoV-229E-infected cells and the linoleic  (LA) to  (AA)  axis was markedly perturbed upon HCoV-229E infection. Interestingly, exogenous supplement of LA or AA in HCoV-229E-infected cells significantly suppressed HCoV-229E virus replication. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of LA and AA on virus replication was also conserved for the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

In this work, a n-6 PUFAs-producing strain of Aspergillus oryzae was generated by manipulating metabolic reactions in fatty  modification and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The codon-optimized genes coding for Δ-desaturase and Δ-elongase of Pythium sp., and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (mMaDGAT2) of Mortierella alpina were co-transformed in a single vector into A. oryzae BCC14614, yielding strain TD6E6-DGAT2. Comparative phenotypic analysis showed that a 70% increase of  titer was found in the engineered strain, which was a result of a significant increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) content (52.0 ± 1.8% of total lipids), and corresponded to the increased size of  particles observed in the fungal cells. Interestingly, the proportions of GLA and DGLA in neutral lipids of the engineered strain were similar, with the highest titers obtained in the high C:N culture (29:0; 6% glucose) during the -accumulating stage of growth. Time-course expression analysis of the engineered strain revealed transcriptional control of TAG biosynthesis through a co-operation between the native DGAT2 of A. oryzae and the transformed mMaDGAT2.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has proven clinical efficacy as a prescription for patients with dyslipidemia, glucocorticoid- and high--induced osteoporosis, but its effect on osteoporosis induced by aging is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-osteoporosis effect of FTZ in aging mice and revealed its biochemical action mechanism using metabolomics. Model of primary osteoporosis induced by aging was established. The mice in treatment group received a therapeutic dose of oral FTZ extract once daily during the experiment. The model and control groups received the corresponding volume of oral normal saline solution. Plasma samples of all three groups were collected after 12 weeks. Clinical biochemical parameters and biomechanics were determined in the osteoporosis model induced by normal aging to evaluate anti-osteoporosis effect of FTZ. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was used to analyze metabolic changes. The changes of histomorphometric and biomechanic parameters of femurs, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast activity indicated that FTZ administration reduced the risk of osteoporosis. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot revealed a clear separation trend between model and controls. Moreover, PLS-DA score plot indicated the anti-osteoporosis effect of FTZ with sphingosine 1-phosphate, LPA (16:0) and  (AA) among key biomarkers. The pivotal pathways revealed by pathway analysis including sphingolipid , glycerophospholipid , and AA . The mechanism by which FTZ reduces the risk of primary age-related osteoporosis in mice might be related to disorders of the above-mentioned pathways.

We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric -derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily palmitic . Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low  diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic  accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA)  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

(AA, C20:4 n-6) is elevated in obesity and postulated to stimulate bone resorption. This study aimed to determine the effect of AA on bone mass, quality, and adiposity in diet-induced obesity during growth. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=42, 4-week) were randomized into groups fed a control diet (CTRL, AIN-93G), high- diet (HFD, 35% kcal ) or HFD + AA (1% w/w diet) for 6 weeks. Body composition, bone mineral density and microarchitecture were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and micro-computed tomography. Red blood cell fatty  profile was measured with gas chromatography. Group differences were evaluated using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing. Total energy intake did not differ among diet groups. At week 6, HFD + AA had significantly greater body  % (12%), body weight (6%) and serum leptin concentrations (125%) than CTRL, whereas visceral  (mass and %, assessed with micro-computed tomography) was increased in both HFD and HFD + AA groups. HFD + AA showed reduced whole body bone mineral content and femur mid-diaphyseal cortical bone cross-sectional area than HFD and CTRL, without impairment in bone strength. Contrarily, HFD + AA had greater femur metaphyseal trabecular vBMD (35%) and bone volume fraction (5%) compared to controls. Inclusion of AA elevated leptin concentrations in male rats. The early manifestations of diet-induced obesity on bone mass were accelerated with AA. Studies of longer duration are needed to clarify the effect of AA on peak bone mass following growth cessation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Most mammalian genomes involve six or seven functional ALOX genes and among the corresponding ALOX-isoforms the ALOX15 orthologs are somewhat unique since they exhibit variable reaction specificity using  as substrate. The Evolutionary Hypothesis of mammalian ALOX15 reaction specificity (Prog.  Res. 72, 55, 2018) suggests that ALOX15 orthologs of primates ranked higher in evolution than gibbons are 15-lipoxygenating enzymes. In contrast, mammals ranking lower than gibbons express dominantly 12-lipoxygenating lipoxygenases and gibbon ALOX15 constitutes a transition enzyme with pronounced dual reaction specificity. Here we predicted the reaction specificity of 95 different prototherian, metatherian and eutherian ALOX15 orthologs on the basis of their primary structures and characterized experimentally the reaction specificity of ten novel metatherian/eutherian enzymes representing different stages of mammalian evolution (gorilla, opossum, cape golden mole, dog, horseshoe bat, hedgehog, Sunda flying lemur, pika, chinchilla, kangaroo rat). We found that 97% of the currently sequenced mammalian ALOX15 including the enzymes of living and extinct hominids follow the Evolutionary Hypothesis. However, the ALOX15 orthologs of rabbits and of the Ord's kangaroo rat violate this mechanistic concept. Taken together, this data confirms the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 reaction specificity and puts this concept on a more reliable experimental basis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the integrated proteomics and metabolomics were used to analyze the sex determination mechanism. A total of 2781 significantly different regulated proteins were identified by proteomics and 2693 significantly different expressed metabolites were identified by metabolomics. Among them, 2560 proteins and 1701 metabolites were significantly up-regulated in testes, whereas 221 proteins and 992 metabolites were significantly up-regulated in ovaries. Venn diagram analysis showed 513 proteins were differentially regulated at both protein and metabolite levels. Correlation analysis of differentially-regulated proteins and metabolites were identified by Gene Ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. The results showed  plays an important role in sex determination. The metabolites decanoyl-CoA, leukotriene, 3-dehydrosphinganine, and arachidonate were the biomarkers in testes, whereas estrone and taurocholate were the biomarkers in ovaries. Interaction networks of the significant differentially co-regulated proteins and metabolites in the process of  showed   and steroid hormone biosynthesis were the most important pathways in sex determination. The findings of this study provide valuable information for selective breeding of O. potamophila. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The male O. potamophila grows substantially larger and at a quicker rate than the female. Thus, males have greater economic value than females. However, limited research was done to analyze the sex determination mechanism of O. potamophila, which seriously hindered the development of whole-male O. potamophila breeding. In this study, four key proteins (Ctnnb1, Piwil1, Hsd17b1, and Dnali1), six most important biomarkers (decanoyl-CoA, leukotriene, 3-dehydrosphinganine, arachidonate, estrone, and taurocholate) and two key pathways (  and steroid hormone biosynthesis) in sex determination of O. potamophila were found by integrated application of iTRAQ and LC-MS techniques.

Supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids was done for 12 weeks using personalized dosing that was expected to reduce colonic PGE by 50%. In stepwise linear regression models, the ω-3 fatty  dose and baseline BMI explained 16.1% of the inter-individual variability in the fold change of colonic PGE post-supplementation. Increases in mRNA gene expression after supplementation were, however, modest and were not associated with changes in PGE. When baseline expression of PTGS1, PTGS2 and HPGD genes was included in the linear regression model containing dose and BMI, only PTGS2, the gene coding for the inducible form cyclooxygenase, was a significant predictor. Higher relative expression of PTGS2 predicted greater decreases in colonic PGE, accounting for an additional 13.6% of the inter-individual variance. In the final step of the regression model, greater decreases in total colonic fatty  concentrations predicted greater decreases in colonic PGE, contributing to an additional 18.7% of the variance. Overall, baseline BMI, baseline expression of PTGS2 and changes in colonic total fatty acids together accounted for 48% of the inter-individual variability in the change in colonic PGE. This is consistent with biochemical data showing that fatty acids which are not substrates for cyclooxygenases can activate cyclooxygenase-2 allosterically. Further clinical trials are needed to elucidate the factors that regulate the fatty  milieu of the human colon and how this interacts with key  metabolizing enzymes. Given the central role of PGE in colon carcinogenesis, these pathways may also impact on colon cancer prevention by other dietary and pharmacological approaches.Copyright © 2018.

We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients.

The MBOAT7 is a susceptibility risk genetic locus for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and mental retardation. Although it has been shown that MBOAT7 is associated to membranes, the MBOAT7 topology remains unknown. To solve the topological organization of MBOAT7, we performed: A) solubilization of the total membrane fraction of cells overexpressing the recombinant MBOAT7-V5, which revealed MBOAT7 is an integral protein strongly attached to endomembranes; B) in silico analysis by using 22 computational methods, which predicted the number and localization of transmembrane domains of MBOAT7 with a range between 5 and 12; C) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with GFP-tagged MBOAT7 full length and truncated forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, co-immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Protease Protection (FPP) assay; D) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with FLAG-tagged MBOAT7 full length forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, selective membrane permeabilization followed by indirect immunofluorescence. All together, these data revealed that MBOAT7 is a multispanning transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains. Based on our model, the predicted catalytic dyad of the protein, composed of the conserved asparagine in position 321 (Asn-321) and the preserved histidine in position 356 (His-356), has a lumenal localization.

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol  and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate  and glucose  as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving metabolic risk factors. This review will provide a brief update on the effects of endocannabinoid signalling in atherosclerosis and related metabolic complications.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902722>A pathway-focused RT-qPCR array study on immune relevant genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) harboring cecropin P1 transgene.</a></h2><p>Recently, our laboratory had produced five families of transgenic rainbow trout harboring cecropin P1 transgene, and via repeated challenge studies these fish exhibited a significant elevation of resistance to infection by microbial pathogens. By cDNA microarray and mRNA deep sequencing (mRNA-seq) analyses on two of the five families of cecropin P1 transgenic fish, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relevant to the innate and adaptive immune  in three different immune-related tissues, (i.e. spleen, kidney and liver) were profiled. These results supported our hypothesis that in addition to its direct microbicidal activity, the transgene product of cecropin P1 induces immunomodulatory activity in the transgenic host. Here, we have adapted the technique of quantitative reverse transcription real time PCR (RT-qPCR) array to analyze the expression of genes relevant to the innate and adaptive immune  in the rest three families. A RT-qPCR array was constructed with oligonucleotide primers of fifty-two innate/adaptive immune relevant DEGs shown to be the most perturbed by cecropin P1 transgene product in previous studies. Messenger RNA isolated from the spleen, kidney and liver of transgenic fish and non-transgenic fish control were studied on this array. Results of RT-qPCR array revealed that statistically significant perturbations of gene expression were detected in  of cytokine/chemokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, complement cascade, antigen processing/presentation, lysosomal phagocytosis and leukocyte trans-endothelial migration in the transgenic spleen; extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and leukocyte trans-endothelial migration  in the transgenic kidney; lysosomal activity pathway in the transgenic liver.

Of these, the omega-6 fatty   (AA) and the omega-3 fatty  decosahexaenoic  (DHA) are highly abundant; hence, we investigated their effects on the multidrug-resistant human pathogen  Our analyses reveal that AA and DHA incorporate into the  bacterial membrane and impact bacterial fitness and membrane integrity, with DHA having a more pronounced effect. Through transcriptional profiling and mutant analyses, we show that the  β-oxidation pathway plays a protective role against AA and DHA, by limiting their incorporation into the phospholipids of the bacterial membrane. Furthermore, our study identified a second bacterial membrane protection system mediated by the AdeIJK efflux system, which modulates the  content of the membrane via direct efflux of lipids other than AA and DHA, thereby providing a novel function for this major efflux system in  This is the first study to examine the antimicrobial effects of host fatty acids on  and highlights the potential of AA and DHA to protect against  infections. A shift in the Western diet since the industrial revolution has resulted in a dramatic increase in the consumption of omega-6 fatty acids, with a concurrent decrease in the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids. This decrease in omega-3 fatty  consumption has been associated with significant disease burden, including increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. Here we provide evidence that DHA, an omega-3 fatty , has superior antimicrobial effects upon the highly drug-resistant pathogen , thereby providing insights into one of the potential health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. The identification and characterization of two novel bacterial membrane protective mechanisms against host fatty acids provide important insights into  adaptation during disease.

Studies suggested the potential roles of LPS in hepatic steatosis and in obese mice models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-regulated obesity remained largely unknown. Here we reported that LPS stimulated expression of cyosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), one of inflammation regulators of obesity, in the preadipocytes. Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes. In addition, LPS-increased DNA synthesis, cell numbers and cell viability of preadipocytes were attenuated by AACOCF3, AG490, BML-275, cPLA2 siRNA, JAK2 siRNA or AMPK siRNA. Attenuation JAK2/STAT or AMPK-dependent cPLA2 expression reduced LPS-mediated adipogenesis of preadipocytes. Stimulation of  or AMPK activator, A-769662, increased cell numbers and cell viability and promoted differentiation of preadipocytes.

It has been shown that these lipids exhibit also regulatory functions in different cell types. FAs can serve as secondary messengers, as well as modulators of enzymatic activities and substrates for cytokines synthesis. More recently, it has been documented a direct activity of free FAs as ligands of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear receptors, and cumulative evidence has emerged, demonstrating its participation in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. It has been long known that the central nervous system is enriched with poly-unsaturated FAs, such as  (C20:4ω-6) or docosohexaenoic (C22:6ω-3) acids. These lipids participate in the regulation of membrane fluidity, axonal growth, development, memory, and inflammatory response. Furthermore, a whole family of low molecular weight compounds derived from FAs has also gained special attention as the natural ligands for cannabinoid receptors or key cytokines involved in inflammation, largely expanding the role of FAs as precursors of signaling molecules. Nutritional deficiencies, and alterations in  and  signaling have been associated with developmental and cognitive problems, as well as with neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanism behind these effects still remains elusive. But in the last two decades, different families of proteins have been characterized as receptors mediating FAs signaling. This review focuses on different receptors sensing and transducing free FAs signals in neural cells: (1) membrane receptors of the family of G Protein Coupled Receptors known as Free Fatty  Receptors (FFARs); (2) cytosolic transport Fatty -Binding Proteins (FABPs); and (3) transcription factors Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs). We discuss how these proteins modulate and mediate direct regulatory functions of free FAs in neural cells. Finally, we briefly discuss the advantages of evaluating them as potential targets for drug design in order to manipulate  signaling.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the  of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and  mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed serum metabolic profiles of offspring rats before and after birth in IUGR model induced by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE). We discovered that differential metabolites in PCE fetuses mainly manifested as amino acids and . In adulthood, PCE offspring showed less and inconsistent types of differential metabolites compared to those in utero, which still exhibited gender differences. The main differential metabolites induced by PCE, including phospholipids, platelet-activating factor, , bile , sphingosine-1-phosphoric , indoxyl sulfuric , and cortexolone, may participate in the pathological and physiological processes of organ toxicities. This study demonstrated the short- and long-term developmental toxicity and gender differences of caffeine, providing new ideas for exploring the early warning and drug intervention targets of IUGR offspring.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we used a C to C diet shift experiment and compound-specific δC analysis to estimate the turnover rates of FAs in the polar and neutral fractions of flight muscle lipids (corresponding to membranes and  droplets) of exercised and sedentary zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Turnover was fastest for linoleic  (LA; 18:2n6) and palmitic  (PA; 16:0), with 95% replacement times of 10.8-17.7 d in the polar fraction and 17.2-32.8 d in the neutral fraction, but was unexpectedly slow for the long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (LC-PUFAs)  (20:4n6) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n3) in the polar fraction, with 95% replacement in 64.9-136.5 d. Polar fraction LA and PA turnover was significantly faster in exercised birds (95% replacement in 8.5-13.3 d). Our results suggest that FA turnover in intramuscular  droplets is related to FA tissue concentrations and that turnover does not change in response to exercise. In contrast, we found that muscle membrane FA turnover is likely driven by a combination of selective LC-PUFA retention and consumption of shorter-chain FAs in energy . The unexpectedly fast turnover of membrane-associated FAs in muscle suggests that songbirds during migration could substantially remodel their membranes within a single migration stopover, and this may have substantial implications for how the FA composition of diet affects energy  of birds during migration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160168>Endocannabinoid and Prostanoid Crosstalk in Pain.</a></h2><p>Interfering with endocannabinoid (eCB)  to increase their levels is a proven anti-nociception strategy. However, because the eCB and prostanoid systems are intertwined, interfering with eCB  will affect the prostanoid system and inversely. Key to this connection is the production of the cyclooxygenase (COX) substrate  upon eCB hydrolysis as well as the ability of COX to metabolize the eCBs anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) into prostaglandin-ethanolamides (PG-EA) and prostaglandin-glycerol esters (PG-G), respectively.

In this scenario, the extraction of seaweeds represents an interesting source of compounds displaying antimicrobial activity. In particular, among the different red algae,  plays an important role due to the presence of important bioactives in its composition. In spite of these features, an efficient culture system is still absent. In the present study, a novel algal culture method was developed and compared to another more common cultural practice, widely reported in literature. A higher efficiency of the new method, both for daily growth rate and biomass, was assessed. Furthermore, the growth inhibitory activity of five extracts, obtained using ethanol, methanol, acetone, chloroform or diethyl ether as a solvent, from the cultured  was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Algal extracts exhibited a considerable inhibitory activity against  strains, while a slight inhibition was observed against . The different extracts showed significant differences in bacterial growth inhibition, with the highest activity that was recorded for the ethanol extract, followed by that of methanol. Based on the chemical characterization, these findings could be related to the antimicrobial activity played by the combination of total carbohydrates and polyphenols, which were determined at high levels in ethanol and methanol extracts, as well as by the highest number and levels of single polyphenols. Conversely, the lower growth inhibitory activities found in chloroform and diethyl ether extracts could be related to the isolation of minor  classes (e.g., neutral and medium polar lipids) composed by fatty acids, such as stearic, oleic and  acids, typically characterized by antimicrobial activity. In consideration of the results obtained, the present study has a double implication, involving both the field of cultural practices and the exploitation of natural sources for the isolation of antimicrobial agents useful both in pharmaceutical and food applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505038>Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition protects from liver injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) is the last enzymatic step in triglyceride degradation, hydrolyzing monoglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids (FA) and converting 2-arachidonoylglycerol into  (AA), thus providing ligands for nuclear receptors (NRs) as key regulators of hepatic bile  (BA)/ and inflammation. We aimed to explore the role of MGL in the development of cholestatic liver and bile duct injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis (SC), a disease so far lacking effective pharmacological therapy. To this aim we analyzed the effects of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding to induce SC in wild type (WT) and knockout (MGL ) mice and tested pharmacological inhibition with JZL184 in the Mdr2 mouse model of SC. Cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry, liver histology, gene expression and western blot characterization of BA and FA synthesis/transport. Moreover, intestinal FAs and fecal microbiome were analyzed. Transfection and silencing were performed in Caco2 cells. MGL mice were protected from DDC-induced biliary fibrosis and inflammation with reduced serum liver enzymes, increased FA/BA  and β-oxidation. Notably, pharmacological (JZL184) inhibition of MGL ameliorated cholestatic injury in DDC-fed WT mice and protected Mdr2 from spontaneous liver injury, with improved liver enzymes, inflammation and biliary fibrosis. In vitro experiments confirmed that silencing of MGL decreases prostaglandin E2 accumulation in the intestine upregulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) -α and -γ activity, thus reducing inflammation. Conclusions: Collectively, our study unravels MGL as a novel metabolic target, demonstrating that MGL inhibition may be considered as potential therapy for SC.© 2019 The Authors.

Prior evidence suggests that DHA is mobilized from maternal liver and adipose to meet fetal accretion and physiological requirements. However, changes in the DHA levels of various maternal tissues throughout pregnancy and into lactation of mothers on diets with and without dietary DHA, and with a background dietary fatty  profile that resembles human intake has not been examined. Sprague Dawley rats were fed a total western diet with (TWD + ) or without DHA (TWD-) along with a commercial rodent chow control (Chow) throughout pregnancy and postpartum. The fatty  compositions of adipose, brain, heart, liver, erythrocytes, and plasma were determined before pregnancy, at 15 and 20 days of pregnancy, and 7 days postpartum. The placenta, fetuses, and pups were also examined when available. Maternal DHA concentrations were increased in plasma at 20 days pregnancy in all the diets with TWD + > Chow > TWD-. Maternal DHA concentrations in the TWD- group were lower in adipose throughout pregnancy as compared with the other diets. At postpartum, DHA concentrations decreased below baseline levels in the heart of the TWD- and Chow dams and the liver of the TWD- dams. Whole body DHA concentrations of the fetuses did not differ but there was evidence of decreased DHA in the whole body and tissues of the TWD- and Chow 7d old pups. In conclusion, it appears that in this rodent model of pregnancy, maternal adaptations were made to meet fetal DHA requirements, but they may compromise maternal DHA status and the ability to deliver DHA during lactation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding genetic mechanisms for differential susceptibility to candidemia may aid in designing host-directed therapies.We performed the first genome-wide association study on candidemia, and we integrated these data with variants that affect cytokines in different cellular systems stimulated with Candida albicans.We observed strong association between candidemia and a variant, rs8028958, that significantly affects the expression levels of PLA2G4B in blood. We found that up to 35% of the susceptibility loci affect in vitro cytokine production in response to Candida. Furthermore, potential causal genes located within these loci are enriched for  and  . Using an independent cohort, we also showed that the numbers of risk alleles at these loci are negatively correlated with reactive oxygen species and interleukin-6 levels in response to Candida. Finally, there was a significant correlation between susceptibility and allelic scores based on 16 independent candidemia-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms that affect monocyte-derived cytokines, but not with T cell-derived cytokines.Our results prioritize the disturbed  homeostasis and oxidative stress as potential mechanisms that affect monocyte-derived cytokines to influence susceptibility to candidemia.© The Author(s) 2019.

The canonical pathway for the synthesis of oxidized phospholipids is through the release of  by cytosolic phospholipase Aα (cPLAα) followed by its enzymatic oxidation, activation of the carboxylate anion by acyl-CoA synthetase(s), and re-esterification to the -2 position by -2 acyltransferase activity ( the Lands cycle). However, recent studies have demonstrated the unanticipated significance of -1 hydrolysis of arachidonoyl-containing choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids by other phospholipases to generate the corresponding 2-arachidonoyl-lysolipids. Herein, we identified a pathway for oxidized phospholipid synthesis comprising sequential -1 hydrolysis by a phospholipase A ( by patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 8 (PNPLA8)), direct enzymatic oxidation of the resultant 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids, and the esterification of oxidized 2-arachidonoyl-lysophospholipids by acyl-CoA-dependent -1 acyltransferase(s). To circumvent ambiguities associated with acyl migration or hydrolysis, we developed a synthesis for optically active (d- and l-enantiomers) nonhydrolyzable analogs of 2-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-AA-LPC). -1 acyltransferase activity in murine liver microsomes stereospecifically and preferentially utilized the naturally occurring l-enantiomer of the ether analog of lysophosphatidylcholine. Next, we demonstrated the high selectivity of the -1 acyltransferase activity for saturated acyl-CoA species. Importantly, we established that 2-15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE) ether-LPC -1 esterification is markedly activated by thrombin treatment of murine platelets to generate oxidized PC. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the enantiomeric specificity and saturated acyl-CoA selectivity of microsomal -1 acyltransferase(s) and reveal its participation in a previously uncharacterized pathway for the synthesis of oxidized phospholipids with cell-signaling properties.© 2019 Liu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717356>Curbing Lipids: Impacts ON Cancer and Viral Infection.</a></h2><p>Lipids play a fundamental role in maintaining normal function in healthy cells.

P450 enzymes metabolize  (AA) to a wide array of biologically active  mediators. P450-mediated AA metabolites have a significant role in normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions, hence they could be promising therapeutic targets in different disease states. P450 monooxygenases mediate the (ω-n)-hydroxylation reactions, which involve the introduction of a hydroxyl group to the carbon skeleton of AA, forming subterminal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). In the current review, we specified different P450 isozymes implicated in the formation of subterminal HETEs in varied tissues. In addition, we focused on the role of subterminal HETEs namely 19-HETE, 16-HETE, 17-HETE and 18-HETE in different organs, importantly the kidneys, heart, liver and brain. Furthermore, we highlighted their role in hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, diabetic retinopathy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, ischemic stroke as well as inflammatory diseases. Since each member of subterminal HETEs exist as R and S enantiomer, we addressed the issue of stereoselectivity related to the formation and differential effects of these enantiomers. In conclusion, elucidation of different roles of subterminal HETEs in normal and disease states leads to identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of new therapeutic modalities in different disease states.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that diesel engine exhaust (DE) could lead to structural changes in the placenta of in utero exposed rabbits (first generation, F1). The effects of maternal exposure to DE were further studied on second-generation (F2) rabbits. Pregnant F0 females were exposed to filtered, diluted DE (1 mg/m, median particle diameter: 69 nm) or clean filtered air (controls) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week by nose-only exposure during days 3-27 post-conception (dpc). Adult female offspring (F1) were mated to control males: F1 tissues and F2 foeto-placental units were collected at 28 dpc and placental structure and gene expression (microarray) analysed. Fatty  profiles were determined in foetal and maternal plasma, maternal liver and placenta. In F1, compared to controls, hepatic neutral  contents were increased in exposed animals without change in the blood biochemistry. In F2, the placental  contents were higher, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids and reduced pro-inflammatory  (AA), without placental structural changes. Conversely, the proportion of anti-inflammatory n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in F2 plasma was increased while that of AA was decreased. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of F2 placenta transcriptomic data identified that the proteasome complex and ubiquitin pathways genes were over-represented and ion channel function and inflammation pathways genes were under-represented in exposed animals. These preliminary results demonstrate that diesel engine exhaust exposure and in utero indirect exposure should be considered as a programming factor within the context of the DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease) with a probable intergenerational transmission.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30227249>Angiotensin II upregulates CYP4A isoform expression in the rat kidney through angiotensin II type 1 receptor.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin II (AngII) stimulates the renal production and release of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (20-HETE), which is a major metabolite of  catalyzed by CYP4A isoforms. However, the effects of AngII on CYP4A isoform expression in the kidney and its mechanism remains unclear. To clarify the regulation of CYP4A isoform expression by AngII, we examined the chronic effects of AngII and AngII type 1 receptor (AT1-R) blockade on CYP4A isoform expression. Sprague-Dawley rats were infused with vehicle or AngII for 1 week, and the AngII-infused rats were also treated with or without the AT1-R blocker, candesartan. AngII increased CYP4A isoform protein expression in the renal cortex (CO) and outer medulla (OM) in a dose-dependent manner, and candesartan inhibited the AngII-increased CYP4A expression in a dose-dependent manner. AngII increased the CYP4A isoform mRNA expression in the CO and OM, and candesartan inhibited AngII-increased CYP4A isoform mRNA expression. These results indicated that AngII chronically increased the CYP4A isoform expression in the rat kidney. The AngII-induced CYP4A isoform expression was mediated by AT1-R.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

These enzymes are also expressed in lower multicellular organisms but here they are not widely distributed. In bacteria, lipoxygenases rarely occur and evaluation of the currently available bacterial genomes suggested that <0.5% of all sequenced bacterial species carry putative lipoxygenase genes. We recently rescreened the public bacterial genome databases for lipoxygenase-like sequences and identified two novel lipoxygenase isoforms (MF-LOX1 and MF-LOX2) in the halotolerant Myxococcus fulvus. Both enzymes share a low degree of amino  conservation with well-characterized eukaryotic lipoxygenase isoforms but they involve the catalytically essential iron cluster. Here, we cloned the MF-LOX1 cDNA, expressed the corresponding enzyme as N-terminal hexa-his-tag fusion protein, purified the recombinant enzyme to electrophoretic homogeneity, and characterized it with respect to its protein-chemical and enzymatic properties. We found that M. fulvus expresses a catalytically active intracellular lipoxygenase that converts  and other polyunsaturated fatty acids enantioselectively to the corresponding n-9 hydroperoxy derivatives. The enzyme prefers C - and C -polyenoic fatty acids but does not exhibit significant membrane oxygenase activity.

Metabolites were characterized by LC-MS/MS and their anti-inflammatory properties assessed using AA-induced autocrine neutrophil stimulation and leukotriene B-mediated chemotaxis. 8‑hydroxy‑9,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic  (Δ-8-HETE) and 8,15-dihydroxy-9,11,13,17-eicosatetraenoic  (Δ-8,15-diHETE) were identified as novel metabolites. Δ-8,15-diHETE production was inhibited by the leukotriene A hydrolase inhibitor SC 57461A. Autocrine neutrophil leukotriene stimulation and neutrophil chemotaxis, both BLT1-dependent processes, were inhibited by Δ-8,15-diHETE at low nM concentrations. These data support an anti-inflammatory role for Δ-8,15-diHETE, a novel 5-LO product.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in the structure and function of cell membrane components have been linked to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by chronic ethanol consumption or cancer transformation has been implicated in changing the levels of phospholipids and fatty acids in the cell membrane. In this study, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to quantitate the effects of alcohol and malignant transformation on membrane components, namely phospholipids and free fatty acids. Ethanol increased the phospholipid levels. Moreover, the process of malignant transformation was accompanied by increased levels of phospholipids and  as well as decreased levels of linoleic  and α-linolenic . Thus, these oxidative stress-inducing conditions that cause variations in the cellular composition affect the actions of the cell membrane and cell function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063407>The eicosapentaenoic : ratio and its clinical utility in cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) is a key anti-inflammatory/anti-aggregatory long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty . Conversely, the omega-6 fatty ,  (AA) is a precursor to a number of pro-inflammatory/pro-aggregatory mediators. EPA acts competitively with AA for the key cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes to form less inflammatory products. As a result, the EPA:AA ratio may be a marker of chronic inflammation, with a lower ratio corresponding to higher levels of inflammation. It is now well established that inflammation plays an important role in cardiovascular disease. This review examines the role of the EPA:AA ratio as a marker of cardiovascular disease and the relationship between changes in the ratio (mediated by EPA intake) and changes in cardiovascular risk. Epidemiological studies have shown that a lower EPA:AA ratio is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, and vascular disease. Increasing the EPA:AA ratio through treatment with purified EPA has been shown in clinical studies to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and reduces the risk of cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention. The EPA:AA ratio is a valuable predictor of cardiovascular risk. Results from ongoing clinical trials will help to define thresholds for EPA treatment associated with better clinical outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399511>Acyl-CoA synthetase 6 enriches seminiferous tubules with the ω-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  and is required for male fertility in the mouse.</a></h2><p>Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is an ω-3 dietary-derived polyunsaturated fatty  of marine origin enriched in testes and necessary for normal fertility, yet the mechanisms regulating the enrichment of DHA in the testes remain unclear. Long-chain ACSL6 (acyl-CoA synthetase isoform 6) activates fatty acids for cellular anabolic and catabolic  by ligating a CoA to a fatty , is highly expressed in testes, and has high preference for DHA. Here, we investigated the role of ACSL6 for DHA enrichment in the testes and its requirement for male fertility.   males were severely subfertile with smaller testes, reduced cauda epididymal sperm counts, germ cell loss, and disorganization of the seminiferous epithelium. Total fatty  profiling of   testes revealed reduced DHA and increased ω-6 , a fatty  profile also reflected in phospholipid composition. Strikingly,  imaging demonstrated spatial redistribution of phospholipids in   testes. -containing phospholipids were predominantly interstitial in control testes but diffusely localized across   testes. In control testes, DHA-containing phospholipids were predominantly within seminiferous tubules, which contain Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells but relocalized to the interstitium in   testes. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ACSL6 is an initial driving force for germ cell DHA enrichment and is required for normal spermatogenesis and male fertility.© 2019 Hale et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816095>[Inflammatory metabolites of arahidonic  in tear fluid in UV-induced corneal damage].</a></h2><p>The ultraviolet (UV) B-induced damage of the eye surface of experimental animals (rabbits) includes loss of corneal epithelium, apoptosis of keratocytes and stromal edema. These changes are accompanied by clinically and histologically manifested corneal inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and exudation of the anterior chamber of the eye. According to mass spectrometric analysis, UV-induced corneal damage is associated with pronounced changes in the  composition of tears, including a decrease in the amount of  and prostaglandin E2 and an increase in the concentrations of prostaglandin D2 and its derivative 15d-PGJ2. In addition, it is accompanied by an alteration in the levels of hydroxyeicosate tetraenic  derivatives, namely upregulation of 12-HETE and downregulation of 5-HETE. The revealed changes indicate the activation of metabolic pathways involving 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase 1 and 2, and prostaglandin-D-synthase. These findings contribute to understanding mechanisms of UV-induced keratitis and point on feasibility of selective anti-inflammatory therapy for improving corneal regeneration after iatrogenic UV damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241938>Reelin deficiency leads to aberrant  composition in mouse brain.</a></h2><p>Reelin is a secreted protein essential for the development and function of the mammalian brain. The receptors for Reelin, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very low-density lipoprotein receptor, belong to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, but it is not known whether Reelin is involved in the brain . In the present study, we performed lipidomic analysis of the cerebral cortex of wild-type and Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice, and found that reeler mice exhibited several compositional changes in phospholipids. First, the ratio of phospholipids containing one saturated fatty  (FA) and one docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or  (ARA) decreased. Secondly, the ratio of phospholipids containing one monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and one DHA or ARA increased. Thirdly, the ratio of phospholipids containing 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic , or Mead  (MA), increased. Finally, the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) increased. As the increase of MA is seen as an index of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) deficiency, and the expression of SCD-1 is suppressed by PUFA, these results strongly suggest that the loss of Reelin leads to PUFA deficiency. Hence, MUFA and MA are synthesized in response to this deficiency, in part by inducing SCD-1 expression. This is the first report of changes of FA composition in the reeler mouse brain and provides a basis for further investigating the new role of Reelin in the development and function of the brain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Sixty male and female rats were randomly assigned to control, exhaustive exercise and one-week recovery groups, respectively. The metabolic profiles of plasma were investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data further underwent orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS) analysis. The current study found that gender was a significant determinant of the effects of exhaustive exercise on the cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, whereas, no significant interaction effects between gender and exhaustive exercise were found on the levels of testosterone, malonaldehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione and lactic dehydrogenase. In male rats, the altered metabolites within exhaustive exercise included increased tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates (citric , fumaric , butanedioic ), branch-chain amino acids (valine, leucine), fatty acids and metabolite (oleic , linoleic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), phosphate and decreased glucose, lactic , serine, and glutamic . In female rats, the levels of fatty acids and metabolite (linoleic , oleic , , 3-hydroxybutyric ), amino acids (valine, leucine, glutamic , 5-oxo-proline, methionine, ornithine), other metabolites urea, myo-inositol and phosphate were increased. The results indicated that exhaustive exercise increased the rates of energy , glucose , amino  catabolism and fatty   in male rats, whereas, female rats showed an increased propensity to oxidize  and conserve carbohydrate and protein  against physical stress. Disordered urea cycle and inositol  also occurred in female rats with exhaustive exercise. Exhaustive exercise affected the balance of hormone adjustment and caused oxidative stress, subsequent cell membrane damage both in male and female rats. A significant gender-related difference in the metabolic profiles was also found between male and female rats within exhaustive exercise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31111118>Endocannabinoid Metabolome Characterization of Milk from Guatemalan Women Living in the Western Highlands.</a></h2><p>Recognized as the gold-standard ideal fare, human milk has a unique composition that meets infants' needs throughout development. Endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like compounds [endocannabinoid metabolome (ECM)] are endogenous  mediators derived from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Based on animal models, it has been proposed that endocannabinoid arachidonoyl glycerol (AG) plays a role in establishing the suckling response during lactation. In addition, endocannabinoid ethanolamides have been shown to stimulate food intake. The mechanisms of action and the role of the ECM in human milk are not fully understood.The present study aimed to characterize and quantify the ECM in human milk samples from an underserved population in Guatemala.Human milk samples were collected from lactating women ( = 26) for ECM characterization and quantification. Samples were taken at 3 different time points between 4 and 6 mo of lactation during maternal fasting. Human milk samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Identified members of the ECM were: arachidonoyl ethanolamide, palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA), oleoyl ethanolamide, docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide, eicoapentaenoyl ethanolamide, eicosenoyl ethanolamide, AG, palmitoyl glycerol, oleoyl glycerol, docosahexaenoyl glycerol, eicosapentaenoyl glycerol, eicosenoyl glycerol,  (ARA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA).Overall, concentrations in the ethanolamide group were lower than the glycerols. A time effect was observed for ARA, DHA, EPA, and PEA across the 3 time points ( ≤ 0.05).Our study identified the ECM in mature human milk and provides the first report for a population with health disparities within a developing country. The few studies available have been conducted in developed countries. Hypotheses for future studies can be developed based on this study's data to help elucidate specific roles for members of the ECM and how this biological system modulates infant health and development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782617>Effects of dietary  on gut microbiota and faecal metabolites, and their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors: a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether diets differing in  content alter the gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low- diet to a diet high in  and reduced in carbohydrate.In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18-35 years; body mass index <28 kg/m; 52% women) who completed the whole trial were included. All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower- diet ( 20% energy), a moderate- diet ( 30% energy) and a higher- diet ( 40% energy). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut microbiota, faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated.The lower- diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of  (p=0.007) and  (p=0.04), whereas the higher- diet was associated with increased  (p=0.04),  (p<0.001) and decreased  (p=0.04). The concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was significantly decreased in the higher- diet group in comparison with the other groups (p<0.001). The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower- diet group. In addition, the higher- diet was associated with faecal enrichment in  and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention.Higher- consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut microbiota, faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinﬂammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.; Results.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Prior to  extraction, the adult ticks were either unfed or fed on cattle, and the fed ticks were in groups either containing males and females together, or containing only males or females. Cholesteryl esters were found on the surfaces of fed females, and they may provide a more complete description of the composition of the mounting sex pheromone. Dihydrocholesteryl esters were detected on the surfaces of unfed males and females, suggesting a possible role in survival during host-seeking. Dehydrodeoxyecdysone, found on fed females, could be a component of the genital sex pheromone. The most abundant polar surface lipids detected were acylglycerides. High levels of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids on males fed separately might be derived, in part, from sperm development. A high level of a 20:4 fatty , presumably , was found on the surface of fed females, indicating that it may be a component of the genital sex pheromone. A high level of docosenamide was found on the surface of fed females. Wax esters were found on the surfaces of fed ticks but not on unfed ticks. These esters could be involved in elasticity of the cuticle of engorged females or in wax coating of eggs. N-acylethanolamines were found on the surfaces of male and female ticks fed together, and on male ticks fed separately, but were absent or at low levels on females fed separately and on unfed ticks. This pattern suggests a possible role as a metabolic coordination primer pheromone.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

However, its activity on helminth parasites has not been previously reported. Here, we show that sclareol is active against larval (IC ≈ 13 μM), juvenile (IC = 5.0 μM), and adult (IC = 19.3 μM) stages of , a parasitic trematode responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. Microwave-assisted synthesis of Heck-coupled derivatives improved activity, with the substituents choice guided by the Matsy decision tree. The most active derivative  showed improved potency and selectivity on larval (IC ≈ 2.2 μM, selectivity index (SI) ≈ 22 in comparison to HepG2 cells), juvenile (IC = 1.7 μM, SI = 28.8), and adult schistosomes (IC = 9.4 μM, SI = 5.2). Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that compound  induced blebbing of the adult worm surface at sublethal concentration (12.5 μM); moreover, the compound inhibited egg production at the lowest concentration tested (3.13 μM). The observed phenotype and data obtained by untargeted metabolomics suggested that compound  affects membrane  homeostasis by interfering with  . The same methodology applied to praziquantel (PZQ)-treated worms revealed sugar  alterations that could be ascribed to the previously reported action of PZQ on serotonin signaling and/or effects on glycolysis.

The selected fatty acids were analysed in  extracts from both free and total forms. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed phase C18 column with isocratic flow using ammonium acetate for improving negative electrospray ionization (ESI) response. Mass detection was performed in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and deuterated internal standards were used for each target compound. The limits of quantification were situated in the low nanomolar range, excepting linoleic , for which the limit was in the high nanomolar range.

EETs are rapidly metabolised in vivo by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Increasing the half life of EETs by inhibiting the sEH enzyme is a novel strategy for neuroprotection. In the present study, sEH inhibitors APAU was screened in silico and further evaluated for their antiparkinson activity against rotenone (ROT) induced neurodegeneration in N27 dopaminergic cell line and Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson disease (PD). In the in vitro study cell viability (MTT and LDH release assay), oxidative stress parameters (total intracellular ROS, hydroperoxides, protein oxidation,  peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidise, glutathione reductase, glutathione, total antioxidant status, mitochondrial complex-1activity and mitochondrial membrane potential), inflammatory markers (IL-6, COX-1 and COX-2), and apoptotic markers (JNK, phospho-JNK, c-jun, phospho-c-jun, pro and active caspase-3) were assessed to study the neuroprotective effects. In vivo activity of APAU was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring survival rate, negative geotaxis, oxidative stress parameters (total intracellular ROS, hydroperoxides, glutathione levels) were measured. Dopamine and its metabolites were estimated by LC-MS/MS analysis. In the in silico study the molecule, APAU showed good binding interaction at the active site of sEH (PDB: 1VJ5). In the in vitro study, APAU significantly attenuated ROT induced changes in oxidative, pro-inflammatory and apoptotic parameters. In the in vivo study, APAU significantly attenuates ROT induced changes in survival rate, negative geotaxis, oxidative stress, dopamine and its metabolites levels (p < 0.05). Our study, therefore, concludes that the molecule APAU, has significant neuroprotection benefits against rotenone induced Parkinsonism.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibitors of fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), the key enzyme responsible for degradation of the endocannabinoid anandamide, are postulated to possess anti-hypertensive potential. Here, we compared the effects of hypertension and chronic FAAH inhibition by URB597 on the endocannabinoid system and redox balance in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and hypertensive deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rats. Enhanced oxidative stress and  peroxidation were found in both hypertension models. Hypertension affected cardiac and plasma endocannabinoid systems in a model-dependent manner: anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels decreased in SHR and increased in DOCA-salt. Cardiac CB receptor expression increased in both models while higher CB receptor expression was only in DOCA-salt. URB597 increased endocannabinoid levels in both models but produced the partial reduction of oxidative stress in DOCA-salt but not in SHR.

However, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in flaxseed decreases nutrient digestibility and limits the availability of n-3 FA. Addition of carbohydrase enzymes to flaxseed-based diets can decrease the anti-nutritive effects of NSP. We hypothesized that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation affect lipid content and alter expression of genes related to lipid  in broiler liver. Five day-old broiler chicks were fed a corn-soybean basal diet with 0% flaxseed, a basal diet with 10% of flaxseed, or 10% flaxseed + 0.05% enzyme diet up to day 42 of growth. Total lipids, including long-chain (≥20C) n-3 FA and monounsaturated FA, were increased in flax-fed broiler livers. Enzyme addition reduced  and total long chain n-6 FA. These changes were similarly reflected in phosphatidylcholine lipid species. Dietary flax and enzyme treatments up-regulated PPARα target genes  and  while reducing expression of  FA synthesis-related genes. This study concludes that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation in broiler diets enhances LC n-3 FA species, while reducing n-6 FA species in hepatic phospholipids (PL).

Platycodins Folium (PF) is the dried leaf of Platycodon grandiflorum, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities. Our previous research suggested that PF was rich in flavonoids, phenols, organic acids, triterpenoid saponins, coumarins and terpenoids. This study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effect of PF using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive mice. Several behavior tests (sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST)) and biochemical parameters (IL-6, TNF-α and SOD levels) were used to evaluate the antidepressive effect of PF on LPS-induced depression model. Furthermore, a UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore the latent mechanism of PF in attenuating depression. As a result, a total of 21 and 11 metabolites that potentially contribute to MDD progress and PF treatment were identified in serum and hippocampus, respectively. The analysis of metabolic pathways revealed that , amino  , energy ,  , glutathione  and inositol phosphate  were disturbed in a model of mice undergoing MDD and PF treatment. These results help us to understand the pathogenesis of depression in depth, and to discover targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

Although generically labeled as an "antioxidant," poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral-gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.NAC prevented hemin-induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate-dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione-dependent enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular  peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E (PGE ).NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic  products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

These early investigations provided a foundation for subsequent efforts to establish the physiological relevance of the AA monooxygenase and its contributions to the pathophysiology of, for example, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, nociception, and vascular disease. This retrospective analyzes the history of some of these efforts, with emphasis on genetic studies that identified roles for the murine  and  genes in renal and vascular physiology and the pathophysiology of hypertension and cancer. Wide-ranging investigations by laboratories worldwide, including the authors, have established a better appreciation of the enzymology, genetics, and physiologic roles for what is now known as the third branch of the AA cascade. Combined with the development of analytical and pharmacological tools, including robust synthetic agonists and antagonists of the major metabolites, we stand at the threshold of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of renal injury, pain, hypertension, and heart disease.Copyright © 2018 Capdevila and Falck.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717350>Glycerolipid Composition of the Red Macroalga  and Comparison to the Closely Related  Producing Different Types of Eicosanoids.</a></h2><p>The red macroalga  is a well-known producer of eicosanoids such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, but the alga produces almost no prostaglandins, unlike the closely related . This indicates that the related two algae would have different enzyme systems or substrate composition. To carry out more in-depth discussions on the metabolic pathway of eicosanoids between the two algae, we investigated the characteristics of glycerolipids, which are the substrates of eicosanoids production, of  and compared them to the reported values of . In , monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were the major  classes and accounted for 44.4% of the total  extract. The predominant fatty acids were  (20:4n-6), an eicosanoids precursor, and palmitic  (16:0). The 20:4n-6 content was extremely high in MGDG and PC (>70%), and the 16:0 content was extremely high in DGDG and SQDG (>40%). A chiral-phase HPLC analysis showed that fatty acids were esterified at the -1 and -2 positions of those lipids. The glycerolipid molecular species were determined by reversed-phase HPLC⁻ESI⁻MS analysis. The main glycerolipid molecular species were 20:4n-6/20:4n-6 (-1/-2) for MGDG (63.8%) and PC (48.2%), 20:4n-6/16:0 for DGDG (71.1%) and SQDG (29.4%). These  characteristics of  were almost the same as those of . Hence, the differences of the eicosanoids producing ability between the two algae would not be due to the difference of substrate composition but the difference of enzyme system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296490>Eicosanoids via CYP450 and cardiovascular disease: Hints from genetic and nutrition studies.</a></h2><p>Metabolites of  via CYP450 such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), have vasoactive and natriuretic properties and have been implicated in BP homeostasis and the incidence of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases in animal studies. In humans, genetic studies considering genes implicated in  acids  (CYP4F2, CYP4A11, CYP2J2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2A1/2, EPHX2) can offer a hint to understand their role, if any, in hypertension development and its deleterious cardiovascular effects. Candidate genes studies and successive meta-analyses have shown that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), often functional, and haplotypes in these genes were associated with one or more cardiovascular endpoints. Nevertheless, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have never detected any SNPs nearby these genes (the only exception being the CYP2A1/2 locus) as associated with either BP, hypertension, coronary artery disease or stroke questioning their real importance for cardiovascular health in humans. Nutrition studies exploring the effects of specific foods on the formation of these compounds or others through the same pathway can offer new insights on this field.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Multiple functions have been proposed, including reservoir of precursors for inflammatory mediators, modulation of membrane fluidity, and anti-oxidative properties. They could therefore play a role under conditions of metabolic stress. Especially enzymatically modified LDL (eLDL) and oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) represent modifications of LDL that are taken up by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to analyze plasmalogen related effects of eLDL and oxLDL in human monocyte derived macrophages, as well as the effects of HDL3 mediated deloading.Elutriated monocytes from nine healthy donors were differentiated in vitro for four days. Macrophages were then loaded with native LDL, eLDL and oxLDL for 24h and subsequently deloaded with HDL3 for another 24h. Lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles were obtained.Loading of macrophages with eLDL and oxLDL led to a transient but strong elevation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) most likely through direct uptake. Only eLDL induced increased levels of total PC, presumably through an induction of PC synthesis. On the other hand treatment with oxLDL led to a significant increase in PC P. Analysis of individual  species showed lipoprotein and saturation specific effects for LPC, PC P and PE P species. Membrane fluidity was decreased by the large amount of FC contained in the lipoproteins, as indicated by a lower PC to FC ratio after lipoprotein loading. In contrast the observed changes in the saturated to mono-unsaturated fatty  (SFA to MUFA) and saturated to poly-unsaturated fatty  (SFA to PUFA) ratios in PE P could represent a cellular reaction to counteract this effect by producing more fluid membranes. Transcriptomic analysis showed considerable differences between eLDL and oxLDL treated macrophages. As a common feature of both lipoproteins we detected a strong downregulation of pathways for endogenous  synthesis as well as for exogenous  uptake. Deloading with HDL3 had only minor effects on total  class as well as on individual  species levels, most of the time not reaching significance. Interestingly treatment with HDL3 had no effect on membrane fluidity under these conditions, although incubation with HDL3 was partially able to counteract the oxLDL induced transcriptomic effects. To investigate the functional effect of lipoprotein treatment on macrophage polarization we performed surface marker flow cytometry. Under our experimental conditions oxLDL was able to partially shift the surface marker pattern towards a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype. This is consistent with the consumption of  containing PE P species in oxLDL treated cells, presumably for the synthesis of inflammatory mediators.Our findings provide novel data on the lipoprotein induced, lipidomic and transcriptomic changes in macrophages. This can help us better understand the development of metabolic, inflammatory diseases as well as improve our background knowledge on  biomarkers in serum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668793>Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Green Microalga Lobosphaera incisa Contribute to Tolerance to Abiotic Stresses.</a></h2><p>Lobosphaera incisa is a green microalga that accumulates high levels of the valuable omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA)  (ARA, 20:4n-6) in triacylglycerols (TAG) under nitrogen (N) starvation. LC-PUFA accumulation is a rare trait in photosynthetic microalgae with insufficiently understood physiological significance. In this study, RNAi was attempted, for the first time in L. incisa, to produce knockdown lines for the Δ5 desaturase gene. Two lines, termed modified lines, which were isolated during screening for transgenic events, demonstrated alterations in their LC-PUFA profile, ARA-biosynthesis gene expression and  class distribution. In line M5-78, which appeared to carry a mutation in the Δ6 elongase gene, LC-PUFA were substituted by 18:3n-6 in all glycerolipids. Line M2-35, for which the exact genetic background has not been established, displayed a dramatic reduction in 20:4n-6, concomitant with an augmented proportion of 18:1n-9, in particular in the extraplastidial membrane lipids and TAG. The physiological responses of the modified lines to stressful conditions were compared with the wild type and the Δ5 desaturase mutant. In the N-replete cells of modified lines, the frequency of  droplets was reduced, while a number of starch grains increased, suggesting altered partitioning of assimilated carbon into reserve products. Furthermore, both lines exhibited reduced ability to accumulate TAG under N deprivation and recover from N starvation. Both lines demonstrated lower photosynthetic pigment contents, impairments in photosynthesis under a range of stressful conditions, and less efficient functioning of photoprotection under optimal conditions. Possible implications of fatty acids modifications in the stress response of L. incisa are addressed.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, we further investigated the effects of TLR4 on islet function and pancreatic proteomics in obese rats by high- diet.PA-induced lipotoxicity β-cells, SD and TLR4 rats were used in this study. iTRAQ was used to screen out meaningful differential proteins.The protein expression level was evaluated by Western blotting; the cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay.TLR4 could reduce inflammatory and regulate body composition in obese rats, and improve β-cells function. The quantitative analysis of protein revealed that TLR4 rebalanced proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats. In addition, the pathways involved in differential proteins were mainly metabolic pathways,  , ECM-receptor interaction, pancreatic secretion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Further analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) revealed that Stk39 and Ass1 interacting through Mapk14-Ywhae were node proteins and participated in inflammatory response, carboxylic  metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process. In vitro experiments we confirmed that silencing TLR4 can inhibit PA-induced β-cell apoptosis, insulin secretion disorders, and increase Ass1 expression. While, overexpression of Ass1 in β-cell inhibited PA or LPS-induced β-cell damage.Our study confirmed that TLR4 could improve dysfunction of β-cell, and the underlying mechanism might be involved in ebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas, affecting the expression of Ass1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027294>Elevated AA/EPA Ratio Represents an Inflammatory Biomarker in Tumor Tissue of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). The oxidative  of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has a strong effect on colonic tumorigenesis and the levels of  (AA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) can contribute to the development of an inflammatory microenvironment. Aim of this study was to evaluate the possible differences in the AA/EPA ratio tissue levels between CRC patients with and without synchronous metastases. Moreover, the expression of the most important inflammatory enzymes and mediators, linked with the AA/EPA ratio, have been also assessed. Sixty-eight patients with CRC were enrolled in the study, of which 33 patients with synchronous metastasis. Fatty  profile analysis in tissue samples was done to examine the levels of AA and EPA. High levels of the AA/EPA ratio were detected in tumor tissue of patients with metastatic CRC. Moreover, an increase of expression of the main enzymes and mediators involved in inflammation was also detected in the same samples. The lipidomic approach of inflammation allows to evaluate  homeostasis changes that occur in cancer and in its metastatic process, in order to identify new biomarkers to be introduced into clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31359069>Effects of Chlorpyrifos on Cholinesterase and Serine Lipase Activities and  in Brains of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).</a></h2><p>Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus insecticide that elicits acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to acetylcholine accumulation and prolonged stimulation of cholinergic receptors throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative pathways, including reduction of cAMP catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie non-cholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of disruption of fatty  signaling as a mechanism of toxicity,  and fatty  profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses (10, 20, and 40 μg/L). While lethality was noted higher doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 μg/L (nominal concentration 10 μg/L) significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines (16:0; 18:0, 18:1, and 22:6) derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids (Palmitic acid16:0; Linolenic acid18:3; Eicosadienoic  20:2;  20:4; and Docosahexaenoic  22:6) were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the  of selected phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations. These results indicate that in addition to AChE inhibition, environmentally relevant chlorpyrifos exposure alters serine lipase activity and  metabolites in the trout brain, which may compromise neuronal signaling and impact neurobehavioral responses in aquatic animals.© The Author(s) 2019.

Besides providing physical properties to cell membranes, these PUFAs are metabolically active and undergo turnover through the "deacylation-reacylation (Land's) cycle". Recent studies suggest a Yin-Yang mechanism for  of ARA and DHA, largely due to different phospholipases A (PLAs) mediating their release. ARA and DHA are substrates of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases resulting in an array of  mediators, which are pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving. The PUFAs are susceptible to peroxidation by oxygen free radicals, resulting in the production of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) from ARA and 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) from DHA. These alkenal electrophiles are reactive and capable of forming adducts with proteins, phospholipids and nucleic acids. The perceived cytotoxic and hormetic effects of these hydroxyl-alkenals have impacted cell signaling pathways, glucose  and mitochondrial functions in chronic and inflammatory diseases. Due to the high levels of DHA and ARA in brain phospholipids, this review is aimed at providing information on the Yin-Yang mechanisms for regulating these PUFAs and their  peroxidation products in the CNS, and implications of their roles in neurological disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30293059>Polyunsaturated fatty  elongation and desaturation in activated human T-cells: ELOVL5 is the key elongase.</a></h2><p>PUFAs are important constituents of membrane glycerophospholipids. However, changes in the capacities to incorporate and metabolize PUFAs when cells enter the cell cycle have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, differences in the incorporation and  of exogenous PUFAs in resting and proliferating primary human T-cells and in the Jurkat cell line were measured. Overall, proliferating T-cells and Jurkat cells had a greater capacity to incorporate and elongate exogenous 18- and 20-carbon PUFAs compared with resting T-cells. Proliferating T-cells and Jurkat cells also showed a greater capacity to desaturate 18-carbon PUFA substrates. Consistent with these observations, a significant increase in the expression of fatty  desaturase (FADS) 1, FADS2, and elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein (ELOVL) 5 was measured in proliferating T-cells compared with resting T-cells. No quantifiable ELOVL2 was measured. Knockdown of ELOVL5 in T-cells and Jurkat cells significantly affected cellular monounsaturated and PUFA profiles and strongly impaired the elongation of 18- and 20-carbon PUFAs. In conclusion, the induction of proliferation in human T-cells is associated with a significant increase in the capacity to take up and metabolize exogenous PUFAs, and ELOVL5 is responsible for the elongation of 18- and 20-carbon PUFAs in these cells.Copyright © 2018 Robichaud et al.

In this study, a novel snake protein, metalloproteinase SP, was successfully isolated from the venom of   by multi-gel chromatography. The isolated protein exhibits anti-platelet aggregation activity. Animal experiments showed that it exhibited defibration, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic effects and contributes to improved blood rheology and antiplatelet aggregation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that it prolonged clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen time and reduced fibrinogen content of mice. Also, metalloproteinase SP inhibited carrageenan-induced tail thrombosis, ADP-induced acute pulmonary embolism, and ADP,  (AA), or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro experiments showed that the protein cleaved the α, β, and γ chains of fibrinogen. Metabolomic analysis upon metalloproteinase SP treatment revealed that 14 metabolites, which are mainly involved in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, responded to metalloproteinase SP treatment.

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1), oleic  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic  (C18:3n6),  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the role of LDs in fish immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous lipid mix (LM; oleic  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA,  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Mounting evidence has shown that 12-LOX plays a critical role in the modulation of inflammation at multiple checkpoints during diabetes development. Due to this, interventions to limit pro-inflammatory 12-LOX metabolites either by isoform-specific 12-LOX inhibition, or by providing specific fatty  substrates via dietary intervention, has the potential to significantly and positively impact health outcomes of patients living with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. To date, the development of truly specific and efficacious inhibitors has been hampered by homology of LOX family members; however, improvements in high throughput screening have improved the inhibitor landscape. Here, we describe the function and role of human 12-LOX, and mouse 12-LOX and 12/15-LOX, in the development of diabetes and diabetes-related complications, and describe promise in the development of strategies to limit pro-inflammatory metabolites, primarily via new small molecule 12-LOX inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the lack of effective research approaches impedes the understanding of the protein-metabolite interactions. In this study, a novel comprehensive strategy by combining metabolomics platform with native mass spectrometry was developed for investigating the protein-metabolite interactions. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ) is a -binding nuclear receptors that plays a key role in regulating fatty- oxidation and , which was selected as the model protein. Seven metabolites including lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) 16:0, LPC18:0, LPC18:1, , oleic , linoleic  and palmitoleic  (p < 0.05) were found to have the possible interactions with the PPARγ, these LPCs were discovered as candidate ligands for the first time by using untargeted metabolomics method. Native mass spectrometry based on 15 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer was employed to directly detect the PPARγ-LPCs complexes to obtain their stoichiometry and kinetic constants. Isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectrum and molecular modeling were further utilized to investigate the thermodynamics, conformation and binding mechanism of the interaction between PPARγ and LPCs. It was found that the PPARγ-LPC interaction was an endothermic process, and these LPCs have similar binding constants with stoichiometric number of 1:1. The novel strategy can provide a very useful approach for mapping and identifying unknown protein-metabolite interactions in biological systems.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

During two meal challenge test visits subjects received standardized isocaloric (450 kcal) liquid meals: high-carbohydrate (HC, carbohydrates: 89% of energy) and normo-carbohydrate (NC, carbohydrates: 45% of energy). Fasting (0 min) and postprandial (30, 60, 120, 180 min) plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite profiles through untargeted metabolomics. Metabolic fingerprinting was performed on an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system connected to an iFunnel quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer.In HR-genotype men, after the intake of an HC-meal, we noted a significantly lower area under the curves (AUCs) of postprandial plasma concentrations of most of the phospholipids (-37% to -53%, variable importance in the projection (VIP) = 1.2-1.5), lysophospholipids (-29% to -86%, VIP = 1.1-2.6), sphingolipids (-32% to -47%, VIP = 1.1-1.3), as well as  (-36%, VIP = 1.4) and oleic (-63%, VIP = 1.3) acids, their metabolites: keto- and hydoxy-fatty acids (-38% to -78%, VIP = 1.3-2.5), leukotrienes (-65% to -83%, VIP = 1.4-2.2), uric  (-59%, VIP = 1.5), and pyroglutamic  (-65%, VIP = 1.8). The AUCs of postprandial sphingosine concentrations were higher (125-832%, VIP = 1.9-3.2) after the NC-meal, AUCs of acylcarnitines were lower (-21% to -61%, VIP = 1.1-2.4), and AUCs of fatty  amides were higher (51-508%, VIP = 1.7-3.1) after the intake of both meals.In nondiabetic men carrying the TCF7L2 HR genotype, subtle but detectable modifications in intermediate  are induced by an HC-meal.

Although the differential  of the main n-3PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) could lead to distinct activities, there are no clinical studies comparing their relative efficacy in human skin. Following a 10-wk oral supplementation of healthy volunteers and using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we found that n-3PUFA mainly affected the epidermal mediator lipidome. EPA was more efficient than DHA in reducing production of -derived lipids, and both n-3PUFA lowered -acyl ethanolamines. In UV radiation-challenged skin (3 times the minimum erythemal dose), EPA attenuated the production of proinflammatory lipids, whereas DHA abrogated the migration of Langerhans cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, n-3PUFA increased the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells but did not alter the erythemal response, either the sunburn threshold or the resolution of erythema, as assessed by spectrophotometric hemoglobin index readings. As EPA and DHA differentially impact cutaneous inflammation through changes in the network of epidermal lipids and dendritic and infiltrating immune cells, they should be considered separately when designing interventions for cutaneous disease.-Kendall, A.
