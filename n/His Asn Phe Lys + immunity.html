<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2460872>Involvement of distinct murine T-cell receptors in the autoimmune encephalitogenic response to nested epitopes of myelin basic protein.</a></h2><p>The peptide p89-101 (Val------Ile-Val-Thr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Pro) of myelin basic protein is encephalitogenic in mice expressing H-2q and H-2s antigens. Six of 13 encephalitogen-specific T-cell clones were shown to express the variable beta-chain (V beta) 17a gene product (KJ23a+), whereas seven clones were KJ23a-. Both KJ23a+ and KJ23a- subpopulations were encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice when adoptively transferred. Depletion of KJ23a+ cells in vivo with the administration of the antibody KJ23a suppresses experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with KJ23a+ T-cell lines. However, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis induced with either (i) encephalitogenic peptide p89-101, (ii) intact myelin basic protein, or (iii) KJ23a- T cells reactive to p89-101 cannot be prevented with monoclonal antibody KJ23a. These data indicate that in spite of the V beta 17a gene expression in a relatively large proportion of p89-101-specific T cells, such V beta gene use is not essential for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice. These results contrast with the predominance of V beta gene use (V beta 8.2) in T cells reactive to the encephalitogenic fragment (pR1-11) in PL/J mice. One reason for this lack of dominant use of a particular T-cell receptor V beta gene family in the autoimmune response to myelin basic protein in SJL/J mice stems from the observation that two encephalitogenic epitopes exist in p89-101. KJ23a- T cells are stimulated by the deleted peptide p89-100, whereas KJ23a+ T cells are not. Thus, in the response to an encephalitogenic fragment of myelin basic protein containing two nested epitopes, at least two distinct T-cell receptor V beta genes are expressed. These distinct T-cell subpopulations can each trigger experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These findings have implications for therapy of autoimmune disease with antibodies to the T-cell receptor gene products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/82385>Peptides and autoimmune disease.</a></h2><p>The use of derived and synthetic peptides has contributed greatly to our understanding of encephalitogenic determinants in the basic protein molecule. Peptides derived from BP by use of trypsin, pepsin, cathepsin D (brain and liver) and BNPS-skatole have proven most useful. Synthetic peptides have served to define the disease-inducing determinants with precision. A remarkable feature of these studies is that different antigenic determinants serve as encephalitogenic sites in different species. The encephalitogenic sites comprise short peptide domains of the BP polypeptide chain, only 8 residues (rat), 9 residues (guinea pig), and 10 residues (rabbit) in length. In view of the requirement for both haptenic and carrier specificity of an immunogenic molecule, it is impressive that these peptides themselves elicit the autoimmune disease, EAE. While less active than BP on a molar basis, they are nonetheless potent encephalitogens, producing clinical signs in rats and guinea pigs at less than 1 microgram dose. The data indicate that for most animal species (guinea pig, rat, monkey) there appears to be only one major encephalitogenic determinant, an unusual finding in view of the number of antigenic determinants for cell-mediated  existing in the BP molecule. Possibly a combination of genetic and anatomical factors may account for this phenomenon. A relationship may exist between multiple sclerosis and EAE as shown by peptide studies; lymphocytes are found in MS patients during exacerbation sensitized to the same region of BP active in the monkey. The major encephalitogenic sites are: Guinea Pig (9) -Ser-Trp-Gly-Ala-Glu-Gly-Gln-(Arg); Rabbit (10) Thr-Thr--Tyr-Gly-Ser-Leu-Pro-Gln-; Rat (8) Ser-Gln-Arg-Ser-Gln-Asp-Glu-; Monkey (14) --Leu-Gly-Gly-Arg-Asp-Ser-Arg-Ser-Gly-Ser-Pro-Hser.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9233656>A 17-Mer self-peptide of acetylcholine receptor binds to B cell MHC class II, activates helper T cells, and stimulates autoantibody production and electrophysiologic signs of myasthenia gravis.</a></h2><p>We have identified in an extracellular segment of the alpha1 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of homologous muscle a 17-residue autoantigen that, without conjugation to a carrier, activates Th lymphocytes and induces production of autoantibodies that cause electrophysiologic signs of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. A panel of overlapping synthetic peptides revealed two T cell epitopes, one encompassed by residues 121-136 and the other by 129-145. Residues 129 (glutamic acid) and 130 (isoleucine) were implicated in a pathogenic B cell epitope. Peptide 129-145 (Glu-Ile-Ile-Val-Thr---Pro--Asp-Glu-Gln--Cys-Ser-Met-, a conserved sequence in rat and human AChR) induced autoantibody production in 76% of rats. All seropositive rats had evidence of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis; five of five tested had electrophysiologic signs, and all had loss of immunochemically measured autologous muscle AChR. Analogues of 129-145, with single residues substituted by alanine, revealed phenylalanine 135, phenylalanine 137, and glutamic acid 139 as most important determinants of Ag/MHC-II/TCR interactions; phenylalanine 137 is critical for T cell activation. B cells were the major MHC-II-positive cell type to which the self-peptide 129-145 bound in a population of nonimmune splenic cells. More efficient processing and presentation of the Th cell epitope by an expanded population of immune B cells selected by specifically binding another epitope of the same peptide would greatly amplify the production of autoantibodies. Peptide autoantigens of this type could plausibly perpetuate the autoantibody response in myasthenia gravis, and are a rational target for strategies aimed at Ag-specific therapeutic intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23502767>Identification of synthetic peptides that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2).</a></h2><p>Many studies have suggested that the synergic effect of myeloid differential protein-2 (MD-2) on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be a critical step during the LPS-TLR4 response signaling pathway. We performed a bioinformatic analysis on the MD-2 protein and identified the amino acid sequence NH2-FSKGKYKCV-COOH (K128-132) as a possible key sequence involved in the binding between MD-2 and LPS. We then screened a random phage display peptide library using this sequence as bait in order to identify antagonistic peptides. After 3 rounds of selection, 3 positive clones were identified. All 3 peptides were shown to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner the production of tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-6 in human U937 and THP-1 cell lines as well as human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated by LPS. Only 2 of the 3 peptides were able to bind MD-2 directly as shown by sulfo-SBED biotin label transfer experiments. BALB/C mice were used to estimate the protection of these peptides from LPS challenge, and 2 of the 3 peptides (-Thr-Val-Pro-Asp-- and Ile-Gly---Leu-Tyr-Arg) reduced mortality of the challenged mice from 100% to 53.8%. This study has demonstrated that interfering with the binding between MD-2 and LPS might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating LPS-induced sepsis, and in doing so has identified 2 potential peptide candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3498765>Myasthenogenicity of human acetylcholine receptor synthetic alpha-subunit peptide 125-147 does not require intramolecular disulfide cyclization.</a></h2><p>This study reports the synthesis of a disulfide-looped peptide corresponding to residues 125-147 (Cys 128-Cys 142) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of human skeletal muscle, H alpha 125-147 (-Ser-Tyr-Cys-Glu-Ile-Ile-Val-Thr---Pro--Asp-Glu-Gln- -Cys-Ser-Nle- Leu-Gly), and a nondisulfide-looped analogue, H alpha 125-147(S) (-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Glu-Ile-Ile-Val-Thr---Pro--Asp-Glu- Gln--Cys-Ser-Nle--Leu-Gly), in which the amino acid Cys 128 was replaced with serine. Both peptides induced antigen-specific helper T cell responses, as evidenced in vitro by lymph node cell proliferation and in vivo by production of anti-AChR antibodies. Rats immunized with 100 micrograms of either synthetic peptide, without conjugation to a carrier, produced anti-peptide antibodies which bound to native AChR in immunoprecipitation assays and induced modulation of membrane-bound AChR from cultured human myotubes. Both peptides also induced electrophysiologic and biochemical signs of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Thus, region 125-147 of the AChR alpha-subunit is at least partly exposed extracellularly in human muscle and contains one or more autoantigenic sites capable of stimulating T cells and B cells. Disulfide-linkage between residues Cys 128 and Cys 142 is not essential for myasthenogenicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11435730>Purification of the major allergen of red soft coral (Dendronephthya nipponica).</a></h2><p>Red soft coral (RSC; Dendronephthya nipponica, a marine coelenterate) causes spiny lobster fishermen living along the Pacific coast of Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan to develop occupational allergies, such as conjunctivitis, rhinitis, dermatitis and bronchial asthma. The aim of this study was to purify and to characterize RSC allergen, which causes occupational asthma in spiny lobster fishermen. The allergic responsiveness of spiny lobster fishermen to RSC was examined. The examinations included specific IgE production, skin test responses, lymphocyte stimulation tests and specific IgG production. We found that RSC has a strong sensitizing activity in humans at a molecular weight of 10 kD or more, while it has no IgE-producing activity at a molecular weight of less than 10 kD. Neither the nonatopic controls nor the atopic non-coral-allergic controls exhibited any RAST-binding activity to any fraction. For the purification and the identification of this new allergen component, repeated gel filtration of the RSC extract was performed on a Sephacryl S-200 column, followed by gel filtration on a Superose-6 column. The purified major allergen component Den n 1, which is separated on a Mono-Q column, showed intradermal responses, lymphocyte stimulating activity and specific IgG-producing activity in RSC-induced bronchial asthma patients. The 53-kD component was electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this new allergen component (Den n 1) was determined as Asp-Asp-Ile--Arg-Tyr-Ala--Asp---Ile-- Asp--Leu--Asp--Trp-Gln-Ser.Copyright 2001 S.

The peptide bound 26-56% of polyclonal antibodies induced in rat, rabbit, and dog by immunization with native AcChoR. Rats inoculated with 50 micrograms of unconjugated peptide developed helper T-cell responses, delayed hypersensitivity, and antibodies to native AcChoR. Anti-peptide antibodies were more reactive with native than denatured AcChoR and bound to the alpha subunit. Some reacted exclusively with mammalian muscle AcChoR, some induced modulation of AcChoR on cultured myotubes, but none inhibited binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to solubilized or membrane-associated AcChoR. Repeated immunization induced experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis: clinical signs in one rat and electrophysiologic and/or biochemical signs in 10 of 11 rats. Thus, at least part of the corresponding region of the mammalian AcChoR alpha subunit is extracellular at the neuromuscular junction and a potential target for pathogenic autoantibodies in patients with acquired myasthenia gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19342687>Mitocryptide-2: purification, identification, and characterization of a novel cryptide that activates neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils are a class of leukocytes involved in innate  by monitoring and scavenging invading microorganisms and toxic substances. The actions of neutrophils in damaged tissues are still not well understood, particularly in the early stage of inflammation, and as-yet-unknown neutrophil-activating substances are proposed to induce their acute transmigration and activation. Here, we isolated and identified from porcine hearts a neutrophil-activating peptide. Structural analyses indicated that the primary structure of this peptide is formyl-Met-Thr--Ile-Arg--Ser--Pro-Leu-Met--Ile-Ile-, which is identical to that of the N-terminal pentadecapeptide of porcine mitochondrial cytochrome b; we therefore named the newly isolated peptide "mitocryptide-2" (MCT-2), since we have recently purified and identified mitocryptide-1, a different class of a neutrophil-activating peptide. Synthetic MCT-2 and its human homolog hMCT-2 induced beta-hexosaminidase release in and chemotaxis of HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic/granulocytic cells. The induction of beta-hexosaminidase release, chemotaxis, and the increase in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration by hMCT-2 were completely suppressed by pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of G(i)- or G(o)-type G proteins in the signaling pathways. Moreover, MCT-2 and hMCT-2 also stimulated beta-hexosaminidase secretion in human neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, these peptides partially competed with [(3)H]formyl-Met-Leu- binding to HL-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic/granulocytic cells, presenting the possibility that the receptor for MCT-2 and hMCT-2 is one of the formyl peptide receptors. These results demonstrate that MCT-2 and its human homolog hMCT-2 are cryptides that activate neutrophils, thus suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms involving such mitocryptides in innate .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19463738>The alyteserins: two families of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae).</a></h2><p>Two families of structurally related C-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial peptides have been identified in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae). The alyteserin-1 peptides (Gly-Leu--(Asp/Glu)-Ile---Ala-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Val--(Gly/)-Ile-Ala-Ala--Val-Ala-(/Ser).NH(2)) show limited structural similarity to the ascaphins from the skins of frogs of the family Leiopelmatidae. Alyteserin-2a (Ile-Leu-Gly--Leu-Leu-Ser-Thr-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser--Leu.NH(2)) and alyteserin-2b and -2c (Ile-Leu-Gly-Ala-Ile-Leu-Pro-Leu-Val-Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-(/Ser)--Leu x NH(2)) show limited sequence identity with bombinin H6, present in the skins of frogs of the family Bombinatoridae. The alyteserin-1 peptides show selective growth inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (MIC=25 microM) whereas alyteserin-2a is more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=50 microM). The hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes of all peptides tested is relatively weak (LC(50)>100 microM).
