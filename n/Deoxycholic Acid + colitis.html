Although there are several animal models of adult visceral hypersensitivity after neonatal perturbation or acute colonic irritation/inflammation, current models of postinflammatory chronic visceral hyperalgesia are unsatisfactory. The aim of this study was to establish a model of chronic visceral hyperalgesia after colonic inflammation in the rat. (DCA) was instilled into the rat colon daily for 3 days and animals were tested for up to 4 weeks.DCA induced mild, transient colonic inflammation within 3 days that resolved within 3 weeks. An exaggerated visceromotor response, referred pain to mechanical stimulation, increased spinal Fos expression, and colonic afferent and dorsal horn neuron activity were apparent by 1 week and persisted for at least 4 weeks, indicating chronic dorsal horn hyperexcitability and visceral hyperalgesia. There was no spontaneous pain, based on open field behavior. There was a significant increase in opioid-receptor activity.DCA induces mild, transient , resulting in persistent visceral hyperalgesia and referred pain in rats, modeling some aspects of postinflammatory IBS.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21077947>The correlation between NF-κB inhibition and disease activity by coadministration of silibinin and ursodeoxycholic  in experimental .</a></h2><p>NF-κB is one of the most important nuclear factors responsible for overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines.

In addition, cholesterol saturation was determined in ulcerative  patients (N = 7) and gallstone patients (N = 18) as well as in 5 normal controls. Biliary cholesterol saturation in ileitis patients both with and without resection was similar to that in gallstone patients yet the prevalence of gallstones was only 12%. Cholesterol saturation did not correlate with ileal resection nor the extent, duration, or activity of ileitis. Biliary cholesterol saturation was not different in ulcerative  patients from that in normal subjects. It is concluded that cholesterol saturation of bile alone does not account for the high prevalence of cholesterol gallstones that has been reported in ileitis patients.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7829016>Rapid cholesterol nucleation time and cholesterol gall stone formation after subtotal or total colectomy in humans.</a></h2><p>Changes in biliary lipid composition, pH, ionised calcium, total and unconjugated bilirubin, and cholesterol nucleation time of gall bladder bile samples were examined in six patients who had undergone subtotal or total colectomy between five months and seven years previously, and values were compared with those in control patients with no gall stones. The colectomy group mainly comprised patients with ulcerative  and familial adenomatosis coli, in whom only a short length of the terminal ileum (mean (SEM) 2.25 (0.57) cm) had been resected. The reconstruction procedures were ileoanal anastomosis in two patients, terminal ileostomy in two, ileorectal anastomosis in one, and J shaped ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in one patient. The distributions of age, sex, and relative body weight were similar in the two groups. The gall bladder bile was lithogenic in the post colectomy group--these patients had a significantly increased cholesterol saturation index (p < 0.01) and rapid cholesterol nucleation time (p < 0.05) compared with the control group. A significant increase in the molar percentage of cholesterol and a decrease in that of total bile  associated with significantly decreased secondary bile acids (p < 0.05) were observed in the post colectomy group. Gall stones formed in two of six patients after colectomy were cholesterol stones containing more than 80% cholesterol by dry weight. Total and unconjugated bilirubin, pH, and ionised calcium values were similar in the two groups. The results indicate that after total or subtotal colectomy the composition of gall bladder bile increases the risk of cholesterol gall stone formation.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7429307>Portal vein bile acids in patients with severe inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The incidence of several forms of liver disease associated with inflammatory bowel disease has been putatively ascribed to a toxic effect on the liver of portal vein bile acids abnormal in type or amount. To examine this possibility, total bile  concentrations (sulphated and non-sulphated) were measured by gas-liquid chromatography in inferior mesentric vein serum of 19 patients undergoing colectomy for severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Similar determinations were obtained on a control group of eight patients requiring colectomy for other non-inflammatory conditions. Mean values for mesenteric vein serum bile  concentrations (muM/1) were 19.6+/-1.8 in controls and 16.3+/-2.0 in IBD. The mean sulphated bile  fraction did not exceed 10% of total, although there was considerable variability (up to 40% of total). Lithocholic  levels (entirely sulphated in all patients) were low. Although the IBD group showed a more than two-fold increase in mean lithocholate concentration (0.54+/-0.15 muM/1) over controls (0.21 +/- muM/1), this difference was not statistically significant. No significant intra-group difference was noted in the non-sulphated and sulphated fractions for cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and  species, respectively. No unidentified or unusual bile acids were observed. There was no correlation between bile  measurements and liver histology. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that liver disease often found in association with severe inflammatory bowel disease represents a form of bile  toxicity. The invariable finding of total sulphation of the lithocholic  fraction even in the presence of severe mucosal disease was unexpected.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14960516>Enteric neurones modulate the colonic permeability response to luminal bile acids in rat colon in vivo.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms behind microscopic  and exacerbations of ulcerative  are incompletely understood. It seems highly likely that both luminal antigens and bile are involved. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that bile acids increase colonic mucosal permeability by activating enteric neurones.The effect of 4 mM  (DCA) on the appearance rate of intravenously administered (3)H-mannitol and (14)C-urea into the lumen of the proximal and distal rat colon was measured in vivo and expressed as clearance. The nerve blocking agents atropine and hexamethonium were given intravenously, and lidocaine was applied onto the serosal surface of the colon, before and after DCA exposureDCA markedly increased clearance of the permeability probes into the lumen in both colonic segments and also the ratio of mannitol/urea clearance, particularly in the distal colon. Pretreatment with atropine, hexamethonium, and lidocaine significantly inhibited the increase in clearance by approximately 65-80% but did not affect the clearance ratio. In the distal colon, the inhibitory effect of lidocaine was not statistically significant. Also, administration of atropine and hexamethonium after DCA exposure significantly inhibited the DCA effect on clearance of the probes.The results suggest that in vivo, the permeability increase induced by a moderate concentration of bile  is to a large extent mediated by a neural mechanism involving muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. This mechanism may be a link between the central nervous system and colonic mucosal barrier function, and may be a new target for treatment.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23664897>Colorectal cancer in inflammatory bowel disease: results of the 3rd ECCO pathogenesis scientific workshop (I).</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

A freely diffusible dye, Azure A, was administered simultaneously to compensate for non-intestinal factors that could modify renal excretion. Animals were killed after a total treatment period of 5 months for rats and 6 wk for guinea-pigs. After 3 wk of carrageenan treatment, excretion of PEG-900 (expressed as a ratio of the Azure A excretion) in guinea-pigs showed a statistically significant increase over that in the control group. At autopsy, the caeca showed numerous macroscopically visible erosions of the entire mucosal surface and histological examination showed ulcerations largely in the mucosa with abscesses in the crypts. Although no such histological changes were seen in the intestines of the treated rats, even after 5 months, a statistically significant increase in PEG-900 excretion was again found compared with the control group. This increase did not occur when deoxycholate was administered with the carrageenan solution. No effect of carrageenan treatment on mucosal permeability to D-[3H]mannitol was demonstrated in either species. The results suggest that degraded carrageenan-induced  could be a result of increased intestinal permeability, since ingestion of this polysaccharide by rats increased PEG-900 absorption without causing mucosal damage.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16440420>Gallbladder bile composition in patients with Crohn 's disease.</a></h2><p>To further elucidate the pathogenesis and mechanisms of the high risk of gallstone formation in Crohn's disease.Gallbladder bile was obtained from patients with Crohn's disease who were admitted for elective surgery (17 with ileal/ileocolonic disease and 7 with Crohn's ). Fourteen gallstone patients served as controls. Duodenal bile was obtained from ten healthy subjects before and after the treatment with ursodeoxycholic . Bile was analyzed for biliary lipids, bile acids, bilirubin, crystals, and crystal detection time (CDT). Cholesterol saturation index was calculated.The biliary concentration of bilirubin was about 50% higher in patients with Crohn's disease than in patients with cholesterol gallstones. Ten of the patients with Crohn's disease involving ileum and three of those with Crohn's  had cholesterol saturated bile. Four patients with ileal disease and one of those with colonic disease displayed cholesterol crystals in their bile. About 1/3 of the patients with Crohn's disease had a short CDT. Treatment of healthy subjects with ursodeoxycholic  did not increase the concentration of bilirubin in duodenal bile. Several patients with Crohn's disease, with or without ileal resection/disease had gallbladder bile supersaturated with cholesterol and short CDT and contained cholesterol crystals.

EIM are present in 15-20% of patients with ulcerative  and in 20-40% of patients with Crohn's disease. The management of EIM is best provided by a multidisciplinary team, which includes specialists in the affected organ systems with training in the treatment of IBD. Therapeutic strategy is often empirical. This is explained by the paucity of randomized-controlled studies for the specific treatment of EIM in IBD and by the fact that treatment models are based on extrapolation from patients with similar conditions but without IBD. For most EIM, the mainstay of therapy is the treatment of the underlying active IBD. However, some EIM such as axial arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis run a clinical course independent of IBD activity and need specific therapy (e.g. TNF antagonists in ankylosing spondylitis and skin manifestations). This review summarizes the conventional and novel (e.g. anti-TNF) treatment modalities, and the therapeutic implications for the management of extraintestinal symptoms in IBD, in order to assist clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies for IBD patients with EIM.Copyright © 2012 S.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids, lithocholic and . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS  was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19636573>Primary sclerosing cholangitis: outcome of patients undergoing restorative proctocolecetomy for ulcerative .</a></h2><p>The prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) among patients with ulcerative  needing proctocolectomy is about 12%.

Several models of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer have been developed and there is an increasing database on the major molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis mainly from preclinical experiments and phase I trials. There have been several large epidemiological and observational studies to evaluate possible protective effects of >200 agents. More recently, case-control and cohort studies and well-conceived, phase II/III clinical trials have been done or are under way to evaluate putative chemopreventive agents including established drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-aminosalicylates and statins; more controversial drugs like cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, ursodeoxycholic ; various vitamins and micronutrients including calcium, selenium, folic , and dietary fibre, fat and protein content. Despite promising outcome in preclinical studies, there is currently very limited data from well-controlled and appropriately powered clinical studies. The most promising agents currently are aspirin, traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. The recent reports of cardiovascular risks of the COX-2 inhibitors and some traditional NSAIDs have resulted in stagnation of the field.

This chronic progressive disease, characterised by inflammation, fibrosis and strictures of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, leads to cirrhosis. There is a strong association between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).A 10-year-old boy presented at the accident and emergency department with fever, episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and hepatomegaly. Blood tests, pathology investigations, liver biopsy and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) led to the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic  and later, because of unbearable itching, sequentially with lidocaine 3% ointment, rifampicin, an endoprosthesis in the common bile duct and glucocorticoids.

The disease belongs to the most common cholestatic diseases in adults and at present is diagnosed with increasing frequency. It is very often associated with ulcerative . Patients with PSC have an increased incidence of bile duct carcinomas and those with ulcerative  also have an increased incidence of colonic carcinomas. Immunosuppressive treatment is little effective. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has been shown to improve liver histology in PSC. The aim is to treat patients as early as possible to prevent progression to the advanced stages of the disease. During treatment with UDCA stenoses of major ducts may develop and early endoscopic dilatation is highly effective.

For decades, synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone have been the cornerstone for the clinical treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A previous study has shown that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) enhances the transcription of NR3C1 gene, which encodes for human GR, by binding to a conserved FXR response element (FXRE) in the distal promoter of this gene. In the present study we demonstrate that FXR promotes the resolution of  in rodents by enhancing Gr gene transcription. We used the chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay to demonstrate that this FXRE is functional in mediating a head-to-tail chromatin looping, thus increasing Gr transcription efficiency.

Autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis occurs more often in children than in adults and is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease, predominantly ulcerative . We report a unique case of a 10-year-old Danish boy with severe small duct autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis and synchronic Crohn . He was referred with a history of weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Biochemical anomalies included elevated alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase and immunoglobulin G levels and the presence of smooth muscle antibodies and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies but normal alkaline phosphatase. Liver biopsy specimen revealed features of both autoimmune hepatitis and sclerosing cholangitis, the latter characterized by acute, hyperplastic and destructive inflammation--granulocytic epithelial lesion--of the small ducts. Magnetic resonance cholangiography was normal. Colonoscopic biopsies showed chronic inflammatory changes of the caecum and the ascending and transverse colon compatible with Crohn disease. Ursodeoxycholic  and immunosuppressive treatment was initiated and within four weeks of treatment the general condition improved. Normalization of aminotransferase was seen at 21 weeks and γ-glutamyl transferase at 72 weeks after first admittance, while immunoglobulin G remained slightly increased.

The induced histologic changes resemble those observed in patients with hepatic damage associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, we have examined the hypothesis that lithocholate is of etiologic importance in causing this association by measuring serum and biliary lithocholates in inflammatory bowel disease patients with and without liver disease. Serum and biliary lithocholates and isolithocholates were normal in all patients. Because defective sulfation in the nonhuman primate which allows lithocholate to accumulate in the enterohepatic circulation is thought to be responsible for inducing liver damage and because secondary bile acids are reduced after colectomy and in established liver disease, we examined thae capacity of all patients to sulfate labeled lithocholate. Effective sulfation of lithocholate was demstrated in all groups. Despite the hepatotoxic effects observed in nonhuman primates, we have found no evidence so far to implicate lithocholate as an etiologic factor in inflammatory bowel disease and hepatic dysfunction nor have we detected other potentially hepatotoxic bile acids in these patients.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093383>Bile acids modulate the Golgi membrane fission process via a protein kinase Ceta and protein kinase D-dependent pathway in colonic epithelial cells.</a></h2><p> (DCA) is a secondary bile  that modulates signalling pathways in epithelial cells. DCA has been implicated in pathogenesis of colon carcinoma, particularly by activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a tertiary bile , has been observed to have chemopreventive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DCA and UDCA on the subcellular localization and activity of PKCeta and its downstream effects on Golgi structure in a colon cancer cell model. PKCeta expression was localized to the Golgi in HCT116 colon cancer cells. DCA induced fragmentation of the Golgi in these cells following activation of PKCeta and its downstream effector protein kinase D (PKD). Pretreatment of cells with UDCA or a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibited DCA-induced PKCeta/PKD activation and Golgi fragmentation. Knockdown of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression using small interfering RNA or inhibition using the GR antagonist mifepristone attenuated the inhibitory effect of UDCA on Golgi fragmentation. Elevated serum and faecal levels of DCA have been previously reported in patients with ulcerative  (UC) and colon cancer. Analysis of Golgi architecture in vivo using tissue microarrays revealed Golgi fragmentation in UC and colorectal cancer tissue. We have demonstrated that DCA can disrupt the structure of the Golgi, an organelle critical for normal cell function. Inhibition of this DCA-induced Golgi fragmentation by UDCA was mediated via the GR.

Bile acids may play a role both in etiology and pharmacology of this disease. Thus, although  is regarded as a proinflammatory agent ursodeoxycholic , which is currently being used to treat certain types of cholestasis and primary biliary cirrhosis, because of their choleretic, cytoprotective and immunomodulatory effects, it has been reported to exert an anti-inflammatory activity. We aim to confirm and characterize the intestinal antiinflammatory activity of ursodeoxycholic . The experimental model trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS)-induced  in rats has been used. Animal status was characterized by a number of macroscopic and biochemical parameters. Oral administration of ursodeoxycholic  was able to ameliorate experimental colonic inflammation. This occurred only at a relatively high dose (50 mg/kg day), whereas ursodeoxycholic  was without significant effect at doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg day. The therapeutic effect was evidenced, among others, by a higher body weight recovery, a diminished affected to total mucosal area and lower alkaline phosphatase activity in treated vs. control (TNBS treated) animals. These results indicate that, at the appropriate dose, ursodeoxycholic  is a potentially useful drug to reduce intestinal inflammation and could be envisaged to be incorporated in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis, rarely occurs in UC. We present two PBC cases of 67 and 71 years who suffered from long-standing UC.

The patients started ursodeoxycholic  (13 mg/kg/day) with complete response. During follow-up, both patients remained asymptomatic with normal blood biochemistry. Although PSC is the most common hepatobiliary manifestation among patients with UC, physicians must keep also PBC in mind in those with unexplained cholestasis and repeatedly normal MRCP.

Therefore, it is possible that exogenous administration of inhibitory bile acids may be used directly as nonantibiotic therapeutics for this indication. The need for such a treatment alternative is especially significant in patients with refractory C. difficile-associated pouchitis, where the efficacy of FMT may be limited.We measured the ability of UDCA to suppress the germination and the vegetative growth of 11 clinical isolate strains of C. difficile from patients treated with FMT for RCDI. In addition, we used oral UDCA to treat a patient with RCDI pouchitis that proved refractory to multiple antibiotic treatments and FMT.UDCA was found to be inhibitory to the germination and the vegetative growth of all C. difficile strains tested. Fecal concentrations of UDCA from the patient with RCDI pouchitis exceeded levels necessary to inhibit the germination and the growth of C. difficile in vitro. The patient has remained infection free for over 10 months after the initiation of UDCA.UDCA can be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with C. difficile-associated pouchitis. Further studies need to be conducted to define the optimal dose and duration of such a treatment.

As a consequence, cholestasis with elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and gamme glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and bilirubin in more advanced disease is the most prominent feature of this disease. The diagnosis of PSC is primarily based on endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with demonstration of irregular strictures and dilatations. In liver biopsy, typical findings are portal and periodical inflammation and fibrosis. Since PSC is a focal disease, the characteristic histological findings may or may not be seen in a single liver biopsy. The cause of PSC is still unknown. The association with histocombatibility antigens indicates that immunological mechanisms may be involved but it is still unclear whether the disease is immunogenic. Alternatively, bacteria and bacterial toxins from the colon might play a role (3, 4). In 70% of cases PSC is associated with ulcerative  (5) and, therefore, in all patients with this intestinal disease who also have elevated levels of liver enzymes, a cholangiography should be performed. Recently, in up to 80% of patients with PSC anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmatic-antigens (ANCA) were found to be elevated (6) and, in future, this test may help to diagnose the disease more easily.

Surprisingly, the calculated intestinal influx of endogenous cholesterol was reduced so that the absolute absorption of cholesterol was decreased; elimination of cholesterol as faecal neutral steroids remained normal.

Our aim was to assess bile lithogenicity, bile composition and mass of biliary lipids within the gallbladder. We studied 11 patients with total colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis and 16 healthy controls. We measured the percentage composition of conjugated bile acids and the masses within the gallbladder of the three main biliary lipids. This method, in contrast with measurement of cholesterol saturation index, can determine the cause of bile lithogenicity in terms of absolute modifications of the biliary lipids. There was no difference in the cholesterol saturation index between patients and controls. Colectomy patients had reduced masses of all three biliary lipids (medians and ranges, mmol): cholesterol 0.11 (0.03-0.24) vs. 0.36 (0.02-0.96), P < 0.02; bile  1.62 (0.75-5.21) vs. 3.95 (1.27-8.70), P < 0.01; phospholipids 0.35 (0.07-0.69) vs. 1.14 (0.14-3.00), P < 0.002. They also had reduced per cent : 3.8 (0.0-27.6) vs. 17.4 (6.4-44.7), P < 0.005, and increased percent cholic : 44.9 (23.3-71.4) vs. 34.3 (19.2-57.9), P < 0.05. We conclude that, despite having bile  malabsorption, patients with colectomy and ileo-anal anastomosis have a normal cholesterol saturation index, caused by a concomitant reduction in the masses of all three biliary lipids. The reduced per cent biliary  may help explain the reduced cholesterol and phospholipid masses in these patients. Total colectomy with ileo-anal anastomosis does not seem to predispose to the formation of cholesterol gallstones.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8174991>Abnormal leukotriene C4 released by unaffected jejunal mucosa in patients with inactive Crohn's disease.</a></h2><p>The mucosal release of inflammatory mediators is enhanced in active inflammatory bowel disease. This study examines whether leukotriene C4 production occurs in apparently unaffected segments of the gut. The intraluminal release of leukotriene C4 was determined by jejunal perfusion in seven healthy controls, in nine patients with chronic ulcerative , and in 13 patients with Crohn's disease (six with ileal disease, and seven with only colonic). All patients were in clinical remission and none of them had evidence of jejunal involvement. Mild intraluminal irritation with a 2.5 mmol/l  solution was induced to stimulate local inflammatory mechanisms. The release of DNA (a marker of mucosal desquamation) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was simultaneously measured. Jejunal release of DNA was higher in Crohn's disease patients than in ulcerative  or healthy controls. Basal release of PGE2 was similar in the three groups of patients. Basal release of leukotriene C4 was considerably enhanced, however, in Crohn's disease patients compared with healthy controls. In ulcerative  patients, basal leukotriene C4 release was non-significantly different from controls. Bile  perfusion stimulated PGE2, leukotriene C4, and DNA release in all groups studied, but leukotriene C4 release was significantly higher in Crohn's disease patients. It is concluded that in inactive Crohn's disease there is an enhanced intraluminal release of leukotriene C4 in apparently unaffected segments of proximal small bowel, which may reflect fundamental changes in the function of the gut mucosal barrier.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23827861>Pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis and advances in diagnosis and management.</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), first described in the mid-1850s, is a complex liver disease that is heterogeneous in its presentation. PSC is characterized by chronic cholestasis associated with chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium, resulting in multifocal bile duct strictures that can affect the entire biliary tree. Chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis involving the hepatic parenchyma and biliary tree, which can lead to cirrhosis and malignancy. The etiology of PSC is not fully understood, which in part explains the lack of effective medical therapy for this condition. However, we have begun to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of PSC. The recognition of specific clinical subtypes and their pattern of progression could improve phenotypic and genotypic classification of the disease. We review our current understanding of this enigmatic disorder and discuss important topics for future studies.Copyright © 2013 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of taurohyodeoxycholic  (THDCA) isolated from Pulvis Fellis Suis on acute ulcerative  model induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS) in mice. The efficacy of THDCA was studied by macroscopical and histological scoring systems as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Serum levels, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 were assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in the colons was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. Treatment with THDCA in doses of 25, 50 and 100mg/kg/day and sulfasalazine in a dose of 500 mg/kg/day used as reference for 7 consecutive days after the induction of , significantly decreased colonic MPO activity, TNF-α, IL-6 serum levels and the expression of COX-2 in colon compared with TNBS induced ulcerative  model group. Moreover, THDCA attenuated the macroscopic colonic damage and the histopathological changes induced by TNBS. All the effects of these parameters were comparable to that of the standard sulfasalazine, especially at the highest dose level. The results suggested that THDCA from Pulvis Fellis Suis has a protective effect in TNBS-induced ulcerative  which might be due to its anti-inflammatory activities, and that it may have therapeutic value in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Mice were treated with vehicle or the FXR agonist INT-747, and  symptoms were assessed daily. Epithelial permeability assays and cytokine expression analysis were conducted in mouse colon and enterocyte-like cells (Caco-2/HT29) treated with medium or INT-747. Inflammatory cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA in various human immune cell types.INT-747-treated WT mice are protected from DSS- and TNBS-induced , as shown by significant reduction of body weight loss, epithelial permeability, rectal bleeding, colonic shortening, ulceration, inflammatory cell infiltration and goblet cell loss. Furthermore, Fxr activation in intestines of WT mice and differentiated enterocyte-like cells downregulates expression of key proinflammatory cytokines and preserves epithelial barrier function. INT-747 significantly decreases tumour necrosis factor α secretion in activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, purified CD14 monocytes and dendritic cells, as well as in lamina propria mononuclear cells from patients with IBD.FXR activation prevents chemically induced intestinal inflammation, with improvement of  symptoms, inhibition of epithelial permeability, and reduced goblet cell loss. Furthermore, FXR activation inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production in vivo in the mouse colonic mucosa, and ex vivo in different immune cell populations. The findings provide a rationale to explore FXR agonists as a novel therapeutic strategy for IBD.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634696>Calcium Pyruvate Exerts Beneficial Effects in an Experimental Model of Irritable Bowel Disease Induced by DCA in Rats.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by  (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27340129>Ursodeoxycholic  inhibits TNFα-induced IL-8 release from monocytes.</a></h2><p>Monocytes are critical to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as they infiltrate the mucosa and release cytokines that drive the inflammatory response. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a naturally occurring bile  with anti-inflammatory actions, has been proposed as a potential new therapy for IBD. However, its effects on monocyte function are not yet known. Primary monocytes from healthy volunteers or cultured U937 monocytes were treated with either the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα (5 ng/ml) or the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml) for 24 h, in the absence or presence of UDCA (25-100 μM). IL-8 release into the supernatant was measured by ELISA. mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR and changes in cell signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting. Toxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. UDCA treatment significantly attenuated TNFα-, but not LPS-driven, release of IL-8 from both primary and cultured monocytes. UDCA inhibition of TNFα-driven responses was associated with reduced IL-8 mRNA expression. Both TNFα and LPS stimulated NFκB activation in monocytes, while IL-8 release in response to both cytokines was attenuated by an NFκB inhibitor, BMS-345541. Interestingly, UDCA inhibited TNFα-, but not LPS-stimulated, NFκB activation. Finally, TNFα, but not LPS, induced phosphorylation of TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF2), while UDCA cotreatment attenuated this response. We conclude that UDCA specifically inhibits TNFα-induced IL-8 release from monocytes by inhibiting TRAF2 activation. Since such actions would serve to dampen mucosal immune responses in vivo, our data support the therapeutic potential of UDCA for IBD.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11197788>Paradoxical progression of biliary strictures against recovery of biochemical parameters under ursodeoxycholic  treatment in a case of primary sclerosing cholangitis with ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has been considered a rational therapy, though its effectiveness in the clinical course is still open to discussion.

There is no effective therapy. We, therefore, studied the safety and efficacy of ursodeoxycholic  in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis with or without additional ulcerative . In a 1-year ursodeoxycholic  treatment period, which preceded the controlled study period, ursodeoxycholic  was well tolerated in 22 of 24 patients with ulcerative  and in all three patients without ulcerative . In two patients with ulcerative  the dose of 750 mg ursodeoxycholic /day led to diarrhea, but following reduction of the dose to 500 and 250 mg/day ursodeoxycholic  was well tolerated.

The movement of the conjugates down the gastrointestinal tract and the anti-inflammatory effects on ulcerative  were investigated by administering the conjugates to guinea-pigs with an inflammatory bowel disease induced by 2% degraded carrageenan solution. The conjugates were protected from deconjugation in stomach and small intestine and reached the caecum and the colon, where 5-ASA was more easily liberated from 5-ASA-CDCA than from 5-ASA-UDCA. The conjugates at doses equivalent to 50 or 150 mg kg(-1) 5-ASA were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks from the 15th day after starting carrageenan treatment. The body weights and the bleeding scores of occult blood in faeces were measured during the experiment. The number of ulcers in the caecum and the colon were counted after killing the guinea-pigs at the end of the experiment. Rapid onset of efficacy was shown by a significant reduction in bleeding scores within a week after administration of the conjugates. Treatment with the lower dose of 5-ASA-CDCA showed a recovery of body weight and a significantly decreased number of ulcers in the caecum, and the ulcers in the colon had completely disappeared bythe end of the experiment. There was a good correlation found between the number of ulcers in the caecum and the bleeding scores of occult blood in faeces. The findings indicate that both conjugates were sufficiently delivered to the large intestine without deconjugation and that the lower dose of 5-ASA-CDCA is enough for treatment of ulcerative  in colonic inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16106402>Ursodeoxycholic  inhibits interleukin 1 beta [corrected] and -induced activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in human colon cancer cells.</a></h2><p> (DCA) has been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis in humans with effects on proliferation and apoptosis, mediated at least in part by activation of transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), activator protein 1 (AP-1) and protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is reported to reduce the frequency of colonic carcinogenesis in ulcerative  patients. Hence, we postulated that it might differ from DCA in its regulation of these transcription factors. The aim of the study was to determine effects of DCA and UDCA on NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation and explore its relationship to PKC. Human colonic tumour cell lines HCT116 were treated with DCA, UDCA, alone or pretreated with UDCA followed by DCA or IL-1beta. In other experiments, cells were pretreated with PKC inhibitors and then stimulated with DCA and IL-1beta or PMA. Gel shift assays were performed on nuclear extracts of the cells for NF-kappaB and AP-1 analysis. Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence were performed for Rel A (p65) and IkappaB-alpha levels on the treated cells. DCA increased NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA binding. UDCA did not increase DNA binding of NF-kappaB and AP-1 and UDCA pretreatment inhibited DCA-induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA binding. PKC inhibitors blocked DCA-induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. These results were validated by Western blot analysis for RelA and IkappaB-alpha. In conclusion, UDCA did not induce NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA binding but also blocked DCA-induced NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation. These findings suggest a possible mechanistic role for UDCA in blocking pathways thought to be involved in colon carcinogenesis.Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084077>Accumulation of HLA-DR4 in Colonic Epithelial Cells Causes Severe  in Homozygous HLA-DR4 Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Homozygous HLA-DR4/I-E transgenic mice (tgm) spontaneously developed  similar to human ulcerative .

During treatment of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis with ursodeoxycholic , plasma concentrations of some endogenous bile acids decrease. To test whether the changes in plasma bile acids are due to decreases of their pool sizes or synthesis rates, we determined bile  kinetics of cholic and chenodeoxycholic  in six patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, of whom four also had ulcerative . All patients were studied before and 3 mo after the start of ursodeoxycholic  treatment. Six healthy subjects served as controls.

Fractional turnover and synthesis of cholic  increased significantly after ursodeoxycholic  administration. Fractional turnover of chenodeoxycholic  also increased significantly, whereas synthesis of this bile  was unchanged. Our data indicate that in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, pool sizes of bile acids are reduced.

Moreover, the effect of DCA on inflammasome activation is mainly mediated through bile  receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2); however, the intermediate process remains unclear. Here, we sought to explore the detailed molecular mechanism involved and examine the effect of S1PR2 blockage in a  mouse model. In this study, we found that DCA could dose dependently upregulate S1PR2 expression. Meanwhile, DCA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation is at least partially achieved through stimulating extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathway downstream of S1PR2 followed by promoting of lysosomal cathepsin B release. DCA enema significantly aggravated DSS-induced  in mice and S1PR2 inhibitor as well as inflammasome inhibition by cathepsin B antagonist substantially reducing the mature IL-1 production and alleviated colonic inflammation superimposed by DCA. Therefore, our findings suggest that S1PR2/ERK1/2/cathepsin B signaling plays a critical role in triggering inflammasome activation by DCA and S1PR2 may represent a new potential therapeutic target for the management of intestinal inflammation in individuals on a high-fat diet.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/527881>Bile  studies in patients with Crohn's .</a></h2><p>Bile  studies were performed in patients with Crohn's disease, radiologically confined to the colon.

Both duration and extent of UC are important risk factors for CRC, as is the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of CRC, and (in some studies) early age at diagnosis of UC. Efforts to reduce this risk have focused on colonoscopic surveillance as the best alternative to the more definitive, but less appealing, approach of prophylactic colectomy. However, spurred on by findings in the sporadic CRC literature, there has been a growing interest in a possible role for chemoprevention of CRC in patients with UC.Published evidence to date indicates that 5-aminosalicylic  agents are protective against the development of dysplasia and CRC. Oral, but not topical, steroids also appear to be chemoprotective, but their chronic use cannot be recommended for this indication. Ursodeoxycholic  has been shown to reduce the risk of neoplasia in UC patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.

It is progressive in most patients and leads to cirrhosis. It is a rare disease, mostly affecting people of northern European descent, males greater than females. The diagnosis is best established by contrast cholangiography, which reveals a characteristic picture of diffuse, multifocal strictures and focal dilation of the bile ducts, leading to a beaded appearance. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is present in ~75% of the patients with PSC, mostly ulcerative  (~85% of the cases). In addition to biliary cirrhosis, complications of PSC include dominant strictures of the bile ducts, cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, colon dysplasia and cancer in patients with IBD, gallbladder polyps and cancer, and hepatic osteodystrophy. The etiology of PSC is not clear, but studies are ongoing. The median survival without liver transplantation is 12 to 15 years after diagnosis. Currently there are no effective treatments except liver transplantation. Immunosuppressive medications have not been shown to be effective but antibiotics and anti-fibrotic agents seem promising.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Blood was sampled hourly until 8 h afterwards. Serum FGF19 and bile salt excursions were determined. Serum levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), reflecting bile salt synthesis, were measured as a biomarker of FGF19 response.Baseline serum FGF19 levels were comparable between groups, while fasted bile salt levels in PSC patients were elevated. Upon CDCA challenge, HC and PBC patients showed a serum FGF19 peak after 4 h followed by a decline. PSC patients showed a prolonged and elevated serum FGF19 response up to 8 h, combined with a sustained serum elevation of CDCA and other bile salts. In general, C4 levels declined following FGF19 elevation. In PSC patients with less favorable prognosis, baseline C4 levels were drastically suppressed and did not further decline.Following an oral CDCA challenge, PSC patients showed an impaired clearance of CDCA and a prolonged serum FGF19 response.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

Liver damage is believed to result from ductal cholestasis, but only 30% of patients with CF develop liver defects, indicating that another factor is involved. We studied the effects of CFTR deficiency on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated responses of the biliary epithelium to endotoxins.Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce  in C57BL/6J-Cftrtm1Unc (Cftr-KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. Ductular reaction and portal inflammation were quantified by keratin-19 and CD45 immunolabeling. Cholangiocytes isolated from wild-type and Cftr-KO mice were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS); cytokine secretion was quantified. Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), phosphorylation of TLR4, and activity of Src were determined. HEK-293 that expressed the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter and human TLR4 were transfected with CFTR complementary DNAs.DSS-induced  caused biliary damage and portal inflammation only in Cftr-KO mice. Biliary damage and inflammation were not attenuated by restoring biliary secretion with 24-nor-ursodeoxycholic  but were significantly reduced by oral neomycin and polymyxin B, indicating a pathogenetic role of gut-derived bacterial products. Cftr-KO cholangiocytes incubated with LPS secreted significantly higher levels of cytokines regulated by TLR4 and NF-κB. LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB was blocked by the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. TLR4 phosphorylation by Src was significantly increased in Cftr-KO cholangiocytes. Expression of wild-type CFTR in the HEK293 cells stimulated with LPS reduced activation of NF-κB.CFTR deficiency alters the innate immunity of the biliary epithelium and reduces its tolerance to endotoxin, resulting in an Src-dependent inflammatory response mediated by TLR4 and NF-κB.

The aim of this proof of the concept study was to explore the possible preventive/reverting effects of UDCA in patients with colorectal IBD with existing findings of low grade dysplasia and/or DNA-aneuploidy.Nineteen patients (13 UC, 6 CD, median age 43 years) with long-standing, extensive IBD (median duration 21 years), with previous findings of low-grade dysplasia and/or DNA-aneuploidy, were randomized to receive either UDCA (500 mg b.i.d) (n=10) or placebo (n=9) in a controlled, double-blind, two-year study. Colonoscopy with multiple biopsies for histopathology and for DNA-flow cytometry was performed at the start and at six-month intervals during the study period. The primary outcome was the need for colectomy due to progression of dysplasia. Changes in dysplasia and DNA-aneuploidy scores were also assessed.There were no significant differences in the overall composed score between the two groups, either at study start or during the study period. In the placebo group one patient had a progression of dysplasia into high-grade and one patient developed DALM with low-grade dysplasia; both had a colectomy. In contrast, no UDCA-treated patient had progression of dysplasia.UDCA may prevent further progression of manifest low-grade dysplasia in colorectal IBD.

In addition, we have previously shown an important role for COX-produced prostanoids in recovery of ischaemic-injured equine jejunum. It was hypothesised that the nonselective COX inhibitor flunixin would retard repair of bile-injured colon by preventing production of reparative prostaglandins, whereas the selective COX-2 inhibitor, etodolac would not inhibit repair as a result of continued COX-1 activity. Segments of the pelvic flexure were exposed to 1.5 mmol/l deoxycholate for 30 min, after which they were recovered for 4 h in Ussing chambers. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis, recovery of bile-injured colonic mucosa was not affected by flunixin or etodolac, despite significantly depressed prostanoid production. However, treatment of control tissue with flunixin led to increases in mucosal permeability, whereas treatment with etodolac had no significant effect. Therefore, although recovery from bile-induced colonic injury maybe independent of COX-elaborated prostanoids, treatment of control tissues with nonselective COX inhibitors may lead to marked increases in permeability.

Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a secondary bile  with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile  transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile  transporters apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile  transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile  homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile  transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile  homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental , we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310532>Tauroursodeoxycholic  inhibits experimental  by preventing early intestinal epithelial cell death.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative  (UC) is characterized by increased epithelial cell death and subsequent breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which perpetuates chronic intestinal inflammation.

We identified the prevention of colonic caspase-3 induction, a key proapoptotic marker which was also over-activated in UC, as the earliest event resulting in a clear clinical benefit. Whereas vehicle-treated mice showed a cumulative mortality of 40%, all TUDCA-treated mice survived the DSS experiment during a 14-day follow-up period. In line with a barrier protective effect, TUDCA decreased bacterial translocation to the spleen and stimulated mucin production. Similarly, TUDCA inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal permeability and associated enterocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in vitro by a dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (using tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand) and receptor-independent (staurosporine) caspase-3 induction in HT29 colonic epithelial cells.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, lithocholic , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21366635>Low levels of bile acids increase bacterial uptake in colonic biopsies from patients with collagenous  in remission.</a></h2><p>Patients with collagenous  have an impaired mucosal barrier.

The aim is to treat patients as early as possible to prevent progression to the advanced stages of the disease. During treatment with UDCA, stenoses of major ducts may develop, and early endoscopic dilation is highly effective.

UDCA is able to inhibit tumor development in azoxymethane and in dextran-related  models. In high-risk populations such as subjects with previous colorectal adenoma removal or inflammatory bowel disease, five out of 10 published studies suggested beneficial effects with UDCA on colonic carcinogenesis. In the azoxymethane model, UDCA inhibited tumor development by counteracting the tumor-promoting effects of secondary bile acids such as  (DCA). The opposing effects of UDCA and DCA on lipid raft composition may be central to their effects on colonic tumorigenesis. Differential effects of DCA and UDCA on growth factor and inflammatory signals involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and COX-2 expression, very likely mediate their opposing effects on colonic tumor promotion and tumor inhibition, respectively.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the ontogeny of dysfunctional neutrophil during septic  remain poorly understood. We report that the dysfunctional neutrophil may be derived by the suppression of Toll-interacting-protein (Tollip). We observed that Tollip deficient neutrophils had compromised migratory capacity toward bacterial product fMLF due to reduced activity of AKT and reduction of FPR2, reduced potential to generate bacterial-killing neutrophil extra-cellular trap (NET), and compromised bacterial killing activity. On the other hand, Tollip deficient neutrophils had elevated levels of CCR5, responsible for their homing to sterile inflamed tissues. The inflamed and incompetent neutrophil phenotype was also observed in vivo in Tollip deficient mice subjected to DSS-induced . We observed that TUDCA, a compound capable of restoring Tollip cellular function, can potently alleviate the severity of DSS-induced . In humans, we observed significantly reduced Tollip levels in peripheral blood collected from human  patients as compared to blood samples from healthy donors.

To obtain more precise information on concomitant involvement of the pancreatic duct system, a comparatively large group of 44 patients was studied.Between 1989 and 1995, 44 patients took part in a study of the therapeutic effect of ursodeoxycholic , and their data were analyzed. In 42 of the 44 patients, both the pancreatic and biliary system were visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).Pancreas divisum was detected in four patients (9.5%) with an otherwise normal major pancreatic duct. Three (7.1%) patients had pancreatic duct changes of the type seen in chronic pancreatitis. When risk factors such as alcohol abuse were excluded, there was only one patient with PSC and pancreatic duct alterations.In PSC patients, the prevalence of chronic pancreatitis is low.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9717724>Synthesis and intestinal metabolism of ursodeoxycholic  conjugate with an antiinflammatory agent, 5-aminosalicylic .</a></h2><p>5-Aminosalicylic  conjugate of ursodeoxycholic  was synthesized in above 90% yield by adding a basic solution of 5-aminosalicylic  into the mixed anhydride formed with ursodeoxycholic  and ethyl chloroformate.

One of the processes underlying the chemopreventive action could be the inhibition of proliferation by UDCA. To clarify the antiproliferative mechanism of UDCA, we used p53 wt colon carcinoma cell lines HCT8 and HCT116. UDCA-induced inhibition of proliferation was reversible and was associated with a decrease of the S-phase and an increase of G1 phase population, but not with apoptosis or senescence. The treatment suppressed the expression of c-Myc protein and, as a consequence, of several cell cycle regulatory molecules, including CDK4 and CDK6. Using the HCT8 cell line as a model, we show that UDCA suppresses c-Myc at the protein level. The suppression of c-Myc alone or a simultaneous suppression of CDK4 and of CDK6 kinase is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation. In sum, we identified c-Myc as a primary UDCA target in colon carcinoma cells. The degradation of c-Myc protein decreases the expression of the cell cycle regulators CDK4 and CDK6, which reversibly slows down the cell cycle. The suppression of these proproliferatory molecules is the likely initial mechanism of antiproliferatory action of UDCA on colon cancer cells.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29874428>CANCERPREVENTIVE IN ULCERATIVE .</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an actual problem today And it occurs 6 times more frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) than in healthy population. CRC in IBD patients is more aggressive and needs total colectomy, which leads to permanent disability That is why canceroprevention is one of the key goals of IBD treatment. The aim of this review is to overview actual pathogenesis pathways of CRC in IBD and methods of chemoprevention. In this review we describe risk factors of CRC, which can be summarized as aggressive disease and chronic inflammation and are based on pathogenesis of CRC. That is the reason why methods of chemoprevention needs to influence on inflammation and other pathogenesis pathways.

Using the PubMed database, a literature search was conducted for relevant articles in English from the past 10 years. Relevant studies investigating PSC as a risk factor for CRC in IBD in the context of incidence and prevalence, pathogenesis, prevention and prognosis were included in this review. Recent evidence increasingly points to PSC as a significant risk factor in the development of CRC in patients with concomitant IBD. PSC may be an important risk factor for CRC in different populations worldwide. The mechanism for this increase in risk is still unclear. The efficacy of UDCA as a chemopreventive agent remains controversial. Liver transplantation does not halt the development of CRC, although there is not enough evidence to suggest that it is associated with increased incidence of CRC. While routine colonoscopic surveillance should be performed in patients with concurrent PSC and IBD, more high-level evidence is required to support the benefits of the procedure. While many new developments have taken place in the last decade, the pathogenesis and optimal management of CRC development in IBD-PSC patients remain unclear.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1667392>Serum bile acids in relation to disease activity and intake of dietary fibers in juvenile ulcerative .</a></h2><p>Serum concentrations of primary bile acids were determined at different disease activities in juvenile ulcerative  and in healthy age-matched controls. In patients with ulcerative  in clinical remission, serum levels of bile acids were also studied after long-term intake (6 months) of dietary fibers (wheat fiber and ispaghula, respectively) in a double-blind randomized cross-over study. Blood samples were taken in the morning after an overnight fasting and for 4 h postprandially after a standardized test meal. Determinations of bile acids were made by radioimmunoassays. Patients with total  in the active phase had significantly higher serum levels of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids 4 h postprandially compared with control children. After long-term intake of ispaghula, significantly higher (although not different from controls) serum levels of cholic  were found 2 and 3 h postprandially, whereas wheat fibers did not affect serum bile  concentrations. These results may suggest an increased absorption of unconjugated bile acids in the diseased colon and a minimal influence of dietary fibers on serum bile  concentrations.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29610171>Autoimmune Pancreatitis and Ulcerative Rectocolitis in an Adolescent.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is rare in teenagers and difficult to diagnose. There are no clear and established diagnostic criteria in the pediatric population to distinguish subtype 1 and subtype 2. Here, we report the case of a 16-year-old white French teenager admitted to the pediatric emergency service with more than 1 year's history of pain originating from the epigastric and the right hypochondriac regions, with bloody diarrhea. After exclusion of pancreatic cancer and other common causes of acute pancreatitis, the diagnosis of AIP was suspected. Biological analyses revealed acute pancreatitis with severe cholestasis and an elevated level of serum immunoglobulin G4. Magnetic resonance cholangiography revealed a voluminous pancreas presenting a typical "sausage-like" aspect. Anatomopathological analyses of the liver biopsy specimen revealed a biliary obstruction due to pancreatic involvement without the typical aspect of chronic destructive cholangitis. Corticotherapy and immunosuppressive treatment proved effective after 1 week of treatment. Without a pancreatic biopsy specimen, the distinction between AIP type 1 and 2 could not be made clearly in this case. The succession of clinical observations could allow clinicians to recognize, treat, and manage AIP in children.Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965665> Triggers NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Aggravates DSS-Induced  in Mice.</a></h2><p>A westernized high-fat diet (HFD) is associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). High-level fecal  (DCA) caused by HFD contributes to the colonic inflammatory injury of IBD; however, the mechanism concerning the initiation of inflammatory response by DCA remains unclear. In this study, we sought to investigate the role and mechanism of DCA in the induction of inflammation  promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here, we, for the first time, showed that DCA dose-dependently induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and highly pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-1β production in macrophages. Mechanistically, DCA-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting cathepsin B release at least partially through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2. Colorectal instillation of DCA significantly increased mature IL-1β level in colonic tissue and exacerbated DSS-induced , while  blockage of NLRP3 inflammasome or macrophage depletion dramatically reduced the mature IL-1β production and ameliorated the aggravated inflammatory injury imposed by DCA. Thus, our findings show that high-level fecal DCA may serve as an endogenous danger signal to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and contribute to HFD-related colonic inflammation. NLRP3 inflammasome may represent a new potential therapeutical target for treatment of IBD.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941372>Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer: feasibility in everyday practice?</a></h2><p>Chemoprevention means the use of agents to prevent, delay, or reverse carcinogenesis. This review was designed to critically discuss the most promising agents in colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention. Aspirin is the best studied chemopreventive agent for CRC. Optimal chemoprevention requires long-term use and high dose of aspirin that may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may also be candidates for chemoprevention. The regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, causes adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of cardiovascular events. In patients with ulcerative  5-aminosalicylates reduce the risk of CRC and dysplasia. Ursodeoxycholic  can reduce the risk of dysplasia or CRC in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative . Current data are insufficient to support the use of hormone replacement therapy to reduce the risk of CRC. Statins may have chemopreventive effects, but further investigation of their overall benefits in preventing CRC is warranted. Antioxidant supplements cannot prevent CRC. The usefulness of selenium, folate, calcium, and vitamin D awaits further evaluation. Chemoprevention cannot yet be accepted as standard medical practice. Use of chemopreventive agents cannot be a substitute for colorectal surveillance.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047703>Higher fecal bile  hydrophobicity is associated with exacerbation of dextran sodium sulfate  in mice.</a></h2><p>Increased luminal bile  hydrophobicity is associated with cytotoxicity and has been suggested to contribute to gut barrier dysfunction. The aim of this study was to compare 2 high-fat diets and a low-fat diet as to whether they modify fecal bile  profile and hydrophobicity and/or susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)  in C57Bl/6J mice. Control and DSS-Control groups received a low-fat control diet [5.5% of total energy (E%) soy oil, 4.5 E% lard], and the DSS-Lard (5.5 E% soy oil, 54.5 E% lard) and DSS-Fish oil (5.5 E% soy oil, 27.2 E% lard and 27.2% menhaden oil) groups received high-fat diets. Feces for bile  analysis were collected after 3-wk feeding, followed by induction of dextran DSS  (2 d 5% DSS in drinking water + 2 d tap water). Fecal bile  hydrophobicity was elevated 76% in the lard group (P = 0.051) and 122% in the fish oil group (P = 0.001) compared with control, indicating potentially increased cytotoxicity. DSS caused severe  symptoms, evaluated as rectal bleeding, whereas all the controls were symptom free. The median symptom scores were: DSS-Control, 2.3 (IQR = 0.6, 3.0); DSS-Lard, 0.3 (IQR = 0, 2.3); and DSS-Fish oil, 2.4 (IQR = 1.9, 2.8). The only differences were DSS-Control vs. control (P < 0.001) and DSS-Fish oil vs. control (P < 0.001). Severity of symptoms in all colitic mice was positively correlated with fecal bile  hydrophobicity (Spearman's ρ = 0.43; P = 0.028) and fecal  concentration (Spearman's ρ = 0.39; P = 0.048).

Patients with Crohn's  (CC) exhibit reduced ileal FXR target gene expression. FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate inflammation in murine  models. We here explore the feasibility of pharmacological FXR activation in CC.Nine patients with quiescent CC and 12 disease controls were treated with the FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA; 15 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. Ileal FXR activation was assessed in the fasting state during 6 hrs after the first CDCA dose and on day 8, by quantification of serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19. Since FGF19 induces gallbladder (GB) refilling in murine models, we also determined concurrent GB volumes by ultrasound. On day 8 ileal and cecal biopsies were obtained and FXR target gene expression was determined.At baseline, FGF19 levels were not different between CC and disease controls. After the first CDCA dose, there were progressive increases of FGF19 levels and GB volumes during the next 6 hours in CC patients and disease controls (FGF19: 576 resp. 537% of basal; GB volumes: 190 resp. 178% of basal) without differences between both groups, and a further increase at day 8. In comparison with a separate untreated control group, CDCA affected FXR target gene expression in both CC and disease controls, without differences between both groups.Pharmacological activation of FXR is feasible in patients with CC. These data provide a rationale to explore the anti-inflammatory properties of pharmacological activation of FXR in these patients.TrialRegister.nl NTR2009.</p><p>Keyword: colitis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7483687>[Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)--humoral immune phenomena, pathogenetic aspects and therapeutic possibilities].</a></h2><p>There are about 80% antibodies in PSC against cytoplasmatic antigens of neutrophilic granulocytes of the perinuclear type (pANCA), inconstantly there are antinuclear antibodies (ANA) too, but no antimitochondrial antibodies.
