Protecting endothelial cells from endoplasmic reticulum stress is a crucial strategies to combate these diseases. The goal of this study was to explore the effect of Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on tunicamycin-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.All studies were performed in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with tunicamycin with or without Exendin-4 pretreatment. Markers of cell viability and apoptosis were assessed in all cells, as well as the protein expression levels of IRE1α (inositol requiring enzyme-1а), p-IRE1α, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), p-JNK, and caspase-3.Following tunicamycin administration, human umbilical vein endothelial cells viability was gradually reduced in a dose-dependent manner, and fluorescence microscopy confirmed that tunicamycin was inducing human umbilical vein endothelial cells apoptosis. This apoptotic effect was attenuated by Exendin-4 pretreatment. Similarly, the ratio of p-IRE1α/IRE1α, p-JNK/JNK and active caspase-3/procaspase-3 were increased by tunicamycin (10 μg/ml); an effect that was counteracted by Exendin-4. The effect of exendin-4 was similar to that of the anti-endoplasmic reticulum stress agent,  (TUDCA).This study demonstrates that Exendin-4 can protect human umbilical vein endothelial cells from tunicamycin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, our data suggests that the mechanism for this effect is mediated by inhibiting the IRE1α/JNK/caspase-3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797574>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell donors with a high body mass index display elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress and are functionally impaired.</a></h2><p>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are promising candidates for regenerative medicine purposes. The effect of obesity on the function of BM-MSCs is currently unknown. Here, we assessed how obesity affects the function of BM-MSCs and the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) therein. BM-MSCs were obtained from healthy donors with a normal (<25) or high (>30) body mass index (BMI). High-BMI BM-MSCs displayed severely impaired osteogenic and diminished adipogenic differentiation, decreased proliferation rates, increased senescence, and elevated expression of ER stress-related genes ATF4 and CHOP. Suppression of ER stress using  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) resulted in partial recovery of osteogenic differentiation capacity, with a significant increase in the expression of ALPL and improvement in the UPR. These data indicate that BMI is important during the selection of BM-MSC donors for regenerative medicine purposes and that application of high-BMI BM-MSCs with TUDCA or 4-PBA may improve stem cell function. However, whether this improvement can be translated into an in vivo clinical advantage remains to be assessed.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29475944>Hepatic loss of  () induces fatty liver and accelerates liver tumorigenesis in mice.</a></h2><p>The liver is a major organ in lipid , and its malfunction leads to various diseases. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common chronic liver disorder in developed countries, is characterized by the abnormal retention of excess lipid within hepatocytes and predisposes individuals to liver cancer. We previously reported that the levels of Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1, also known as PAFAH1B1) are down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Following up on this observation, we found that genetic deletion of  in the mouse liver increases lipid accumulation and inflammation in this organ. Further analysis revealed that loss of  triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduces triglyceride secretion. Attenuation of ER stress by addition of  (TUDCA) diminished lipid accumulation in the -deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, the Golgi stacks were disorganized in -deficient liver cells. Of note, the  liver-knockout mice exhibited increased hepatocyte ploidy and accelerated development of liver cancer after exposure to the liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced  levels can spur the development of liver diseases from steatosis to liver cancer and provide a useful model for delineating the molecular  that lead to these diseases.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30765332>The Food Additive Maltodextrin Promotes Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Driven Mucus Depletion and Exacerbates Intestinal Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Food additives, such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, or bulking agents, are present in the Western diet and their consumption is increasing. However, little is known about their potential effects on intestinal homeostasis. In this study we examined the effect of some of these food additives on gut inflammation.Mice were given drinking water containing maltodextrin (MDX), propylene glycol, or animal gelatin, and then challenged with dextran sulfate sodium or indomethacin. In parallel, mice fed a MDX-enriched diet were given the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor  (TUDCA). Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, mucin-2 expression, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase quantification, and H&E staining was performed on colonic tissues. Mucosa-associated microbiota composition was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. For the in vitro experiments, murine intestinal crypts and the human mucus-secreting HT29-methotrexate treated cell line were stimulated with MDX in the presence or absence of TUDCA or a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor.Diets enriched in MDX, but not propylene glycol or animal gelatin, exacerbated intestinal inflammation in both models. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the detrimental effect of MDX showed up-regulation of inositol requiring protein 1β, a sensor of ER stress, in goblet cells, and a reduction of mucin-2 expression with no significant change in mucosa-associated microbiota. Stimulation of murine intestinal crypts and HT29-methotrexate treated cell line cells with MDX induced inositol requiring protein 1β via a p38 MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Treatment of mice with TUDCA prevented mucin-2 depletion and attenuated colitis in MDX-fed mice.MDX increases ER stress in gut epithelial cells with the downstream effect of reducing mucus production and enhancing colitis susceptibility.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Abnormal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress participates in many heart diseases, but its role in viral myocarditis remains unsolved.We investigated the influence of ER stress in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis by dynamically detecting its activation in CVB3-infected hearts, analyzing its association with myocarditis severity, and exploring its impact on disease development by modulating the strength of ER stress with the chemical activator tunicamycin (Tm) or the inhibitor  (TUDCA). The underlying signal pathway of ER stress in CVB3-induced myocarditis was also deciphered.We found that myocardial expression of Grp78 and Grp94, 2 ER stress markers, was significantly increased after CVB3 infection and positively correlated with myocarditis severity. Consistently, Tm-augmented ER stress obviously aggravated myocarditis, as shown by more severe myocardial inflammation, reduced cardiac function, and a lower survival rate, whereas TUDCA decreased ER stress and obviously alleviated myocarditis. This pathologic effect of ER stress could be attributed to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) production through the IRE1-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB) pathway.ER stress accentuated CVB3-induced myocardial inflammation through the IRE1-associated NF-κB pathway. This study may help us understand the role of ER stress in viral myocarditis and promote the development of corresponding therapeutic strategies based on manipulating ER stress.Copyright © 2015 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Previous work has shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and SMC apoptosis were increased both in a mouse model and human thoracic aortic aneurysm. However, whether the ER stress is activated in AAA formation and whether suppressing ER stress attenuates AAA is unknown.Human AAA and control aorta samples were collected. Expression of ER stress chaperones glucose-regulated protein (GRP)-78 and GRP-94 was detected by immunohistochemical staining. The effect of ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) on AAA formation in angiotensin (Ang) II induced apolipoprotein E mice was explored. Elastin staining was used to observe the rupture of elastic fragmentation. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed, to detect the protein expression of ER stress chaperones and apoptosis molecules.There was significant upregulation of GRP-78 and GRP-94 in aneurysmal areas of human AAA and Ang II induced ApoE mice (p < .05). TUDCA significantly attenuated the maximum diameters of abdominal aortas in Ang II induced ApoE mice (p < .05). TUDCA significantly reduced expression of ER stress chaperones and the apoptotic cell numbers (p < .05). Furthermore, TUDCA significantly reduced expression of apoptosis molecules, such as caspase-3, caspase-12, C/EBP homologous protein, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activating transcription factor 4, X-box binding protein, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α in Ang II induced ApoE mice (p < .05).The results suggest that ER stress is involved in human and Ang II induced AAA formation in ApoE mice.

(TUDCA) is known as safe cell-protective agent in disorders associated with apoptosis. We aimed to investigate the protective effects of TUDCA against gentamicin-induced ototoxicity. House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1(HEI-OC1) cells and explanted cochlear tissue were treated with gentamicin and TUDCA, followed by serial analyses including cell viability assay, hair cell staining, qPCR, ELISA and western blotting to determine the cell damage by the parameters relevant to cell apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. TUDCA significantly attenuated gentamicin-induced cell damage in cultured HEI-OC1 cells and explanted cochlear hair cells. TUDCA alleviated gentamicin-induced cell apoptosis, supported by the decreased Bax/Bcl2 ratio compared with that of gentamicin treated alone. TUDCA decreased gentamicin-induced nitric oxide production and protein nitration in both models. In addition, TUDCA suppressed gentamicin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress as reflected by inversing the expression levels of Binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip), CCAAT/-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and Caspase 3. TUDCA attenuated gentamicin-induced hair cell death by inhibiting protein nitration activation and ER stress, providing new insights into the new potential therapies for sensorineural deafness.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ER stress induces the unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. Inflammation is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear which PRRs have a major role in inducing inflammation during ER stress. Here we show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are important mediators of ER-stress-induced inflammation in mouse and human cells. The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion. Inflammation and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor. The association of NOD1 and NOD2 with pro-inflammatory responses induced by the IRE1α/TRAF2 signalling pathway provides a novel link between innate immunity and ER-stress-induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214655>Calorie-induced ER stress suppresses uroguanylin satiety signaling in diet-induced obesity.</a></h2><p>The uroguanylin-GUCY2C gut-brain axis has emerged as one component regulating feeding, energy homeostasis, body mass and . Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying obesity was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of obesity, as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation of receptor sensitivity, obesity may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174230>Palmitate induces cisternal ER expansion via the activation of XBP-1/CCTα-mediated phospholipid accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces ER expansion. The expansion of the intracisternal space of the ER was found in macrophages associated with human atherosclerotic lesions. We also previously reported that palmitate induces cisternal ER expansion and necrosis in RAW 264.7 cells. In this study, we report on an investigation of the likely mechanism responsible for this palmitate-induced cisternal ER expansion in a mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 cells.RAW 264.7 cells were pre-treated with the designated inhibitor or siRNA, followed by treatment with palmitate. Changes in the ER structure were examined by transmission electron microscopy. The induction of ER stress was confirmed by an increase in the extent of phosphorylation of PERK, the expression of BiP and CHOP, and the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA. Phospholipid staining was performed with the LipidTOX Red phospholipidosis detection reagent. Related gene expressions were detected by quantitative real time-RT-PCR or RT-PCR.Palmitate was found to induce ER stress and cisternal ER expansion. In addition, palmitate-induced cisternal ER expansion was attenuated by ER stress inhibitors, such as 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) and  (TUDCA). The findings also show that palmitate induced-mRNA expression of CCTα, which increases phospholipid synthesis, was attenuated by the down-regulation of XBP-1, a part of ER stress. Furthermore, palmitate-induced phospholipid accumulation and cisternal ER expansion were attenuated by the down-regulation of XBP-1 or CCTα.The findings reported herein indicate that palmitate-induced cisternal ER expansion is dependent on the activation of XBP-1/CCTα-mediated phospholipid accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336924>Rtn1a-Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Podocyte Injury and Diabetic Nephropathy.</a></h2><p>We previously reported a critical role of reticulon (RTN) 1A in mediating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in kidney tubular cells and the expression of RTN1A correlates with the renal function and the severity of kidney injury in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Here, we determined the roles of RTN1A and ER stress in podocyte injury and DN. We used db/db mice with early unilateral nephrectomy (Unx) as a murine model of progressive DN and treated mice with  (TUDCA), a specific inhibitor of ER stress. We found increased expression of RTN1A and ER stress markers in the kidney of db/db-Unx mice. Treatment of TUDCA not only attenuated proteinuria and kidney histological changes, but also ameliorated podocyte and glomeruli injury in diabetic mice, which were associated with reduction of RTN1A and ER stress marker expression in the podocytes of TUDCA-treated mice. In vitro, we showed RTN1A mediates albumin-induced ER stress and apoptosis in human podocytes. A positive feedback loop between RTN1A and CHOP was found leading to an enhanced ER stress in podocytes. Our data suggest that ER stress plays a major role in podocyte injury in DN and RTN1A might be a key regulator of ER stress in podocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696534>Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress by Cadmium and Its Regulation on Nrf2 Signaling Pathway in Kidneys of Rats.</a></h2><p>This study was conducted to investigate the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress on Nrf2 signaling pathway in the kidneys of rats.Rats were divided into twelve groups of six animals each. Some groups were pre-administered with bacitracin or  (TUDCA), and all of them were treated with 5-20 μmol/kg cadmium (Cd) for 48 h. The oxidative stress levels were analyzed using kits. The mRNA and protein expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related factors and Nrf2 signaling pathway-related factors were determined using RT-PCR and western blot.Cd exposure resulted in oxidative stress in the kidneys of rats and upregulated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors and Nrf2 signaling pathway-related factors, especially at doses of 10 and 20 μmol/kg Cd, and the expression changes were particularly obvious. Moreover, after pretreatment with bacitracin, Cd upregulated the expression of ERS-related factors to a certain extent and, at higher doses, increased the mRNA expression of Nrf2. After pretreatment with TUDCA, Cd reduced the level of ERS to a certain extent; however, at these doses, there were no significant changes in the expression of Nrf2.Cadmium can result in ERS and oxidative stress in the kidneys of rats, activate Nrf2, and upregulate the transcriptional expression of phase II detoxification enzymes under these experimental conditions. ERS has a positive regulation effect on Nrf2 signaling pathway but has little effect on the negative regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway in cadmium toxicity.Copyright © 2019 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

Women with GDM had 2 h serum glucose levels > 9.0 mmol/l following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and were treated with diet and insulin when necessary. Western blotting was used to assess markers of ER stress. To test the effects of hyperglycaemia on the generation of ER stress, a new trophoblast-like cell line, BeWo-NG, was generated by culturing in a physiological glucose concentration of 5.5 mmol/l (over 20 passages) before challenging with 10 or 20 mmol/l glucose.All GDM patients were well-controlled (HbA1c 5.86 ± 0.55% or 40.64 ± 5.85 mmol/mol, n = 11). Low-grade ER stress was observed in the placental samples, with dilation of ER cisternae and increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit α. Challenge of BeWo-NG with high glucose activated the same , but this was as a result of acidosis of the culture medium rather than the glucose concentration per se. Addition of chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate and  and vitamins C and E ameliorated the ER stress.This is the first report of placental ER stress in GDM patients.

Increased activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-unfolded protein response (UPR) are independently reported to partake in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification in CKD. However, the association between mTORC1 activity and ER stress-UPR remains unknown. We report here that components of the uremic state [activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and hyperphosphatemia] potentiate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification by inducing persistent and exaggerated activity of mTORC1. This gives rise to prolonged and excessive ER stress-UPR as well as attenuated levels of sestrin 1 ( Sesn1) and Sesn3 feeding back to inhibit mTORC1 activity. Activating transcription factor 4 arising from the UPR mediates cell death via expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (c/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), impairs the generation of pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of mineralization, and potentiates VSMC transdifferentiation to the osteochondrocytic phenotype. Short-term treatment of CKD mice with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1, or , a bile acid that restores ER homeostasis, normalized mTORC1 activity, molecular markers of UPR, and calcium content of aortas. Collectively, these data highlight that increased and/or protracted mTORC1 activity arising from the uremic state leads to dysregulated ER stress-UPR and VSMC calcification. Manipulation of the mTORC1-ER stress-UPR pathway opens up new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of vascular calcification in CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562747>Intermittent-Hypoxia-Induced Autophagy Activation Through the ER-Stress-Related PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 Pathway is a Protective Response to Pancreatic β-Cell Apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Intermittent hypoxia (IH) causes apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells, but the potential mechanisms remain unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy, and apoptosis are interlocked in an extensive crosstalk. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the contributions of ER stress and autophagy to IH-induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis.We established animal and cell models of IH, and then inhibited autophagy and ER stress by pharmacology and small interfering RNA (siRNA) in INS-1 cells and rats. The levels of biomarkers for autophagy, ER stress, and apoptosis were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. The number of autophagic vacuoles was observed by transmission electron microscopy.IH induced autophagy activation both in vivo and in vitro, as evidenced by increased autophagic vacuole formation and LC3 turnover, and decreased SQSTM1 level. The levels of ER-stress-related proteins, including GRP78, CHOP, caspase 12, phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), p-eIF2α, and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) were increased under IH conditions. Inhibition of ER stress with  or 4-phenylbutyrate partially blocked IH-induced autophagy in INS-1 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PERK with GSK2606414 or siRNA blocked the ERstress-related PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 signaling pathway and inhibited autophagy induced by IH, which indicates that IH-induced autophagy activation is dependent on this signaling pathway. Promoting autophagy with rapamycin alleviated IH-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine or autophagy-related gene (Atg5 and Atg7) siRNA aggravated pancreatic β-cell apoptosis caused by IH.IH induces autophagy activation through the ER-stress-related PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 signaling pathway, which is a protective response to pancreatic β-cell apoptosis caused by IH.© 2018 The Author(s).

The mechanism for the onset of depression remains largely unknown. Recently, more and more attention is being given to the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in depression.  (TUDCA), a clinically available agent used to treat cholesterol gallstone and protect neurons against neurodegeneration, has been reported to prevent neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of TUDCA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior, neuroinflammation, and oxido-nitrosative stress in mice. Results showed that TUDCA pretreatment (once daily for 7 consecutive days) at the dosage of 200 and 400 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg, markedly attenuated LPS (0.83 mg/kg)-induced behavioral abnormalities in the tail suspension test, forced swim test, and sucrose preference test. Further analysis showed that the TUDCA pretreatment (200, 400 mg/kg) not only inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS stimulation, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, but attenuated LPS-triggered oxido-nitrosative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our results provide evidence to show that the TUDCA could be a potential antidepressant, and its antidepressive mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response and oxido-nitrosative stress in the brain.© 2018 S.

We explored the vascular protective effects of chronic treatment with paeonol (2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone), the major compound from the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa on ER stress-induced endothelial dysfunction in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with ER stress inducer, tunicamycin (1 mg/kg/week) for 2 weeks to induce ER stress. The animals were co-administered with or without paeonol (20 mg/kg/oral gavage), reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, tempol (20 mg/kg/day) or ER stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA, 150 mg/kg/day) respectively. Blood pressure and body weight were monitored weekly and at the end of treatment, the aorta was isolated for isometric force measurement. Protein associated with ER stress (GRP78, ATF6 and p-eIF2α) and oxidative stress (NOX2 and nitrotyrosine) were evaluated using Western blotting. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability were determined using total nitrate/nitrite assay and western blotting (phosphorylation of eNOS protein). ROS production was assessed by en face dihydroethidium staining and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, respectively. Our results revealed that mice treated with tunicamycin showed an increased blood pressure, reduction in body weight and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) of aorta, which were ameliorated by co-treatment with either paeonol, TUDCA and tempol. Furthermore, paeonol reduced the ROS level in the mouse aorta and improved NO bioavailability in tunicamycin treated mice. These beneficial effects of paeonol observed were comparable to those produced by TUDCA and tempol, suggesting that the actions of paeonol may involve inhibition of ER stress-mediated oxidative stress pathway. Taken together, the present results suggest that chronic treatment with paeonol preserved endothelial function and normalized blood pressure in mice induced by tunicamycin in vivo through the inhibition of ER stress-associated ROS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029706>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Upregulation of STARD1 Promotes Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure.</a></h2><p>Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Mitochondrial SH3BP5 (also called SAB) and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediate the hepatotoxic effects of APAP. We investigated the involvement of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STARD1), a mitochondrial cholesterol transporter, in this process and sensitization by valproic acid (VPA), which depletes glutathione and stimulates steroidogenesis.Nonfasted C57BL/6J mice (control) and mice with liver-specific deletion of STARD1 (Stard1), SAB (Sab), or JNK1 and JNK2 (Jnk1+2) were given VPA with or without APAP. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry and for APAP metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial function. Adult human hepatocytes were transplanted into Fah/Rag2/Il2rg/NOD (FRGN) mice to create mice with humanized livers.Administration of VPA before administration of APAP increased the severity of liver damage in control mice. The combination of VPA and APAP increased expression of CYP2E1, formation of NAPQI-protein adducts, and depletion of glutathione from liver tissues of control mice, resulting in ER stress and the upregulation of STARD1. Livers from control mice given VPA and APAP accumulated cholesterol in the mitochondria and had sustained mitochondrial depletion of glutathione and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of ER stress, by administration of  to control mice, prevented upregulation of STARD1 in liver and protected the mice from hepatoxicity following administration of VPA and APAP. Administration of N-acetylcysteine to control mice prevented VPA- and APAP-induced ER stress and liver injury. Stard1 mice were resistant to induction of ALF by VPA and APAP, despite increased mitochondrial levels of glutathione and phosphorylated JNK; we made similar observations in fasted Stard1 mice given APAP alone. Sab mice or Jnk1+2 mice did not develop ALF following administration of VPA and APAP. The ability of VPA to increase the severity of APAP-induced liver damage was observed in FRGN mice with humanized liver.In studies of mice, we found that upregulation of STARD1 following ER stress mediates APAP hepatoxicity via SH3BP5 and phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Following treatment with TNF‑α, cell viability was determined by MTT assay to select the optimum concentration and duration of TNF‑α treatment in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Intracellular lipid droplet dispersion and glycerin content in culture media were determined to evaluate the effect of TUDCA on TNF‑α‑induced lipolysis in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Western blotting was performed to detect protein expression levels of perilipin‑A and protein markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress: Immunoglobulin‑binding protein (BiP), inositol‑requiring enzyme (IRE), c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated (p)‑IRE and p‑JNK. Following treatment with 50 ng/ml TNF‑α for 24 h, glycerin content increased significantly and lipid droplets were dispersed. Glycerin content was reduced significantly and dispersal of lipid droplets reduced following pretreatment of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with 1 mmol/l TUDCA. TNF‑α additionally activated the expression of BiP, p‑IRE and p‑JNK in a time‑dependent manner; following pretreatment of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with 1 mmol/l TUDCA, the expression levels of these three proteins decreased. Therefore, TUDCA may inhibit TNF-α-induced lipolysis in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes and reduce production of free fatty acids. Its underlying molecular mechanisms are potentially associated with the inhibition of activation of the IRE‑JNK signaling pathway, which influences perilipin-A expression levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27283502>Endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse decidua during early pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Unfolded or misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Although it is known that ER stress is crucial for mammalian reproduction, little is known about its physiological significance and underlying mechanism during decidualization. Here we show that Ire-Xbp1 signal transduction pathway of unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in decidual cells. The process of decidualization is compromised by ER stress inhibitor  sodium (TUDCA) and Ire specific inhibitor STF-083010 both in vivo and in vitro. A high concentration of ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM) suppresses stromal cells proliferation and decidualization, while a lower concentration is beneficial. We further show that ER stress induces DNA damage and polyploidization in stromal cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that the GRP78/Ire1/Xbp1 signaling pathway of ER stress-UPR is activated and involved in mouse decidualization.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a principal cell organelle involved in proteosynthesis, but also integrating various stress signals. ER stress evokes a conserved signaling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to cell death or adaptation to stress conditions. In this work, we document that mouse OSE suffers from ER stress during replicative senescence in vitro, develops abnormalities in ER and initiates UPR. Attenuation of ER stress in senescent OSE by  (TUDCA) reconditions ER architecture and leads to delayed onset of senescence. In summary, we show for the first time a mutual molecular link between ER stress response and replicative senescence leading to phenotypic changes of non-malignant ovarian surface epithelium.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27441395>Inhibition of the Unfolded Protein Response Mechanism Prevents Cardiac Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cardiac fibrosis attributed to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins is a major cause of heart failure and death. Cardiac fibrosis is extremely difficult and challenging to treat in a clinical setting due to lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to cardiac fibrosis and effective anti-fibrotic therapies. The objective in this study was to examine whether unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway mediates cardiac fibrosis and whether a pharmacological intervention to modulate UPR can prevent cardiac fibrosis and preserve heart function.We demonstrate here that the mechanism leading to development of fibrosis in a mouse with increased expression of calreticulin, a model of heart failure, stems from impairment of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, transient activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and stimulation of the TGFβ1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Remarkably, sustained pharmacologic inhibition of the UPR pathway by  (TUDCA) is sufficient to prevent cardiac fibrosis, and improved exercise tolerance.We show that the mechanism leading to development of fibrosis in a mouse model of heart failure stems from transient activation of UPR pathway leading to persistent remodelling of cardiac tissue. Blocking the activation of the transiently activated UPR pathway by TUDCA prevented cardiac fibrosis, and improved prognosis. These findings offer a window for additional interventions that can preserve heart function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26048914>The transthyretin amyloidoses: advances in therapy.</a></h2><p>There are two forms of transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis: non-hereditary and hereditary. The non-hereditary form (ATTRwt) is caused by native or wild-type TTR and was previously referred to as senile systemic amyloidosis. The hereditary form (ATTRm) is caused by variant TTR which results from a genetic mutation of TTR. The predominant effect of ATTRwt amyloidosis is on the heart, with patients having a greater left ventricular wall thickness at presentation than the devastating form which is light chain (AL) amyloidosis. ATTRm amyloidosis is broadly split into two categories: a type that predominantly affects the nervous system (often called familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP)) and one with a predilection for the heart (often called familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC)). Approximately half of all TTR mutations known to express a clinical phenotype cause a cardiomyopathy. Since the introduction of orthotopic liver transplantation for ATTRm amyloidosis in 1991, several additional therapies have been developed. These therapies aim to provide a reduction or elimination of TTR from the plasma (through genetic approaches), stabilisation of the TTR molecule (to prevent deposition) and dissolution of the amyloid matrix. We describe the latest developments in these approaches to management, many of which are also applicable to wild-type amyloidosis.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

As an endogenous bile acid and recognized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA) administration has been reported to have a potentially therapeutic effect on neurodegenerative diseases, but its real mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated whether TUDCA could alleviate traumatic damage of the spinal cord and improve locomotion function in a mouse model of SCI. Traumatic SCI mice were intraperitoneally injected with TUDCA, and the effects were evaluated based on motor function assessment, histopathology, apoptosis detection, qRT-PCR, and western blot at different time periods. TUDCA administration can improve motor function and reduce secondary injury and lesion area after SCI. Furthermore, the apoptotic ratios were significantly reduced; Grp78, Erdj4, and CHOP were attenuated by the treatment. Unexpectedly, the levels of CIBZ, a novel therapeutic target for SCI, were specifically up-regulated. Taken together, it is suggested that TUDCA effectively suppressed ER stress through targeted up-regulation of CIBZ. This study also provides a new strategy for relieving secondary damage by inhibiting apoptosis in the early treatment of spinal cord injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26602924>Critical Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Cognitive Impairment Induced by Microcystin-LR.</a></h2><p>Recent studies showed that cyanobacteria-derived microcystin-leucine-arginine (MCLR) can cause hippocampal pathological damage and trigger cognitive impairment; but the underlying mechanisms have not been well understood. The objective of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of MCLR-induced cognitive deficit; with a focus on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The Morris water maze test and electrophysiological study demonstrated that MCLR caused spatial memory injury in male Wistar rats; which could be inhibited by ER stress blocker;  (TUDCA). Meanwhile; real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression level of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78); C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase 12 were significantly up-regulated. These effects were rescued by co-administration of TUDCA. In agreement with this; we also observed that treatment of rats with TUDCA blocked the alterations in ER ultrastructure and apoptotic cell death in CA1 neurons from rats exposed to MCLR. Taken together; the present results suggested that ER stress plays an important role in potential memory impairments in rats treated with MCLR; and amelioration of ER stress may serve as a novel strategy to alleviate damaged cognitive function triggered by MCLR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187671>Bavachin Induces Apoptosis through Mitochondrial Regulated ER Stress Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>As a traditional herbal medicine, the fruits of Psoralea corylifolia L. (Fructus Psoraleae (FP)) have been widely used for the treatment of various skin diseases for hundred years. Recently, the emerging FP-induced toxic effects, especially hepatotoxicity, in clinic are getting the public's attention. However, its exact toxic components and mechanisms underlying remain unclear. Bavachin, one of flavonoids in FP, has been documented as a hepatotoxic substance, and the present study aimed to determine the toxicity caused by bavachin and the possible toxic mechanisms involved using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results showed that bavachin could significantly inhibited cell proliferation and trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent manner. Downregulating ER stress using  (TUDCA) obvious attenuated bavachin-triggerd cell apoptosis. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of Mitofusion2 (Mfn2) resulted in a remarkable aggravation of ER stress through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Additionally, suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by ROS Scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cystein (NAC)) also reduced bavachin-induced ER stress. Taken together, our study demonstrated that bavachin-induced ER stress caused cell apoptosis by Mfn2-Akt pathway, and that ROS may participate upstream in this mechanism. Here, we not only provide a new understanding of ROS/Mfn2/Akt pathway in bavachin-induced cytotoxicity via the ER stress, but also identify a new specific intervention to prevent FP-induced hepatotoxicity in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26288223>Gefitinib and Erlotinib Lead to Phosphorylation of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 Alpha Independent of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in A549 Cells.</a></h2><p>Gefitinib and erlotinib are anticancer agents, which inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving EGFR inhibitors. In the present study, we examined whether gefitinib- and erlotinib-induced lung injury related to ILD through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a causative intracellular mechanism in cytotoxicity caused by various chemicals in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells. These two EGFR inhibitors increased Parkinson juvenile disease protein 2 and C/EBP homologous protein mRNA expressions, and activated the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α/activating transcription factor 4 pathway without protein kinase R-like ER kinase activation in A549 cells. Gefitinib and erlotinib caused neither ER stress nor cell death; however, these agents inhibited cell growth via the reduction of cyclin-D1 expression. , which is known to suppress eIF2α phosphorylation, cancelled the effects of EGFR inhibitors on cyclin-D1 expression and cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The results of an EGFR-silencing study using siRNA showed that gefitinib and erlotinib affected eIF2α phosphorylation and cyclin-D1 expression independent of EGFR inhibition. Therefore, the inhibition of cell growth by these EGFR inhibitors might equate to impairment of the alveolar epithelial cell repair system via eIF2α phosphorylation and reduced cyclin-D1 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30976744>Serum Metabolomic Profiling Identifies Key Metabolic Signatures Associated With Pathogenesis of Alcoholic Liver Disease in Humans.</a></h2><p>Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) develops in a subset of heavy drinkers (HDs). The goals of our study were to (1) characterize the global serum metabolomic changes in well-characterized cohorts of controls (Cs), HDs, and those with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC); (2) identify metabolomic signatures as potential diagnostic markers, and (3) determine the trajectory of serum metabolites in response to alcohol abstinence. Serum metabolic profiling was performed in 22 Cs, 147 HDs, and 33 patients with AC using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Hepatic gene expression was conducted in Cs (n = 16) and those with AC (n = 32). We found progressive changes in the quantities of metabolites from heavy drinking to AC. Taurine-conjugated bile acids (taurocholic acid [TCA], 127-fold; taurochenodeoxycholic acid [TCDCA], 131-fold; and , 56-fold) showed more striking elevations than glycine-conjugated forms (glycocholic acid [GCA], 22-fold; glycochenodeoxycholic acid [GCDCA], 22-fold; and glycoursodeoxycholic acid [GUDCA], 11-fold). This was associated with increased liver cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily B, member 1 and taurine content (more substrates); the latter was due to dysregulation of homocysteine metabolism. Increased levels of GCDCA, TCDCA, GCA, and TCA positively correlated with disease progression from Child-Pugh A to C and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores, whereas GCDCA, GCA, and GUDCA were better predictors of alcohol abstinence. The levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 but not FGF19 were increased in HDs, and all three were further increased in those with AC.  Serum taurine/glycine-conjugated bile acids could serve as noninvasive markers to predict the severity of AC, whereas GLP-1 and FGF21 may indicate a progression from heavy drinking to AC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30653687>Deficiency of Mitochondrial Glycerol 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Hepatic Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) is an integral component of the respiratory chain, and recent studies have suggested that it plays an important role in hepatic glucose homeostasis. However, its function in hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. Here, we identified a role for mGPDH in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specifically, mGPDH expression and activity were lower in fatty livers from patients and mice with NAFLD (ob/ob, high-fat diet [HFD] and db/db). Liver-specific depletion of mGPDH in mice or mGPDH knockdown in cultured hepatocytes exacerbated diet-induced triglyceride accumulation and steatosis through enhanced . RNA-sequencing revealed that mGPDH regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins and processes. mGPDH deletion exacerbated tunicamycin (ER stress inducer)-induced hepatic steatosis, whereas  (ER stress inhibitor) rescued mGPDH depletion-induced steatosis on an HFD. Moreover, ER stress induced by mGPDH depletion could be abrogated by the intracellular Ca chelator 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N´,N´-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibitor cyclosporine A, or cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) knockdown. mGPDH promoting Cyp-D ubiquitination was also observed. Finally, liver-specific mGPDH overexpression attenuated hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and HFD mice. Conclusion: mGPDH is a pivotal regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Its deficiency induces ER stress by suppressing Cyp-D ubiquitination, a key regulator of the mitochondrial Ca conductance channel mPTP, and results in hepatic steatosis. mGPDH may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26278107>Response to Elia et al.

Previous studies have suggested compromised Sirt1 expression in rodent models of cholestatic liver injury. We hypothesized that Sirt1 could be potentially targeted to alleviate cholestatic liver injury. In cultured primary human hepatocytes, SIRT1 messenger RNA was down-regulated after GCA treatment, potentially through induction of microRNA (miR)-34a, whereas  induced SIRT1 expression without affecting miR-34a expression. Sirt1 expression was also significantly down-regulated in three mouse models of liver injury (bile duct ligation, 1% cholic acid [CA] fed, and the Mdr2 mouse). Mice fed CA diet also demonstrated hepatic FXR hyperacetylation and induction of the Janus kinase/p53 pathway. Mice fed a CA diet and concurrently administered the Sirt1 activator, SRT1720 (50 mg/kg/day, orally), demonstrated 40% and 45% decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase and BA levels, respectively. SRT1720 increased hepatic BA hydrophilicity by increasing tri- and tetrahydroxylated and decreasing the dihydroxylated BA fraction. SRT1720 administration also inhibited hepatic BA synthesis, potentially through ileal fibroblast growth factor 15- and Fxr-mediated inhibition of cytochrome p450 (Cyp) 7a1 and Cyp27a1, along with increased hepatic BA hydroxylation in association with Cyp2b10 induction. SRT1720 administration significantly induced renal multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α, and constitutive androstance receptor expression along with ∼2-fold increase in urinary BA concentrations.SRT1720 administration alleviates cholestatic liver injury in mice by increasing hydrophilicity of hepatic BA composition and decreasing plasma BA concentration through increased BA excretion into urine.

Recent studies show that stress produces enduring effects on structure and function of hippocampus, which is one of the most important structures involved in epilepsy. In the present study, we determined the effect of repeated restraint stress exposure on the susceptibility of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures and the possible mechanisms involved using a rodent model. Our results show that mice subjected to repeated restraint stress exhibited shorter latency to PTZ-induced tonic-clonic seizures and higher seizure severity, suggesting chronic restraint stress increases seizure susceptibility. Following repeated restraint stress, we observed an increased level of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as well as oxidative stress in the hippocampus. Moreover, our results show that chronic restraint stress exposure causes neuron loss in the hippocampus. Inhibition of ER stress with chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), however, protects against chronic restraint stress-induced neuron loss, suggesting repeated restraint stress-induced neuronal degeneration is dependent on ER stress activation. On the other hand, inhibition of ER stress with TUDCA suppresses restraint stress-induced seizure susceptibility. Taken together, these results indicate that repeated restraint stress increases seizure susceptibility by activation of hippocampal ER stress and ER stress mediated oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Thus, attenuating ER stress may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy targeted to block stress-induced seizure activities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To solve this problem, we evaluated whether three priming small molecules (, fucoidan, and oleuropein) could enhance the angiogenic potential of EPCs. Such enhancement would promote the cellular bioactivities and help to develop functionally improved EPC therapeutics for ischemic diseases by accelerating the priming effect of the defined physiological molecules. We found that preconditioning of each of the three small molecules significantly induced the differentiation potential of CD34 stem cells into EPC lineage cells. Notably, long-term priming of OECs with the three chemical cocktail (OEC-3C) increased the proliferation potential of EPCs via ERK activation. The migration, invasion, and tube-forming capacities were also significantly enhanced in OEC-3Cs compared with unprimed OECs. Further, the cell survival ratio was dramatically increased in OEC-3Cs against HO-induced oxidative stress via the augmented expression of Bcl-2, a prosurvival protein. In conclusion, we identified three small molecules for enhancing the bioactivities of -expanded OECs for vascular repair.

In this study, we assessed interactions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus in causing kidney dysfunction and injury and the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Hypertension was induced by aorta constriction (AC) between the renal arteries in 6-month-old male Goto-Kakizaki (GK) type 2 diabetic and control Wistar rats. Fasting plasma glucose averaged 162±11 and 87±2 mg/dL in GK and Wistar rats, respectively. AC produced hypertension in the right kidney (above AC) and near normal blood pressure in the left kidney (below AC), with both kidneys exposed to the same levels of glucose, circulating hormones, and neural influences. After 8 weeks of AC, blood pressure above the AC (and in the right kidney) increased from 109±1 to 152±5 mm Hg in GK rats and from 106±4 to 141±5 mm Hg in Wistar rats. The diabetic-hypertensive right kidneys in GK-AC rats had much greater increases in albumin excretion and histological injury compared with left kidneys (diabetes mellitus only) of GK rats or right kidneys (hypertension only) of Wistar-AC rats. Marked increases in ER stress and oxidative stress indicators were observed in diabetic-hypertensive kidneys of GK-AC rats. Inhibition of ER stress with  for 6 weeks reduced blood pressure (135±4 versus 151±4 mm Hg), albumin excretion, ER and oxidative stress, and glomerular injury, while increasing glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive-diabetic kidneys. These results suggest that diabetes mellitus and hypertension interact synergistically to promote kidney dysfunction and injury via ER stress.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27893675>A multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of TUDCA and UDCA in Chinese patients with primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p> (TUDCA) is a taurine conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with higher hydrophility.

An intratracheal injection of BLM transiently increased the expression of CHOP mRNA and protein in an early phase (days 1 and 3) in mice lungs. BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly attenuated in Chop gene deficient (Chop KO) mice, compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, the inflammatory reactions evaluated by protein concentration, the total number of leucocytes and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the mRNA expression of interleukin 1b and caspase 11, and the apoptotic cell death were suppressed in Chop KO mice compared with those in WT mice. In addition, administration of  (TUDCA), a pharmacological agent that can inhibit CHOP expression, inhibited the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation, and the increase in Chop mRNA expression in WT mice in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the ER stress-induced transcription factor, CHOP, at least in part, plays an important role in the development of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and that the inhibition of CHOP expression by a pharmacological agent, such as TUDCA, may be a promising strategy for the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit increased oxidative stress in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including monocytes; however, the mechanisms remain unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding of this study is that factors contained within the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes can contribute to increased oxidative stress in monocytes, making them more adherent to endothelial cells. We show that these effects are largely mediated by the interaction between endoplasmic reticulum stress and NADPH oxidase activity. Recent evidence suggests that exposure of human monocytes to glucolipotoxic media to mimic the composition of plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) results in the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The extent to which these findings translate to patients with T2D remains unclear. Thus, we first measured ROS (dihydroethidium fluorescence) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of T2D patients (n = 8) and compared the values with age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 8). The T2D patients exhibited greater basal intracellular ROS (mean ± SD, +3.4 ± 1.4-fold; P < 0.05) compared with control subjects. Next, the increase in ROS in PBMCs isolated from T2D patients was partly recapitulated in cultured human monocytes (THP-1 cells) exposed to plasma from T2D patients for 36 h (+1.3 ± 0.08-fold versus plasma from control subjects; P < 0.05). In addition, we found that increased ROS formation in THP-1 cells treated with T2D plasma was NADPH oxidase derived and led to increased endothelial cell adhesion (+1.8 ± 0.5-fold; P < 0.05) and lipid uptake (+1.3 ± 0.3-fold; P < 0.05). Notably, we found that T2D plasma-induced monocyte ROS and downstream functional effects were abolished by treating cells with , a chemical chaperone known to inhibit ER stress. Collectively, these data indicate that monocyte ROS production with T2D can be attributed, in part, to signals from the circulating environment. Furthermore, an interplay between ER stress and NADPH oxidase activity contributes to ROS production and may be a mechanism mediating endothelial cell adhesion and foam cell formation in T2D.© 2016 The Authors.

However, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by ischemia in the area of application limits the integration and survival of MSCs in patients. In our study, we generated ER stress-induced conditions in MSCs using -cresol. As -cresol is a toxic compound accumulated in the body of CKD patients and induces apoptosis and inflammation through reactive oxygen species (ROS), we observed ER stress-induced MSC apoptosis activated by oxidative stress, which in turn resulted from ROS generation. To overcome stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated the protective effects of  (TUDCA), a bile acid, on ER stress in MSCs. In ER stress, TUDCA treatment of MSCs reduced ER stress-associated protein activation, including GRP78, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, IRE1α, and CHOP. Next, to explore the protective mechanism adopted by TUDCA, TUDCA-mediated cellular prion protein (PrP) activation was assessed. We confirmed that PrP expression significantly increased ROS, which was eliminated by superoxide dismutase and catalase in MSCs. These findings suggest that TUDCA protects from inflammation and apoptosis in ER stress via PrP expression. Our study demonstrates that TUDCA protects MSCs against inflammation and apoptosis in ER stress by PrP expression in response to -cresol exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31143889> (TUDCA) counters osteoarthritis by regulating intracellular cholesterol levels and membrane fluidity of degenerated chondrocytes.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol and lipid metabolism are associated with osteoarthritis (OA) in human cartilage. High cholesterol levels in OA chondrocytes leads to decreased membrane fluidity and blocks the signaling cascade associated with the expression of chondrogenic genes. It is known that bile acid plays a role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and the digestion of fats in the human body.  (TUDCA), as a member of the bile acid family, also aids in the transport of cellular cholesterol. In this study, we hypothesized that TUDCA might be able to promote the restoration of OA cartilage by reducing membrane cholesterol levels in OA chondrocytes and by stimulating the chondrogenic signaling cascade. To assess this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on degenerated chondrocytes isolated from patients with OA. Importantly, treatment with TUDCA at sub-micellar concentrations (2500 μM) significantly increased cell proliferation and Cyclin D1 expression compared with the controls. In addition, the expression of chondrogenic marker genes (SOX9, COL2, and ACAN), proteins (SOX9 and COL2), and glycosaminoglycan (Chondroitin sulfate) was much higher in the TUDCA-treated group compared to the controls. We also found that TUDCA treatment significantly reduced the intracellular cholesterol levels in the chondrocytes and increased membrane fluidity. Furthermore, the stability of TGF receptor 1 and activity of focal adhesion proteins were also increased following TUDCA treatment. Together, these results demonstrated that TUDCA could be used as an alternative treatment for the restoration of OA cartilage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315604>Advanced glycation end products inhibit testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells by inducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Diabetes severely impairs male reproduction. The present study assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which play an important role in the development of diabetes complications, on testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells. Primary rat Leydig cells were cultured and treated with AGEs (25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml). Testosterone production induced by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was determined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), which are involved in testosterone biosynthesis, were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyssi, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Leydig cells was measured using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins [C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)] in the Leydig cells were measured by western blot analysis. We found that the AGEs markedly suppressed testosterone production by rat Leydig cells which was induced by hCG in a concentration-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of StAR, 3β-HSD and P450scc were downregulated by the AGEs in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The antioxidant agent, N-acetyl‑L‑cysteine (NAC), and the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor,  (TUDCA), reversed the inhibitory effects of AGEs. In addition, the content of ROS in Leydig cells treated with AGEs increased significantly. The expression levels of CHOP and GRP78 were markedly upregulated by the AGEs in the Leydig cells. From these findings, it can be concluded that AGEs inhibit testosterone production by rat Leydig cells by inducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27075612>Steroid binding to Autotaxin links bile salts and lysophosphatidic acid signalling.</a></h2><p>Autotaxin (ATX) generates the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX-LPA signalling is involved in multiple biological and pathophysiological processes, including vasculogenesis, fibrosis, cholestatic pruritus and tumour progression. ATX has a tripartite active site, combining a hydrophilic groove, a hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket and a tunnel of unclear function. We present crystal structures of rat ATX bound to 7α-hydroxycholesterol and the bile salt tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA), showing how the tunnel selectively binds steroids. A structure of ATX simultaneously harbouring TUDCA in the tunnel and LPA in the pocket, together with kinetic analysis, reveals that bile salts act as partial non-competitive inhibitors of ATX, thereby attenuating LPA receptor activation. This unexpected interplay between ATX-LPA signalling and select steroids, notably natural bile salts, provides a molecular basis for the emerging association of ATX with disorders associated with increased circulating levels of bile salts. Furthermore, our findings suggest potential clinical implications in the use of steroid drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26143062>Quantitative bile acid profiling by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry: monitoring hepatitis B therapy by a novel Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor.</a></h2><p>A novel analytical approach for the targeted profiling of bile acids (BAs) in human serum/plasma based on liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) is presented. Reversed-phase chromatography enabled the baseline separation of 15 human BA species which could be readily detected by accurate mass analysis in negative ion mode. Blood proteins were removed by methanol precipitation in the presence of deuterium-labeled internal standards which allowed BA quantification in 50 μl plasma/serum. The assay was validated according to FDA guidance achieving quantification limits from 7.8 to 156 nM. Calibration curves prepared in charcoal-stripped serum/plasma showed excellent regression coefficients (R (2) > 0.997) and covered quantities from 7.8 to 10,000 nM depending on the analyzed species. Intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were below 15 % for all analytes. Apparent extraction recoveries were above 97 %, and ion suppression rates were between 4 and 53 %. Mean BA level in serum/plasma from healthy volunteers ranged from 11 ± 4 nM () to 1321 ± 1442 nM (glycochenodeoxycholic acid). As a proof of concept, the assay was applied to plasma samples derived from a clinical phase I study of myrcludex B, a novel first-in-class virus entry inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and D. The results demonstrate that myrcludex-induced inhibition of the hepatic BA transporter Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) significantly affects plasma BA level. These observations provide novel insights into drug-induced  responses and will be indispensable for the assessment of side effects and dose-finding processes during future clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30314894>Endoplasmic reticulum stress is activated in post-ischemic kidneys to promote chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) may lead to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), i.e. AKI-CKD transition, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in ER resulting in a cellular stress response. The role of ER stress in AKI-CKD transition remains unknown.In this study, we examined ER stress in the mouse model of AKI-CKD transition after unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (uIR). To determine the role of ER stress in AKI-CKD transition, we tested the effects of two chemical chaperones:  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA).uIR led to the induction of ER stress in kidneys, as indicated by increased expression of UPR molecules CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) and BiP(binding immunoglobulin protein; also called GRP78-78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). Given at 3 days after uIR, both TUDCA and 4-PBA blocked ER stress in post-ischemic kidneys. Notably, both chemicals promoted renal recovery and suppressed tubulointerstitial injury as manifested by the reduction of tubular atrophy, renal fibrosis and myofibroblast activation. Inhibition of ER stress further attenuated renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, inflammation and autophagy in post-ischemic kidneys.These findings suggest that ER stress contributes critically to the development of chronic kidney pathologies and CKD following AKI, and inhibition of ER stress may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to impede AKI-CKD transition.Copyright © 2018.

(TUDCA) is known to have cardiovascular protective effects by decreasing ER stress. This study aimed to assess the ability of TUDCA to decrease ER stress, inhibit dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and reduce in-stent restenosis.The effect of TUDCA on dedifferentiation of VSMCs and ER stress was investigated in vitro using wound-healing assays, MTT assays, and western blotting. For in vivo studies, 18 rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet to induce atheroma formation. Bare metal stents (BMS), BMS+TUDCA or Firebird stents were implanted in the left common carotid artery. Rabbits were euthanized after 28 days and processed for scanning electron microscope (SEM), histological examination (HE), and immunohistochemistry.In vitro TUDCA (10-1000 μmol/L) treatment significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced proliferation and migration in VSMCs in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased ER stress markers (IRE1, XBP1, KLF4, and GRP78). In vivo, we confirmed no significant difference in neointimal coverage on three stents surfaces; neointimal was significantly lower with BMS+TUDCA (1.6 ± 0.2 mm) compared with Firebird (1.90 ± 0.1 mm) and BMS (2.3 ± 0.1 mm). Percent stenosis was lowest for BMS+TUDCA, then Firebird, and was significantly higher with BMS (28 ± 4%, 35 ± 7%, 40 ± 1%; respectively; P < 0.001). TUDCA treatment decreased ER stress in the BMS+TUDCA group compared with BMS.TUDCA inhibited dedifferentiation of VSMCs by decreasing ER stress and reduced in-stent restenosis, possibly through downregulation of the IRE1/XBP1 signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29802827>Globular adiponectin protects rat hepatocytes against acetaminophen-induced cell death via modulation of the inflammasome activation and ER stress: Critical role of autophagy induction.</a></h2><p>Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose treatment causes severe liver injury. Adiponectin, a hormone predominantly produced by adipose tissue, exhibits protective effects against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of globular adiponectin (gAcrp) on APAP-induced hepatocyte death and its underlying mechanisms. We found that APAP (2 mM)-induced hepatocyte death was prevented by inhibition of the inflammasome. In addition, treatment with gAcrp (0.5 and 1 μg/ml) inhibited APAP-induced activation of the inflammasome, judged by suppression of interleukin-1β maturation, caspase-1 activation, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) speck formation, suggesting that protective effects of gAcrp against APAP-induced hepatocyte death is mediated via modulation of the inflammasome. APAP also induced ER stress and treatment with  (TUDCA), an ER chaperone and inhibitor of ER stress, abolished APAP-induced inflammasomes activation, implying that ER stress acts as signaling event leading to the inflammasome activation in hepatocytes stimulated with APAP. Moreover, gAcrp significantly suppressed APAP-induced expression of ER stress marker genes. Finally, the modulatory effects of gAcrp on ER stress and inflammasomes activation were abrogated by treatment with autophagy inhibitors, while an autophagy inducer (rapamycin) suppressed APAP-elicited ER stress, demonstrating that autophagy induction plays a crucial role in the suppression of APAP-induced inflammasome activation and ER stress by gAcrp. Taken together, these results indicate that gAcrp protects hepatocytes against APAP-induced cell death by modulating ER stress and the inflammasome activation, at least in part, via autophagy induction.Copyright © 2018.

(TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) could alleviate the increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and prevent insulin resistance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of TUDCA and PBA on  of Cu and Zn in diabetic mice model. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in FVB mice treated with and without TUDCA and PBA. Determination of Cu and Zn in tissues and serum by acid digestion was followed by ICP-MS. The renal and serum Cu levels were significantly higher, while the hepatic Cu and Zn levels were significantly decreased in the diabetic mice at 2 weeks and 2 months after diabetes onset. The increase of cardiac Cu together with the decrease of muscular Zn was found in the diabetic mice only at 2 months. Cu levels were positively correlated with Zn in the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, spleen, and serum of diabetic and control mice at both 2 weeks and 2 months. Both PBA and TUDCA reduced serum Zn, and PBA reduced hepatic Cu to normal levels in the diabetic mice at two time points, while PBA normalized serum Cu in the diabetic mice only at 2 months. PBA increased hepatic Zn to normal levels in the diabetic mice at 2 weeks, while it partially increased hepatic Zn in the same group at 2 months. Therefore, maintaining homeostasis of Cu and Zn by TUDCA and PBA in diabetes needs to be received with special attention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26907328>Porcine Circovirus 2 Deploys PERK Pathway and GRP78 for Its Enhanced Replication in PK-15 Cells.</a></h2><p>Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection induces autophagy and apoptosis. These cellular responses could be connected with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It remains unknown if PCV2 induces ER stress and if autophagy or apoptosis is primary to PCV2 infection or secondary responses following ER stress. Here, we demonstrate that PCV2 triggered unfolded protein response (UPR) in PK-15 cells by activating the PERK/eIF2α pathway without concomitant activation of IRE1 or ATF6. Since ATF4 and CHOP were induced later than PERK/eIF2α, it is clear that persistent PCV2 infection could lead to selective activation of PERK via the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis. Therefore, PERK activation could be part of the pro-apoptotic signaling via induced expression of CHOP by PCV2. Since PERK inhibition by GSK2606414 or RNA silencing or suppression of eIF2α dephosphorylation by salubrinal limited viral replication, we suppose that PCV2 deploys UPR to enhance its replication. Over-expression of GRP78 or treatment with  could enhance viral capsid expression and/or viral titers, indicating that these chaperones, endogenous or exogenous, could help correct folding of viral proteins. Our findings provide the first evidence that ER stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of PCV2 infection probably as part of autophagic and apoptotic responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667627>Propofol Inhibits HeLa Cells by Impairing Autophagic Flux via AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Activation and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Regulated by Calcium.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Propofol has antitumor effects against various cancers. However, the mechanism of action of propofol in HeLa human cervical cancer cells has not been elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS We treated HeLa human cervical cancer cells with different concentrations of propofol. Cell viability was evaluated with Cell Counting Kit-8 and apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Autophagosome formation was evaluated based on microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC)3 conversion and light chain 3 puncta formation. Autophagosome clearance was assessed according to p62 protein level and autolysosome generation. RESULTS We found that propofol decreased cell viability and increased autophagosome generation in HeLa cells. Autophagosome formation was evaluated based on LC3 conversion and LC3 puncta formation. Autophagosome clearance was assessed according to p62 protein level. The AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway was found to be activated in propofol-induced autophagosome accumulation. Fluorescence analysis using LysoTracker dye revealed that propofol blocked autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Administration of rapamycin increased autophagosome clearance in propofol-treated HeLa cells. Additionally, propofol induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and disrupted intracellular Ca2+ balance, thereby enhancing autophagosome accumulation. Suppressing ER stress by treatment with  (TUDCA) enhanced these effects, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of propofol is related to induction of ER stress. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to provide evidence that propofol-mediated autophagy regulation is an underlying part of the mechanism by which propofol regulates HeLa cells progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26748055> prevents hearing loss and hair cell death in Cdh23(erl/erl) mice.</a></h2><p>Sensorineural hearing loss has long been the subject of experimental and clinical research for many years. The recently identified novel mutation of the Cadherin23 (Cdh23) gene, Cdh23(erl/erl), was proven to be a mouse model of human autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB12).  (TUDCA), a taurine-conjugated bile acid, has been used in experimental research and clinical applications related to liver disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases associated with apoptosis. Because hair cell apoptosis was implied to be the cellular mechanism leading to hearing loss in Cdh23(erl/erl) mice (erl mice), this study investigated TUDCA's otoprotective effects in erl mice: preventing hearing impairment and protecting against hair cell death. Our results showed that systemic treatment with TUDCA significantly alleviated hearing loss and suppressed hair cell death in erl mice. Additionally, TUDCA inhibited apoptotic genes and caspase-3 activation in erl mouse cochleae. The data suggest that TUDCA could be a potential therapeutic agent for human DFNB12.Copyright © 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We have reported that sustained treatment with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) results in apoptotic β-cell death and impairs insulin secretion. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for NMDA-induced β-cell dysfunction remains largely obscure. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether sustained activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) causes β-cell dysfunction through ER stress.Primary mouse islets and MIN6 mouse pancreatic β-cells were treated with NMDA for 24 h or high-glucose for 72 h. After the treatment, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and the expression of ER stress markers were measured, respectively. In vivo, the expression of ER stress markers was measured in the pancreas of diabetic mice treated with or without NMDARs inhibitor Memantine.NMDA treatment caused an increase in the expression of ER stress markers (ATF4, CHOP, GRP78, and Xbp1s) in primary islets. While,  (TUDCA), an inhibitor of ER stress, significantly attenuated NMDA-induced β-cell dysfunction, including the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduction of pancreas duodenum homeobox factor-1 (Pdx-1) mRNA expression, a transcription factor regulating insulin synthesis. Besides, NMDA-induced ER stress strongly promoted pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis (IL-1β and TNF-α) in β cells. Interestingly, knockdown of CHOP attenuated β-cell dysfunction evoked by NMDA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that blockade of NMDARs ameliorated high-glucose-induced ER stress in vitro and in vivo.This study confirms that ER stress is actively involved in the activation of NMDARs-related β-cell dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We have recently discovered that the endogenous bile acid  (TUDCA), a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis and a neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, also enhances NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neuronal conversion by improving mitochondrial integrity and function of NSCs. In the present study, we explore the effect of TUDCA on regulation of NSC fate in neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using rat postnatal neurospheres and adult rats exposed to the bile acid. TUDCA significantly induced NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neural differentiation in the SVZ, without affecting DG-derived NSCs. More importantly, expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial antioxidant responses were significantly increased by TUDCA in SVZ-derived NSCs. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of TUDCA in adult rats markedly enhanced both NSC proliferation and early differentiation in SVZ regions, corroborating in vitro data. Collectively, our results highlight a potential novel role for TUDCA in neurologic disorders associated with SVZ niche deterioration and impaired neurogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224065>ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress and aggravates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes, and the dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in its pathogenesis. ERp44, an ER resident chaperone protein, has been implicated in the modulation of ER stress, however, its role and mechanism in DN are not determined. Here, we show that ERp44 expression is upregulated in the glomeruli of db/db mice, a rodent model of type 2 diabetes. When ERp44 is depleted by in vivo shRNA-mediated knockdown, the features associated with DN including albuminuria level and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness are aggravated, therefore suggesting a detrimental role of ERp44 depletion in DN progression. We further show that ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress in DN in db/db mice, and that attenuating ER stress with the chemical chaperone TUDCA remarkably diminishes the aggravated DN features caused by ERp44 depletion. These results suggest that the exacerbated ER stress is a critical factor for the detrimental effect of ERp44 depletion on DN progression in db/db mice. Thus, our study links the role of ERp44 in DN with ER stress regulation and may offer a potential therapeutic strategy to interfere DN progression.Copyright © 2018.

APS treatments at 15 and 45 μg/mL significantly reduced PCV2 infection and GRP78 mRNA and protein expression (P < 0.05). Tunicamycin supplementation increased GRP78 mRNA and protein expression and significantly attenuated the APS-induced inhibition of PCV2 infection (P < 0.05).  supplementation decreased GRP78 mRNA and protein expression and significantly inhibited PCV2 infection (P < 0.05). In addition, fifty 2-week-old mice were randomly divided into five groups: Con, PCV2, APS + PCV2, TM + PCV2 and TM + APS + PCV2. The results were similar to those in PK15 cells. Taken together, it could be concluded that APS suppresses PCV2 infection by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797762>Ceramide enhances COX-2 expression and VSMC contractile hyperreactivity via ER stress signal activation.</a></h2><p>Ceramide accumulation in blood vessels has been attributed to vascular dysfunction in progressive vascular complications in  diseases.

However, the developmental role of Gbf1 in vertebrates remains elusive. In this study, we report the zebrafish mutant line  that arises from -ethyl--nitrosourea (ENU)-mediated mutagenesis and is characterized by prominent intracerebral and trunk hemorrhage. The mutant embryos develop hemorrhage accompanied by fewer pigments and shorter caudal fin at day 2 of development. The hemorrhage phenotype is caused by vascular breakage in a cell autonomous fashion. Positional cloning identifies a T → G nucleotide substitution in the 23rd exon of the  locus, resulting in a leucine → arginine substitution (L1246R) in the HDS2 domain.

(TUDCA) is neuroprotective in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD; however, its effect in PD motor symptoms has never been addressed. In the present work, an extensive behavior analysis was performed to better characterize the MPTP model of PD and to evaluate the effects of TUDCA in the prevention/improvement of mice phenotype. MPTP induced significant alterations in general motor performance paradigms, including increased latency in the motor swimming, adhesive removal and pole tests, as well as altered gait, foot dragging, and tremors. TUDCA administration, either before or after MPTP, significantly reduced the swimming latency, improved gait quality, and decreased foot dragging. Importantly, TUDCA was also effective in the prevention of typical parkinsonian symptoms such as spontaneous activity, ability to initiate movement and tremors. Accordingly, TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced decrease of dopaminergic fibers and ATP levels, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Overall, MPTP-injected mice presented motor symptoms that are aggravated throughout time, resembling human parkinsonism, whereas PD motor symptoms were absent or mild in TUDCA-treated animals, and no aggravation was observed in any parameter. The thorough demonstration of improvement of PD symptoms together with the demonstration of the  triggered by TUDCA supports a subsequent clinical trial in humans and future validation of the application of this bile acid in PD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500188>Metabolomics Profiles of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in a Korean Prospective Cohort: The Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II.</a></h2><p>In the prospective Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II (KCPS-II), we investigated the application of metabolomics to differentiate subjects with incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC group) from subjects who remained free of cancer (control group) during a mean follow-up period of 7 years with the aim of identifying valuable  biomarkers for HCC. We used baseline serum samples from 75 subjects with incident HCC and 134 age- and gender-matched cancer-free subjects. Serum  profiles associated with HCC incidence were investigated via metabolomics analysis. Compared with the control group, the HCC group showed significantly higher serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. At baseline, compared with the control group, the HCC group showed significantly higher levels of 9 metabolites, including leucine, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, arachidonic acid, and  (TUDCA), but lower levels of 28 metabolites, including oleamide, androsterone sulfate, L-palmitoylcarnitine, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 16:0, LPA 18:1, and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC). Multiple linear regression revealed that the incidence of HCC was associated with the levels of tyrosine, AST, lysoPCs (16:1, 20:3), oleamide, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, androsterone sulfate, and TUDCA (adjusted  = 0.514,  = 0.036). This study showed the clinical relevance of the dysregulation of not only branched amino acids, aromatic amino acids, and lysoPCs but also bile acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and fatty acid . In addition, tyrosine, AST, lysoPCs (16:1, 20:3), oleamide, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid, androsterone sulfate, and TUDCA were identified as independent variables associated with the incidence of HCC. .©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28630443>Chemical chaperone, TUDCA unlike PBA, mitigates protein aggregation efficiently and resists ER and non-ER stress induced HepG2 cell death.</a></h2><p>Stress induced BSA (bovine serum albumin) protein aggregation is effectively mitigated in vitro by TUDCA () than by PBA (4- phenylbutyric acid), chemical chaperones approved by FDA for the treatment of biliary cirrhosis and urea cycle disorders respectively. TUDCA, unlike PBA, enhances trypsin mediated digestion of BSA. TUDCA activates PERK, an ER-resident kinase that phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor2 (eIF2α) and promotes the expression of activated transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in HepG2 cells. In contrast, PBA induced eIF2α phosphorylation is not mediated by PERK activation and results in low ATF4 expression. Neither chaperones promote expression of BiP, an ER chaperone, and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), downstream target of eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. Both chaperones mitigate tunicamycin induced PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP arm of UPR and expression of BiP. TUDCA, unlike PBA does not decrease cell viability and it also mitigates tunicamycin, UV-irradiation and PBA induced PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase) cleavage and cell death. These findings therefore suggest that TUDCA's antiapoptotic activity to protect HepG2 cells and PBA's activity that limits tumor cell progression may be important while considering their therapeutic potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28821633>Cell-autonomous cytotoxicity of type I interferon response  induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The interaction of IFN with specific membrane receptors that transduce death-inducing signals is considered to be the principle mechanism of IFN-induced cytotoxicity. In this study, the classic non-cell-autonomous cytotoxicity of IFN was augmented by cell-autonomous mechanisms that operated independently of the interaction of IFN with its receptors. Cells primed to produce IFN by 5-azacytidine (5-aza) underwent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The chemical chaperones tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), as well as the iron chelator ciclopirox (CPX), which reduces ER stress, alleviated the cytotoxicity of 5-aza. Ablation of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), the major ER stress-associated proapoptotic transcription factor, protected fibroblasts from 5-aza only when the cytotoxicity was examined cell autonomously. In a medium-transfer experiment in which the cell-autonomous effects of 5-aza was dissociated, CHOP ablation was incapable of modulating cytotoxicity; however, neutralization of IFN receptor was highly effective. Also the levels of caspase activation showed a distinct profile between the cell-autonomous and the medium-transfer experiments. We suggest that besides the classic paracrine mechanism, cell-autonomous mechanisms that involve induction of ER stress also participate.

The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal energy intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic fat deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high fat diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the liver on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis. These results also provide an insight into interventions for the potential high-risk population of NAFLD, such as those born small or exposed to maternal undernourishment during the fetal period, with the alleviation of ER stress by dietary supplements and/or specific food including chaperones.© 2016 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30708974>TUDCA-Treated Mesenchymal Stem Cells Protect against ER Stress in the Hippocampus of a Murine Chronic Kidney Disease Model.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to the loss of kidney function, as well as the dysfunction of several other organs due to the release of uremic toxins into the system. In a murine CKD model, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are increased in the hippocampus. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the candidates for cell-based therapy for CKD; however severe pathophysiological conditions can decrease their therapeutic potential. To address these issues, we established  (TUDCA)-treated MSCs using MSCs isolated from patients with CKD (CKD-hMSCs) and assessed the survival and ROS generation of neural cell line SH-SY5Y cells by co-culturing with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs. In the presence of the uremic toxin -cresol, the death of SH-SY5Y cells was induced by ROS-mediated ER stress. Co-culture with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs increased anti-oxidant enzyme activities in SH-SY5Y cells through the upregulation of the cellular prion protein (PrP) expression. Upregulated PrP expression in SH-SY5Y cells protected against CKD-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. In an adenine-induced murine CKD model, injection with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs suppressed ROS generation and ER stress in the hippocampus. These results indicate that TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs prevent the CKD-mediated cell death of SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting ER stress. Our study suggests that treatment with TUDCA could be a powerful strategy for developing autologous MSC-based therapeutics for patients with CKD, and that PrP might be a pivotal target for protecting neural cells from CKD-mediated ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004805> reduces ER stress by regulating of Akt-dependent cellular prion protein.</a></h2><p>Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising cell source for regenerative medicine, ischemia-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces low MSC engraftment and limits their therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this, we investigated the protective effect of  (TUDCA), a bile acid, on ER stress in MSCs in vitro and in vivo. In ER stress conditions, TUDCA treatment of MSCs reduced the activation of ER stress-associated proteins, including GRP78, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, IRE1α, JNK, p38, and CHOP. In particular, TUDCA inhibited the dissociation between GRP78 and PERK, resulting in reduced ER stress-mediated cell death. Next, to explore the ER stress protective mechanism induced by TUDCA treatment, TUDCA-mediated cellular prion protein (PrP) activation was assessed. TUDCA treatment increased PrP expression, which was regulated by Akt phosphorylation. Manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) expression also increased significantly in response to signaling through the TUDCA-Akt axis. In a murine hindlimb ischemia model, TUDCA-treated MSC transplantation augmented the blood perfusion ratio, vessel formation, and transplanted cell survival more than untreated MSC transplantation did. Augmented functional recovery following MSC transplantation was blocked by PrP downregulation.

The rats were randomly divided into three groups: group A (sham surgery group), group B (DMSO control group) and group C (TUDCA treatment group), with 36 rats in each group. At one minute and at 24 hours after successfully establishing the model, rats in group C received an intraperitoneal injection of TUDCA (200 mg/kg), while rats in group B received an equal amount of DMSO at the same time points. At 24 hours, three days, and five days after injury, a modified Tarlov scoring method and Rivlin's oblique plate test were used to evaluate rat spinal cord nerve function recovery. Animals were sacrificed at 24 hours, three days, and five days after injury. Specimens were obtained from the center of the injury sites; the pathological changes in spinal cord tissue were observed after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining; apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL method, and the expression of caspase-12 was measured at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and Western blots.Group C differed significantly from group B in Tarlov scores and the oblique table test as early as 24 hours after the injury (P < 0.05). The TUNEL assay test results showed that neurons underwent apoptosis after SCI, which peaked at 24 hours.

In AVMC mouse hearts (n=11), ER stress and CHOP were significantly activated, and were linked to the induction of proapoptotic signaling including reduction of Bcl-2, activation of Bax and caspase 3, compared with the controls (n=10), whereas these could be markedly blocked by ER stress inhibitor  administration (n=11). Moreover, chemical inhibition of ER stress significantly attenuated cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and prevented cardiac troponin I elevation, ameliorated cardiac dysfunction assessed by both hemodynamic and echocardiographic analysis, reduced viral replication, and increased survival rate after CVB3 inoculation. We further discovered that genetic ablation of CHOP (n=10) suppressed cardiac Bcl-2/Bax ratio reduction and caspase 3 activation, and prevented cardiomyotes apoptosis in vivo, compared with wild-type receiving CVB3 inoculation (n=10).

When ER stress occurs, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is subsequently activated to restore ER proteostasis. However, severe ER stress leads to apoptosis. Recent studies have suggested that cisplatin cytotoxicity may be related to ER stress. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ER stress participates in cochlear cell apoptosis in a cisplatin-induced ototoxicity rat model and to also determine the possible relationship between ER stress and hearing loss. Our results revealed that treatment with cisplatin upregulated the expression of active caspase-12 in cochlear cells, which is indicative of cisplatin-induced activation of ER-specific apoptosis. Increased expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-9 suggested a close relationship between severe ER stress and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in the cochlear cells of cisplatin-treated rats. In addition, we found that  (TUDCA), a promoter of ER proteostasis, had a protective effect on cisplatin-induced hearing loss.

Since it was shown that TGR5 is expressed in pancreatic tissue, a direct TGR5 activation in β-cells is currently postulated and discussed. The current study reveals that oleanolic acid (OLA) affects murine β-cell function by TGR5 activation. Both a G inhibitor and an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase (AC) prevented stimulating effects of OLA. Accordingly, OLA augmented the intracellular cAMP concentration. OLA and two well-established TGR5 agonists, RG239 and  (TUDCA), acutely promoted stimulus-secretion coupling (SSC). OLA reduced K current and elevated current through Ca channels. Accordingly, in mouse and human β-cells, TGR5 ligands increased the cytosolic Ca concentration by stimulating Ca influx. Higher OLA concentrations evoked a dual reaction, probably due to activation of a counterregulating pathway. Protein kinase A (PKA) was identified as a downstream target of TGR5 activation. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase did not prevent stimulating effects of OLA. Involvement of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2) or farnesoid X receptor (FXR2) was ruled out by experiments with knockout mice. The proposed pathway was not influenced by local glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion from α-cells, shown by experiments with MIN6 cells, and a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. In summary, these data clearly demonstrate that activation of TGR5 in β-cells stimulates insulin secretion via an AC/cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway, which is supposed to interfere with SSC by affecting K and Ca currents and thus membrane potential.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29724297>Ibrutinib improves the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death.</a></h2><p>The current study mainly aims to evaluate the effects of ibrutinib on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced apoptosis in Reh cells, which may shed light on the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among children.

To enter a low energy state, misfolded proteins form aggregates, which are associated with many degenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown the use of low molecular weight chemical chaperones to be an effective method of reducing protein aggregation in various cell types. This study demonstrates a novel non-biased assay to assess the molecular efficacy of these compounds at preventing protein misfolding and/or aggregation. This assay utilizes a thioflavin T fluorescent stain to provide a qualitative and quantitative measure of protein misfolding within cells. The functionality of this method was first assessed in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells treated with various endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers. Once established in the renal model system, we analyzed the ability of some known chemical chaperones to reduce ER stress. A total of five different compounds were selected: 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), , trehalose, and glycerol. The dose-dependent effects of these compounds at reducing thapsigargin-induced ER stress was then analyzed, and used to determine their EC values. Of the chaperones, 4-PBA and DHA provided the greatest reduction of ER stress and did so at relatively low concentrations. Upon analyzing the efficiency of these compounds and their corresponding structures, it was determined that chaperones with a localized hydrophilic, polar end followed by a long hydrophobic chain, such as 4-PBA and DHA, were most effective at reducing ER stress. This study provides some insight into the use of low molecular weight chemical chaperones and may serve as the first step towards developing new chaperones of greater potency thereby providing potential treatments for diseases caused by protein aggregation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulates VEGFA expression in granulosa cells, and whether its activation is involved in OHSS development. The expression of the spliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 [XBP1(S)], induced by ER stress, in cumulus cells from OHSS patients was higher than that in cumulus cells from non-OHSS patients. The ER stress inducer tunicamycin increased human chorionic gonadotropin-induced VEGFA production in human granulosa cells through the induction of XBP1(S), and pretreatment with the ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) abrogated the effect of tunicamycin. In OHSS model rats, TUDCA administration prevented the OHSS development, reducing ovarian VEGFA production. Our findings suggest ER stress upregulates hCG-induced VEGFA production in granulosa cells, indicating that ER stress might be involved in OHSS development.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Peripheral ER includes interconnected tubules, and dense tubular arrays called "ER matrices" together with bona fide flat cisternae. Transitions between these states are regulated by membrane-associated proteins and cytosolic factors. Recently, the small GTPases Rab10 and Rab18 were reported to control ER shape by regulating ER dynamics and fusion. Here, we present evidence that another Rab protein, Rab7a, modulates the ER morphology by controlling the ER homeostasis and ER stress. Indeed, inhibition of Rab7a expression by siRNA or expression of the dominant negative mutant Rab7aT22 N, leads to enlargement of sheet-like ER structures and spreading towards the cell periphery. Notably, such alterations are ascribable neither to a direct modulation of the ER shaping proteins Reticulon-4b and CLIMP63, nor to interactions with Protrudin, a Rab7a-binding protein known to affect the ER organization. Conversely, depletion of Rab7a leads to basal ER stress, in turn causing ER membrane expansion. Both ER enlargement and basal ER stress are reverted in rescue experiments by Rab7a re-expression, as well as by the ER chemical chaperone  (TUDCA). Collectively, these findings reveal a new role of Rab7a in ER homeostasis, and indicate that genetic and pharmacological ER stress manipulation may restore ER morphology in Rab7a silenced cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

No definitive cure is available for OI and to develop novel drug therapies, taking advantage of a repositioning strategy, the small teleost zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a particularly appealing model. Its small size, high proliferative rate, embryo transparency and small amount of drug required make zebrafish the model of choice for drug screening studies, when a valid disease model is available. We performed a deep characterization of the zebrafish mutant Chihuahua, that carries a G574D (p.G736D) substitution in the α1 chain of type I collagen. We successfully validated it as a model for classical OI. Growth of mutants was delayed compared with WT. X-ray, µCT, alizarin red/alcian blue and calcein staining revealed severe skeletal deformity, presence of fractures and delayed mineralization. Type I collagen extracted from different tissues showed abnormal electrophoretic migration and low melting temperature. The presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enlargement due to mutant collagen retention in osteoblasts and fibroblasts of mutant fish was shown by electron and confocal microscopy. Two chemical chaperones, 4PBA and TUDCA, were used to ameliorate the cellular stress and indeed 4PBA ameliorated bone mineralization in larvae and skeletal deformities in adult, mainly acting on reducing ER cisternae size and favoring collagen secretion. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that ER stress is a novel target to ameliorate OI phenotype; chemical chaperones such as 4PBA may be, alone or in combination, a new class of molecules to be further investigated for OI treatment.© The Author 2017.

We show that TUDCA stabilizes the active form of rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II, and does not display the detergent-like effects of common amphiphilic compounds that share the cholesterol scaffold structure, such as deoxycholic acid. Computer docking of TUDCA to the model of light-activated rhodopsin revealed that it interacts using similar mode of binding to the C-terminal domain of transducin alpha subunit. The ring regions of TUDCA made hydrophobic contacts with loop 3 region of rhodopsin, while the tail of TUDCA is exposed to solvent. The results show that TUDCA interacts specifically with rhodopsin, which may contribute to its wide-ranging effects on retina physiology and as a potential therapeutic compound for retina degenerative diseases.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Supplementation of the culture medium with  (TUDCA), a bile acid, has been reported to improve the development of embryos derived from in vivo fertilized (IVF) embryos after in vitro culture (IVC) by attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, it remains unclear if TUDCA can improve development of IVM-IVF embryos. Here, we examined whether TUDCA treatment could improve embryonic development during or after IVM. Immature GV oocytes collected from ovaries of ICR female mice that were free from cumulus cells were subjected to IVM in αMEM containing 5% FBS for 16 h. TUDCA was added to the media at varying concentrations (0-1000 μM) during IVM and IVC. TUDCA treatment during IVM reduced both MII and pronuclear (PN) rates but did not affect blastocyst rates of fertilized embryos. In contrast, TUDCA treatment during IVC significantly increased blastocyst formation rates in a concentration dependent manner. Finally, embryo transfer after TUDCA treatment revealed a significant improvement in the rates of offspring production (15% with 1000 μM TUDCA vs. 6.0% control). These results show that treatment with 1000 μM of TUDCA significantly can improve poor embryonic development of cumulus-free IVM-IVF embryos.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360145>Bile acids stimulate cholangiocyte fluid secretion by activation of transmembrane member 16A Cl channels.</a></h2><p>Bile acids stimulate a bicarbonate-rich choleresis, in part, through effects on cholangiocytes. Because Cl channels in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes provide the driving force for secretion and transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A) has been identified as the Ca -activated Cl channel in the apical membrane of cholangiocytes, the aim of the present study was to determine whether TMEM16A is the target of bile-acid-stimulated Cl secretion and to identify the regulatory pathway involved. In these studies of mouse, rat, and human biliary epithelium exposure to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or  (TUDCA) rapidly increased the rate of exocytosis, ATP release, [Ca ] , membrane Cl permeability, and transepithelial secretion. Bile-acid-stimulated Cl currents demonstrated biophysical properties consistent with TMEM16A and were inhibited by pharmacological or molecular (small-interfering RNA; siRNA) inhibition of TMEM16A. Bile acid-stimulated Cl currents were not observed in the presence of apyrase, suramin, or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), demonstrating that current activation requires extracellular ATP, P2Y, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. TUDCA did not activate Cl currents during pharmacologic inhibition of the apical Na -dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), but direct intracellular delivery of TUDCA rapidly activated Cl currents.Bile acids stimulate Cl secretion in mouse and human biliary cells through activation of membrane TMEM16A channels in a process regulated by extracellular ATP and [Ca ] . These studies suggest that TMEM16A channels may be targets to increase bile flow during cholestasis.

Copper(ii)-phenanthroline complexes are promising compounds that were shown previously to induce an immediate cytotoxic response over a panel of tumor cell lines in vitro. The molecular mechanism, however, remained unresolved. In this work we performed a thorough study of the copper(ii)-phenanthroline complexes containing different imidazolidine-2-thione ligands in ovarian cancer cells, and revealed that these complexes induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequently cell death mediated by the unfolded protein response. Alleviation of the ER-stress by  (TUDCA) attenuated the cytotoxic effects. In summary, we have identified a novel, ER-dependent, molecular mechanism mediating cytotoxic effects of copper(ii)-phenanthroline complexes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26803847>Nicotine Directly Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response in Rat Placental Trophoblast Giant Cells.</a></h2><p>Nicotine exposure during pregnancy leads to placental insufficiency impairing both fetal and neonatal development. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that in rats, nicotine augmented endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in association with placental insufficiency; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Therefore, we sought to investigate the possible direct effect of nicotine on ER stress in Rcho-1 rat placental trophoblast giant (TG) cells during differentiation. Protein and/or mRNA expression of markers involved in ER stress (eg, phosphorylated PERK, eIF2α, CHOP, and BiP/GRP78) and TG cell differentiation and function (eg, Pl-1, placental growth factor [Pgf], Hsd11b1, and Hsd11b2) were quantified via Western blot or real-time polymerase chain reaction. Nicotine treatment led to dose-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of PERK[Thr981] and eIF2α[Ser51], whereas pretreatment with a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist (mecamylamine hydrochloride) blocked the induction of PERK phosphorylation, verifying the direct involvement of nicotine and nAChR binding. We next investigated select target genes known to play essential roles in placental TG cell differentiation and function (Pl-1, Pgf, Hsd11b1, and Hsd11b2), and found that nicotine significantly augmented the mRNA levels of Hsd11b1 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, using , a safe bile acid known to improve protein chaperoning and folding, we were able to prevent nicotine-induced increases in both PERK phosphorylation and Hsd11b1 mRNA levels, revealing a potential novel therapeutic approach to reverse the deleterious effects of nicotine exposure in pregnancy. Collectively, these results implicate that nicotine, acting through its receptor, can directly augment ER stress and impair placental function.© The Author 2016.

However, the exact mechanisms whereby FGF21 mediates insulin sensitivity remain not fully understood. In the present study, FGF21was administrated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and tunicamycin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and  parameters, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicators, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting. The administration of FGF21 in obese mice reduced body weight, blood glucose and serum insulin, and increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in alleviation of insulin resistance. Meanwhile, FGF21 treatment reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress in adipose tissue of obese mice. Additionally, suppression of ER stress via the ER stress inhibitor  increased adiponectin expression and improved insulin resistance in obese mice and in tunicamycin-induced adipocytes. In conclusion, our results showed that the administration of FGF21 reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress under the condition of insulin resistance, demonstrating the causative role of ER stress in downregulating adiponectin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26816051>The 78-kD Glucose-Regulated Protein Regulates Endoplasmic Reticulum Homeostasis and Distal Epithelial Cell Survival during Lung Development.</a></h2><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease of prematurity, has been linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To investigate a causal role for ER stress in BPD pathogenesis, we generated conditional knockout (KO) mice (cGrp78(f/f)) with lung epithelial cell-specific KO of Grp78, a gene encoding the ER chaperone 78-kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a master regulator of ER homeostasis and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Lung epithelial-specific Grp78 KO disrupted lung morphogenesis, causing developmental arrest, increased alveolar epithelial type II cell apoptosis, and decreased surfactant protein and type I cell marker expression in perinatal lungs. cGrp78(f/f) pups died immediately after birth, likely owing to respiratory distress. Importantly, Grp78 KO triggered UPR activation with marked induction of the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Increased expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and cell death and decreased expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes suggest a role for oxidative stress in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis. Increased Smad3 phosphorylation and expression of transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 targets Cdkn1a (encoding p21) and Gadd45a suggest that interactions among the apoptotic arm of the UPR, oxidative stress, and transforming growth factor-β/Smad signaling  contribute to Grp78 KO-induced AEC apoptosis and developmental arrest. Chemical chaperone  reduced UPR activation and apoptosis in cGrp78(f/f) lungs cultured ex vivo, confirming a role for ER stress in observed AEC abnormalities. These results demonstrate a key role for GRP78 in AEC survival and gene expression during lung development through modulation of ER stress, and suggest the UPR as a potential therapeutic target in BPD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142143>A multidrug cocktail approach attenuates ischemic-type biliary lesions in liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors.</a></h2><p>Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) are the most troublesome biliary complication after liver transplantation (LT) from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) and frequently result in death or re-transplantation. In transplantation process, warm ischemia (WI) in the donor, cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in the recipient altogether inducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is strongly associated with ITBL. This is a cascading injury process, involving in a complex series of inter-connecting events causing variety of cells activation and damage associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These damaged cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), coupled with immunological injury and bile salt toxicity altogether contribute to ITBL in NHBD LT. Developed therapeutic strategies to attenuate IRI are essential to improve outcome after LT. Among them, single pharmaceutical interventions blocking a specific pathway of IRI in rodent models play an absolutely dominant role, and show a beneficial effect in some given controlled experiments. But this will likely prove ineffective in complex clinical setting in which more risk parameters are involved. Therefore, we intend to design a multidrug cocktail approach to block different  on more than one stage (WI, cold ischemia and reperfusion) of the process of IRI-induced ITBL simultaneously. This multidrug cocktail will include six drugs containing streptokinase, epoprostenol, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin and  (TUDC). These drugs show protective effects by targeting the different key events of IRI, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and reduced bile salt toxicity. Ideally, the compounds, dosage, and method of application of drugs included in cocktail should not be definitive. We can consider removing or adding some drugs to the proposed cocktail based on further research. But given the multitude of different combinations, it is extremely difficult to determent which combination is the optimization design. Nevertheless, regardless of the difficulty, our multidrug cocktail approach designed to block different mechanisms on more than one stage of IRI simultaneously may represent a future preventive and therapeutic avenue for ITBL.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we explored the anticancer properties of SAN in lung cancer using the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A1. Our results revealed that SAN inhibited SPC-A1 cell growth and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We found that SAN triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while elimination of ROS by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by SAN. SAN-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulted in the upregulation of many genes and proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), p-protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Blocking ER stress with  (TUDCA) markedly reduced SAN-induced inhibition of growth and apoptosis. Furthermore, TUDCA decreased SAN-induced ROS production, and NAC attenuated SAN-induced GRP78 and CHOP expression. Overall, our data indicate that the anticancer effects of SAN in lung cancer cells depend on ROS production and ER stress and that SAN may be a potential agent against lung cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754923> enhances the development of porcine embryos derived from in vitro-matured oocytes and evaporatively dried spermatozoa.</a></h2><p>Evaporative drying (ED) is an alternative technique for long-term preservation of mammalian sperm, which does not require liquid nitrogen or freeze-drying equipment, but offers advantages for storage and shipping at ambient temperature and low cost. However, the development of zygotes generated from these sperms was poor. Here, we demonstrated that the supplementation of  (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, during embryo culture improved the developmental competency of embryos derived from in vitro matured pig oocytes injected intracytoplasmically with boar ED spermatozoa by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species, the DNA degradation and fragmentation, and the expression of apoptosis-related gene Bax and Bak, and by increasing the transcription of anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. Furthermore, TUDCA treatment promoted the blastocyst quality manifested by the total cell numbers and the ratio of inner cell mass. Taken together, our data suggest that evaporative drying would be a potentially useful method for the routine preservation of boar sperm in combination with further optimization of subsequently embryo culture conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28544790>Roles of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress in intracerebral hemorrhage-induced secondary brain injury in rats.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to evaluate the roles of autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced secondary brain injury (SBI) in rats.Autophagy inducer (rapamycin) and inhibitor (3-methyladenine), as well as ER stress activator (tunicamycin, TM) and inhibitor (, TUDCA), were used. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, was used to assess autophagic flux.Autophagy and ER stress were enhanced in the week after ICH. At 6 hours after ICH, autophagy was excessive, while the autophagic flux was damaged at 72 hours and return to be intact at 7 days after ICH. At 6 hours after ICH, ER stress induction by TM could enhance autophagy and lead to caspase 12-mediated apoptosis and neuronal degeneration, which was further aggravated by autophagy induction. At 7 days after ICH, ER stress inhibition by TUDCA still could suppress ICH-induced SBI. And, the effects of TUDCA were enhanced by autophagy induction.At 6 hours after ICH, excessive autophagy may participate in ER stress-induced brain injury; at 7 days after ICH, autophagy could enhance the protection of ER stress inhibitor possibly via clearing up the cell rubbish generated due to the early-stage damaged autophagic flux.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26765262>Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Uremic Cardiomyopathy: Protective Effects of .</a></h2><p>Uremic cardiomyopathy (UCM) is a complication in chronic kidney disease.

Renal function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and by periodic acid-Schiff reagent staining.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis and its mechanisms. Palmitate (PA) stimulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and subsequent thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Ilexgenin A enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and improved ER stress by suppression of ROS-associated TXNIP induction. However, these effects were blocked by knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK is essential for its action in suppression of ER stress. Meanwhile, ilexgenin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thereby reduced IL-1β secretion. It also inhibited inflammation and apoptosis exposed to PA insult. Consistent with these results in endothelial cells, ilexgenin A attenuated ER stress and restored the loss of eNOS activity in vascular endothelium, and thereby improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta. A further analysis in high-fat fed mice showed that oral administration of ilexgenin A blocked ER stress/NLRP3 activation with reduced ROS generation and increased NO production in vascular endothelium, well confirming the beneficial effect of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these results show ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation was responsible for endothelial dysfunction and ilexgenin A ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by suppressing ER-stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a regulation of AMPK. This finding suggests that the application of ilexgenin A is useful in the management of cardiovascular diseases in obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We then investigated their weight and effect on BA  profile using advanced ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics.The UPLC-MS/MS analysis of the plasma show that the levels of murocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, , taurodeoxycholic acid, tauromuricholic acid, and taurocholic acid were increased; whereas levels of taurolithocholic acid and isolithocholic acid were decreased after drinking green, oolong, and white tea types compared with control. Surprisingly, oolong tea significantly influenced reduction in relative weight compared with control, black, and green tea; whereas black, green, and white teas had no effects on weight compared with control.Green, black, oolong, and white teas altered the BA .

However, relationships between these processes are unclear. We hypothesized that Nox isoforms localize in a subcellular compartment-specific manner, contributing to oxidative and ER stress, which influence the oxidative proteome and vascular function in hypertension. Nox compartmentalization (cell fractionation), O (lucigenin), HO (amplex red), reversible protein oxidation (sulfenylation), irreversible protein oxidation (protein tyrosine phosphatase, peroxiredoxin oxidation), and ER stress (PERK [protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase], IRE1α [inositol-requiring enzyme 1], and phosphorylation/oxidation) were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMC proliferation was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and vascular reactivity assessed in stroke-prone SHR arteries by myography. Noxs were downregulated by short interfering RNA and pharmacologically. In SHR, Noxs were localized in specific subcellular regions: Nox1 in plasma membrane and Nox4 in ER. In SHR, oxidative stress was associated with increased protein sulfenylation and hyperoxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatases and peroxiredoxins. Inhibition of Nox1 (NoxA1ds), Nox1/4 (GKT137831), and ER stress (4-phenylbutyric acid/) normalized SHR vascular reactive oxygen species generation. GKT137831 reduced IRE1α sulfenylation and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing in SHR. Increased VSMC proliferation in SHR was normalized by GKT137831, 4-phenylbutyric acid, and STF083010 (IRE1-XBP1 disruptor). Hypercontractility in the stroke-prone SHR was attenuated by 4-phenylbutyric acid. We demonstrate that protein hyperoxidation in hypertension is associated with oxidative and ER stress through upregulation of plasmalemmal-Nox1 and ER-Nox4. The IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the ER stress response is regulated by Nox4/reactive oxygen species and plays a role in the hyperproliferative VSMC phenotype in SHR. Our study highlights the importance of Nox subcellular compartmentalization and interplay between cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species and ER stress response, which contribute to the VSMC oxidative proteome and vascular dysfunction in hypertension.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28549656>Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate-induced liver injury and bile acid cycle disruption.</a></h2><p>Alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT) is a common hepatotoxicant experimentally used to reproduce the pathologies of drug-induced liver injury in humans, but the mechanism of its toxicity remains unclear.

Histological and cellular analyses were performed and the effect of oral administration of the molecular chaperone  (TUDCA) and antibiotics were investigated. IgA content of feces and serum and presence of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were also investigated.Aberrantly accumulated HLA-DR4/I-E molecules in colonic epithelial cells were observed only in the colitic homozygous tgm, which was accompanied by upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and reduced mucus. Homozygous tgm with CIITAKO, and thus absent of HLA-DR4/I-E expression, did not develop colitis. Oral administration of TUDCA to homozygotes reduced HLA-DR4/I-E and BiP expression in colonic epithelial cells and restored the barrier function of the intestinal tract. The IgA content of feces and serum, and numbers of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were higher in the colitic tgm, and antibiotic administration suppressed the expression of HLA-DR4/I-E and colitis.The pathogenesis of the colitis observed in the homozygous tgm was likely due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in goblet cell damage and compromised mucus production in the colonic epithelial cells in which HLA-DR4/I-E molecules were heavily accumulated.

Here we investigated the effects of troxerutin on the enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Mice were divided into four groups: Control group, HFD group, HFD + Troxerutin group, and Troxerutin group. Troxerutin was treated by daily oral administration at doses of 150 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks.  (TUDCA) was used to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Our results showed that troxerutin effectively improved obesity and related  parameters, and liver injuries in HFD-treated mouse. Furthermore, troxerutin significantly attenuated enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in HFD-fed mouse. Moreover, troxerutin notably suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 transcriptional activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in HFD-treated mouse livers. Mechanismly, troxerutin dramatically decreased Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) expression, as well as interaction between NOD1/2 with interacting protein-2 (RIP2), by abating oxidative stress-induced ER stress in HFD-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by TUDCA treatment. These improvement effects of troxerutin on hepatic glucose disorders might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect. In conclusion, troxerutin markedly diminished HFD-induced enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis via its inhibitory effects on ER stress-mediated NOD activation and consequent inflammation, which might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902174>Endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle from pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation and infection are key mediators of inflammation and peripheral insulin resistance associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Studies have shown endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to induce inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, however is paucity of studies investigating the effects of ER stress in skeletal muscle on inflammation and insulin resistance associated with GDM. ER stress proteins IRE1α, GRP78 and XBP-1s were upregulated in skeletal muscle of obese pregnant women, whereas IRE1α was increased in GDM women. Suppression of ER stress, using ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) or siRNA knockdown of IRE1α and GRP78, significantly downregulated LPS-, poly(I:C)- or IL-1β-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and MCP-1. Furthermore, LPS-, poly(I:C)- or TNF-α-induced insulin resistance was improved following suppression of ER stress, by increasing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR-β, IRS-1, GLUT-4 expression and glucose uptake. In summary, our inducible obesity and GDM-like models suggests that the development of GDM may be involved in activating ER stress-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type cancer cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271806>Activation of G0/G1 switch gene 2 by endoplasmic reticulum stress enhances hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and increased levels of G0/G1 Switch Gene 2 (G0S2) have been documented in animal models with fatty liver disease. In this study, we investigated whether G0S2 is regulated by branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and contributes to ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis.We first analyzed G0S2 expression and the state of the three canonical UPR branches in several hepatic steatosis models, tunicamycin-treated C57BL/6J mice and HepG2 cells, where ER homeostasis was perturbed. We pretreated HepG2 cells with  (TUDCA) to validate whether G0S2 was the downstream target of ER stress. Loss or gain function analysis was conducted to identify which UPR branch specifically linked to G0S2 transcription. The transcription mechanism was estimated by luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay.Here we showed that the activation of ER stress was accompanied by elevation of G0S2 expression in the occurrence of fatty liver disease. Furthermore, G0S2 was found to be a novel target gene of activating transcription factor 4(ATF4). We also localized one conserved ATF4-binding sequence in the 5' regulatory region of G0S2, which was responsible for transcriptional activating G0S2 by ATF4.G0S2 is regulated by the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 branch of the UPR and mediates ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), which is a condition of the unfolded/misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum, has been defined as a potential target for cardiovascular disease. In the present study, the effects of ERS inhibition on hypertension-induced alterations in the vessels were investigated. In male Wistar albino rats, hypertension was induced through unilateral nephrectomy, deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA) injection (20 mg/kg, twice a week) and 1% NaCl with 0.2% KCI added to drinking water for 12 weeks. An ERS inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycolic acid (TUDCA) (150 mg/kg/day, i.p.), was administered for the final four weeks. ERS inhibition in DOCA-salt induced hypertension was observed to have reduced systolic blood pressure, improved endothelial dysfunction, enhanced plasma nitric oxide (NO) level, reduced protein expressions of phosphorylated-double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (pPERK), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), Inositol trisphosphate receptor1 (IPR1) and Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), increased expressions of endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase2 (SERCA2) and B cell lymphoma2 (Bcl2) in vessels. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of ERS inhibition on hypertension may be related to protection of vessel functions through restoration of endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic and mitotic pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Under many undesirable conditions, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can be induced. However, the physiological and molecular responses of wheat to ER stress remain poorly understood. We used dithiothreitol (DTT) and  (TUDCA) to induce or suppress ER stress in wheat cells, respectively, with the aim to reveal the molecular background of ER stress responses using a combined approach of transcriptional profiling and morpho-physiological characterization.To understand the mechanism of wheat response to ER stress, three wheat cultivars were used in our pre-experiments. Among them, the cultivar with a moderate stress tolerance, Yunong211 was used in the following experiments. We used DTT (7.5 mM) to induce ER stress and TUDCA (25 μg·mL) to suppress the stress. Under three treatment groups (Control, DTT and DTT + TUDCA), we firstly monitored the morphological, physiological and cytological changes of wheat seedlings. Then we collected leaf samples from each group for RNA extraction, library construction and RNA sequencing on an Illumina Hiseq platform. The sequencing data was then validated by qRT-PCR.Morpho-physiological results showed DTT significantly reduced plant height and biomass, decreased contents of chlorophyll and water, increased electrolyte leakage rate and antioxidant enzymes activity, and accelerated the cell death ratio, whereas these changes were all remarkably alleviated after TUDCA co-treatment. Therefore, RNA sequencing was performed to determine the genes involved in regulating wheat response to stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 8204 genes were differentially expressed in three treatment groups. Among these genes, 158 photosynthesis-related genes, 42 antioxidant enzyme genes, 318 plant hormone-related genes and 457 transcription factors (TFs) may play vital roles in regulating wheat response to ER stress. Based on the comprehensive analysis, we propose a hypothetical model to elucidate possible mechanisms of how plants adapt to environmental stresses.We identified several important genes that may play vital roles in wheat responding to ER stress. This work should lay the foundations of future studies in plant response to environmental stresses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155263>Fatty acid-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress promoted lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, and endoplasmic reticulum stress existed in the liver of severe fatty liver cows.</a></h2><p>Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, often termed ER stress, is intrinsically linked with perturbation of lipid metabolism in humans and mice. Whether ER homeostasis is affected in cows experiencing fatty liver is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes and ER stress status in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. In vitro experiments were conducted in which hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with different concentrations of fatty acids,  (TUDCA; a canonical inhibitor of ER stress), or both. The increase in phosphorylation level of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) proteins, and the cleavage of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) protein in response to increasing doses of fatty acids (which were reversed by TUDCA treatment) in primary hepatocytes underscored a mechanistic link between fatty acids and ER stress. In addition, fatty acid treatment increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, fatty acid synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and lipid accumulation in calf primary hepatocytes, whereas inhibition of ER stress by incubating with TUDCA significantly weakened these effects. Overall, results in vitro indicate that inhibition of ER stress in calf hepatocytes alleviates fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation by downregulating the expression of lipogenic genes. In vivo experiments, liver and blood samples were collected from cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 15) or with severe fatty liver (n = 15). The phosphorylation level of PERK and IRE1α, the cleavage of ATF6 protein, and the abundance of several unfolded protein response genes (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, AMP-dependent transcription factor 4, and spliced X-box binding protein 1) were greater in liver of cows with severe fatty liver. The present in vivo study confirms the occurrence of ER stress in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. Considering the causative role of fatty acid-induced ER stress in hepatic lipid accumulation in calf hepatocytes, the existence of ER stress in the liver of severe fatty liver cows may presage its participation in fatty liver progression in dairy cows. However, the mechanistic relationship between ER stress and fatty liver in dairy cows remain to be determined.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we hypothesized that pigs with different genotypes (ETEC F18 resistant (FUT1AA) versus susceptible (FUT1AG)) differed in following systemic and enteric responses: growth performance, plasma metabolic profiles, expression of candidate genes for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and immunity, number of selected bacteria and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in faeces and digesta in piglets pre and post-weaning, and on the ETEC F18 adherence ex vivo. Genotype had the strongest impact on plasma metabolomic profile on day 7 and 28 of age. FUT1AG piglets had higher level of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, hippuric acid, oxindole, and 3-oxo-5-beta-chol-7-en-24-oic acid on day 7, and a higher level of guanosine on day 28 than that in the FUT1AA piglets. FUT1AA piglets had a higher level of betaine on day 7 and 3-methylguanine on day 28. On day 34 of age, the FUT1AA pigs had higher levels of S-2-hydroxyglutarate, L-phenylalanine,  and an undetermined PC/LysoPC, while Ile Glu Phe Gly peptide and genistein 5-O-glucuronide, and PC (18:0/0:0) were at higher levels in the FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype did not affect the growth performance and expression of candidate genes. FUT1AG piglets had a higher number of haemolytic bacteria in faeces and in digesta than that in FUT1AA at 34 days of age. The colonic acetic acid concentration was highest in FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype may influence not only the expression of E. coli F18 receptors but could potentially impact the gut homeostasis and metabotype of piglets pre and post-weaning. Further investigations on the relation between FUT1 genotype and these aspects including the intestinal commensal  will expand the knowledge on factors affecting the intestinal ecosystem.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354401>Ufm1-Specific Ligase Ufl1 Regulates Endoplasmic Reticulum Homeostasis and Protects Against Heart Failure.</a></h2><p>Defects in protein homeostasis are sufficient to provoke cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Although posttranslational modifications by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins are emerging as an important regulatory mechanism of protein function, the role of Ufm1 (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1)-a novel ubiquitin-like protein-has not been explored in either the normal or stressed heart.Western blotting revealed that Ufl1 (Ufm1-specific E3 ligase 1)-an enzyme essential for Ufm1 modification-was increased in hypertrophic mouse hearts but reduced in the failing hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. To determine the functional role of Ufl1 in the heart, we generated a cardiac-specific knockout mouse and showed that Ufl1-deficient mice developed age-dependent cardiomyopathy and heart failure, as indicated by elevated cardiac fetal gene expression, increased fibrosis, and impaired cardiac contractility. When challenged with pressure overload, Ufl1-deficient hearts exhibited remarkably greater hypertrophy, exacerbated fibrosis, and worsened cardiac contractility compared with control counterparts. Transcriptome analysis identified that genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function were dysregulated in Ufl1-deficient hearts. Biochemical analysis revealed that excessive ER stress preceded and deteriorated along with the development of cardiomyopathy in Ufl1-deficient hearts. Mechanistically, Ufl1 depletion impaired (PKR-like ER-resident kinase) signaling and aggravated cardiomyocyte cell death after ER stress. Administration of the chemical ER chaperone  to Ufl1-deficient mice alleviated ER stress and attenuated pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction.Our results advance a novel concept that the Ufm1 system is essential for cardiac homeostasis through regulation of ER function and that upregulation of myocardial Ufl1 could be protective against heart failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111318>Peroxiredoxin I maintains luteal function by regulating unfolded protein response.</a></h2><p>Mounting evidence shows that ROS regulation by various antioxidants is essential for the expression of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis and maintenance of progesterone production by the corpus luteum (CL). However, the underlying mechanisms of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), an antioxidant enzyme, in luteal function for progesterone production in mice have not been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional link between PRDX1 and progesterone production in the CL of Prdx1 knockout (K/O) mice in the functional stage of CL.The expression pattern of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis related genes and peroxiredoxins 1 (PRDX1) were investigated by western blotting analysis in CL tissue of 10 weeks mice during functional stage of CL. The protein levels of these genes after ER-stress inducer tunicamycin (Tm), ER-stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) and ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) stimulation by intraperitoneal (i.p) injection were also investigated in CL tissue of wild type (WT) mice. Finally, we examined progesterone production and UPR signaling related gene expression in CL tissue of Prdx1 K/O mice.We demonstrated that PRDX1 deficiency in the functional stage activates the UPR signaling pathways in response to ER stress-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, CL number, serum progesterone levels, and steroidogenic enzyme expression in Prdx1 K/O mice decreased significantly, compared to those in wild type mice. Levels of UPR signaling pathway markers (GRP78/BIP, P50ATF6, and phosphorylated (p)-eIF2) and ER-stress associated apoptotic factors (CHOP, p-JNK, and cleaved caspase-3) were dramatically increased in the CL tissue of Prdx1 K/O mice. In addition, administration of the NAC, reduced progesterone production and activated ER-stress-induced UPR signaling in the CL tissue obtained from the ovary of Prdx1 K/O mice. Taken together, these results indicated that reduction in serum progesterone levels and activation of ER-stress-induced UPR signaling are restored by NAC injection in the CL of Prdx1 K/O mice.These observations provide the first evidence regarding the basic mechanisms connecting PRDX1 and progesterone production in the functional stage of CL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238983> suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress in the chondrocytes of patients with osteoarthritis.</a></h2><p>The main pathogenic events in osteoarthritis (OA) include loss and abnormal remodeling of cartilage extracellular matrix. The present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of  on chondrocyte apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Articular cartilage tissues were collected from 18 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty and were analyzed histologically. Subsequently, chondrocyte apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were employed to evaluate gene and protein expression, respectively, of ER stress markers, including glucose‑regulated protein 78 (GRP78), growth arrest and DNA‑damage‑inducible gene 153 (GADD153) and caspase‑12 along with type II collagen. Chondrocytes obtained from osteoarthritis patients at different stages were cultured in three conditions including: No treatment (CON group), tunicamycin treatment to induce ER stress (ERS group) and  treatment after 4 h of tunicamycin (TDA group); and cell proliferation, apoptosis, function and ER stress level were assessed. Degradation of cartilage resulted in histological damage with more apoptotic cartilage cells observed. Of note, GRP78, GADD153 and caspase‑12 mRNA and protein expression increased gradually from grade I to III cartilage tissue, while type II collagen expression decreased. Tunicamycin induced ER stress, as shown by a high expression of ER stress markers, reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decreased synthesis of type II collagen. Notably,  treatment resulted in the improvement of tunicamycin‑induced ER stress.

Neuropathic pain may result from spinal dorsal horn (SDH) ER stress. In this study, we examined the cause-effect relationship between ER stress and neuropathic pain using the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rat model. We showed that ER stress was mutually promotive with oxidative stress during the process. We also tested the hypothesis that spinal sensitization arose from reduced activities of GABA-ergic interneurons and that spinal sensitization was mediated by SDH ER stress. Other important findings in this study including the following: (1) nociceptive behavior was alleviated in SNL rat as long as  injections were repeated to inhibit ER stress; (2) inducing SDH ER stress in healthy rat resulted in mechanical hyperalgesia; (3) blocking protein disulfide isomerase pharmacologically reduced ER stress and nociceptive behavior in SNL rat; (4) cells in the dorsal horn with elevated ER stress were mainly neurons; and (5) whole-cell recordings made in slide preparations revealed significant inhibition of GABA-ergic interneuron activity in the dorsal horn with ER stress vs in the healthy dorsal horn. Taken together, results of the current study demonstrate that coregulation of ER stress and oxidative stress played an important role in neuropathic pain process. Inhibiting SDH ER stress could be a potential novel strategy to manage neuropathic pain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728112>Connexin32 plays a crucial role in ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress apoptosis signaling pathway in ischemia reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury.</a></h2><p>Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) not only prolongs the length of hospital stay, but also seriously affects the patient's survival rate. Although our previous investigation has verified that reactive oxygen species (ROS) transferred through gap junction composed of connexin32 (Cx32) contributed to AKI, its underlying mechanisms were not fully understood and viable preventive or therapeutic regimens were still lacking. Among various mechanisms involved in organs I/R-induced injuries, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related apoptosis is currently considered to be an important participant. Thus, in present study, we focused on the underlying mechanisms of I/R-induced AKI, and postulated that Cx32 mediated ROS/ERS/apoptosis signal pathway activation played an important part in I/R-induced AKI.We established renal I/R models with Cx32 and Cx32 mice, which underwent double kidneys clamping and recanalization. ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) and ERS inhibitors (4-phenyl butyric acid, 4-PBA, and , TUDCA) were used to decrease the content of ROS and attenuate ERS activation, respectively.Renal damage was progressively exacerbated in a time-dependent manner at the reperfusion stage, that was consistent with the alternation of ERS activation, including glucose regulated protein 78 (BiP/GRP78), X box-binding protein1, and C/EBP homologous protein expression. TUDCA or 4-PBA application attenuated I/R-induced ERS activation and protected against renal tubular epithelial cells apoptosis and renal damage. Cx32 deficiency decreased ROS generation and distribution between the neighboring cells, which attenuated I/R-induced ERS activation, and improved cell apoptosis and renal damage.Cx32 mediated ROS/ERS/apoptosis signal pathway activation played an important part in I/R-induced AKI.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a local factor that affects various cellular events during a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological conditions. It may also be an important determinant of pro-fibrotic remodeling during tissue fibrosis. In the present study, we showed that ER stress was activated in granulosa cells of PCOS patients as well as in a well-established PCOS mouse model. Pharmacological inducers of ER stress, tunicamycin and thapsigargin, were found to increase the expression of pro-fibrotic growth factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, in human granulosa cells, and their expression also increased in granulosa cells of PCOS patients. By contrast, treatment of PCOS mice with an ER stress inhibitor,  or BGP-15, decreased interstitial fibrosis and collagen deposition in ovaries, accompanied by a reduction in TGF-β1 expression in granulosa cells. These findings suggest that ER stress in granulosa cells of women with PCOS contributes to the induction of pro-fibrotic growth factors during ovarian fibrosis, and that ER stress may serve as a therapeutic target in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068282>[Bortezomib and obatoclax for dual blockade of protein degradation  show synergistic anti-tumor effect in human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells].</a></h2><p>To explore whether bortezomib and a Bcl-2 inhibitor exhibit synergistic anti-tumor effect in human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia cells.MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of bortezomib in the absence or presence of Bcl-2 inhibitors (obatoclax, AT-101 and ABT-199) in Jurkat cells. The effects of drug treatment on the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, LC3B, p62, ubiquitin, BiP/Grp78, p-JNK, p-p38 and CHOP proteins were examined by Western blotting. Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of bortezomib and Bcl-2 inhibitors (obatoclax, AT-101 and ABT-199) on cell apoptosis. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of the key regulatory factors of unfolded protein reaction (UPR). A zebrafish xenograft model was used to study the anti-tumor effect of bortezomib, obatoclax and their combination in vivo.Bortezomib or Bcl-2 inhibitors alone inhibited the cell viability of Jurkat cells, but only obatoclax and bortezomib showed synergistic cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effect. Obatoclax, rather than AT-101 and ABT- 199, blocked autophagic flux in the cells evidenced by concomitant accumulation of LC3B-Ⅱ and p62. Both bortezomib and obatoclax alone caused accumulation of polyubiquinated proteins, and their combination showed a synergistic effect, which was consistent with their synergistic cytotoxicity. The dual blockade of proteasome and autophagy by the combination of bortezomib and obatoclax triggered unfolded protein response followed by cell apoptosis. Preventing UPS dysfunction by  (TUDCA) significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effect of bortezomib in combination with obatoclax.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the mechanism by which MC-LR induces developmental toxicity is through activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. MC-LR (4.0 μM) exposure through submersion caused serious developmental toxicity, such as malformation, growth delay and decreased heart rates in zebrafish larvae, which could be inhibited by ER stress blocker,  (TUDCA, 20 μM). Meanwhile, acridine orange (AO) staining showed TUDCA could rescue cell apoptosis in heart area in zebrafish larvae resulted by MC-LR exposure. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) analysis demonstrated that MC-LR induced activation of ER stress which consequently triggered apoptosis in zebrafish larvae. Protein expression examined by western blot indicated that MC-LR could activate MAPK8/Bcl-2/Bax pathway and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in zebrafish larva and the effects were mitigated by inhibition of ER stress. Taken together, the results observed in this study suggested that ER stress plays a critical role in developmental toxicity and apoptosis in zebrafish embryos exposed to MC-LR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Male Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with  (400 mg/kg) or saline solution, once per day for 3 days before surgery, and then the model of hepatic I/R injury was established. Blood and liver samples were collected from each group at 3, 6, and 24 h after surgery. Liver pathological changes, liver function, hepatocyte apoptosis and proinflammatory factors were detected. KCs were extracted, cultured and treated with TUDCA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then viability and phagocytosis were examined. Additionally, IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity and AML cell apoptosis were detected. The results showed that TUDCA alleviated hepatic I/R injury, the level of liver function markers, and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effects of KCs were suppressed by down-regulating IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vivo. TUDCA dose-dependently suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors and IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vitro, consistent with the in vivo results. Therefore, TUDCA can effectively alleviate hepatic IR injury by down-regulating the activity of the IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway to suppress the function of KCs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Searching new agents with better antidepressant-like activities is of great significance for depression therapy.  (TUDCA), a clinical drug for gallstone treatment, possesses neuroprotective effects in different brain disorders. However, whether it affects depression remains unclear. We addressed this issue by evaluating the effect of TUDCA on depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Results showed that TUDCA treatment at 200 but not 100 mg/kg prevented the 5 weeks of CUS-induced increases in the immobile time of C57BL6/J mice in the experiments of forced swimming test and tail suspension test as well as the CUS-induced decrease in sucrose intake and crossing numbers in the open-field test, and did not enhance the antidepressant-like effect of fluoxetine. Attenuation of neuroinflammation may be involved in the antidepressant-like effect of TUDCA, as TUDCA treatment (200 mg/kg) normalized the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The increases in inflammasome and microglial activation markers, including interleukin-β, nod-like receptor protein 3, and Iba-1, in CUS-treated mice were reduced by TUDCA treatment (200 mg/kg). TUDCA treatment (200 mg/kg) also normalized the changes in markers reflecting the oxidative-nitrosative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by CUS, such as nitric oxide, reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde, glucose-regulated protein 78, and C/EBP homologous protein. These results revealed that TUDCA improved the CUS-induced depression-like behaviors likely through attenuation of neuroinflammation, oxido-nitrosative, and ER stress.© 2018 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121477>Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Induce Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Autophagic Cell Death via Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Disruption in Normal Lung Cells.</a></h2><p>Nanomaterials are used in diverse fields including food, cosmetic, and medical industries.

Here, we report the toxicological mechanism of TiO2-NP in cell organelles. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were exposed to 50 and 100 μg/mL TiO2-NP for 24 and 48 h. Our results showed that TiO2-NP induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the cells and disrupted the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) and calcium ion balance, thereby increasing autophagy. In contrast, an inhibitor of ER stress,  (TUDCA), mitigated the cellular toxic response, suggesting that TiO2-NP promoted toxicity via ER stress.

As 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF) 4 reduces vascular injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion or diabetes, and flavonols have been demonstrated to attenuate ER stress, we investigated whether DiOHF can protect mice from ER stress-induced endothelial dysfunction. Male C57BLK/6 J mice were injected with tunicamycin to induce ER stress in the presence or absence of either DiOHF or  (TUDCA), an inhibitor of ER stress. Tunicamycin elevated blood pressure and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Moreover, in aortae there was evidence of ER stress, oxidative stress and reduced NO production. This was coincident with increased NOX2 expression and reduced phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) on Ser1176. Importantly, the effects of tunicamycin were significantly ameliorated by DiOHF or TUDCA. DiOHF also inhibited tunicamycin-induced ER stress and apoptosis in cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC). These results provide evidence that ER stress is likely an important initiator of endothelial dysfunction through the induction of oxidative stress and a reduction in NO synthesis and that DiOHF directly protects against ER stress- induced injury. DiOHF may be useful to prevent ER and oxidative stress to preserve endothelial function, for example in hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26234558>Diabetes and Age-Related Differences in Vascular Function of Renal Artery: Possible Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>To study the time-course relationship between vascular functions and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in type 2 diabetes, we investigated vascular function and associated protein expression, including cyclo-oxygenase (COX), ER stress, and apoptotic markers, in renal arteries (RA) from type 2 diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats at the young adult (4 months old) and aged (18 months old) stages. In the RA of aged OLETF (vs. young OLETF), we found: (1) Increased contractions induced by uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (Up4A) and phenylephrine, (2) decreased relaxation and increased contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) at lower and higher concentrations, respectively, and (3) increased expression of COX-1 and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP, a pro-apoptotic protein). In aged rats, the expression of COX-1, COX-2, PDI (an ER protein disulfide isomerase), Bax (a proapoptotic marker), and CHOP were increased in RA from OLETF rats (vs. age-matched control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka [LETO] rats). Up-regulation of PDI and Bax were seen in the RA from young OLETF (vs. young LETO) rats. No age-related alterations were apparent in the above changes in RA from LETO rats, excluding ACh-induced contraction. Short-term treatment with the ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA, 100 mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally for 1 week) to OLETF rats at the chronic stage of the disease (12 months old) could suppress renal arterial contractions induced by Up4A and ACh. These results suggest that a long-term duration of disease may be important for the development of vascular dysfunction rather than aging per se. The early regulation of ER stress may be important against the development of diabetes-associated vascular dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28117681>Modulation of the Unfolded Protein Response by  Counteracts Apoptotic Cell Death and Fibrosis in a Mouse Model for Secondary Biliary Liver Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>The role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cholestatic liver disease and fibrosis is not fully unraveled.  (TUDCA), a hydrophilic bile acid, has been shown to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and counteract apoptosis in different pathologies. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of TUDCA in experimental secondary biliary liver fibrosis in mice, induced by common bile duct ligation. The kinetics of the hepatic UPR and apoptosis during the development of biliary fibrosis was studied by measuring markers at six different timepoints post-surgery by qPCR and Western blot. Next, we investigated the therapeutic potential of TUDCA, 10 mg/kg/day in drinking water, on liver damage (AST/ALT levels) and fibrosis (Sirius red-staining), in both a preventive and therapeutic setting. Common bile duct ligation resulted in the increased protein expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) at all timepoints, along with upregulation of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and 12, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRsf1a) and Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD) expression. Treatment with TUDCA led to a significant reduction of liver fibrosis, accompanied by a slight reduction of liver damage, decreased hepatic protein expression of CHOP and reduced gene and protein expression of pro-apoptotic markers. These data indicate that TUDCA exerts a beneficial effect on liver fibrosis in a model of cholestatic liver disease, and suggest that this effect might, at least in part, be attributed to decreased hepatic UPR signaling and apoptotic cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179450>Tauroursodeoxycholate improves 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced experimental acute ulcerative colitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic nonspecific inflammatory disease of unknown cause. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of tauroursodeoxycholate in 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced experimental colitis in mice. After the induction of colitis for 24h, the mice were administrated orally with tauroursodeoxycholate (20, 40 and 60mg/kg) and sulfasalazine (500mg/kg) by gavage for 7 consecutive days. The inhibition effects were evaluated by the body of weight change, survival rate, macroscopical and histological evaluations. Besides, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in colon tissue were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment with different doses of tauroursodeoxycholate (20, 40 and 60mg/kg) significantly improved the body weight change, decreased the macroscopic and histopathological scores. Compared with the model group, the accumulation of MPO activity, the colonic tissue levels of IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α were significantly reduced in the tauroursodeoxycholate treated groups. Moreover, tauroursodeoxycholate assuaged the symptoms of colitis. These results suggested that tauroursodeoxycholate has an anti-inflammatory effect in TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In rat beta cells, cytokine-induced ER stress involves NO production and consequent inhibition of the ER Ca(2+) transporting ATPase sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump 2 (SERCA2B). However, the mechanisms by which cytokines induce ER stress and apoptosis in mouse and human pancreatic beta cells remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of ER stress on cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis in these three species and thus solve ongoing controversies in the field.Rat and mouse insulin-producing cells, human pancreatic islets and human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed to the cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, with or without NO inhibition. A global comparison of cytokine-modulated gene expression in human, mouse and rat beta cells was also performed. The chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) and suppression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were used to assess the role of ER stress in cytokine-induced apoptosis of human beta cells.NO plays a key role in cytokine-induced ER stress in rat islets, but not in mouse or human islets. Bioinformatics analysis indicated greater similarity between human and mouse than between human and rat global gene expression after cytokine exposure. The chemical chaperone TUDCA and suppression of CHOP or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protected human beta cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis.These observations clarify previous results that were discrepant owing to the use of islets from different species, and confirm that cytokine-induced ER stress contributes to human beta cell death, at least in part via JNK activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27496879>Endoplasmic reticulum stress increases brain MAPK signaling, inflammation and renin-angiotensin system activity and sympathetic nerve activity in heart failure.</a></h2><p>We previously reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is induced in the subfornical organ (SFO) and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of heart failure (HF) rats and is reduced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The present study further examined the relationship between brain MAPK signaling, ER stress, and sympathetic excitation in HF. Sham-operated (Sham) and HF rats received a 4-wk intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of vehicle (Veh) or the ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA, 10 μg/day). Lower mRNA levels of the ER stress biomarkers GRP78, ATF6, ATF4, and XBP-1s in the SFO and PVN of TUDCA-treated HF rats validated the efficacy of the TUDCA dose. The elevated levels of phosphorylated p44/42 and p38 MAPK in SFO and PVN of Veh-treated HF rats, compared with Sham rats, were significantly reduced in TUDCA-treated HF rats as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Plasma norepinephrine levels were higher in Veh-treated HF rats, compared with Veh-treated Sham rats, and were significantly lower in the TUDCA-treated HF rats. TUDCA-treated HF rats also had lower mRNA levels for angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and NF-κB p65, and a higher mRNA level of IκB-α, in the SFO and PVN than Veh-treated HF rats. These data suggest that ER stress contributes to the augmented sympathetic activity in HF by inducing MAPK signaling, thereby promoting inflammation and renin-angiotensin system activity in key cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771505>Neurotoxic effects of MPTP on mouse cerebral cortex: Modulation of neuroinflammation as a neuroprotective strategy.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by the presence of intracellular inclusions, known as Lewy bodies. Despite SNpc being considered the primary affected region in PD, the neuropathological features are confined solely to the nigro-striatal axis. With disease progression other brain regions are also affected, namely the cerebral cortex, although the spreading of the neurologic damage to this region is still not completely unraveled.  (TUDCA) is an endogenous bile acid that has been shown to have antioxidant properties and to exhibit a neuroprotective effect in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model of PD. Moreover, TUDCA anti-inflammatory properties have been reported in glial cells, making it a prominent therapeutic agent in PD. Here, we used C57BL/6 mice injected with MPTP in a sub-acute paradigm aiming to investigate if the neurotoxic effects of MPTP could be extended to the cerebral cortex. In parallel, we evaluated the anti-oxidant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of TUDCA. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms elicited by TUDCA were further dissected in microglia cells. Our results show that MPTP leads to a decrease of ATP and activated AMP-activated protein kinase levels in mice cortex, and to a transient increase in the expression of antioxidant downstream targets of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf-2), and parkin. Notably, MPTP increases pro-inflammatory markers, while down-regulating the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein Annexin-A1 (ANXA1). Importantly, we show that TUDCA treatment prevents the deleterious effects of MPTP, sustains increased levels of antioxidant enzymes and parkin, and most of all negatively modulates neuroinflammation and up-regulates ANXA1 expression. Additionally, results from cellular models using microglia corroborate TUDCA modulation of ANXA1 synthesis, linking inhibition of neuroinflammation and neuroprotection by TUDCA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The liver is the major site for insulin degradation, a process mainly coordinated by the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). The beneficial effects of taurine conjugated bile acid (TUDCA) on insulin secretion as well as insulin sensitivity have been recently described. However, the possible role of TUDCA in insulin clearance had not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrated that 15 days treatment with TUDCA reestablished plasma insulin to physiological concentrations in high fat diet (HFD) mice, a phenomenon associated with increased insulin clearance and liver IDE expression. TUDCA also increased IDE expression in human hepatic cell line HepG2. This effect was not observed in the presence of an inhibitor of the hepatic membrane bile acid receptor, S1PR2, nor when its downstream proteins were inhibited, including IR, PI3K and Akt. These results indicate that treatment with TUDCA may be helpful to counteract obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia through increasing insulin clearance, likely through enhanced liver IDE expression in a mechanism dependent on S1PR2-Insulin pathway activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28190264>Inflammatory stress of pancreatic beta cells drives release of extracellular heat-shock protein 90α.</a></h2><p>A major obstacle in predicting and preventing the development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) in at-risk individuals is the lack of well-established early biomarkers indicative of ongoing beta cell stress during the pre-clinical phase of disease. Recently, serum levels of the α cytoplasmic isoform of heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) were shown to be elevated in individuals with new-onset T1D. We therefore hypothesized that hsp90α could be released from beta cells in response to cellular stress and inflammation associated with the earliest stages of T1D. Here, human beta cell lines and cadaveric islets released hsp90α in response to stress induced by treatment with a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ. Mechanistically, hsp90α release was found to be driven by cytokine-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a pathway that can eventually lead to beta cell apoptosis. Cytokine-induced beta cell hsp90α release and JNK activation were significantly reduced by pre-treating cells with the endoplasmic reticulum stress-mitigating chemical chaperone . The hsp90α release by cells may therefore be a sensitive indicator of stress during inflammation and a useful tool in assessing therapeutic mitigation of cytokine-induced cell damage linked to autoimmunity.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26044599>Tauroursodeoxycholate Protects Rat Hepatocytes from Bile Acid-Induced Apoptosis via β1-Integrin- and Protein Kinase A-Dependent Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid, which in vivo is rapidly converted into its taurine conjugate, is frequently used for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. Apart from its choleretic effects, tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) can protect hepatocytes from bile acid-induced apoptosis, but the mechanisms underlying its anti-apoptotic effects are poorly understood.These mechanisms were investigated in perfused rat liver and isolated rat hepatocytes.It was found that TUDC inhibited the glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced activation of the CD95 death receptor at the level of association between CD95 and the epidermal growth factor receptor. This was due to a rapid TUDC-induced β1-integrin-dependent cyclic AMP (cAMP) signal with induction of the dual specificity mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), which prevented GCDC-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and c-jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Furthermore, TUDC induced a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated serine/threonine phosphorylation of the CD95, which was recently identified as an internalization signal for CD95. Furthermore, TUDC inhibited GCDC-induced CD95 targeting to the plasma membrane in a β1-integrin-and PKA-dependent manner. In line with this, the β1-integrin siRNA knockdown in sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp)-transfected HepG2 cells abolished the protective effect of TUDC against GCDC-induced apoptosis.TUDC exerts its anti-apoptotic effect via a β1-integrin-mediated formation of cAMP, which prevents CD95 activation by hydrophobic bile acids at the levels of JNK activation and CD95 serine/threonine phosphorylation.© 2015 S.

However, the role and mechanisms of ER stress in hypertension remain unclear. Thus, we hypothesized that enhanced ER stress contributes to the maintenance of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Sixteen-week old male SHRs and Wistar Kyoto Rats (WKYs) were used in this study. The SHRs were treated with ER stress inhibitor (; TUDCA, 100 mg/kg/day) for two weeks. There was a decrease in systolic blood pressure in SHR treated with TUDCA. The pressure-induced myogenic tone was significantly increased, whereas endothelium-dependent relaxation was significantly attenuated in SHR compared with WHY. Interestingly, treatment of ER stress inhibitor normalized myogenic responses and endothelium-dependent relaxation in SHR. These data were associated with an increase in expression or phosphorylation of ER stress markers (Bip, ATF6, CHOP, IRE1, XBP1, PERK, and eIF2α) in SHRs, which were reduced by TUDCA treatment. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MLC20 was increased in SHRs, which was reduced by the treatment of TUDCA.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation and chemical chaperones have been known to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve β-cell function and survival. The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate the chemical chaperone -conjugated exendin-4 as a protective agent for pancreatic β-cells. Mono--Lys-exendin-4 conjugate (TUM1-Ex4) showed better receptor binding affinity than other conjugates with strong in vitro insulinotropic activity in rat pancreatic β-cells and in vivo hypoglycemic activity in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In INS-1 cells under endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by thapsigargin, TUM1-Ex4 promoted cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. In western blot analysis, TUM1-Ex4 reduced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker GRP78 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. These results reveal that TUM1-Ex4 accelerates translational recovery and contributes to β-cell protection and survival. The present study indicates that the chemical chaperone-coupled glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist is a feasible therapeutic strategy to enhance β-cell function and survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the goal is usually dampened by the complexity of the biological matrices in terms of structural diversity, concentration span, and polarity range. We attempted herein to propose an analytical approach being able to circumvent these technical obstacles, and medicinal bile was employed as a proof of concept. In the liquid chromatography (LC) domain, reversed phase LC and hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography were coupled in series, namely RPLC-HILIC, to yield appropriate chromatographic behavior for each component regardless of the polarity. In-depth chemical characterization and widely quantitative analysis were successively conducted in the mass spectrometry (MS) domain. Hybrid ion trap-time of flight MS was jointly deployed with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap MS for metabolite searching because of their orthogonal natures. Afterwards, a tailored MRM strategy that integrated online parameter optimization, ion intensity tailoring, and scheduled monitoring, was subsequently constructed to accomplish comprehensive quantitation although authentic compounds weren't involved and concentration span was quite large. Calibration curve was constructed for each detected identity by preparing and serially diluting the universal metabolome standard (UMS) solution that merged chemical information from all bile samples. Quasi-contents of 164 components including bile acids, sterols, eicosanoids, amino acids, lipids, flavonoids, and so forth, were gained by applying those regressive calibration curves and replaced the role of peak areas to serve as the variables for multivariate statistical analysis. In particular, the concentration ratio between  (TUDCA) and taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) that were exactly co-eluted as a single peak was calculated from the intensity specific value of m/z 498 > 80 over 498 > 124. Different metabolome occurred among various animal bile samples, and significant variations were also observed for different batches of bear bile powders. Bile acids acted as the indicative components in either discrimination. Overall, RPLC-HILIC-tailored MRM enabled quantitative metabolome profiling of medicinal bile and was thereby a promising analytical tool for large-scale targeted metabolomics.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have shown that ER stress deregulates cholesterol metabolism via multiple pathways. This study aimed to determine the relationship between ER stress and lipid metabolism and to verify that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process.An atherosclerosis model was established in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed a Western diet, and THP-1 derived macrophages were used in this study. Hematoxylin-eosin and Oil Red O staining were used to quantify the atherosclerotic plaques. 1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate labeled oxidized low-density lipoprotein binding assay and a Cholesterol Efflux Fluorometric Assay Kit were used to observe cholesterol uptake and efflux. The mRNA and protein levels of biomarkers associated with ER stress and cholesterol metabolism in atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to observe alterations of ABCA1 localization. Small interfering RNAs were used to knock down CHOP and miR-33 in macrophages to alter CHOP and miR-33 expression.Atherosclerotic lesions and systemic lipid levels were ameliorated after inhibition of ER stress () in vivo. In vitro studies confirmed that ER stress regulated the lipid catabolism of macrophages by promoting cholesterol uptake, inhibiting cholesterol efflux, and modulating the expression of related transporters. CHOP contributed to lipid metabolism disorder following ER stress. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-33 was involved in ER stress that induced lipid metabolism disorder in macrophages. These findings support a model of ER stress induction by oxidized low-density lipoprotein that affects macrophage lipid catabolism disorder.Our data shed new light on the relationship between ER stress and lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro, and confirm that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process. The relationship between ER stress and miR-33 represents a novel target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The bile acid conjugate  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in different animal models of stroke and neurological diseases. We have previously shown that TUDCA has anti-inflammatory effects on glial cell cultures and in a mouse model of acute neuroinflammation. We show now that microglial cells (central nervous system resident macrophages) express the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) in vivo and in vitro. TUDCA binding to GPBAR1/TGR5 caused an increase in intracellular cAMP levels in microglia that induced anti-inflammatory markers, while reducing pro-inflammatory ones. This anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA was inhibited by small interference RNA for GPBAR1/TGR5 receptor, as well as by treatment with a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. In the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation, treating the animals with TUDCA was clearly anti-inflammatory. TUDCA biased the microglial phenotype in vivo and in vitro toward the anti-inflammatory. The bile acid receptor GPBAR1/TGR5 could be a new therapeutic target for pathologies coursing with neuroinflammation and microglia activation, such as traumatic brain injuries, stroke, or neurodegenerative diseases. TUDCA and other GPBAR1/TGR5 agonists need to be further investigated, to determine their potential in attenuating the neuropathologies associated with microglia activation. J. Cell.

We have previously shown the anti-inflammatory properties of TUDCA in an animal model of acute neuroinflammation. Here, we present a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of TUDCA through the regulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intravenously (iv) on TGFβ reporter mice (Smad-binding element (SBE)/Tk-Luc) to study in their brains the real-time activation profile of the TGFβ pathway in a non-invasive way. The activation of the TGFβ pathway in the brain of SBE/Tk-Luc mice increased 24 h after LPS injection, compared to control animals. This activation peak increased further in mice treated with both LPS and TUDCA than in mice treated with LPS only. The enhanced TGFβ activation in mice treated with LPS and TUDCA correlated with both an increase in TGFβ3 transcript in mouse brain and an increase in TGFβ3 immunoreactivity in microglia/macrophages, endothelial cells, and neurons. Inhibition of the TGFβ receptor with SB431542 drug reverted the effect of TUDCA on microglia/macrophages activation and on TGFβ3 immunoreactivity. Under inflammatory conditions, treatment with TUDCA enhanced further the activation of TGFβ pathway in mouse brain and increased the expression of TGFβ3. Therefore, the induction of TGFβ3 by TUDCA might act as a positive feedback, increasing the initial activation of the TGFβ pathway by the inflammatory stimulus. Our findings provide proof-of-concept that TGFβ contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA under neuroinflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268667>Ursodeoxycholic acid ameliorates diabetic retinopathy via reducing retinal inflammation and reversing the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the hydrolysis of , which is the main ingredient from bear gall that has functions including clearing heat and detoxification, and improving eyesight. However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice.

Although numerous studies have analyzed the migration of absorptive epithelial cells during wound healing, it remains unclear how goblet cells restitute and how MUC2 mucin production affects this process. In this study, we examined the role of high MUC2 production in goblet cell migration during wound healing and demonstrated that during high MUC2 output, goblet cells migrated slower because of impaired production of wound healing factors and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Two goblet cell lines, HT29-H and HT29-L, that produced high and low MUC2 mucin, respectively, were used. HT29-L healed wounds faster than HT29-H cells by producing significantly higher amounts of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1, FGF2, vascular endothelial growth factor-C, and matrix metallopeptidase 1. Predictably, treatment of HT29-H cells with recombinant FGF2 significantly enhanced migration and wound healing. High MUC2 biosynthesis in HT29-H cells induced ER stress and delayed migration that was abrogated by inhibiting ER stress with  and IL-22. FGF2- and IL-22-induced wound repair was dependent on STAT1 and STAT3 signaling. During wound healing after dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, restitution of Math1 goblet cells occurred earlier in the proximal colon, followed by the middle and then distal colon, where ulceration was severe. We conclude that high MUC2 output during colitis impairs goblet cell migration and wound healing by reducing production of growth factors critical in wound repair.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

We show that PPARδ is a crucial mediator for exercise to exert a beneficial effect on the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. In db/db mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas and flow-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries, whereas genetic ablation of Ppard abolished such improvements. Exercise induces AMPK activation and subsequent PPARδ activation, which help to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, thus increasing NO bioavailability in endothelial cells and vascular tissues. Chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric acid and  decrease ER stress and protect against endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. The results demonstrate that PPARδ-mediated inhibition of ER stress contributes to the vascular benefits of exercise and provides potentially effective targets for treating diabetic vasculopathy.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027487>Effect of  on PUFA levels and inflammation in an animal and cell model of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Rats were divided into control, tunicamycin (TM)-treated, and TM +  (TUDCA)-treated groups. Hepatic ER stress was induced by TM and the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA was injected 30 min before induction of ER stress. Liver THLE-3 cells were treated with TM and TUDCA was administered in advance to decrease cytotoxic effects. Necroinflammation was evaluated in liver sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein. Arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) in liver tissue and THLE-3 cells were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured in tissue and cell samples. Hepatic ER stress was accomplished by TM and was alleviated by TUDCA. TM treatment significantly decreased PUFAs in both liver and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. PLA2, COX, and PGE2 levels were significantly increased in TM-treated rats and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. TUDCA leads to a partial restoration of liver PUFA levels and decreased PLA2, COX, and PGE2. This study reports decreased PUFA levels in ER stress and supports the use of omega-3 fatty acids in liver diseases demonstrating ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044671>A SAL1 Loss-of-Function Arabidopsis Mutant Exhibits Enhanced Cadmium Tolerance in Association with Alleviation of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>SAL1, as a negative regulator of stress response signaling, has been studied extensively for its role in plant response to environmental stresses. However, the role of SAL1 in cadmium (Cd) stress response and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Using an Arabidopsis thaliana loss-of-function mutant of SAL1, we assessed Cd resistance and further explored the Cd toxicity mechanism through analysis of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. The loss of SAL1 function greatly improved Cd tolerance and significantly attenuated ER stress in Arabidopsis. Exposure to Cd induced an ER stress response in Arabidopsis as evidenced by unconventional splicing of AtbZIP60 and up-regulation of ER stress-responsive genes. Damage caused by Cd was markedly reduced in the ER stress response double mutant bzip28 bzip60 or by application of the ER stress-alleviating chemical agents,  (TUDCA) and 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), in wild-type plants. The Cd-induced ER stress in Arabidopsis was also alleviated by loss of function of SAL1. These results identified SAL1 as a new component mediating Cd toxicity and established the role of the ER stress response in Cd toxicity. Additionally, the attenuated ER stress in the sal1 mutant might also shed new light on the mechanism of diverse abiotic stress resistance in the SAL1 loss-of-function mutants.© The Author 2016.

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is known to be the most important OSA feature in terms of cardiovascular morbi-mortality. Since ER stress and HIF-1 are known to be involved in cardiomyocyte life or death, this study investigates the role of ER stress on HIF-1 activation in myocardial susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced by IH.C57Bl6J, HIF-1α(+/-) and their respective control mice were exposed to 14 days of IH (21-5% FiO2, 60 scycle, 8h/day). Myocardial inter-organelle calcium exchanges, ER stress and HIF-1 activity were investigated and in vivo I/R was performed to measure infarct size. In additional groups,  (TUDCA, 75 mg·kg(-1)), an ER stress inhibitor, was administered daily during exposure.In C57Bl6J mice, chronic IH induced an increase in ER-Ca(2+) content, ER stress markers and HIF-1 activity, associated with an enhanced infarct size (33.7 ± 9.4 vs. 61.0 ± 5.6% in N and IH, respectively, p<0.05). IH failed to increase infarct size in HIF-1α deficient mice (42.4 ± 2.7 and 24.7 ± 3.4% N and IH, respectively). Finally, TUDCA totally abolished the IH-induced increase in HIF-1 activity (1.3 ± 0.04 vs. 0.14 ± 0.02 fold increase in IH vs. IH-TUDCA respectively, p<0.0001) and in infarct size (55.5 ± 7.6 vs. 49.9 ± 3.0 in N-TUDCA and IH-TUDCA, respectively).This novel regulatory mechanism of HIF-1 activity by ER stress should be considered as a potential diagnostic tool for cardiovascular complications in OSA patients as well as a therapeutic target to limit myocardial ischemic damage.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) have not been investigated in MSS patient-derived cells.Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were established from four MSS patients. Spontaneous and tunicamycin-induced ER stress and the UPR were investigated in MSS-LCLs. Expression of UPR markers was analyzed by western blotting. ER stress-induced apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cytoprotective effects of ER stress modulators were also examined.MSS-LCLs exhibited increased spontaneous ER stress and were highly susceptible to ER stress-induced apoptosis.

Chemotherapy is able to improve the survival of CRPC patients. We previously found that NSC606985 (NSC), a highly water-soluble camptothecin analog, induced cell death in Pca cells via interaction with topoisomerase 1 and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. To further elucidate the role of NSC, we studied the effect of NSC on ER-stress and its association with NSC-induced cell death in Pca cells. NSC produced a time- and dose-dependent induction of GRP78, CHOP and XBP1s mRNA, and CHOP protein expression in Pca cells including DU145, indicating an activation of ER-stress. However, unlike conventional ER-stress in which GRP78 protein is increased, NSC produced a time- and dose-dependent U-shape change in GRP78 protein in DU145 cells. The NSC-induced decrease in GRP78 protein was blocked by protease inhibitors, N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucylnorleucinal (ALLN), a lysosomal protease inhibitor, and epoxomicin (EPO), a ubiquitin-protease inhibitor. ALLN, but not EPO, also partially inhibited NSC-induced cell death. However, both 4-PBA and TUDCA, two chemical chaperons that effectively reduced tunicamycin-induced ER-stress, failed to attenuate NSC-induced GRP78, CHOP and XBP1s mRNA expression and cell death. Moreover, knockdown of NSC induction of CHOP expression using a specific siRNA had no effect on NSC-induced cytochrome c release and NSC-induced cell death. These results suggest that NSC produced an atypical ER-stress that is dissociated from NSC-induced activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and NSC-induced cell death in DU145 prostate cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552716>Nrf2 activation by  in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the cause of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction and severe oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the cell death that characterizes the disease. Under oxidative stress, the master regulator of cellular redox status, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is responsible for activating the transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Nrf2 is a promising target to limit reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in PD. Here, we show that  (TUDCA) prevents both 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)- and α-synuclein-induced oxidative stress, through Nrf2 activation, in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, we used C57BL/6 male mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to elucidate the effect of TUDCA in this in vivo model of PD. In vivo, TUDCA treatment increases the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1, and Nrf2 downstream target antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and GPx. Moreover, we found that TUDCA enhances GPx activity in the brain. Altogether, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising agent to limit ROS-mediated damage, in different models of PD acting, at least in part, through modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, TUDCA should be considered a promising therapeutic agent to be implemented in PD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we reported the biotransformation of  (TUDCA) through Escherichia coli engineered with a two-step mimic biosynthetic pathway of TUDCA from taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA). Two 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7α-HSDH) and two 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7β-HSDH) genes (named as α, α, β, and β) were selected and synthesized to create four pathway variants using ePathBrick.

On the fifth day post-infection, an increase in the mRNA levels of binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) and X-box binding protein (XBP1), activation of XBP1/s, and an increase in percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in Muscovy duckling livers. The use of ER stress inducer Tunicamycin and ER stress inhibitor  demonstrated that MDRV induces apoptosis via ER stress, leading to apoptosis. The use of Tunicamycin increased viral protein synthesis while  reduced viral protein synthesis, suggesting that MDRV induces ER stress benefiting virus replication. The MDRV p10.8 is the major protein to induce ER stress and apoptosis. We found that p10.8 promotes the conversion of XBP1/u to XBP1/s and expands ER diameter, and increases the percentages of apoptotic cells in DF-1 and duckling liver tissues. To investigate the mechanism underlying the MDRV p10.8-induced ER stress and apoptosis, Western blot, siRNA, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed. We found that the MDRV p10.8 protein up-regulates Bip, p-IRE1, XBP1s, and cleaved-caspase 3. Co-IP results reveal that the MDRV p10.8 protein disassociates the Bip/IRE1 complex. Inhibition of IRE1 by 4-methyl umbelliferone 8-carbaldehyde (4u8c) dramatically reversed the MDRV p10.8-modulated increase in levels of XBP1s and cleaved-caspase 3. Knockdown of XBP1 by siRNA reversed the increased level of p10.8-modulated cleaved-caspase 3. The present study provides mechanistic insights into the MDRV p10.8 protein induces ER stress, resulting in apoptosis via the Bip/IRE1/XBP1 pathway in DF-1 cells and duckling livers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Genetic mutations or  extremes that cause long-term alteration of cellular homeostasis compromise protein folding efficiency. To maintain proteostasis, cells mobilized stress coping responses that include the unfolded protein response in order to prevent accumulation of improperly folded proteins that forms the basis of many diseases. In recent years, several small molecules commonly referred to as "chemical chaperones" (e.g., 4-phenylbutyric acid or 4-PBA, a modified fatty acid;  or TUDCA, a bile acid) have been identified that function to attenuate cellular stress and enhance protein processing. Here we illustrate that molecular chaperones and the so called "chemical chaperones" are distinct entities. We propose the term "proteostasis promoters" as a more accurate descriptor for a class of compounds that demonstrate ability to promote proteostasis by modulating the UPR and/or the function of chaperones.© 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(12):943-954, 2016.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27382986>Impairment of autophagy by TTR V30M aggregates: in vivo reversal by TUDCA and curcumin.</a></h2><p>Transthyretin (TTR)-related amyloidoses are diseases characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils and aggregates in tissues composed of insoluble misfolded TTR that becomes toxic. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of small compounds in preventing and reversing TTR V30M deposition in transgenic mice gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as lowering biomarkers associated with cellular stress and apoptotic mechanisms. In the present study we aimed to study TTR V30M aggregates effect in autophagy, a cellular mechanism crucial for cell survival that has been implicated in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases. We were able to demonstrate in cell culture that TTR V30M aggregates cause a partial impairment of the autophagic machinery as shown by p62 accumulation, whereas early steps of the autophagic flux remain unaffected as shown by autophagosome number evaluation and LC3 turnover assay. Our studies performed in TTR V30M transgenic animals demonstrated that  (TUDCA) and curcumin effectively reverse p62 accumulation in the GI tract pointing to the ability of both compounds to modulate autophagy additionally to mitigate apoptosis. Overall, our in vitro and in vivo studies establish an association between TTR V30M aggregates and autophagy impairment and suggest the use of autophagy modulators as an additional and alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of TTR V30M-related amyloidosis.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31298745>Characterization of Gut Microbiota, Bile Acid , and Cytokines in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a type of bile duct cancer, has a high mortality rate. Gut microbiota, bile acid (BA) , and cytokines have not been characterized in patients with ICC, and better noninvasive diagnostic approaches for ICC are essential to be established. Therefore, in this study we aimed to improve our understanding of changes in gut microbiota, BA , and cytokines in patients with ICC. We found that the α-diversities and β-diversities of ICC were highest and that the abundances of four genera (Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Alloscardovia) were increased in patients with ICC compared with those in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cirrhosis and in healthy individuals. The glycoursodeoxycholic acid and  (TUDCA) plasma-stool ratios were obviously increased in patients with ICC. Furthermore, the genera Lactobacillus and Alloscardovia that were positively correlated with TUDCA plasma-stool ratios were combined to discriminate ICC from the other three diseases. Vascular invasion (VI) frequently led to a poor prognosis in patients with ICC. Compared with patients with ICC without VI, patients with VI had a greater abundance of the family Ruminococcaceae, increased levels of plasma interleukin (IL)-4 and six conjugated BAs, and decreased levels of plasma IL-6 and chenodeoxycholic acid. A positive correlation between plasma taurocholic acid and IL-4 was observed in patients with ICC. Plasma TUDCA was negatively correlated with the abundance of the genus Pseudoramibacter and the survival time of patients with ICC, but had no effect on tumor size, as determined in two murine tumor models. Conclusion: In this study, we identified some biomarkers, including gut microbiota, BAs and inflammatory cytokines, for the diagnosis of ICC and prediction of VI in patients with ICC.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29689346>B-type natriuretic peptide attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress in H9c2 cardiomyocytes underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation injury under high glucose/high fat conditions.</a></h2><p>Exogenously administered B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been shown to provide cardioprotection against various heart diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study explores whether BNP exerts its cardioprotection against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury under high glucose/high fat (HG/HF) conditions in cardiac H9c2 cells and uncovers the underlying mechanisms. Our data revealed that BNP significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), with a maximal effect at the BNP concentration of 10 mol/L. In addition, by analyzing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 and by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, we showed that BNP attenuated H/R-induced cell apoptosis in HG/HF conditions. Western blot analysis showed enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like endoplastmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)(one of the three main signaling  in endoplastmic reticulum (ER) stress), and increased expression of GRP78 and CHOP proteins (ER stress-related proteins) in H9c2 cells which underwent H/R in HG/HF conditions. Treatment with BNP or 8-Br-cGMP (an analog of cGMP) reversed this activation. However, this effect was significantly weakened by KT-5823, a selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. In addition, similar to BNP, treatment with a specific inhibitor of ER stress  (TUDCA) protected the cells against H/R injury exposed to HG/HF conditions. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that BNP effectively protected cells against H/R injury under HG/HF conditions by inhibiting the ER stress via activation of the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It remains unknown whether BA  can be affected by heat stress (HS). The objective of this study was to describe the shifts in serum, hepatic and intestinal BA profiles induced by chronic HS. Twenty-seven Large White pigs weighing 40.8 ± 2.7 kg were assigned to one of the three treatments: a control group (CON, 23 °C), a HS group (33 °C), or a pair-fed group (PF, 23 °C and fed the same amount as HS group) for 21 d. The concentrations of taurine-conjugated BAs (TUDCA and THDCA in serum and TCDCA, TUDCA, THDCA and THCA in liver) were decreased in HS and PF pigs. However, in HS pigs, a reduction in taurine-conjugated BAs (TCBA) correlated with decreased liver genes expression of BA synthesis, conjugation and uptake transport. BA regulated-genes (FXR, TGR5 and FGFR4) in HS pigs and TGR5, FGFR4 and KLβ in PF pigs were down-regulated in liver. In ileum, total BAs and glycoursodeoxycholic acid concentrations were higher in HS pigs than other groups and PF group, respectively (P < 0.05). TCBA (P = 0.01) and  (P < 0.01) were decreased in PF group. BA transporters (OSTα and MRP3) were up-regulated in HS pigs compared with CON and PF pigs, respectively (P < 0.01). In cecum, ursodeoxycholic acid was higher in HS (P = 0.02) group than CON group. The expression of apical sodium-coupled bile acid transporter (P = 0.04) was lower in HS pigs than CON pigs, while OSTβ (P < 0.01) was greater in HS group than PF group. These results suggest that chronic HS suppressed liver activity of synthesis and uptake of TCBA, at least in part, which was independent of reduced feed intake.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The clinical expression of the disorder, usually occurring in young adults, is typically characterized by subacute, usually sequential, bilateral visual loss, resulting from the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. As the precise action of mitochondrial DNA mutations on the overall cell  in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is unknown, we investigated the metabolomic profile of the disease. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 188 metabolites in fibroblasts from 16 patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and eight healthy control subjects. Latent variable-based statistical methods were used to identify discriminating metabolites. One hundred and twenty-four of the metabolites were considered to be accurately quantified. A supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model separating patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy from control subjects showed good predictive capability (Q 2cumulated = 0.57). Thirty-eight metabolites appeared to be the most significant variables, defining a Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy  signature that revealed decreased concentrations of all proteinogenic amino acids, spermidine, putrescine, isovaleryl-carnitine, propionyl-carnitine and five sphingomyelin species, together with increased concentrations of 10 phosphatidylcholine species. This signature was not reproduced by the inhibition of complex I with rotenone or piericidin A in control fibroblasts. The importance of sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines in the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy signature, together with the decreased amino acid pool, suggested an involvement of the endoplasmic reticulum. This was confirmed by the significantly increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, as well as the greater expression of C/EBP homologous protein and the increased XBP1 splicing, in fibroblasts from affected patients, all these changes being reversed by the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, TUDCA (). Thus, our metabolomic analysis reveals a pharmacologically-reversible endoplasmic reticulum stress in complex I-related Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy fibroblasts, a finding that may open up new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy with endoplasmic reticulum-targeting drugs.© The Author (2016).

We hypothesized in this study that interferon alpha (IFNα) participates in the early stages of T1D development by triggering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To verify our hypothesis, human islets and human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed to IFNα and tested for ER stress markers, glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and insulin content. IFNα treatment induced upregulation of ER stress markers including Binding immunoglobulin Protein, phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, spliced- X-box binding protein-1, C/EBP homologous protein and activating transcription factor 4. Intriguingly, IFNα treatment did not impair GSIS but significantly decreased insulin production in both human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells. Furthermore, IFNα decreased the expression of both proinsulin convertase 1 and proinsulin convertase 2, suggesting an altered functional state of the beta cells characterized by a slower proinsulin-insulin conversion. Pretreatment of both human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells with chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric acid and  completely prevented IFNα effects, indicating an ER stress-mediated impairment of insulin production. We demonstrated for the first time that IFNα elicits ER stress in human beta cells providing a novel mechanistic role for this virus-induced cytokine in the development of T1D. Compounds targeting molecular processes altered in ER-stressed beta cells could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent IFNα-induced beta cell dysfunction in the early onset of T1D.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Autophagy, a major pathway for degradation of macromolecules in the vacuole, is activated by these stress agents in a manner dependent on inositol-requiring enzyme 1b (IRE1b), and delivers endoplasmic reticulum fragments to the vacuole for degradation. In this study, we examined the mechanism for activation of autophagy during endoplasmic reticulum stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. The chemical chaperones sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and  were found to reduce tunicamycin- or dithiothreitol-induced autophagy, but not autophagy caused by unrelated stresses. Similarly, over-expression of BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN PROTEIN (BIP), encoding a heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) molecular chaperone, reduced autophagy. Autophagy activated by heat stress was also found to be partially dependent on IRE1b and to be inhibited by sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, suggesting that heat-induced autophagy is due to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression in Arabidopsis of the misfolded protein mimics zeolin or a mutated form of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*) also induced autophagy in an IRE1b-dependent manner. Moreover, zeolin and CPY* partially co-localized with the autophagic body marker GFP-ATG8e, indicating delivery to the vacuole by autophagy. We conclude that accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum is a trigger for autophagy under conditions that cause endoplasmic reticulum stress.© 2015 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555> inhibits intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile acid-based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid  and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses, obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28426781> (TUDCA) attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling by reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Pressure overload in the heart induces pathological hypertrophy and is associated with cardiac dysfunction. Apoptosis and fibrosis signaling initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is known to contribute to these maladaptive effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether reduction of ERS by a known chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA) can attenuate pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Oral administration of TUDCA at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight (BW) in the TUDCA-TAC group reduced ERS markers (GRP78, p-PERK, and p-eIf2α), compared to the Vehicle (Veh)-TAC group. TUDCA administration, for 4 weeks after TAC significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy as shown by the reduced heart weight (HW) to BW ratio, and expression of hypertrophic marker genes (ANF, BNP, and α-SKA). Masson's trichrome staining showed that myocardial fibrosis and collagen deposition were also significantly reduced in the TUDCA-TAC group. We also found that TUDCA significantly decreased expression of TGF-β signaling proteins and collagen isoforms. TUDCA administration also reduced cardiac apoptosis and the related proteins in the TUDCA-TAC group. Microarray analysis followed by gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis demonstrated that extracellular matrix genes responsible for hypertrophy and fibrosis, and mitochondrial genes responsible for apoptosis and fatty acid  were significantly altered in the Veh-TAC group, but the alterations were normalized in the TUDCA-TAC group, suggesting potential of TUDCA in treatment of heart diseases related to pressure-overload.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499839>Administration of  enhances osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and bone regeneration.</a></h2><p>It is known that osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be promoted by suppression of adipogenesis of MSCs. We have recently found that the chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) significantly reduces adipogenesis of MSCs. In the present study, we examined whether TUDCA can promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) by regulating Integrin 5 (ITGA5) associated with activation of ERK1/2 signal pathway and thereby enhance bone tissue regeneration by reducing apoptosis and the inflammatory response. TUDCA treatment promoted in vitro osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs and in vivo bone tissue regeneration in a calvarial defect model, as confirmed by micro-computed tomography, histological staining, and immunohistochemistry for osteocalcin. In addition, TUDCA treatment significantly decreased apoptosis and the inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro, which is important to enhance bone tissue regeneration. These results indicate that TUDCA plays a critical role in enhancing osteogenesis of BMMSCs, and is therefore a potential alternative drug for bone tissue regeneration.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we determined the in vivo contribution of EGFRtk and ER stress in acute myocardial infarction induced by acute ischemia (40 min)-reperfusion (24 h) (I/R) injury in T2D (db/db) mice. We treated db/db mice with EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Mice were then subjected to myocardial I/R injury. The db/db mice developed a significant infarct after I/R injury. The inhibition of EGFRtk significantly reduced the infarct size and ER stress induction. We also determined that the inhibition of ER stress (, TUDCA, 150 mg/kg per day) in db/db significantly decrease the infarct size indicating that ER stress is a downstream mechanism to EGFRtk. Moreover, AG1478 and TUDCA reduced myocardium p38 and ERK1/2 MAP-kinases activity, and increased the activity of the pro-survival signaling cascade Akt. Additionally, the inhibition of EGFRtk and ER stress reduced cell apoptosis and the inflammation as indicated by the reduction in macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. We determined for the first time that the inhibition of EGFRtk protects T2D heart against I/R injury through ER stress-dependent mechanism. The cardioprotective effect of EGFRtk and ER stress inhibition involves the activation of survival pathway, and inhibition of apoptosis, and inflammation. Thus, targeting EGFRtk and ER stress has the potential for therapy to overcome myocardial infarction in T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669287> Attenuates Renal Tubular Injury in a Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>Renal tubular injury is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in diabetic nephropathy.  (TUDCA) is an effective inhibitor of ER stress. Here, we investigated the role of TUDCA in the progression of tubular injury in DN. For eight weeks, being treated with TUDCA at 250 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) twice a day, diabetic db/db mice had significantly reduced blood glucose, albuminuria and attenuated renal histopathology. These changes were associated with a significant decreased expression of ER stress markers. At the same time, diabetic db/db mice had more TUNEL-positive nuclei in the renal tubule, which were attenuated by TUDCA treatment, along with decreases in ER stress-associated apoptotic markers in the kidneys. In summary, the effect of TUDCA on tubular injury, in part, is associated with inhibition of ER stress in the kidneys of diabetic db/db mice. TUDCA shows potential as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of DN.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078979>Altered Expression of NF- κ B and SP1 after Exposure to Advanced Glycation End-Products and Effects of Neurotrophic Factors in AGEs Exposed Rat Retinas.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) on neurite regeneration, and also to determine the regenerative effects of different neurotrophic factors (NTFs) on rat retinal explants, the retinas of SD rats were cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels and incubated in 6 types of media: (1) serum-free control culture media; (2) 100 μg/mL AGEs-BSA media; (3) AGEs-BSA + 100 ng/mL neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) media; (4) AGEs-BSA + 100 ng/mL hepatocyte growth factor media; (5) AGEs-BSA + 100 ng/mL glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor media; or (6) AGEs-BSA + 100 µM  media. After 7 days, the number of regenerating neurites was counted. The explants were immunostained for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and specificity protein 1 (SP1). Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA. In retinas incubated with AGEs, the numbers of neurites were fewer than in control. All of the NTFs increased the number of neurites, and the increase was more significant in the NT-4 group. The number of NF-κB and SP1 immunopositive cells was higher in retinas exposed to AGEs than in control. All of the NTFs decreased the number of NF-κB immunopositive cells but did not significantly affect SP1 expression. These results demonstrate the potential of the NTFs as axoprotectants in AGEs exposed retinal neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28155228>HOP3, a member of the HOP family in Arabidopsis, interacts with BiP and plays a major role in the ER stress response.</a></h2><p>HSP70-HSP90 organizing protein (HOP) is a well-studied family of cytosolic cochaperones. However, the possible role of HOP during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and the identity of its interactors within the ER were not previously addressed in any eukaryote. We have demonstrated that Arabidopsis HOP3, whose function was not studied before, interacts in vivo with cytosolic HSP90 and HSP70, and, unexpectedly, with binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), a HSP70 ER-resident protein. Although BiP lacks the domain described in other eukaryotes for HOP-HSP70 binding, it interacts with HOP3 through a non-canonical association to its nucleotide binding domain. Consistent with this interaction with BiP, HOP3 is partially localized at the ER. Moreover, HOP3 is induced both at transcript and protein levels by unfolded protein response (UPR) inducer agents by a mechanism dependent on inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Importantly, hop3 loss-of-function mutants show a reduction in pollen germination and a hypersensitive phenotype in the presence of ER stress inducer agents, a phenotype that is reverted by the addition of the chemical chaperone  (TUDCA). All these data demonstrate, for the first time in any eukaryote, a main role of HOP as an important regulator of the ER stress response, a process intimately linked in plants to important specific developmental programs and to environmental stress sensing and response.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27122157>Chronology of UPR activation in skeletal muscle adaptations to chronic contractile activity.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (UPR(mt) and UPR(ER)) are important for cellular homeostasis during stimulus-induced increases in protein synthesis. Exercise triggers the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). To investigate the role of the UPR in exercise-induced adaptations, we subjected rats to 3 h of chronic contractile activity (CCA) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days followed by 3 h of recovery. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, through PGC-1α mRNA, increased 14-fold after 1 day of CCA. This resulted in 10-32% increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, between days 3 and 7, as well as increases in the autophagic degradation of p62 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (LC3)-II protein. Before these adaptations, the UPR(ER) transcripts activating transcription factor-4, spliced X-box-binding protein 1, and binding immunoglobulin protein were elevated (1.3- to 3.8-fold) at days 1-3, while CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 were elevated at mRNA and protein levels (1.5- to 3.9-fold) at days 1-7 of CCA. The mitochondrial chaperones 10-kDa chaperonin, HSP60, and 75-kDa mitochondrial HSP, the protease ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit, and the regulatory protein sirtuin-3 of the UPR(mt) were concurrently induced 10-80% between days 1 and 7 To test the role of the UPR in CCA-induced remodeling, we treated animals with the endoplasmic reticulum stress suppressor  and subjected them to 2 or 7 days of CCA.  attenuated CHOP and HSP70 protein induction; however, this failed to impact mitochondrial remodeling. Our data indicate that signaling to the UPR is rapidly activated following acute contractile activity, that this is attenuated with repeated bouts, and that the UPR is involved in chronic adaptations to CCA; however, this appears to be independent of CHOP signaling.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26522062>Toll-like receptor 4-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to impairment of vasodilator action of insulin.</a></h2><p>Impairment of vasodilator action of insulin is associated with endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces proinflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) activate TLR4, which induces ER stress and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we determined whether TLR4-mediated ER stress is an obligatory step mediating SFA-induced endothelial dysfunction. Palmitate stimulated proinflammatory responses and ER stress, and this was suppressed by knockdown of TLR4 in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Next, we examined the role of TLR4 in vasodilatory responses in intact vessels isolated from wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and TLR4-KO mice after feeding high-fat (HFD) or normal chow diet (NCD) for 12 wk. Arterioles isolated from HFD WT mice exhibited impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation compared with arterioles isolated from NCD WT mice. Deficiency of TLR4 was protective from HFD-induced impairment of insulin-stimulated vasodilation. There were no differences in acetylcholine (Ach)- or sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-stimulated vasodilation between the two groups. Furthermore, we examined whether ER stress is involved in SFA-induced impairment of vasodilator actions of insulin. Infusion of palmitate showed the impairment of vasodilatory response to insulin, which was ameliorated by coinfusion with  (TUDCA), an ER stress suppressor. Taken together, the results suggest that TLR4-induced ER stress may be an obligatory step mediating the SFA-mediated endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28165466> protects bile acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and dampens Crohn's disease-like ileitis.</a></h2><p>Bile acids regulate the expression of intestinal bile acid transporters and are natural ligands for nuclear receptors controlling inflammation. Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether  (TUDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile acid transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile acid transporters apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile acid homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile acid transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental colitis, we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26709511>Angiotensin 1-7 Protects against Angiotensin II-Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Endothelial Dysfunction via Mas Receptor.</a></h2><p>Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) counter-regulates the cardiovascular actions of angiotensin II (Ang II). The present study investigated the protective effect of Ang 1-7 against Ang II-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and endothelial dysfunction. Ex vivo treatment with Ang II (0.5 μM, 24 hours) impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in mouse aortas; this harmful effect of Ang II was reversed by co-treatment with ER stress inhibitors, l4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) and  (TUDCA) as well as Ang 1-7. The Mas receptor antagonist, A779, antagonized the effect of Ang 1-7. The elevated mRNA expression of CHOP, Grp78 and ATF4 or protein expression of p-eIF2α and ATF6 (ER stress markers) in Ang II-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse aortas were blunted by co-treatment with Ang 1-7 and the latter effect was reversed by A779. Furthermore, Ang II-induced reduction in both eNOS phosphorylation and NO production was inhibited by Ang 1-7. In addition, Ang 1-7 decreased the levels of ER stress markers and augmented NO production in HUVECs treated with ER stress inducer, tunicamycin. The present study provides new evidence for functional antagonism between the two arms of the renin-angiotensin system in endothelial cells by demonstrating that Ang 1-7 ameliorates Ang II-stimulated ER stress to raise NO bioavailability, and subsequently preserves endothelial function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30246717>Role of X-Box Binding Protein-1 in Fructose-Induced   in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>A high consumption of fructose leads to hepatic steatosis. About 20-30% of triglycerides are synthesized via de novo . Some studies showed that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is involved in this process, while others showed that a lipotoxic environment directly influences ER homeostasis. Here, our aim was to investigate the causal relationship between ERS and fatty acid synthesis and the effect of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), one marker of ERS, on hepatic lipid accumulation stimulated by high fructose.HepG2 cells were incubated with different concentrations of fructose. Upstream regulators of de novo  (i.e., carbohydrate response element-binding protein [ChREBP] and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c [SREBP-1c]) were measured by polymerase chain reaction and key lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid synthase [FAS], and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 [SCD-1]) by Western blotting. The same -associated factors were then evaluated after exposure of HepG2 cells to high fructose followed by the ERS inhibitor  (TUDCA) or the ERS inducer thapsigargin. Finally, the same -associated factors were evaluated in HepG2 cells after XBP-1 upregulation or downregulation through cell transfection.Exposure to high fructose increased triglyceride levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner and significantly increased mRNA levels of SREBP-1c and ChREBP and protein levels of FAS, ACC, and SCD-1, concomitant with XBP-1 conversion to an active spliced form. -associated factors induced by high fructose were inhibited by TUDCA and induced by thapsigargin. Triglyceride level in XBP-1-deficient group decreased significantly compared with high-fructose group (4.41 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 6.52 ± 0.38 μmol/g, P < 0.001), as mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c (2.92 ± 0.46 vs. 5.08 ± 0.41, P < 0.01) and protein levels of FAS (0.53 ± 0.06 vs. 0.85 ± 0.05, P = 0.01), SCD-1 (0.65 ± 0.06 vs. 0.90 ± 0.04, P = 0.04), and ACC (0.38 ± 0.03 vs. 0.95 ± 0.06, P < 0.01) decreased.

Isolated rat hearts were subjected to 30-min regional ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP 78 or BIP), an ER homeostasis marker, was not increased during ischemia but was increased upon reperfusion, indicating that ER stress was initiated upon reperfusion but not during ischemia. The ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) given at reperfusion resulted in a significant reduction of GRP78 expression 30 and 60 min after the onset of reperfusion, an effect that was reversed by the zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN). The immunofluorescence study also showed that the effect of TUDCA on GRP78 expression was reversed by TPEN. TUDCA reduced infarct size and this was reversed by the mPTP opener atractyloside, indicating that ER stress inhibition may induce cardioprotection by modulating the mPTP opening. Experiments with transmission electron microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin staining also revealed that TUDCA prevented endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial damages at reperfusion, which was blocked by TPEN. Exposure of cardiac H9c2 cells to HO increased GRP 78 and GRP 94 expressions, suggesting that oxidative stress can induce ER stress. Cells treated with HO showed a significant decrease in tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) fluorescence, indicating that HO triggers the mPTP opening. In contrast, TUDCA prevented the loss of TMRE fluorescence, the effect that was blocked by TPEN, indicating a role of Zn in the preventive effect of ER stress inhibition on the mPTP opening. In support, TUDCA significantly increased intracellular free zinc. These data suggest that reperfusion but not ischemia initiates ER stress and inhibition of ER stress protects the heart from reperfusion injury through prevention of the mPTP opening. Increased intracellular free Zn accounts for the cardioprotective effect of ER stress inhibition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27853103>Endoplasmic reticulum stress is involved in 2,4-dichlorophenol-induced hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) is an environmental pollutant exhibiting a wide spectrum of toxic effects. We investigated the toxic effects and potential mechanisms underlying 2,4-DCP-induced hepatotoxicity. In vitro, 2,4-DCP caused hepatotoxicity manifested by a decrease in cell viability and inhibition of colony formation. Bip and CHOP expression was up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, 2,4-DCP induced eIF2α phosphorylation and Xbp1 mRNA splicing, indicating that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was activated after exposure of HL7702 cells to 2,4-DCP for 12 hr. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed and apoptosis was triggered after exposure to 2,4-DCP for 24 hr. In vivo, 2,4-DCP caused histological changes in the liver, and dramatically elevated the serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of mice. ER stress was also triggered in the liver of mice on days 1 and 3. The ER stress inhibitor TUDCA could partly relieve the liver damage, as indicated by the restoration of serum ALT and AST levels.

Exposure to TUDCA resulted in extensive epithelial apoptosis and reduced levels of phospho-IκB kinase in the colon. In HCT 116 cells stimulated with TNF-α, TUDCA significantly inhibited IL-8 and IL-1α expression and suppressed TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, in both HCT 116 and COLO 205 cells, TUDCA reduced cell viability and downregulated the expression of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF.These results demonstrated that TUDCA suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates colitis-associated tumorigenesis, suggesting that TUDCA could be a potential treatment for CAC.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27703259>Deficiency in Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) skews inflamed yet incompetent innate leukocytes in vivo during DSS-induced septic colitis.</a></h2><p>Functionally compromised neutrophils contribute to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with severe inflammation and injury such as colitis and sepsis. However, the ontogeny of dysfunctional neutrophil during septic colitis remain poorly understood. We report that the dysfunctional neutrophil may be derived by the suppression of Toll-interacting-protein (Tollip). We observed that Tollip deficient neutrophils had compromised migratory capacity toward bacterial product fMLF due to reduced activity of AKT and reduction of FPR2, reduced potential to generate bacterial-killing neutrophil extra-cellular trap (NET), and compromised bacterial killing activity. On the other hand, Tollip deficient neutrophils had elevated levels of CCR5, responsible for their homing to sterile inflamed tissues. The inflamed and incompetent neutrophil phenotype was also observed in vivo in Tollip deficient mice subjected to DSS-induced colitis. We observed that TUDCA, a compound capable of restoring Tollip cellular function, can potently alleviate the severity of DSS-induced colitis. In humans, we observed significantly reduced Tollip levels in peripheral blood collected from human colitis patients as compared to blood samples from healthy donors. Collectively, our data reveal a novel mechanism in Tollip alteration that underlies the inflamed and incompetent polarization of neutrophils leading to severe outcomes of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26892516>The bile acid TUDCA increases glucose-induced insulin secretion via the cAMP/PKA pathway in pancreatic beta cells.</a></h2><p>While bile acids are important for the digestion process, they also act as signaling molecules in many tissues, including the endocrine pancreas, which expresses specific bile acid receptors that regulate several cell functions. In this study, we investigated the effects of the conjugated bile acid TUDCA on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic β-cells.Pancreatic islets were isolated from 90-day-old male mice. Insulin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay, protein phosphorylation by western blot, Ca(2+) signals by fluorescence microscopy and ATP-dependent K(+) (KATP) channels by electrophysiology.TUDCA dose-dependently increased GSIS in fresh islets at stimulatory glucose concentrations but remained without effect at low glucose levels. This effect was not associated with changes in glucose , Ca(2+) signals or KATP channel activity; however, it was lost in the presence of a cAMP competitor or a PKA inhibitor. Additionally, PKA and CREB phosphorylation were observed after 1-hour incubation with TUDCA. The potentiation of GSIS was blunted by the Gα stimulatory, G protein subunit-specific inhibitor NF449 and mimicked by the specific TGR5 agonist INT-777, pointing to the involvement of the bile acid G protein-coupled receptor TGR5.Our data indicate that TUDCA potentiates GSIS through the cAMP/PKA pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Previous work in cell culture models demonstrate that high glucose results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and, in animal studies, ER stress has been implicated as a cause of endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that acute oral administration of  (TUDCA, 1500 mg), a chemical chaperone known to alleviate ER stress, would prevent hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. In 12 young healthy subjects (seven men, five women), brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed at baseline, and at 60 and 120 min after an oral glucose challenge. Subjects were tested on two separate visits in a single-blind randomized cross-over design: after oral ingestion of TUDCA or placebo capsules. FMD was reduced from baseline during hyperglycaemia under the placebo condition (-32% at 60 min and -28% at 120 min post oral glucose load; P<0.05 from baseline) but not under the TUDCA condition (-4% at 60 min and +0.3% at 120 min post oral glucose load; P>0.05 from baseline). Postprandial plasma glucose and insulin were not altered by TUDCA ingestion. Plasma oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) remained unaltered throughout the oral glucose challenge in both conditions. These results suggest that hyperglycaemia-induced endothelial dysfunction can be mitigated by oral administration of TUDCA, thus supporting the hypothesis that ER stress may contribute to endothelial dysfunction during postprandial hyperglycaemia.© 2016 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374067>Serum metabolome and targeted bile acid profiling reveals potential novel biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury.</a></h2><p>This study aims to determine the non-invasive, reliable and sensitive biochemical parameters for the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI).Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) were used to profile the serum metabolome and quantify 15 targeted bile acid metabolites, respectively, in samples obtained from 38 DILI patients and 30 healthy controls.A comparison of the resulting serum metabolome profiles of the study participants revealed significant differences between DILI patients and healthy controls. Specifically, serum palmitic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid (GCA), and  (TUDCA) levels were significantly higher, and serum lysophosphatidylethanolamine levels were significantly lower in DILI patients vs healthy controls (P < .001). Furthermore, the SRM assay of bile acids revealed that the increase in GCA, taurocholic acid (TCA), TUDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), glycochenodeoxycholic sulfate (GCDCS), and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) corresponded to a higher degree of liver damage. These results also indicate that serum concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) were significantly lower in patients with severe DILI, when compared to healthy controls, and that this decrease was closely correlated to the severity of liver damage.Taken together, these results demonstrate that bile acids could serve as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis and severity of DILI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29192063>Mechanism of inhibition of taurolithocholate-induced retrieval of plasma membrane MRP2 by cyclic AMP and tauroursodeoxycholate.</a></h2><p>Taurolithocholate (TLC) produces cholestasis by inhibiting biliary solute secretion in part by retrieving MRP2 from the plasma membrane (PM). Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) and cAMP reverse TLC-induced cholestasis by inhibiting TLC-induced retrieval of MRP2. However, cellular mechanisms for this reversal are incompletely understood. Recently, we reported that TLC decreases PM-MRP2 by activating PKCε followed by phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). Thus, cAMP and TUDC may reverse TLC-induced cholestasis by inhibiting the TLC/PKC/MARCKS phosphorylation pathway. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether TUDC and/or cAMP inhibit TLC-induced activation of PKCε and phosphorylation of MARCKS Studies were conducted in HuH-NTCP cell line and rat hepatocytes. Activation of PKC was determined from the translocation of PKC to PM using a biotinylation method. Phosphorylation of MARCKS was determined by immunoblotting with a phospho-MARCKS antibody. TLC, but not cAMP and TUDC, activated PKC and increased MARCKS phosphorylation in HuH-NTCP as well in rat hepatocytes. Treatment with TUDC or cAMP inhibited TLC-induced activation of PKCε and increases in MARCKS phosphorylation in both cell types. Based on these results, we conclude that the reversal of TLC-induced cholestasis by cAMP and TUDC involves, at least in part, inhibition of TLC-mediated activation of the PKCε/MARCKS phosphorylation pathway.© 2017 The Authors.

Indeed, mutations in genes that affect mitochondrial function account for most of the familial cases of the disease, and post mortem studies in sporadic PD patients brains revealed increased signs of oxidative stress. Moreover, exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, leads to clinical symptoms similar to sporadic PD. The bile acid  (TUDCA) is an anti-apoptotic molecule shown to protect against MPTP-induced neurodegeneration in mice, but the mechanisms involved are still incompletely identified. Herein we used MPTP-treated mice, as well as primary cultures of mice cortical neurons and SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP to investigate the modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction by TUDCA in PD models. We show that TUDCA exerts its neuroprotective role in a parkin-dependent manner. Overall, our results point to the pharmacological up-regulation of mitochondrial turnover by TUDCA as a novel neuroprotective mechanism of this molecule, and contribute to the validation of TUDCA clinical application in PD.Copyright © 2017.

In the liver, MSC are represented by stellate cells which have the potential to differentiate into hepatocytes after stimulation with growth factors. Since bile acids can promote liver regeneration, their influence on liver-resident and bone marrow-derived MSC was investigated. Physiological concentrations of bile acids such as  were able to initiate hepatic differentiation of MSC via the farnesoid X receptor and transmembrane G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 5 as investigated with knockout mice. Notch, hedgehog, transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenic protein family and non-canonical Wnt signalling were also essential for bile acid-mediated differentiation, whereas β-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling was able to attenuate this process. Our findings reveal bile acid-mediated signalling as an alternative way to induce hepatic differentiaion of stem cells and highlight bile acids as important signalling molecules during liver regeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27699602> Protects Against Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Cell Death via Mitophagy in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been deeply implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, to keep a healthy mitochondrial population, a balanced mitochondrial turnover must be achieved.  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative disease models; however, the mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of TUDCA against mitochondrial damage triggered by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophelyhydrazone (CCCP). Herein, we show that TUDCA significantly prevents CCCP-induced cell death, ROS generation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of TUDCA in this cell model is mediated by parkin and depends on mitophagy. The demonstration that pharmacological up-regulation of mitophagy by TUDCA prevents neurodegeneration provides new insights for the use of TUDCA as a modulator of mitochondrial activity and turnover, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525950>Probiotic or synbiotic alters the gut microbiota and metabolism in a randomised controlled trial of weight management in overweight adults.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota contributes to host energy metabolism, and altered gut microbiota has been associated with -related metabolic disorders. We previously reported that a probiotic alone or together with a prebiotic controls body fat mass in healthy overweight or obese individuals in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov ). We now aimed to investigate whether changes in the gut microbiota may be associated with the observed clinical benefits. Faecal and plasma samples were obtained from a protocol compliant subset (n=134) of participants from a larger clinical study where participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) into four groups: (1) placebo, 12 g/d microcrystalline cellulose; (2) Litesse® Ultra™ polydextrose (LU), 12 g/day; (3) Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420™ (B420), 10 cfu/d in 12 g microcrystalline cellulose; (4) LU+B420, 1010 cfu/d of B420 in 12 g/d LU for 6 months of intervention. The faecal microbiota composition and metabolites were assessed as exploratory outcomes at baseline, 2, 4, 6 months, and +1 month post-intervention and correlated to -related clinical outcomes. Lactobacillus and Akkermansia were more abundant with B420 at the end of the intervention. LU+B420 increased Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae and Methanobrevibacter, while Paraprevotella was reduced. Christensenellaceae was consistently increased in the LU and LU+B420 groups across the intervention time points, and correlated negatively to waist-hip ratio and energy intake at baseline, and waist-area body fat mass after 6 months treatment with LU+B420. Functional metagenome predictions indicated alterations in pathways related to cellular processes and metabolism. Plasma bile acids glycocholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and taurohyodeoxycholic acid and  were reduced in LU+B420 compared to Placebo. Consumption of B420 and its combination with LU resulted in alterations of the gut microbiota and its metabolism, and may support improved gut barrier function and -related markers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332392>Gut microbiota-bile acid-interleukin-22 axis orchestrates polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries, and is often accompanied by insulin resistance. The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved  health is associated with a relatively high microbiota gene content and increased microbial diversity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and  levels. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from women with PCOS or B. vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid , reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS. This study suggests that modifying the gut microbiota, altering bile acid  and/or increasing IL-22 levels may be of value for the treatment of PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26985651>ER stress and autophagy are involved in the apoptosis induced by cisplatin in human lung cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II (CDDP)] is one of the most classical and effective chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancers including lung cancer. However, the presence of cisplatin resistance in cancer lowers its curative effect and limits its usage in the clinic. The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in lung cancer involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy. In the present study, we detected the effect of cisplatin on cell viability, ER stress and autophagy in lung cancer cell lines A549 and H460. We also tested the effects of ER stress and autophagy on apoptosis induced by cisplatin. The results showed that cisplatin induced apoptosis, ER stress and autophagy in lung cancer cell lines. In addition, the inhibition of ER stress by 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) or  sodium (TUDC) enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the human lung cancer cells. Meanwhile, combination treatment with the autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine (CQ) further increased the apoptosis induced by cisplatin in the human lung cancer cells. The present study provides a novel treatment strategy - cisplatin in combination with an autophagic inhibitor or an ER stress inhibitor leads to increased apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528737>C/EBP homologous protein deficiency inhibits statin-induced myotoxicity.</a></h2><p>It has been well established that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) cause adverse side effects in skeletal muscle ranging from mild to fatal myotoxicity upon dose, drug interaction, and exercise. However, the underlying mechanisms by which statins induce myotoxicity have not been fully addressed. Recent reports showed that statins induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death in immune cells and myoblasts in vitro. Therefore, the goal of study is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which statins induce skeletal muscle cell death and myopathy via the regulation of ER stress. Biochemical data showed that TUDCA, an ER stress inhibitor, inhibited atorvastatin- and simvastatin-induced protein cleavages of PARP-1 and caspase-3, respectively. Actually, statin treatment activated marker proteins of unfolded protein responses (UPR) including ATF6, CHOP, and spliced XBP1 and these responses were inhibited by TUDCA. In addition, statin treatment induced mRNA levels of UPR marker genes, suggesting that statins activate ER stress in a transcriptional regulation. The physiological relevance of ER stress in statin-induced myopathy was demonstrated in a mouse model of myopathy, in which instillation of simvastatin and atorvastatin led to myopathy. Notably, the reduction of muscular endurance in response to statin instillation was significantly improved in TUDCA treating group compared to vehicle control group. Moreover, CHOP deficiency mice showed restoration of statin-induced reduction of muscular endurance, suggesting that statin induces myopathy via ER stress and in a CHOP-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings indicate that statins specifically induce myopathy in an ER stress-dependent manner, suggesting the therapeutic potential of ER stress regulation in preventing adverse effects of statin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed at investigating the therapeutic potential of , a hydrophilic bile acid known to have anti-apoptotic and endoplasmic reticulum stress-reducing capacities, in experimental acute liver injury induced by acetaminophen overdose.Mice were injected with 300 mg/kg acetaminophen, 2 hours prior to receiving , N-acetylcysteine or a combination therapy, and were euthanized 24 hours later. Liver damage was assessed by serum transaminases, liver histology, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling staining, expression profiling of inflammatory, oxidative stress, unfolded protein response, apoptotic and pyroptotic markers.Acetaminophen overdose resulted in a significant increase in serum transaminases, hepatocyte cell death, unfolded protein response activation, oxidative stress, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase 1 and pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions. Standard of care, N-acetylcysteine and, to a lesser extent, tauroursodeoxycholic treatment were associated with significantly lower transaminase levels, hepatocyte death, unfolded protein response activation, oxidative stress markers, caspase 1 expression and NLRP3 levels. Importantly, the combination of N-acetylcysteine and  improved serum transaminase levels, reduced histopathological liver damage, UPR-activated CHOP, oxidative stress, caspase 1 expression, NLRP3 levels, IL-1β levels and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and this to a greater extend than N-acetylcysteine alone.These findings indicate that a combination strategy of N-acetylcysteine and  surpasses the standard of care in acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice and might represent an attractive therapeutic opportunity for acetaminophen-intoxicated patients.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive response to rifampicin (RFP)-induced cell injury. In this study, we found RFP decreased the survival rate of HepG2 cells and increased the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), γ-glutamyl-transferase (γ-GT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL), total bile acid (TBA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cell culture supernatants in both a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. RFP increased the expression levels of bile acid transporter proteins and mRNAs, such as bile salt export pump (BSEP), multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), Na/taurocholate cotransporter (NTCP), organic anion transporting protein 2 (OATP2), organic solute transporter β (OSTβ) and Nrf2. Following the transient knockdown of Nrf2 and treatment with RFP, the expression levels of the BSEP, MDR1, MRP2, NTCP, OATP2 and OSTβ proteins and mRNAs were decreased to different degrees. Moreover, the cell survival was decreased, whereas the LDH level in the cell culture supernatant was increased. Overexpression of the Nrf2 gene produced the opposite effects. Treatment with  (TUDCA) increased the expression levels of the bile acid transporters and Nrf2, decreased the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and inhibited RFP-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, TUDCA reduced cell apoptosis, increased cell survival and decreased the levels of LDH, ALT, AST, AKP, γ-GT, TBIL, DBIL, IBIL, TBA and ATP in the cell culture supernatant. Therefore, TUDCA alleviates RFP-induced injury in HepG2 cells by enhancing bile acid transporters expression and the Nrf2-mediated adaptive response.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that the hypothalamic opioid system might also control energy  in peripheral tissues. Mice lacking the kappa opioid receptor (κOR) and adenoviral vectors overexpressing or silencing κOR were stereotaxically delivered in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of rats. Vagal denervation was performed to assess its effect on liver . Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was inhibited by pharmacological () and genetic (overexpression of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) approaches. The peripheral effects on lipid  were assessed by histological techniques and western blot. We show that in the LHA κOR directly controls hepatic lipid  through the parasympathetic nervous system, independent of changes in food intake and body weight. κOR colocalizes with melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) in the LHA, and genetic disruption of κOR reduced melanin concentrating hormone-induced liver steatosis. The functional relevance of these findings was given by the fact that silencing of κOR in the LHA attenuated both methionine choline-deficient, diet-induced and choline-deficient, high-fat diet-induced ER stress, inflammation, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, whereas overexpression of κOR in this area promoted liver steatosis. Overexpression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa in the liver abolished hypothalamic κOR-induced steatosis by reducing hepatic ER stress.This study reveals a novel hypothalamic-parasympathetic circuit modulating hepatic function through inflammation and ER stress independent of changes in food intake or body weight; these findings might have implications for the clinical use of opioid receptor antagonists.

Myristic acid (MA), a free fatty acid highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25973683>XBP1 mitigates aminoglycoside-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and neuronal cell death.</a></h2><p>Here we study links between aminoglycoside-induced mistranslation, protein misfolding and neuropathy. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides induce misreading in mammalian cells and assess endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) . Genome-wide transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed upregulation of genes related to protein folding and degradation. Quantitative PCR confirmed induction of UPR markers including C/EBP homologous protein, glucose-regulated protein 94, binding immunoglobulin protein and X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) mRNA splicing, which is crucial for UPR activation. We studied the effect of a compromised UPR on aminoglycoside ototoxicity in haploinsufficient XBP1 (XBP1(+/-)) mice. Intra-tympanic aminoglycoside treatment caused high-frequency hearing loss in XBP1(+/-) mice but not in wild-type littermates. Densities of spiral ganglion cells and synaptic ribbons were decreased in gentamicin-treated XBP1(+/-) mice, while sensory cells were preserved. Co-injection of the chemical chaperone  attenuated hearing loss. These results suggest that aminoglycoside-induced ER stress and cell death in spiral ganglion neurons is mitigated by XBP1, masking aminoglycoside neurotoxicity at the organismal level.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533935>Uric Acid Induces Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis via Activation of Calpain-1 and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>Hyperuricemia is associated with an increased risk for multiple cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Calpain-1 is a protease that is implicated in several pathological conditions that affect the heart. The aim of this current study was to test the effects of uric acid (UA) on cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac function and to investigate the role of calpain-1 in the UA-induced effects in the heart and their underlying mechanisms.In vivo, hyperuricemia was induced by oxonic acid (OA) administration in Sprague-Dawley rats for 16 weeks; TUNEL staining was used to identify apoptotic cells. Left ventricular (LV) sections were stained with Sirius Red to evaluate interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac catheterization was performed to evaluate cardiac function. In vitro, cultured H9c2 cells were incubated with different UA concentrations. MTT assays and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis. All related gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and all protein expression levels were analyzed by western blotting.Hyperuricemia induction in vivo resulted in cellular apoptosis, interstitial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction in the rat hearts, as well as increased activation of calpain-1 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, while allopurinol treatment mitigated the above changes. UA administration in vitro increased apoptosis and decreased H9c2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Increased activation of calpain-1 and ER stress was also observed in the groups with high UA levels. Calpain-1 siRNA and the calpain inhibitor CI-III alleviated UA-induced ER stress and apoptosis, while inhibiting ER stress by  (TUDCA) mitigated UA-induced apoptosis without affecting calpain-1 expression or activity.These findings suggest that UA induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis through activation of calpain-1 and ER stress. These results may provide new insights into the mechanisms of hyperuricemia-associated cardiovascular risks and hopefully identify new treatment targets.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

We had created an engineered E. coli harboring two-step bidirectional oxidative and reductive enzyme-catalyzing pathway that could rapidly convert TCDCA to TUDCA at a specific percentage in shake flasks.We reported here the large-scale production of TUDCA containing products by balancing the bidirectional reactions through optimizing fermentation process of the engineered E. coli in fermenters. The fermentation medium was firstly optimized based on M9 medium using response surface methodology, leading to a glycerol and yeast extract modified M9-GY medium benefits for both cell growth and product conversion efficiency. Then isopropylthio-β-galactoside induction and fed-stock stage was successively optimized. Finally, a special deep-tank static process was developed to promote the conversion from TCDCA to TUDCA. Applying the optimal condition, fermentation was performed by separately supplementing 30 g refined chicken bile powder and 35 g crude chicken bile powder as substrates, resulting in 29.35 ± 2.83 g and 30.78 ± 3.04 g powder products containing 35.85 ± 3.85% and 27.14 ± 4.23% of TUDCA at a ratio of 1.49 ± 0.14 and 1.55 ± 0.19 to TCDCA, respectively, after purification and evaporation of the fermentation broth.

However, the limited information of TUDCA on protecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been known. The present study was conducted to evaluate the protection of TUDCA on high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) dysfunction and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy (DR) rats and the possible mechanism underlying was also explored.The proliferation of high glucose-induced HRMECs was determined by MTT assay. DR rats' model was established by an administration of high-glucose-fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30mg/kg). The cell supernatant and rats' serum were collected for the assays of NO content by ELISA kits. Retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe pathological changes. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in rat retinas. Furthermore, western blot analysis was carried out to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in high glucose-induced HRMECs.After treating with TUDCA, high glucose-induced HRMECs proliferation could be significantly inhibited. TUDCA (5.0μM, 25.0μM and 125.0μM) could decrease NO content in high glucose-induced HRMECs. Furthermore, TUDCA (500mg/kg/d and 250mg/kg/d) also decrease NO content in serum of DR rats. Additionally, both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that the over-expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF were significantly decreased by TUDCA.The data indicated that TUDCA could ameliorate DR by decreasing NO content and down-regulating the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF. Thus, our experimental results suggested that TUDCA might be a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of DR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition,  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018.

The number of regenerating neurites was counted after 7 days of culture, followed by performing TUNEL and DAPI staining. The ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to the number of DAPI-stained nuclei was calculated. Immunohistochemical examinations for the active form of caspase-9 and JNK were performed. All of the neuroprotectants increased the number of neurites and decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells. However, the number of neurites was significantly higher, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-9- and JNK-immunopositive cells was fewer in the retinas incubated with the combined three agents. Combination solutions containing citicoline, TUDCA, and NT-4 should be considered for neuroprotective and regenerative therapy for AGE-related retinal degeneration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721575>Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperon  Attenuates Aldosterone-Infused Renal Injury.</a></h2><p>Aldosterone (Aldo) is critically involved in the development of renal injury via the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is also evoked in Aldo-induced renal injury. In the present study, we investigated the role of ER stress in inflammation-mediated renal injury in Aldo-infused mice. C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive treatment for 4 weeks as follows: vehicle infusion, Aldo infusion, vehicle infusion plus  (TUDCA), and Aldo infusion plus TUDCA. The effect of TUDCA on the Aldo-infused inflammatory response and renal injury was investigated using periodic acid-Schiff staining, real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. We demonstrate that Aldo leads to impaired renal function and inhibition of ER stress via TUDCA attenuates renal fibrosis. This was indicated by decreased collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, and TGF- expression, as well as the downregulation of the expression of Nlrp3 inflammasome markers, Nlrp3, ASC, IL-1, and IL-18. This paper presents an important role for ER stress on the renal inflammatory response to Aldo. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by TUDCA negatively regulates the levels of these inflammatory molecules in the context of Aldo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249278>Mechanisms of Tauroursodeoxycholate-Mediated Hepatoprotection.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholate and its taurine conjugate tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) promote choleresis by triggering the insertion of transport proteins for bile acids into the canalicular and basolateral membranes of hepatocytes. In addition, TUDC exerts hepatoprotective and anti-apoptotic effects, can counteract the action of toxic bile acids and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress. TUDC can also initiate the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) including hepatic stellate cells and promote their development into hepatocyte-like cells. Although the hepatoprotective and choleretic action of TUDC is empirically used in clinical medicine since decades, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained largely unclear. Since TUDC has little or no potency to activate known bile acid receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor and transmembrane G protein-coupled bile acid receptor, other receptors must be involved in TUDC-mediated signaling. Recent research demonstrates that integrins serve as sensors for TUDC. After binding of TUDC to α5β1-integrin, the β1-integrin subunit becomes activated through a conformational change, thereby triggering integrin signaling with the downstream activation of focal adhesion kinase, c-Src, the epidermal growth factor receptor and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, Erks and p38. These events trigger choleresis through a coordinated insertion of the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide into the basolateral membrane and of the bile salt export pump into the canalicular membrane. In addition to its choleretic action, TUDC-induced integrin activation triggers a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A activation in hepatocytes, which provides the basis for the anti-apoptotic effect of TUDC. On the other hand, the TUDC-induced stimulation of MSC differentiation appears not to be mediated by integrins. This article gives a brief overview about our work on the signaling network-mediating hepatoprotection by TUDC.© 2017 S.

We induced an inflammatory process in RAW 264.7 macrophages, BV2 microglial cells, and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The anti-inflammatory effects of TUDCA on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, BV2 microglial cells, and BMMs were analyzed using nitric oxide (NO) assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The pathological changes in lesions of the spinal cord tissue were evaluated by hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining, luxol fast blue/cresyl violet-staining and immunofluorescent staining. TUDCA decreased the LPS-stimulated inflammatory mediator, NO. It also suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, TUDCA decreased prostaglandin E (PGE). After SCI, TUDCA supported the recovery of the injury site and suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as iNOS, CD68 and CD86. In addition, TUDCA induced the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine, Arg-1. In conclusion, TUDCA inhibits inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages, BV2 microglial cells, and BMMs. TUDCA can be a potential alternative drug for SCI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634226>Reduction of Hypothalamic Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Activates Browning of White Fat and Ameliorates Obesity.</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining , histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and  phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851371>Taurochenodeoxycholate relaxes rat mesenteric arteries through activating eNOS: Comparing with glycochenodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate.</a></h2><p>The bile acids (BAs) and their conjugates have vascular activities and the serum levels of BAs and their conjugates are increased in liver diseases. In the present study, we examined the in vitro vasoactivities of BAs conjugates taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) (5-80 µM), glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) (20-150 µM) and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) (20-150 µM) in rat mesenteric arteries and thoracic aorta. The isometric tension of rat mesenteric arteries and thoracic aorta was recorded by using multi-wire myograph systems. TCDC induced significant concentration-dependent relaxation in endothelium-intact but not endothelium-denuded rat mesenteric arteries pre-contracted with phenylephrine (PE). TCDC also showed vasorelaxant effects on high K(+) induced contraction in rat mesenteric arteries. L-NAME treatment inhibited TCDC-induced relaxation in mesenteric arteries pre-contracted with PE. Acute treatment with TCDC increased protein expression of P-eNOS (ser1177) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. GCDC dose-dependently relaxed PE-induced vasoconstriction in both endotheium-intact and endothelium-denuded rat mesenteric arteries, but GCDC showed no effect on high K(+)-induced vasoconstriction. Both GCDC and TCDC showed no apparent relaxation on PE and high K(+)-induced vasoconstriction in rat thoracic aorta. TUDC showed no effect on PE and high K(+)-induced vasoconstriction in rat mesenteric arteries and thoracic aorta. The study demonstrates that TCDC relaxes rat mesenteric arteries through activating eNOS. TCDC might be the major BAs conjugate for vasorelaxation in vivo.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This activation is orchestrated by three endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensors: PERK, ATF6 and IRE1. These sensors transduce signals that induce the expression of the UPR gene programme. Here, we first identified an early activator of the UPR and investigated the role of a chronically activated UPR in the pathogenesis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a neurometabolic disorder that is caused by ABCD1 malfunction; ABCD1 transports very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into peroxisomes. The disease manifests as inflammatory demyelination in the brain or and/or degeneration of corticospinal tracts, thereby resulting in spastic paraplegia, with the accumulation of intracellular VLCFA instead of protein aggregates. Using X-ALD mouse model (Abcd1  and Abcd1  /Abcd2  mice) and X-ALD patient's fibroblasts and brain samples, we discovered an early engagement of the UPR. The response was characterized by the activation of the PERK and ATF6 , but not the IRE1 pathway, showing a difference from the models of AD, PD or ALS. Inhibition of PERK leads to the disruption of homeostasis and increased apoptosis during ER stress induced in X-ALD fibroblasts. Redox imbalance appears to be the mechanism that initiates ER stress in X-ALD. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the bile acid tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) abolishes UPR activation, which results in improvement of axonal degeneration and its associated locomotor impairment in Abcd1  /Abcd2  mice. Altogether, our preclinical data provide evidence for establishing the UPR as a key drug target in the pathogenesis cascade. Our study also highlights the potential role of TUDCA as a treatment for X-ALD and other axonopathies in which similar molecular mediators are implicated.</p></html>
