There is no treatment available for these diseases. The bile acids (TUDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) have been recently shown to be neuroprotective in other protein misfolding disease models, including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and also in humans with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Here, we studied the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds in prion disease. We demonstrated that TUDCA and UDCA substantially reduced PrP conversion in cell-free aggregation assays, as well as in chronically and acutely infected cell cultures. This effect was mediated through reduction of PrPSc seeding ability, rather than an effect on PrPC. We also demonstrated the ability of TUDCA and UDCA to reduce neuronal loss in prion-infected cerebellar slice cultures. UDCA treatment reduced astrocytosis and prolonged survival in RML prion-infected mice. Interestingly, these effects were limited to the males, implying a gender-specific difference in drug metabolism. Beyond effects on PrPSc, we found that levels of phosphorylated eIF2 were increased at early time points, with correlated reductions in postsynaptic density protein 95. As demonstrated for other neurodegenerative diseases, we now show that TUDCA and UDCA may have a therapeutic role in prion diseases, with effects on both prion conversion and neuroprotection. Our findings, together with the fact that these natural compounds are orally bioavailable, permeable to the blood-brain , and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in humans, make these compounds promising alternatives for the treatment of prion diseases.Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases that are transmissible to humans and other mammals. There are no disease-modifying therapies available, despite decades of research. Treatment targets have included inhibition of protein accumulation,clearance of toxic aggregates, and prevention of downstream neurodegeneration. No one target may be sufficient; rather, compounds which have a multimodal mechanism, acting on different targets, would be ideal. TUDCA and UDCA are bile acids that may fulfill this dual role. Previous studies have demonstrated their neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative disease models, and we now demonstrate that this effect occurs in prion disease, with an added mechanistic target of upstream prion seeding. Importantly, these are natural compounds which are orally bioavailable, permeable to the blood-brain , and U.S.Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in humans with primary biliary cirrhosis. They have recently been proven efficacious in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, these compounds are promising options for the treatment of prion diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346222>GRP78 translocation to the cell surface and O-GlcNAcylation of VE-Cadherin contribute to ER stress-mediated endothelial permeability.</a></h2><p>Increased O-GlcNAcylation, a well-known post-translational modification of proteins causally linked to various detrimental cellular functions in pathological conditions including diabetic retinopathy (DR). Previously we have shown that endothelial activation induced by inflammation and hyperglycemia results in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated intercellular junction alterations accompanied by visual deficits in a tie2-TNF-α transgenic mouse model. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that increased ER stress via O-GlcNAcylation of VE-Cadherin likely contribute to endothelial permeability. We show that ER stress leads to GRP78 translocation to the plasma membrane, increased O-GlcNAcylation of proteins, particularly VE-Cadherin resulting in a defective complex partnering leading to the loss of retinal endothelial  integrity and increased transendothelial migration of monocytes. We further show an association of GRP78 with the VE-Cadherin under these conditions. Interestingly, cells exposed to ER stress inhibitor,  partially mitigated all these effects. Our findings suggest an essential role for ER stress and O-GlcNAcylation in altering the endothelial   and reveal a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of DR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29084077>Accumulation of HLA-DR4 in Colonic Epithelial Cells Causes Severe Colitis in Homozygous HLA-DR4 Transgenic Mice.</a></h2><p>Homozygous HLA-DR4/I-E transgenic mice (tgm) spontaneously developed colitis similar to human ulcerative colitis. We explored whether endoplasmic reticulum stress in colonic epithelial cells due to overexpression of HLA-DR4/I-E was involved in the pathogenesis of colitis.Major histocompatibility complex class II transactivator-knockout (CIITAKO) background tgm were established to test the involvement of HLA-DR4/I-E expression in the pathogenesis of colitis. Histological and cellular analyses were performed and the effect of oral administration of the molecular chaperone  (TUDCA) and antibiotics were investigated. IgA content of feces and serum and presence of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were also investigated.Aberrantly accumulated HLA-DR4/I-E molecules in colonic epithelial cells were observed only in the colitic homozygous tgm, which was accompanied by upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and reduced mucus. Homozygous tgm with CIITAKO, and thus absent of HLA-DR4/I-E expression, did not develop colitis. Oral administration of TUDCA to homozygotes reduced HLA-DR4/I-E and BiP expression in colonic epithelial cells and restored the barrier function of the intestinal tract. The IgA content of feces and serum, and numbers of IgA-coated fecal bacteria were higher in the colitic tgm, and antibiotic administration suppressed the expression of HLA-DR4/I-E and colitis.The pathogenesis of the colitis observed in the homozygous tgm was likely due to endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in goblet cell damage and compromised mucus production in the colonic epithelial cells in which HLA-DR4/I-E molecules were heavily accumulated. Commensal bacteria seemed to be involved in the accumulation of HLA-DR4/I-E, leading to development of the colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268667>Ursodeoxycholic acid ameliorates diabetic retinopathy via reducing retinal inflammation and reversing the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the hydrolysis of , which is the main ingredient from bear gall that has functions including clearing heat and detoxification, and improving eyesight. However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In conclusion, UDCA attenuates BRB breakdown during DR development via inhibiting retinal inflammation and reversing the reduced expression of tight junctions (TJs) including claudin-1 and claudin-19.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile acid-based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses,  and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310532> inhibits experimental colitis by preventing early intestinal epithelial cell death.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by increased epithelial cell death and subsequent breakdown of the intestinal epithelial , which perpetuates chronic intestinal inflammation. Since fecal bile acid dysmetabolism is associated with UC and  (TUDCA) has been shown to improve murine colitis, we evaluated the effect of TUDCA on intestinal epithelial cell death in a mouse model of UC-like  dysfunction elicited by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We identified the prevention of colonic caspase-3 induction, a key proapoptotic marker which was also over-activated in UC, as the earliest event resulting in a clear clinical benefit. Whereas vehicle-treated mice showed a cumulative mortality of 40%, all TUDCA-treated mice survived the DSS experiment during a 14-day follow-up period. In line with a  protective effect, TUDCA decreased bacterial translocation to the spleen and stimulated mucin production. Similarly, TUDCA inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal permeability and associated enterocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in vitro by a dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (using tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand) and receptor-independent (staurosporine) caspase-3 induction in HT29 colonic epithelial cells. These data imply that caspase-3 activation is an early marker of colitis that is prevented by TUDCA treatment. These data, together with the previously reported beneficial effect in colitis, suggest that TUDCA could be an add-on strategy to current immunosuppressive treatment of UC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525950>Probiotic or synbiotic alters the gut microbiota and metabolism in a randomised controlled trial of weight management in overweight adults.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota contributes to host energy metabolism, and altered gut microbiota has been associated with -related metabolic disorders. We previously reported that a probiotic alone or together with a prebiotic controls body fat mass in healthy overweight or obese individuals in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov ). We now aimed to investigate whether changes in the gut microbiota may be associated with the observed clinical benefits. Faecal and plasma samples were obtained from a protocol compliant subset (n=134) of participants from a larger clinical study where participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) into four groups: (1) placebo, 12 g/d microcrystalline cellulose; (2) Litesse® Ultra™ polydextrose (LU), 12 g/day; (3) Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420™ (B420), 10 cfu/d in 12 g microcrystalline cellulose; (4) LU+B420, 1010 cfu/d of B420 in 12 g/d LU for 6 months of intervention. The faecal microbiota composition and metabolites were assessed as exploratory outcomes at baseline, 2, 4, 6 months, and +1 month post-intervention and correlated to -related clinical outcomes. Lactobacillus and Akkermansia were more abundant with B420 at the end of the intervention. LU+B420 increased Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae and Methanobrevibacter, while Paraprevotella was reduced. Christensenellaceae was consistently increased in the LU and LU+B420 groups across the intervention time points, and correlated negatively to waist-hip ratio and energy intake at baseline, and waist-area body fat mass after 6 months treatment with LU+B420. Functional metagenome predictions indicated alterations in pathways related to cellular processes and metabolism. Plasma bile acids glycocholic acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid, and taurohyodeoxycholic acid and  were reduced in LU+B420 compared to Placebo. Consumption of B420 and its combination with LU resulted in alterations of the gut microbiota and its metabolism, and may support improved gut barrier function and -related markers.</p></html>
