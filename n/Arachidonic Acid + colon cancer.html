<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563460> therapy: new perspectives of nutritional manipulations using polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Recent advances in the development of new therapeutic strategies combining conventional adjuvant radio/chemotherapy with nutritional manipulations with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are presented.Studies in cell culture and tumour-bearing animals have reported the ability of long-chain n-3 PUFAs to enhance the cytotoxicity of several anticancer drugs. In , combination of n-3 PUFAs with 5-fluorouracil resulted in an additive growth inhibitory effect on different cell lines. Moreover, recent findings suggest that eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic  may be used to enhance tumour radiosensitivity while reducing mucosal/epidermal radiotoxicity similar to radioprotective agents. The underlying mechanism is probably mediated through lipid peroxidation because the antitumour effect of n-3 PUFAs is shared with the n-6 PUFA, , and abolished by vitamin E. In vivo, the use of n-3 PUFAs may provide an additional advantage compared with n-6 PUFAs. Downregulation of eicosanoid synthesis from cyclooxygenase II may reduce angiogenesis, inflammation and metastasis induction.New insights suggest that n-3 PUFAs may play an important role not only in  prevention but also in  management. They may act synergistically with radio/chemotherapy to kill tumour cells by increasing oxidative stress while reducing angiogenesis, inflammation and metastasis induction.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19266600>Docosahexaenoic  suppresses -induced proliferation of LS-174T human  carcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>To investigate the impact of  (AA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and their combination on  cell growth.The LS-174T  cell line was used to study the role of the prostaglandin precursor AA and the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  DHA on cell growth. Cell viability was assessed in XTT assays. For analysis of cell cycle and cell death, flow cytometry and DAPI staining were applied. Expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), p21 and bcl-2 in cells incubated with AA or DHA was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) generation in the presence of AA and DHA was measured using a PGE(2)-ELISA.AA increased cell growth, whereas DHA reduced viability of LS 174T cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, DHA down- regulated mRNA of bcl-2 and up-regulated p21. Interestingly, DHA was able to suppress AA-induced cell proliferation and significantly lowered AA-derived PGE(2) formation. DHA also down-regulated COX-2 expression. In addition to the effect on PGE(2) formation, DHA directly reduced PGE(2)-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.These results suggest that DHA can inhibit the pro-proliferative effect of abundant AA or PGE(2).</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31545039>Extra Virgin Olive Oil Minor Compounds Modulate Mitogenic Action of Oleic  on  Cell Line.</a></h2><p>Experimental and clinical findings suggest that olive oil has a protective effect, whereas oleic  consumption induces colorectal  (CRC). Considering this apparent contradiction and that olive oil is a complex mix of fatty acids, mainly oleic  and minor compounds such as phenolic compounds, lignans, hydrocarbons, and triterpenes, we study its effects on intestinal epithelial cell growth. Our results show that oleic  (1-100 μM) but not elaidic  induced DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth (2-fold higher than cells without growth factors,  < 0.05). These effects were inhibited by 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors as well as the leukotriene antagonist ( < 0.05), suggesting the implication of this pathway in this mitogenic action. Hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, pinoresinol, squalene, and maslinic  (0.1-10 μM) reverted DNA synthesis and Caco-2 cell growth induced by oleic . These effects were not the consequence of the cell cycle arrest or the impairment of cell viability with the exception of hydroxytyrosol and maslinic  that induced cell detachment and apoptosis (35.6 ± 2.3 and 43.2 ± 2.4%, respectively) at the higher concentration assayed. Oleuropein effects can be related with hydroxytyrosol release as a consequence of oleuropein hydrolysis by Caco-2 cells (up to 25%). Furthermore, hydroxytyrosol modulates the  cascade, and this event can be associated with its antimitogenic action. In conclusion, oleic  and oleic  in the presence of olive oil representative minor components have opposite effects, suggesting that the consumption of seed oils, high oleic  seed oils, or olive oil will probably have different effects on CRC.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20857911>Synthesis and biological activities of transition metal complexes based on acetylsalicylic  as neo-anticancer agents.</a></h2><p>[(μ(4)-η(2))-(Prop-2-ynyl)-2-acetoxybenzoate]dicobalthexacarbonyl (Co-ASS), a derivative of aspirin (ASS), demonstrated high growth-inhibitory potential against various tumor cells with interference in the  cascade as probable mode of action. The significance of the kind of metal and cluster was verified in this structure-activity study: Co(2)(CO)(6) was respectively exchanged by a tetrameric cobalt-, trimeric ruthenium-, or trimeric ironcarbonyl cluster. Furthermore, the metal binding motif was changed from alkyne to 1,3-butadiene. Compounds were evaluated for growth inhibition, antiproliferative effects, and apoptosis induction in breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB 231) and  (HT-29) cell lines and for COX-1/2 inhibitory effects at isolated isoenzymes. Additionally, the major COX metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) was quantified in -stimulated MDA-MB 231 breast tumor cells. It was demonstrated that the metal cluster was of minor importance for effects on cellular activity if an alkyne was used as ligand. Generally, no correlation existed between growth inhibition and COX activity. Cellular growth inhibition and antiproliferative activity at higher concentrations of the most active compounds Prop-ASS-Co(4) and Prop-ASS-Ru(3) correlated well with apoptosis induction.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29587668>Knockdown delta-5-desaturase in breast  cells that overexpress COX-2 results in inhibition of growth, migration and invasion via a dihomo-γ-linolenic  peroxidation dependent mechanism.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible COX form, is a bi-functional membrane-bound enzyme that typically metabolizes  (downstream ω-6 fatty ) to form 2-series of prostaglandins known to be involved in  development. Overexpression of COX-2 has been found in a majority of breast carcinomas, and has also been associated with increased severity and the development of the metastasis. Our lab recently demonstrated that COX-2 can also metabolize dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA, a precursor of ω-6 ) to produce an anti- byproduct, 8-hydroxyoctanoic  (8-HOA) that can inhibit growth and migration of  and pancreatic  cells. We thus tested whether our strategy of knocking down delta-5-desaturase (D5D, the key enzyme that converts DGLA to ) in breast  cells overexpressing COX-2 can also be used to promote 8-HOA formation, thereby suppressing  growth, migration, and invasion.SiRNA and shRNA transfection were used to knock down D5D expression in MDA-MB 231 and 4 T1 cells (human and mouse breast  cell lines expressing high COX-2, respectively). Colony formation assay, FITC Annexin V/PI double staining, wound healing and transwell assay were used to assess the effect of our strategy on inhibition of  growth, migration, and invasion. GC/MS was used to measure endogenous 8-HOA, and western blotting was performed to evaluate the altered key protein expressions upon the treatments.We demonstrated that D5D knockdown licenses DGLA to inhibit growth of breast  cells via promoting formation of 8-HOA that can inhibit histone deacetylase and activate cell apoptotic proteins, such as procaspase 9 and PARP. Our strategy can also significantly inhibit  migration and invasion, associated with altered expression of MMP-2/- 9, E-cadherin, vimentin and snail. In addition, D5D knockdown and DGLA supplementation greatly enhanced the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil on breast  growth and migration.Consistent to our previous studies on  and pancreatic , here we demonstrate again that the high level of COX-2 in breast  cells can be capitalized on inhibiting  growth and migration. The outcome of this translational research could guide us to develop new anti- strategy and/or to improve current chemotherapy for breast  treatment.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18976499>Voluntary exercise inhibits intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice and azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies suggest that physical activity reduces the risk of  in humans. Results from animal studies, however, are inconclusive. The present study investigated the effects of voluntary exercise on intestinal tumor formation in two different animal models, Apc(Min/+) mice and azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice.In Experiments 1 and 2, five-week old female Apc(Min/+) mice were either housed in regular cages or cages equipped with a running wheel for 6 weeks (for mice maintained on the AIN93G diet; Experiment 1) or 9 weeks (for mice on a high-fat diet; Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, male CF-1 mice at 6 weeks of age were given a dose of AOM (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and, 12 days later, 1.5% DSS in drinking fluid for 1 week. The mice were then maintained on a high-fat diet and housed in regular cages or cages equipped with a running wheel for 16 weeks.In the Apc(Min/+) mice maintained on either the AIN93G or the high-fat diet, voluntary exercise decreased the number of small intestinal tumors. In the AOM/DSS-treated mice maintained on a high-fat diet, voluntary exercise also decreased the number of  tumors. In Apc(Min/+) mice, voluntary exercise decreased the ratio of serum insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 to IGF binding protein (BP)-3 levels. It also decreased prostaglandin E2 and nuclear beta-catenin levels, but increased E-cadherin levels in the tumors.These results indicate hat voluntary exercise inhibited intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min/+) mice and AOM/DSS-treated mice, and the inhibitory effect is associated with decreased IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio, aberrant beta-catenin signaling, and  metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15309463>Interaction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and sodium butyrate during apoptosis in HT-29 human  adenocarcinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of the balance between cell growth and death in the  epithelium is associated with  promotion. Understanding how cell death in this self-renewing tissue is regulated and how it is influenced by interaction of specific dietary components, especially fat and fibre, could lead to improved treatment and prevention strategies for .The effects of two types of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)-- (AA, 20:4, n-6) or docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6, n-3)--on the response of human  adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells to sodium butyrate (NaBt) were investigated.The parameters reflecting cell proliferation and cell death were studied together with oxidative response, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and changes of selected regulatory molecules associated with cell cycle (p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1/WAF1)) and apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-9, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase--PARP, Bcl-2, Bax, Bak,Mcl-1).We demonstrated that pre-treatment with either AA or DHA attenuated cell cycle arrest caused by NaBt which is associated with modulation of p27(Kip1), but not p21(Cip1/WAF1) protein expression. On the other hand, PUFAs sensitised HT-29 cells to NaBt-induced apoptosis. An increased amount of floating cells and cells in the subG(0)/G(1) population was associated with increased reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, decrease of MMP, activation of caspase-3 and -9, PARP cleavage, and decrease in the expression of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein. The observed effects were modulated by the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and partially reversed by the antioxidant Trolox.PUFAs may have beneficial effects in the  enhancing apoptosis induced by NaBt. Alteration of cell membrane lipid composition and potentiation of oxidative processes accompanied by changes in mitochondria followed by stimulation of apoptotic cascade components play a role in these effects.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375358>6 Iodo-δ-lactone: a derivative of  with antitumor effects in HT-29  cells.</a></h2><p>IL-δ (5-hydroxy-6 iodo-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic delta lactone) an iodinated  (AA) derivative, is one of the iodolipids biosynthesized by the thyroid.

IL-δ had pro-apoptotic effects, evidenced by morphological features of programmed cell death such as pyknosis, karyorrhexis, cell shrinkage and cell blebbing observed by fluorescence microscopy, and an increase in caspase-3 activity and in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio (2.5 after 3h of treatment). Furthermore, IL-δ increased ROS production (30%) and lipid peroxidation levels (19%), suggesting that apoptosis could be a result of increased oxidative stress. A maximum increase in c-fos and c-jun protein expression in response to IL-δ was observed 1h after initiation of the treatment. IL-δ also induced a tumour growth delay of 70% compared to the control group in NIH nude mice implanted with HT-29 cells.Our study shows that IL-δ inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in the  cell line, HT-29 and opens the possibility that IL-δ could be a potential useful chemotherapy agent.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Several sPLA2s have been associated with various cancers, including prostate, , gastric, lung and breast cancers, yet, their role is controversial and seems to be dependent on the  type, the local microenvironment and the enzyme studied. There is strong evidence that the expression of some sPLA2s, most notably the group IIA, III and X enzymes, is dysregulated in various malignant tissues, where, as described in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies using mouse models and according to correlations between sPLA2 expression and patient survival, a particular enzyme may exert either a pro- or an anti-tumourigenic role. It is becoming clear that there are multiple, context-dependent mechanisms of action of sPLA2s in different cancers. First, the role of sPLA2s in  has traditionally been associated with their enzymatic activity and ability to participate in the release of potent biologically active lipid mediators, in particular -derived eicosanoids, which promote tumourigenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and cell survival, by abrogating apoptosis and by increasing local inflammation and angiogenesis. Second, several biological effects of sPLA2s were found to be independent of sPLA2 enzymatic activity, arguing for a receptor-mediated mechanism of action. Finally, recent studies have implicated sPLA2s in the regulation of basal lipid metabolism, opening a new window to the understanding of the diverse roles of sPLA2s in .

The transfection of MCF-7 cells with ACSL4 cDNA transforms the cells into a highly aggressive phenotype and controls both lipooxygenase-5 (LOX-5) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) metabolism of AA, suggesting a causal role of ACSL4 in tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that ACSL4, LOX-5 and COX-2 may constitute potential therapeutic targets for the control of tumor growth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use a tetracycline Tet-Off system of MCF-7 xenograft model of breast  to confirm the effect of ACSL4 overexpression on tumor growth in vivo. We also aim to determine whether a combinatorial inhibition of the ACSL4-LOX-COX-2 pathway affects tumor growth in vivo using a xenograft model based on MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly aggressive breast  cell line naturally overexpressing ACSL4. The first novel finding is that stable transfection of MCF-7 cells with ACSL4 using the tetracycline Tet-Off system of MCF-7 cells resulted in development of growing tumors when injected into nude mice. Tumor xenograft development measured in animals that received doxycycline resulted in tumor growth inhibition. The tumors presented marked nuclear polymorphism, high mitotic index and low expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor. These results demonstrate the transformational capacity of ACSL4 overexpression. We examined the effect of a combination of inhibitors of ACSL4, LOX-5 and COX-2 on MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts. This treatment markedly reduced tumor growth in doses of these inhibitors that were otherwise ineffective when used alone, indicating a synergistic effect of the compounds.

Samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The data analyses focused on changes in bacterial community diversity. Linear regression was used to evaluate factors that predict a reduction in  PGE2.At baseline, increased bacterial diversity, as measured by the Shannon and Inverse Simpson indexes in both biopsy and luminal brushing samples, was positively correlated with dietary fiber intakes and negatively correlated with fat intakes. Dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids increased the Yue and Clayton community dis-similarity index between the microbiome in luminal brushings and  biopsy samples post-supplementation (P = 0.015). In addition, there was a small group of individuals with relatively high Prevotella abundance who were resistant to the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 fatty  supplementation. In linear regression analyses, increases in diversity of the bacteria in the luminal brushing samples, but not in the biopsy samples, were significant predictors of lower  PGE2 concentrations post-supplementation in models that included baseline PGE2, baseline body mass index, and changes in  eicosapentaenoic -to- ratios. The changes in bacterial diversity contributed to 6-8% of the interindividual variance in change in  PGE2 (P = 0.001).Dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids had little effect on intestinal bacteria in healthy humans; however, an increase in diversity in the luminal brushings significantly predicted reductions in  PGE2.

Through free radical reactions, COX metabolizes DGLA and AA to form well-known bioactive metabolites, namely, the 1 and 2 series of prostaglandins (PGs1 and PGs2), respectively. Unlike PGs2, which are viewed as proinflammatory, PGs1 possess anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. However, the mechanisms linking the PGs to their bioactivities are still unclear, and radicals generated in COX-DGLA have not been detected. To better understand PG biology and determine whether different reactions occur in COX-DGLA and COX-AA, we have used LC/ESR/MS with a spin trap, α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), to characterize the carbon-centered radicals formed from COX-DGLA in vitro, including cellular peroxidation. A total of five types of DGLA-derived radicals were characterized as POBN adducts: m/z 266, m/z 296, and m/z 550 (same as or similar to COX-AA) and m/z 324 and m/z 354 (exclusively from COX-DGLA).

It is suggested that 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, mediates the carcinogenic action of cigarette smoking by promoting  growth. In the present study, the proliferative response of a cultured  cell line HT-29 to NNK was determined. It was found that NNK dose-dependently stimulated HT-29 cell proliferation. In this regard, the stimulatory action of NNK was abolished by atenolol and ICI 118,551, a beta1- and beta2-selective antagonist, respectively. In addition, cell growth was stimulated by the nonselective adrenergic agonist, noradrenaline, and more effectively by the beta-selective agonist, isoproterenol. The second message cyclic AMP level for beta-adrenoceptor activation was elevated by isoproterenol and NNK treatment. These agents also up-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression, and prostaglandin E2 release. Beta2-adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118,551, in contrast, significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression and prostaglandin E2 release induced by NNK and isoproterenol. To conclude, it is proposed that NNK stimulates HT-29 cell proliferation through beta-adrenoceptors, preferentially beta2 receptors. Activation of the beta-adrenoceptors, and the consequent cyclic AMP elevation coupled with the downstream  pathway, is perhaps an important mechanistic cascade in the promotion of  growth.

VEGF expression is up regulated in response to micro-environmental cues related to poor blood supply such as hypoxia. However, regulation of VEGF expression in  cells is not limited to the stress response due to increased volume of the tumor mass. Lipid mediators in particular -derived prostaglandin (PG)E₂ are regulators of VEGF expression and angiogenesis in . In addition, increased osmolarity that is generated during  water absorption and feces consolidation seems to activate  cells and promote PGE₂ generation. Such physiological stimulation may provide signaling for  promotion. Here we investigated the effect of exposure to a hypertonic medium, to emulate  environment, on VEGF production by  cells. The role of concomitant PGE₂ generation and MAPK activation was addressed by specific pharmacological inhibition. Human  cell line Caco-2 exposed to a hypertonic environment responded with marked VEGF and PGE₂ production. VEGF production was inhibited by selective inhibitors of ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. To address the regulatory role of PGE₂ on VEGF production, Caco-2 cells were treated with cPLA₂ (ATK) and COX-2 (NS-398) inhibitors, that completely block PGE₂ generation. The Caco-2 cells were also treated with a non selective PGE₂ receptor antagonist. Each treatment significantly increased the hypertonic stress-induced VEGF production. Moreover, addition of PGE₂ or selective EP₂ receptor agonist to activated Caco-2 cells inhibited VEGF production. The autocrine inhibitory role for PGE₂ appears to be selective to hypertonic environment since VEGF production induced by exposure to CoCl₂ was decreased by inhibition of concomitant PGE₂ generation.

They are known to be secondary metabolites characterized by a wide spectrum of biological activities, and a growing body of evidence indicates they have anti-inflammatory potential. It is well known that inflammation plays a key role in many chronic diseases such as circulatory diseases, pulmonary diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, , and neurodegenerative diseases. Polyphenols influence the inflammatory process by controlling and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme involved in the metabolism of . Furthermore, polyphenols exhibit anti-inflammatory activity on many levels via NF-κB inhibition, and MAPK, iNOS, and growth factors regulation.

In this study, we revealed that elevation of n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio suppress the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and prevent colorectal tumorigenesis. The transgenic expression of fat-1, a desaturase that catalyzes the conversion of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs and produces n-3 PUFAs endogenously, repressed colorectal tumor cell growth and remarkably reduced tumor burden, and alleviated anemia as well as hyperlipidemia in APCMin/+ (adenomatous polyposis coli) mice, a classic CRC model that best simulates most clinical cases. In contrast to  (AA, C20:4 n-6), either Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6 n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5 n-3), or a combination of DHA and AA, efficiently inhibited the proliferation of CRC cell lines and promoted apoptosis in these cells. The ectopic expression of fat-1 had similar effects in  epithelial cells with APC depletion. Mechanistically, elevation of n-3/n-6 ratio suppressed mTORC1 activity in tumors of APCMin/+ mice, CRC cell lines with APC mutation, and in normal  epithelial cells with APC depletion. In addition, elevation of n-3/n-6 ratio repressed mTORC1 activity and inhibited adipogenic differentiation in preadipocytes with APC knockdown, as well as alleviated hyperlipidemia in APCMin/+ mice. Taken together, our findings have provided novel insights into the potential mechanism by which increase in n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio represses CRC development, and also a new rationale for utilizing n-3 PUFAs in CRC prevention and treatment.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308583>Arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) polymorphisms and  risk.</a></h2><p>In the human ,  is metabolized primarily by cyclooxygenase (COX) and arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX) to bioactive lipids, which are implicated in  risk. Several polymorphisms in ALOX and COX genes have been identified, including G-1752A, G-1699A and Glu254Lys in ALOX5; Gln261Arg in ALOX12; Leu237Met and Val481Ile in COX1; and C-645T and Val511Ala in COX2.

We addressed this hypothesis in African-Americans and Caucasians using  cases (n = 293) and hospital- (n = 229) and population-based (n = 304) control groups. Polymorphisms did not differ between the control groups (P > 0.05); thus, they are combined for all analyses presented. ALOX5 Glu254Lys and COX2 C-645T and Val511Ala allele frequencies differed between Caucasians and African-American controls (P < 0.001). The ALOX5 -1752 and -1699 polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (P < 0.001) and associated with a decreased risk in Caucasians in ALOX5 haplotype analyses (P = 0.03). Furthermore, an inverse association was observed between A alleles at positions -1752 and -1699 of ALOX5 and  risk in Caucasians, but not in African-Americans. Caucasians with A alleles at ALOX5 -1752 had a reduced odds of  versus those with G alleles [odds ratio (OR) (GA versus GG), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-1.01; OR (AA versus GG), 0.33; 95% CI, 0.07-1.65, P(trend) = 0.02].

ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC)  tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino  composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, , and linoleic . In the same way, differences in the amino  composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic , leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, tyrosine, methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino  fragments. In this case, human  inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

PUFA-treated cells showed an increased number of lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PUFA-induced apoptosis of LoVo and RKO cells is mediated through a mitochondria-mediated pathway as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of ROS, accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, decreased ATP level and increase in the Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio.PUFAs induced apoptosis of  cells through a mitochondrial dependent pathway.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698447>Celecoxib use and circulating oxylipins in a  polyp prevention trial.</a></h2><p>Drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the metabolism of  (ARA) to prostaglandin E2 are potent anti-inflammatory agents used widely in the treatment of joint and muscle pain. Despite their benefits, daily use of these drugs has been associated with hypertension, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities. It is now recognized that ARA is metabolized to a number of bioactive oxygenated lipids (oxylipins) by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. Currently, the contribution of individual variability in ARA metabolism in response to the COX-2 inhibitors and potential adverse effects remains poorly understood. Using patient samples from the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III selenium/celecoxib (Sel/Cel) trial for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we analyzed plasma concentrations of 74 oxylipins in a subset of participants who received celecoxib (n = 90) or placebo (n = 95). We assessed the effect of celecoxib (with and without low dose aspirin) on circulating oxylipins and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Individual CYP450- and LOX- but not COX-derived metabolites were higher with celecoxib than placebo (P<0.05) and differences were greater among non-aspirin users. LOX derived 5- and 8-HETE were elevated with celecoxib and positively associated with systolic blood pressure (P = 0.011 and P = 0.019 respectively). 20-HETE, a prohypertensive androgen-sensitive CYP450 metabolite was higher with celecoxib absent aspirin and was positively associated with SBP in men (P = 0.040) but not women. Independent of celecoxib or aspirin, LOX derived metabolites from ARA were strongly associated with SBP including 5- and 8-HETE. These findings support oxylipins, particularly the ARA LOX-derived, in blood pressure control and indicate that pharmacologic inhibition of COX-2 has effects on LOX and CYP450 ARA metabolism that contribute to hypertension in some patients.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18159171>[COX-2 inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease: friends or foes?].</a></h2><p>The cyclooxygenase (COX) is a key enzyme in the conversion of  to prostaglandins. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and is a critical housekeeping gene, whereas COX-2 is rapidly upregulated by growth factors and cytokines and thus responsible for inflammation. COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in  adenoma and carcinoma. Specific inhibitors of COX-2 have been shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and to inhibit tumor growth in animal models and in humans. Long-standing IBD patients have increased risk of developing colorectal  compared to general population. IBD-associated colorectal carcinogenesis is probably promoted by chronic inflammation and closely related to COX-2. In a recent study, powerful chemopreventive ability of selective COX-2 inhibitor was observed in colitis-related  carcinogenesis in mouse model. But it was reported that even selective COX inhibitors aggravated the DSS-induced  inflammation. It is assumed that endogenous PGs are involved in the mucosal defense against DSS-induced  ulcerations which are produced by COX-1 at early phase and by COX-2 at late phase.

The enzymes have recently emerged as key regulators in lipid droplets formation and it is hypothesized that sPLA-GV and GX enhanced cell proliferation and lipid droplet accumulation in  cells (HT29). In this study, cell viability and lipid droplet accumulation were assessed by Resazurin assay and Oil-Red-O staining. Interestingly, both sPLA-GV and GX enzymes reduced intracellular lipid droplet accumulation and did not significantly affect cell proliferation in HT29 cells. Incubation with varespladib, a pan-inhibitor of sPLA-Group IIA/V/X, further suppressed lipid droplets accumulation in sPLA-GV but have no effects in sPLA-GX-treated cells. Further studies using catalytically inactive sPLA enzymes showed that the enzymes intrinsic catalytic activity is required for the net reduction of lipid accumulation. Meanwhile, inhibition of intracellular phospholipases (iPLA-γ and cPLA-α) unexpectedly enhanced lipid droplet accumulation in both sPLA-GV and GX-treated cells. The findings suggested an interconnected relationship between extracellular and intracellular phospholipases in lipid cycling. Previous studies indicated that sPLA enzymes are linked to  development due to their ability to induce release of  and eicosanoids as well as the stimulation of lipid droplet formation. This study showed that the two enzymes work in a distinct manner and they neither confer proliferative advantage nor enhanced the net lipid droplet accumulation in HT29 cells.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26216432>Leukotriene D4-induced Caco-2 cell proliferation is mediated by prostaglandin E2 synthesis.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) is a pro-inflammatory mediator formed from  through the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Its biological effects are mediated by at least two G-coupled plasmatic cysteinyl LT receptors (CysLT1-2R). It has been reported an upregulation of the 5-LOX pathway in tumor tissue unlike in normal  mucosa.  tumors generally have an increased expression of CysLT1R and  patients with high expression levels of CysLT1R have poor prognosis. We previously observed that the cyclooxygenase pathway is involved in the control of intestinal epithelial  cell growth through PGE2 production. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the effect of LTD4 binding with CysLT1R on Caco-2 cell growth. We note a number of key findings from this research. We observed that at a concentration similar to that found under inflammatory conditions, LTD4 was able to induce Caco-2 cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. Moreover, with the use of a specific receptor antagonist this study has demonstrated that the effect of LTD4 is a result of its interaction with CystLT1R. We also note the possible participation of the PLC-IP3-Ca(2+)/DAG-PKC signaling pathways in cytosolic PLA2 and [(3)H]AA release induced by LTD4-CystLT1R interaction. Finally, we found that the resulting activation of the AA cascade and the production of PGE2 eicosanoid could be related to the activation of cell signaling pathways such as ERK and CREB. These findings will help facilitate our understanding of how inflammatory mediators can affect the survival and dissemination of intestinal carcinoma cells.© 2015 The Authors.

Glutathione peroxidases (GPx) are among the most effective systems that protect cells from hydroperoxide toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between GPx and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), implicated in  pathogenesis, particularly in  cells.Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx or GPx4), which metabolizes peroxidized phospholipids, was cloned in an expression plasmid, transfected in HT29 cl.19A  carcinoma cells and the effects of PHGPx overexpression were measured on  metabolism by COX-2.

This enzyme has recently been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and asthma and may also play a role in  tumorigenesis. We show here that group X sPLA(2) [mouse (m)GX] is one of the most highly expressed PLA(2) in the mouse  and that recombinant mouse and human enzymes stimulate proliferation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation of various  cell lines, including -26  cells. Among various recombinant sPLA(2)s, mGX is the most potent enzyme to stimulate cell proliferation. Based on the use of sPLA(2) inhibitors, catalytic site mutants, and small interfering RNA silencing of cytosolic PLA(2)alpha and M-type sPLA(2) receptor, we demonstrate that mGX promotes cell proliferation independently of the receptor and via its intrinsic catalytic activity and production of free  and lysophospholipids, which are mitogenic by themselves. mGX can also elicit the production of large amounts of prostaglandin E2 and other eicosanoids from -26 cells, but these lipid mediators do not play a role in mGX-induced cell proliferation because inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases do not prevent sPLA(2) mitogenic effects. Together, our results indicate that group X sPLA(2) may play an important role in  tumorigenesis by promoting  cell proliferation and releasing various lipid mediators involved in other key events in  progression.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29605789>The role of the lipidome in obesity-mediated  risk.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a state of chronic inflammation influenced by lipids such as fatty acids and their secondary oxygenated metabolites deemed oxylipids. Many such lipid mediators serve as potent signaling molecules of inflammation, which can further alter lipid metabolism and lead to carcinogenesis. For example, sphingosine-1-phosphate activates cyclooxygenase-2 in endothelial cells resulting in the conversion of  (AA) to prostaglandin E (PGE). PGE promotes  cell growth. In contrast, the less studied path of AA oxygenation via cytochrome p450 enzymes produces epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EETs), whose anti-inflammatory properties cause shrinking of enlarged adipocytes, a characteristic of obesity, through the liberation of fatty acids. It is now thought that EET depletion occurs in obesity and may contribute to  cell carcinogenesis. Meanwhile, gangliosides, a type of sphingolipid, are cell surface signaling molecules that contribute to the apoptosis of  tumor cells. Many of these discoveries have been made recently and the mechanisms are still not fully understood, leading to an exciting new chapter of lipidomic research. In this review, mechanisms behind obesity-associated  are discussed with a focus on the role of small lipid signaling molecules in the process.

These effects are characterized by clastogenesis and damage to mitotic spindles in target cells and are mediated, in part, by trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). In this study, we investigated the role of COX and lipoxygenase (LOX) in producing this reactive aldehyde using E. faecalis-infected macrophages and interleukin (IL)-10-knockout mice colonized with this commensal. 4-HNE production by E. faecalis-infected macrophages was significantly reduced by COX and LOX inhibitors. The infection of macrophages led to decreased Cox1 and Alox5 expression whereas COX-2 and 4-HNE increased. Silencing Alox5 and Cox1 with gene-specific siRNAs had no effect on 4-HNE production. In contrast, silencing Cox2 significantly decreased 4-HNE production by E. faecalis-infected macrophages. Depleting intracellular glutathione increased 4-HNE production by these cells. Next, to confirm COX-2 as a source for 4-HNE, we assayed the products generated by recombinant human COX-2 and found 4-HNE in a concentration-dependent manner using  as a substrate. Finally, tissue macrophages in  biopsies from IL-10-knockout mice colonized with E. faecalis were positive for COX-2 by immunohistochemical staining. This was associated with increased staining for 4-HNE protein adducts in surrounding stroma. These data show that E. faecalis, a human intestinal commensal, can trigger macrophages to produce 4-HNE through COX-2.

CRC-secreted 12(S)-HETE enhances the retraction of -associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and therefore, 12(S)-HETE may enforce invasivity of CRC. Understanding the mechanisms of metastatic CRC is crucial for successful intervention. Therefore, we studied pro-invasive contributions of stromal cells in physiologically relevant three-dimensional in vitro assays consisting of CRC spheroids, CAFs, extracellular matrix and endothelial cells, as well as in reductionist models. In order to elucidate how CAFs support CRC invasion, tumour spheroid-induced CAF retraction and free intracellular Ca levels were measured and pharmacological- or siRNA-based inhibition of selected signalling cascades was performed. CRC spheroids caused the retraction of CAFs, generating entry gates in the adjacent surrogate stroma. The responsible trigger factor 12(S)-HETE provoked a signal, which was transduced by PLC, IP3, free intracellular Ca, Ca-calmodulin-kinase-II, RHO/ROCK and MYLK which led to the activation of myosin light chain 2, and subsequent CAF mobility. RHO activity was observed downstream as well as upstream of Ca release. Thus, Ca signalling served as central signal amplifier. Treatment with the FDA-approved drugs carbamazepine, cinnarizine, nifedipine and bepridil HCl, which reportedly interfere with cellular calcium availability, inhibited CAF-retraction.

The effects of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib and the 5-LOX inhibitor MK886 on prostaglandin E(2) and cysteinyl leukotriene production, tumor cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and Bcl-2/Bax expression were evaluated in the Caco-2 and HT29  cells.

Up-regulation of the COX-2 and 5-LOX pathways was found in the tumor tissue in comparison with normal  mucosa. Inhibition of either COX-2 or 5-LOX alone resulted in activation of the other pathway in  cells. Combined treatment with 10 micromol/L celecoxib and MK886 could prevent this activation and had additive effects on inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing cell apoptosis, decreasing Bcl-2 expression, increasing Bax expression, and determining mitochondrial depolarization in comparison with treatment with either inhibitor alone.

However, these side-effects are likely to be attributed to the additional effects of indomethacin besides its cyclooxygenase inhibition. In this study, we examined the effect of indomethacin on  uptake using LS174T human  cells. We here show that treatment of LS174T cells with indomethacin reduced  uptake as well as reduced expressions of fatty  translocase/CD36 and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma. Since  is a major substrate of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, we believe this novel effect of indomethacin may apply to new treatment strategies that aim to suppress these mediators by decreasing the uptake of their substrates, which would eventually inhibit colorectal  malignancy.Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Except CCL221  carcinoma cells, the growth of all  cell lines decreased if the cells were cultured in the presence of 10 microM molecular iodine (I(2)) for at least two days. delta-iodolactone (IL, 5 microM) was found to have a similar effect. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells turned out to be most susceptible to both iodine compounds (total inhibition), followed by MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells (60% and 77.7% inhibition in the presence of I(2) respect. IL) and HS24 lung carcinoma cells (36.3% respect. 40.3% inhibition). In contrast, MCF-10 normal mammary epithelial cells were much less affected by the iodine treatment. In both, SH-SY5Y and MCF-7 cells, I(2) and IL also abolished EGF-induced promotion of cell growth completely. This effect was, however, not due to an interfering with EGF-signaling, because I(2) and IL did not affect the phosphorylation of EGF-receptors, EGF-induced activation of MAP-kinase (Erk(1/2)), or EGF-induced lamellar actin protrusion.

Upon release, free  provides substrate for the synthesis of eicosanoids. However, under certain conditions,  may participate in ceramide-mediated apoptosis. Disruption of  homeostasis can shift the balance of cell turnover in favor of tumorigenesis, via overproduction of tumor-promoting eicosanoids or alternatively by limiting proapoptotic signals. In the following study, we evaluated the influence of genetic deletion of a key intracellular phospholipase, cytoplasmic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)), on azoxymethane-induced  tumorigenesis. Heterozygous and null mice, upon treatment with the organotropic  carcinogen, azoxymethane, developed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in  tumor multiplicity (7.2-fold and 5.5-fold, respectively) relative to their wild-type littermates. This enhanced tumor sensitivity may be explained, in part, by the attenuated levels of apoptosis observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining within the  epithelium of heterozygous and null mice ( approximately 50% of wild type). The lower frequency of apoptotic cells corresponded with reduced ceramide levels (69% and 46% of wild-type littermates, respectively). Remarkably, increased tumorigenesis resulting from cPLA(2) deletion occurred despite a significant reduction in prostaglandin E(2) production, even in cyclooxygenase-2-overexpressing tumors. These data contribute new information that supports a fundamental role of cPLA(2) in the control of  homeostasis and cell turnover. Our findings indicate that the proapoptotic role of cPLA(2) in the  may supercede its contribution to eicosanoid production in tumor development.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15172119>Effect of LY293111 in combination with gemcitabine in  .</a></h2><p>New adjuvant therapies are needed for the treatment of stage III .

Several peroxisome proliferators and  derivatives enhance cytochrome P450 1A1 activity, but the mechanisms involved remain unknown. The aim of this work was to study the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in cytochrome P450 1A1 gene induction.The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor transcription factors in cytochrome P450 1A1 induction was assessed by means of enzymatic activities, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, gene reporter assays, mutagenesis, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay.We show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonists (WY-14643, bezafibrate, clofibrate, and phthalate) induce human cytochrome P450 1A1 gene expression, whereas 2,4-thiazolidinedione, a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist, represses it. The induction of cytochrome P450 1A1 transcripts by WY-14643 was associated with a marked increase of ethoxyresorufin O -deethylase activity (10-fold at 200 mumol/L). Transfection of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha complementary DNA enhanced cytochrome P450 1A1 messenger RNA induction by WY-14643, although WY-14643 failed to activate xenobiotic responsive element sequences. Two peroxisome proliferator response element sites were located at positions -931/-919 and -531/-519 of the cytochrome P450 1A1 promoter. Their inactivation by directed mutagenesis suppressed the inductive effect of WY-14643 on cytochrome P450 1A1 promoter activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay experiments showed that the 2 cytochrome P450 1A1 peroxisome proliferator response element sites bind the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha/retinoid X receptor-alpha heterodimer.We describe here a new cytochrome P450 1A1 induction pathway involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and 2 peroxisome proliferator response element sites, indicating that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ligands, which are common environmental compounds, may be involved in carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26433161>Defects in 15-HETE Production and Control of Epithelial Permeability by Human Enteric Glial Cells From Patients With Crohn's Disease.</a></h2><p>Enteric glial cells (EGCs) produce soluble mediators that regulate homeostasis and permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB). We investigated the profile of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites produced by EGCs from rats and from patients with Crohn's disease (CD), compared with controls, along with the ability of one of these metabolites, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), to regulate the permeability of the IEB.We isolated EGCs from male Sprague-Dawley rats, intestinal resections of 6 patients with CD, and uninflamed healthy areas of intestinal tissue from 6 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal  (controls). EGC-conditioned media was analyzed by high-sensitivity liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine PUFA signatures. We used immunostaining to identify 15-HETE-producing enzymes in EGCs and tissues. The effects of human EGCs and 15-HETE on permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance of the IEB were measured using Caco-2 cells; effects on signal transduction proteins were measured with immunoblots. Levels of proteins were reduced in Caco-2 cells using short-hairpin RNAs or proteins were inhibited pharmacologically. Rats were given intraperitoneal injections of 15-HETE or an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase (the enzyme that produces 15-HETE); colons were collected and permeability was measured.EGCs expressed 15-lipoxygenase-2 and produced high levels of 15-HETE, which increased IEB resistance and reduced IEB permeability. 15-HETE production was reduced in EGCs from patients with CD compared with controls. EGCs from patients with CD were unable to reduce the permeability of the IEB; the addition of 15-HETE restored permeability to levels of control tissues. Inhibiting 15-HETE production in rats increased the permeability of the IEB in  tissues. We found that 15-HETE regulates IEB permeability by inhibiting an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.Enteric glial cells from patients with CD have reduced production of 15-HETE, which controls IEB permeability by inhibiting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and increasing expression of zonula occludens-1.Copyright © 2016 AGA Institute.

Epidemiologic studies show that individuals taking nonselective, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, have a significant reduction in CRC mortality, compared with those not taking these agents. The recent characterization of cyclooxygenase- I and -2 (COX- I and COX-2) isoforms has led to an expanded understanding of how nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help prevent polyp formation. Cyclooxygenase enzymes are required for the conversion of  to prostaglandins.COX-2 mediates the inflammatory effects of COX activity, is induced by a wide spectrum of growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines, and is overexpressed in numerous premalignant and malignant lesions, including CRC. Treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib has shown promising results in the prevention of CRC, Numerous studies show that this COX-2 selective inhibitor is a potent suppressor of  polyps both in animal models for familial adenomatous polyposis and in patients with this condition. This has led to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of celecoxib for the treatment of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. The role of celecoxib in  treatment is still evolving.

The events induced by inflammatory mediators lead to dysregulated activation and induction of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-2 is involved in the conversion of  to biologically active prostanoids and is highly upregulated in . Since inflammation-induced changes to the extracellular matrix could affect integrin activities, we here investigated the effect of integrin signalling on the level of COX-2 expression in the non-transformed intestinal epithelial cell lines, Int 407 and IEC-6. Adhesion of these cells to a collagen I- or IV-coated surface, increased surface expression of alpha2beta1 integrin. Activation of integrins with collagen caused an increased cox-2 promoter activity, with a subsequent increase in COX-2 expression. The signalling cascade leading to this increased expression and promoter activity of cox-2, involves PKCalpha, the small GTPase Ras and NFkappaB but not Erk1/2 or Src activity.

Non-selective and selective COX-2 inhibitors attenuated DOX-induced accumulation of wild type (WT) but not mutant p53.

Moreover, the DOX-induced increase in p53 protein levels was reduced in COX-2 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to those in WT or COX-1 KO MEFs. DOX-induced accumulation of p53 was attenuated by a specific inhibitor or knockdown of Jun-N-terminal kinase (Jnk).

The molecular mechanism by which DHA induces apoptosis is unclear. Although there is no direct evidence, some studies have suggested that DNA damage generated through lipid peroxidation may be involved. Our previous studies showed that DHA, because it has a high degree of unsaturation, can give rise to the acrolein-derived 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine (Acr-dG) as a major class of DNA adducts via lipid oxidation. As a first step to investigate the possible role of oxidative DNA damage in apoptosis induced by DHA, we examined the relationships between oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis caused by DHA in human  HT-29 cells. Apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage, including Acr-dG and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) formation, in cells treated with DHA and omega-6 PUFAs, including  (AA) and linoleic  (LA), were measured. DHA induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner with a concentration range from 0 to 300 microM as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. In contrast, AA and LA had little or no effect at these concentrations. The Acr-dG levels were increased in HT-29 cells treated with DHA at 240 and 300 microM, and the increases were correlated with the induction of apoptosis at these concentrations, while no significant changes were observed for 8-oxo-dG. Because proteins may compete with DNA to react with acrolein, we then examined the effects of BSA on DHA-induced apoptosis and oxidative DNA damage. The addition of BSA to HT-29 cell culture media significantly decreases Acr-dG levels with a concomitant decrease in the apoptosis induced by DHA. The reduced Acr-dG formation is attributed to the reaction of BSA with acrolein as indicated by increased levels of total protein carbonyls. Similar correlations between Acr-dG formation and apoptosis were observed in HT-29 cells directly incubated with 0-200 microM acrolein. Additionally, DHA treatment increased the level of DNA strand breaks and caused cell cycle arrested at G1 phase. Taken together, these results demonstrate the parallel relationships between Acr-dG level and apoptosis in HT-29 cells, suggesting that the formation of Acr-dG in cellular DNA may contribute to apoptosis induced by DHA.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17374734>Genetic and epigenetic regulation of the human prostacyclin synthase promoter in lung  cell lines.</a></h2><p>The importance of the  pathway has been established in  and lung cancers, as well as in inflammatory diseases.

In addition, PGIS expression in several human lung  cell lines is silenced by CpG methylation, and we have mapped these sites across the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) sequence in the promoter, as well as CpGs within exon 1 and the first intron. Finally, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that human lung  cell lines and lung  tissues do not have a loss of the PGIS genomic region but multiple copies. These results show that an individual's PGIS promoter haplotype can play an important role in the predisposition for lung  and CpG methylation provides an epigenetic mechanism for the down-regulated PGIS expression.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24178365>Adipose tissue fatty  composition and : a case-control study.</a></h2><p>An increased dietary intake of fat, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been related to an increased risk of breast, prostate and  cancers.

There were distinct lipodomic patterns consistent with a lipogenic phenotype in tumors. In tumor tissue, the eicosapentaenoic / ratio, cyclooxygenase-2 expression and the mole percent of saturated fatty acids were significant predictors of inter-animal variability in  PGE after accounting for diet. In normal tissues from either control rats or carcinogen-treated rats, only diet was a significant predictor of  PGE.

Their effect on  carcinogenesis using carcinoma formation as an end point is unknown. We assessed the chemopreventive properties of NO-indomethacin (NCX 530) and NO-aspirin (NCX 4016) against azoxymethane-induced . Seven-week-old male F344 rats were fed control diet, and 1 week later, rats received two weekly s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg/kg body weight). Two weeks after azoxymethane treatment, rats (48 per group) were fed experimental diets containing NO-indomethacin (0, 40, or 80 ppm), or NO-aspirin (1,500 or 3,000 ppm), representing 40% and 80% of the maximum tolerated dose. All rats were killed 48 weeks after azoxymethane treatment and assessed for  tumor efficacy and molecular changes in  tumors and normally appearing  mucosa of different dietary groups. Our results suggest that NO-indomethacin at 40 and 80 ppm and NO-aspirin at 3,000 ppm significantly suppressed both tumor incidence (P < 0.01) and multiplicity (P < 0.001). The degree of inhibition was more pronounced with NO-indomethacin at both dose levels (72% and 76% inhibition) than with NO-aspirin (43% and 67%). NO-indomethacin at 40 and 80 ppm and NO-aspirin at 3,000 ppm significantly inhibited the  tumors' (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001) total cyclooxygenase (COX), including COX-2 activity (52-75% inhibition) and formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), PGF2alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1alpha, and TxB2 from  (53-77% inhibition). Nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS-2) activity and beta-catenin expression were suppressed in animals given NO-NSAID. In  crypts and tumors of animals fed these two NO-NSAIDs, there was a significant decrease in proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling when compared with animals fed the control diet. The results of this study provide strong evidence that NO-NSAIDs possess strong inhibitory effect against  carcinogenesis; their effect is associated with suppression of COX and NOS-2 activities and beta-catenin levels in  tumors.

Their synthesis is dependent on two cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which are rate-limiting for the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes from free . Selective inhibitors of both COX forms have the potential to inhibit  tumorigenesis, and there is abundant documented evidence of elevated expression of COX-2 in  tumors and a variety of other malignancies. The resultant high level PGE2 production may play an important role in cell proliferation, modulation of apoptosis, angiogenesis, inflammation and immune surveillance. Prostanoids exert their biological actions through binding to eight specific membrane receptors; the four subtypes EP1 to EP4 for PGE2; DP for PGD2; FP for PGF2; IP for PGI2; and TP for thromboxane A2. Recently, genetic and pharmacologic experiments have suggested that all PGE2 receptors can contribute to  tumorigenesis. Moreover, it is suggested that EP1 and EP4 play roles in polyp formation independently. It is important to determine details of the down-stream signaling pathways of prostanoid receptors for further understanding of the mechanisms of  development.

However, total fat consists of different fatty  families, e.g., saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Epidemiological evidence and experimental studies suggest that these fatty  families have different effects on breast and  carcinogenesis. Therefore the action of each fatty  on carcinogenesis should be evaluated separately. Although it is difficult to establish firm conclusions on the effect of each fatty  in human epidemiological studies, experimental studies on animals and cultured cells suggest that n-6 PUFAs (linoleic  and ) may have a tumor promoting effect, while n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic  and alpha-linolenic ) and conjugated fatty acids (CFAs; a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of PUFAs with conjugated double bonds) exert an inhibitory effect on tumor growth. SFAs such as palmitic  and stearic  show little or no tumor promoting effect, and the action of oleic , a MUFA, is inconclusive. In addition to regulation of abnormal cell growth seen in cancers, fatty acids also control cell loss seen in degenerative eye diseases, such as degeneration of lens material in cataract and degeneration of photoreceptor cells in retinitis pigmentosa. Experiments suggest that n-6 PUFAs cause deleterious effects, while n-3 PUFAs result in beneficial effects on the lens and retina. In particular, docosahexaenoic  is known to be effective in rescuing photoreceptor cells from damage. Thus, understanding the function of each fatty  is likely to be important for making progress in treating these and other diseases.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17488476>Pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma and therapeutic implications: the roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and Cox-2.</a></h2><p>Pathways of the molecular pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma have been extensively studied and molecular lesions during the development of the disease have been revealed. High up in the list of colorectal  lesions are APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), K-ras, Smad4 (or DPC4-deleted in pancreatic  4) and p53 genes. All these molecules are part of important pathways for the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis and as a result perturbation of these processes lead to carcinogenesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is comprised of a multi-unit cellular protease system that regulates several dozens of cell proteins after their ligation with the protein ubiquitin. Given that among these proteins are regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion and cell signalling, this system plays a significant role in cell fate and carcinogenesis. UPS inhibition has been found to be a pre-requisite for apoptosis and is already clinically exploited with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in multiple myeloma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is the inducible form of the enzyme that metabolizes the lipid  to prostaglandin H2, the first step of prostaglandins production. This enzyme is up-regulated in colorectal  and in several other cancers. Inhibition of Cox-2 by aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been found to inhibit proliferation of colorectal  cells and in epidemiologic studies has been shown to reduce  polyp formation in genetically predisposed populations and in the general population. NSAIDs have also Cox-independent anti-proliferative effects. Targeted therapies, the result of increasingly understanding carcinogenesis in the molecular level, have entered the field of anti-neoplastic treatment and are used by themselves and in combination with chemotherapy drugs. Combinations of targeted drugs have started also to be investigated.

The present work evaluates modulation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with hypericin by pre-treatment with n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in HT-29 and HeLa tumour cells. We observed stimulation of cytotoxic effects by docosahexaenoic  (n-3) and  (n-6) in several stages of action in both cell lines. Treatment with either fatty acids or photodynamic therapy alone induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner; however the effect was even more striking in mutual combination applied as pre-treatment with fatty acids prior to photodynamic therapy. Moreover, the combination also induced changes in membrane lipid composition leading to alteration in cell membrane fluidity. Increased toxicity of combined treatment was also confirmed by the presence of oxidative stress demonstrated by ROS production, RNS accumulation and increased presence of lipoperoxides. In conclusion, we suggest that pre-treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to cytotoxic effects induced by photodynamic therapy with hypericin.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15588151>The effects of parenteral lipid emulsions on  and normal human  epithelial cells in vitro.</a></h2><p>Differences in lipid metabolism of tumor and normal tissues suggest a distinct response to available lipid compounds.

The concentration of emulsions which did not affected HT-29 cells increased the percentage of floating and subG0/G1 FHC cells probably due to their higher reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation. Co-treatment of cells with antioxidant Trolox reduced the observed effects.

Cox2 is expressed during early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis from the premalignant adenoma stage, and adenocarcinomas of stomach, , breast, lung and prostate. Its expression is detected in neoplastic, inflammatory, endothelial and stromal cells. Cox2 is involved in the conversion of  into prostaglandins and thromboxanes, as well as the synthesis of malonaldehyde (MDA, a mutagen) and the production of hydrogen peroxide, which promotes carcinogenesis. The Cox2 products act in turn on serpentine receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins (R-TXA2, R-PG) that are connected to signaling elements implicated in oncogenesis. Thus, Cox2 plays a key role in early stages of carcinogenesis by promoting the proliferation of tumoral cells and their resistance to apoptosis, as well as angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion and setting up of the metastatic process.

Further analysis indicated that AA increased the expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in this cell line and inhibiting its expression by small molecule inhibitors lowered the production of LTB and reduced migration. In contrast, MCF-7 cells did not show any appreciable changes in eicosanoid synthesis, 5-LOX expression, or cellular migration.Our results suggest that AA treatment activates the BLT1 receptor (present in membrane microdomains) and stimulates the synthesis of LTB production, which is likely to be associated with the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28983734>Anti-inflammatory Effects of Enhanced Recovery Programs on Early-Stage Colorectal  Surgery.</a></h2><p>Postoperative ileus (POI) is observed in 20-30% of patients undergoing colorectal  surgery, despite enhanced recovery programs (ERPs).

COX-mediated formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from linoleic  (LA) showed that HCA-7 cells can convert LA into  (AA). Alternatively, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) was found to compete with AA for COX. Strongly decreased PGE2 levels by addition of IM demonstrated involvement of COX in PUFA metabolism.

Overall, inhibiting effects were stronger for PhIP than for IQ. HCA-DNA adduct formation was stimulated by addition of PUFA, although high PUFA concentrations partly reduced this stimulating effect. Finally, similar effects for n-3 and n-6 fatty acids suggested that adduct formation may not be the crucial mechanism behind the differential effects of PUFA on  carcinogenesis that have been described.

This study sought to investigate the roles of these mediators in experimental models of inflammation and inflammation-associated intestinal tumorigenesis. Using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of experimental colitis, we first investigated how a global reduction in eicosanoid production would impact intestinal injury by utilizing cPLA2 knockout mice. cPLA2 deletion enhanced  injury, reflected by increased mucosal ulceration and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Increased disease severity was associated with a significant reduction in the levels of several eicosanoid metabolites, including PGE2. We further assessed the precise role of PGE2 synthesis on mucosal injury and repair by utilizing mice with a genetic deletion of microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1), the terminal synthase in the formation of inducible PGE2. DSS exposure caused more extensive acute injury as well as impaired recovery in knockout mice compared to wild-type littermates. Increased intestinal damage was associated with both reduced PGE2 levels as well as altered levels of other eicosanoids including PGD2. To determine whether this metabolic redirection impacted inflammation-associated intestinal tumorigenesis, Apc(Min/+) and Apc(Min/+):mPGES-1(-/-) mice were exposed to DSS. DSS administration caused a reduction in the number of intestinal polyps only in Apc(Min/+):mPGES-1(-/-) mice.

We tested several C18 polyunsaturated fatty -enriched oils (e.g., sunflower and Echium) as well as other oils, such as -enriched (Arasco®) and docosahexaenoic -enriched (Marinol® and cod liver oil), in addition to coconut and olive oils. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test indicated inhibitory effects on HT-29 cells viability for FFAs, and monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol (DAG) species, while the lactate dehydrogenase test proved that FFAs were the more effective species to induce membrane injury. Conversely, all species did not exhibit actions on CCD-18 normal human  cells viability. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of necrosis and apoptosis, while the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition test demonstrated high activity for 2-monoacylglycerols derived from Arasco and sunflower oils.

Antisense technology approaches and use of different kinds of blocker targeted to 5-LOX, FLAP (5-LOX-activating protein), and OXER1 have shown a greater efficiency in combating different  cell types.

The aim of this study was to refine the LC/MS and spin trapping technique to make it possible for the association between free radicals and  cell growth to be directly tested. Using a  cell line, HCA-7 colony 29, and LC/MS along with a solid-phase extraction, we were able to characterize the reduced forms of radical adducts (hydroxylamines) as the free radicals generated from cellular COX-catalyzed peroxidation. For the first time, free radicals formed in the COX-catalyzed peroxidation of AA vs DGLA and their association with  cell growth were assessed (cell proliferation via MTS and cell cycle distribution via propidium iodide staining) in the same experimental setting. The exclusive free radicals formed from the COX-catalyzed peroxidation of AA and DGLA were shown to be correlated with the cell growth response. Our results indicate that free radicals generated from the distinct radical reactions in COX-catalyzed peroxidation may represent the novel metabolites of AA and DGLA that correspond to their contrasting bioactivity.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To further explore the actions of sPLA2-IIA in tumorigenesis, sPLA2-IIA was overexpressed in two cell lines where it is normally absent, the murine  tumor cell line AJ02nm0, and human  carcinoma cell line HCT-116. Two allelic variants of sPLA2-IIA were tested in this study; sPLA2-IIA(AKR) and sPLA2-IIA(SWR), which are derived from AKR/J and SWR/J mice, respectively, and differ by a single amino  at position 63 in the calcium- and receptor-binding domain. There was no change in cell-doubling time for either allele when compared to vector controls. Furthermore, sodium butyrate and  (AA)-induced cell death were unchanged in control and transfected cells. Addition of the sPLA2 substrate, palmitoyl-arachidonoyl-phosphatidic  (PAPA), to AJ02nm0 cells resulted in a modest (12%-24%), but significant (P < 0.01), inhibition of growth that was dependent on sPLA2-IIA expression.

In addition, sPLA2-IIA expressing HCT-116 tumors were found to be more infiltrative than controls. We conclude that the ability of sPLA2-IIA to slow tumor cell growth is dependent upon the availability of substrate, and that in some instances sPLA2-IIA may actually enhance tumor growth.

The synthesis of PGE(2) from PGH(2) is facilitated by three different PGE synthases, and functional PGE(2) can promote tumor growth by binding to four EP receptors to activate signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. An integral method of controlling gene expression is by posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate mRNA stability and protein translation. Messenger RNA regulatory elements typically reside within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the transcript and play a critical role in targeting specific mRNAs for posttranscriptional regulation through microRNA (miRNA) binding and adenylate- and uridylate-rich element RNA-binding proteins. In this review, we highlight the current advances in our understanding of the impact these RNA sequence elements have upon regulating PGE(2) levels. We also identify various RNA sequence elements consistently observed within the 3'UTRs of the genes involved in the PGE(2) pathway, indicating these binding sites for miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins to be central regulators of PGE(2) synthesis and function.

Interestingly, the survival rate of Fads1-null mice is severely compromised after 2 months on a semi-purified AA-free diet, which precludes long-term chemoprevention studies. Therefore, in this study, dietary AA levels were titrated to determine the minimal level required for survival, while maintaining a distinct AA-deficient phenotype. Null mice supplemented with AA (0.1%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 2.0%, w/w) in the diet exhibited a dose-dependent increase (P < 0.05) in AA, PGE2, 6-keto PGF1α, TXB2, and EdU-positive proliferative cells in the .

Results showed that pretreating  cells with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) promoted  growth in the nude mouse xenograft model. Inhibition of COX-2 or 5-LOX reduced the tumor size. In the group treated with COX-2-inhibitor, the PGE2 level decreased while the LTB4 level increased. In contrast, in the 5-LOX-inhibitor treated group, the LTB4 level was reduced and the PGE2 level was unchanged. However, combined treatment with both COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitors further inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CSE over treatment with either COX-2-inhibitor or 5-LOX-inhibitor alone. This was accompanied by the downregulation of PGE2 and LTB4. In an in vitro study, we found that the action of CSE on  cells was mediated by 5-LOX DNA demethylation. In summary, these results indicate that inhibition of COX-2 may lead to a shunt of  metabolism towards the leukotriene pathway during  tumorigenesis promoted by CSE. Suppression of 5-LOX did not induce such a shunt and produced a better response.

In addition, D5D knockdown along with DGLA supplement may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. After knocking down D5D in HCA-7 colony 29 cells and HT-29 cells (human  cell lines with high and low COX levels, respectively), the antitumor activity of DGLA was significantly enhanced along with the formation of a threshold range (~0.5-1.0μM) of 8-hydroxyoctanoic . In contrast, DGLA treatment did not inhibit cell growth when D5D was not knocked down and only limited amount of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  was formed. D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment also enhanced the cytotoxicities of various chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil, regorafenib, and irinotecan, potentially through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. p53 and caspase 9. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed COX in  cells can be utilized in suppressing  cell growth.

We hypothesized that COX-1 or COX-2 knockout lung fibroblasts may display altered protein profiles which may allow us to further differentiate the functional roles of these isozymes at the molecular level. Proteomic analysis shows constitutive production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in lung fibroblasts derived from COX-2 but not wild-type (WT) or COX-1 mice. MIF was spontaneously released in high levels into the extracellular milieu of COX2 fibroblasts seemingly from the preformed intracellular stores, with no change in the basal gene expression of MIF. The secretion and regulation of MIF in COX-2 was "prostaglandin-independent." GO analysis showed that concurrent with upregulation of MIF, there is a significant surge in expression of genes related to fibroblast growth, FK506 binding proteins, and isomerase activity in COX-2 cells. Furthermore, COX-2 fibroblasts also exhibit a significant increase in transcriptional activity of various regulators, antagonists, and co-modulators of p53, as well as in the expression of oncogenes and related transcripts.

It has been reported to possess significant antitumor effects that inhibit the process of carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying its anticancer effects remain largely unresolved. In this study, we investigated the  chemopreventive effects of American ginseng on the progression of high fat (HF) diet-enhanced colorectal carcinogenesis with a genetically engineered Apc(Min/+) mouse model. The metabolic alterations in sera of experimental mice perturbed by HF diet intervention as well as the American ginseng treatment were measured by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) analysis. American ginseng treatment significantly extended the life span of the Apc(Min/+) mouse. Significant alterations of metabolites involving amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates were observed in Apc(Min/+) mouse in sera, which were attenuated by American ginseng treatment and concurrent with the histopathological improvement with significantly reduced tumor initiation, progression and gut inflammation. These metabolic changes suggest that the preventive effect of American ginseng is associated with attenuation of impaired amino , carbohydrates, and lipid metabolism. It also appears that American ginseng induced significant metabolic alterations independent of the Apc(Min/+) induced metabolic changes. The significantly altered metabolites induced by American ginseng intervention include , linolelaidic , glutamate, docosahexaenoate, tryptophan, and fructose, all of which are associated with inflammation and oxidation.

The  (AA) pathway and linoleic  (LA) pathway have been implicated as important contributors to CRC development and growth. Human 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LOX-1) converts LA to anti-tumor 13-S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic  (13-HODE)and 15-LOX-2 converts AA to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE). In addition, human 12-LOX metabolizes AA to pro-tumor 12-HETE. In rodents, the function of 12-LOX and 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 is carried out by a single enzyme, 12/15-LOX. As a result, conflicting conclusions concerning the role of 12-LOX and 15-LOX have been obtained in animal studies. In the present studies, we determined that PD146176, a selective 15-LOX-1 inhibitor, markedly suppressed 13-HODE generation in human  HCA-7 cells and HCA-7 tumors, in association with increased tumor growth. In contrast, PD146176 treatment led to decreases in 12-HETE generation in mouse  MC38 cells and MC38 tumors, in association with tumor inhibition. Surprisingly, deletion of host 12/15-LOX alone led to increased MC38 tumor growth, in association with decreased tumor 13-HODE levels, possibly due to inhibition of 12/15-LOX activity in stroma. Therefore, the effect of 12/15-LOX on colorectal tumorigenesis in mouse models could be affected by tumor cell type (human or mouse), relative 12/15 LOX activity in tumor cells and stroma as well as the relative tumor 13-HODE and 12-HETE levels.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30423565>Mice Deficient in Cyp4a14 Have An Increased Number of Goblet Cells and Attenuated Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis.</a></h2><p>Cyp4a14 is a member of cytochrome P450 (Cyp450) enzyme superfamily that possesses NADPH monooxygenase activity, which catalyzes omega-hydroxylation of medium-chain fatty acids and .

Cox2 is involved in the conversion of  into prostaglandins and thromboxanes, as well as the synthesis of malonaldehyde (MDA, a mutagen) and the production of hydrogen peroxide, which promotes carcinogenesis. The Cox2 products act in turn on serpentine receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins (R-TXA2, R-PG) that are connected to signaling elements implicated in oncogenesis. Thus, Cox2 plays a key role in early stages of carcinogenesis by promoting the proliferation of tumoral cells and their resistance to apoptosis, as well as angiogenesis. tumor cell invasion and setting up of the metastatic process.

Evidence shows that, via COX-mediated peroxidation, DGLA and its metabolites (1-series prostaglandins) are associated with anti-tumor activity, while AA and its metabolites (2-series prostaglandins) could be tightly implicated in various  diseases. However, it still remains a mystery why DGLA and AA possess contrasting bioactivities. Our previous studies showed that DGLA could go through an exclusive C-8 oxygenation pathway during COX-catalyzed lipid peroxidation in addition to a C-15 oxygenation pathway shared by both DGLA and AA, and that the exclusive C-8 oxygenation could lead to the production of distinct DGLA׳s free radical derivatives that may be correlated with DGLA׳s anti-proliferation activity. In the present work, we further investigate the anti- effect of DGLA׳s free radical derivatives and their associated molecular mechanisms. Our study shows that the exclusive DGLA׳s free radical derivatives from C-8 oxygenation lead to cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the human  cell line HCA-7 colony 29, probably by up-regulating the  suppressor p53 and the cell cycle inhibitor p27. In addition, these exclusive radical derivatives were also able to enhance the efficacy of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a widely used chemo-drug for .

Here, this novel research finding is extended to pancreatic  growth, as COX-2 is also commonly overexpressed in pancreatic . The pancreatic  cell line, BxPC-3 (with high COX-2 expression and mutated p53), was used to assess not only the inhibitory effects of the enhanced formation of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  from cellular COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation but also its potential synergistic and/or additive effect on current chemotherapy drugs. This work demonstrated that, by inducing DNA damage through inhibition of histone deacetylase, a threshold level of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  achieved in DGLA-treated and D5D-knockdown BxPC-3 cells subsequently induce  cell apoptosis. Furthermore, it was shown that a combination of D5D knockdown along with DGLA treatment could also significantly sensitize BxPC-3 cells to various chemotherapy drugs, likely via a p53-independent pathway through downregulating of anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2) and activating pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., caspase 3, -9). This study reinforces the supposition that using commonly overexpressed COX-2 for molecular targeting, a strategy conceptually distinct from the prevailing COX-2 inhibition strategy used in  treatment, is an important as well as viable alternative to inhibit  cell growth.

Microarray analysis, Western blotting, ELISA, and immunohistochemical staining were done to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of  chemopreventive effects of SFN and DBM. Dietary administrations of SFN and DBM alone or in combination significantly inhibited the development of intestinal adenomas by 48% (P=0.002), 50% (P=0.001), and 57% (P<0.001), respectively.

After the experimental period, samples of plasma were collected and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time off light mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF). Multivariate statistical tools were used to identify the changes of serum metabolites associated with CRC and responses to IA treatment. HT 29 and HCT 116 cells were stimulated by palmitate (PA) and cultured under hypoxia. Western blot, Q-PCR, and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to confirm the molecular pathway in vivo and in vitro.Our results showed IA significantly inhibited the inflammatory colitis symptoms such as disease activity index score, shortening of  tissues and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. In metabolomic study, 31 potential metabolites associated with CRC were identified and 24 of them were reversed by IA treatment. Most of biomarkers were associated with  metabolism, glycerophospholipid catabolism, and phospholipid metabolism, suggesting lipid metabolism might be involved in the beneficial effect of IA on CRC. Furthermore, we also found IA could decrease the expressions of SREBP-1 and its target gene in the  tissues of AOM/DSS mice. It could down-regulate the triglyceride (TG) content and the expressions of HIF1α, SREBP-1, FASN, and ACC in HT 29 and HCT 116 cells.

Evidence in the literature suggests that araC may inhibit the growth of human  carcinoma cell lines as well. Because araC action interferes with normal nucleoside metabolism, it is highly toxic to a number of normal cell types including bone marrow and intestinal mucosa cells. Here we investigate whether the omega-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  (DHA) could selectively target araC toxicity toward  tumor cells while protecting the normal cells in vitro.Cultures of normal rat  epithelial cells (4D/WT) and those transformed by v-src (D/v-src) were supplemented with graded concentrations of DHA or  (AA) alone or in combination with araC. AraC was only 1.6 fold more toxic to D/v-src than 4D/WT in cultures without added fatty acids. Supplementing with as little as 3 muM of either AA or DHA increased araC toxicity by more than 30-fold in the tumorigenic cells. The toxic effect of araC on the normal cells was also increased by the fatty  supplementation.

We measured Nox1-dependent O2- production during cell spreading on Collagen IV (Coll IV) in  carcinoma cell lines. Knocking down Nox1 by shRNA, we showed that Nox1-dependent O2- production is activated during cell spreading after 4 hr of adhesion on Collagen IV. Nox1 activation during cell spreading relies on Rac1 activation and  metabolism. Our results showed that manoalide (a secreted phospholipase A2 inhibitor) and cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate (a 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor) inhibit O2- production, cell spreading and cell proliferation in these  epithelial cells. 12-Lipoxygenase inhibition of ROS production and cell spreading can be reversed by adding 12-HETE, a 12-lipoxygenase product, supporting the specific effect observed with cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate. In contrast, Nox1 shRNA and DPI (NADPH oxidase inhibitor) weakly affect cell spreading while inhibiting O2- production and cell proliferation.

Supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids was done for 12 weeks using personalized dosing that was expected to reduce  PGE by 50%. In stepwise linear regression models, the ω-3 fatty  dose and baseline BMI explained 16.1% of the inter-individual variability in the fold change of  PGE post-supplementation. Increases in mRNA gene expression after supplementation were, however, modest and were not associated with changes in PGE. When baseline expression of PTGS1, PTGS2 and HPGD genes was included in the linear regression model containing dose and BMI, only PTGS2, the gene coding for the inducible form cyclooxygenase, was a significant predictor. Higher relative expression of PTGS2 predicted greater decreases in  PGE, accounting for an additional 13.6% of the inter-individual variance. In the final step of the regression model, greater decreases in total  fatty  concentrations predicted greater decreases in  PGE, contributing to an additional 18.7% of the variance. Overall, baseline BMI, baseline expression of PTGS2 and changes in  total fatty acids together accounted for 48% of the inter-individual variability in the change in  PGE. This is consistent with biochemical data showing that fatty acids which are not substrates for cyclooxygenases can activate cyclooxygenase-2 allosterically.

The best known targets of NSAIDs are cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which convert  to prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane.

PlsEtn distribution was studied in healthy, adenomatous, and carcinomatous  mucosa sections by IMS. In epithelium, 75% of PlsEtn changed in a highly regular manner along the crypt axis, in clear contrast with diacyl species (67% of which remained constant). Consistently, AA-containing PlsEtn species were more abundant at the base, where stem cells reside, and decreased while ascending the crypt. In turn, mono-/diunsaturated species experienced the opposite change. These gradients were accompanied by a gradual expression of ether lipid synthesis enzymes. In lamina propria, 90% of stromal PlsEtn remained unchanged despite the high content of AA and the gradient in AA-containing diacylglycerophospholipids. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were severely affected in polyps and carcinoma.

Therefore, the causal role of ACSL4 is still not established. This study was undertaken to determine the role of ACSL4 in AA metabolic pathway in breast  cells. The first novel finding is that ACSL4 regulates the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and the production of prostaglandin in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also found that ACSL4 is significantly up-regulated in the highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast  cells. In terms of its overexpression and inhibition, ACSL4 plays a causal role in the control of the aggressive phenotype. These results were confirmed by the increase in the aggressive behaviour of MCF-7 cells stably transfected with a Tet-off ACSL4 vector. Concomitantly, another significant finding was that intramitochondrial AA levels are significantly higher in the aggressive cells. Thus, the esterification of AA by ACSL4 compartmentalizes the release of AA in mitochondria, a mechanism that serves to drive the specific lipooxygenase metabolization of the fatty . To our knowledge, this is the first report that ACSL4 expression controls both lipooxygenase and cyclooxygenase metabolism of AA.

We reported the most active cytotoxic level to be correspondence to LC₅₀ values of 20.2, 59.2 ppm and 18.9 and 26 ppm. Accordingly, bio-assay guided fractionation was conducted to identi- fy the bioactive compounds. , eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  were characterized based on GC-MS analyses.

However, several recent large-scale human trials with high doses of α-tocopherol (α-T) have produced disappointing results. This points out the need for a better understanding of the biological activities of the different forms of tocopherols. Using a naturally occurring tocopherol mixture (γ-TmT) that is rich in γ-T, we demonstrated the inhibition of chemically induced lung, , and mammary  formation as well as the growth of xenograft tumors derived from human lung and prostate  cells. This broad anticancer activity of γ-TmT has been attributed mainly to the trapping of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and inhibition of  metabolism. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and the inhibition of estrogen signaling have also been observed in the inhibition of mammary  development. δ-T has been shown to be more active than γ-T in inhibiting the growth of human lung  cells in a xenograft tumor model and the development of aberrant crypt foci in azoxymethane-treated rats, whereas α-T is not effective in these models. The higher inhibitory activities of δ-T and γ-T (than α-T) are proposed to be due to their trapping of reactive nitrogen species and their capacity to generate side-chain degradation products, which retain the intact chromanol ring structure and could have  preventive activities.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21158711>Cyclooxygenase as a target for colorectal  chemoprevention.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is one of the most common neoplasia in Western countries and the second leading cause of -related death. The vast majority of cases belong to sporadic forms, whereas a small but relevant proportion of them corresponds to inherited disorders, i.e. familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome. These individuals with germline mutations in -promoting genes, along with those who had already developed a colorectal neoplasm, either adenoma or carcinoma, stand to benefit from chemopreventive interventions. A large body of evidence indicates that the use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can reduce the risk of CRC. Experimental studies have demonstrated that these drugs decrease the incidence of carcinogen-induced  tumors in rodents, and several epidemiological investigations and therapeutic trials have also shown a 40-50% reduction in the risk of colorectal adenoma and  in individuals taking NSAIDs. Moreover, patients with familial adenomatous polyposis taking sulindac or celecoxib experience a reduction in adenoma size and number. The chemopreventive effects of NSAID are largely related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of  to prostaglandins. COX-2 overexpression is a frequent, but not universal event in colorectal . Indeed, approximately 50% of adenomas and 80% of CRC express high levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein in neoplastic tissue. In this article, we will review the role of cyclooxygenase as a target for CRC chemoprevention, with special attention to the use of selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors in both individuals genetically predisposed and those who have already developed a colorectal neoplasm.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17190766>Effect of azoxymethane and curcumin on transcriptional levels of cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 during initiation of  carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Curcumin is well documented as an effective  chemopreventive agent in preclinical studies. Inhibition of  metabolism has been considered one of anticarcinogenic mechanisms of curcumin. We recently reported resistance of middle-aged F344 male rats to inhibition of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced  aberrant crypt foci (ACF) by curcumin (Nutr , 48, 37-43). It was important to confirm this finding and to find potential mechanisms responsible, as loss of preventive activity of curcumin due to aging was a novel finding, with important implications for human intervention trials.To confirm our previous findings, and investigate  metabolism as a potential mechanism of age-related differences in response to curcumin, middle-aged F344 male rats were given AOM injections after being fed their experimental diets, 0.6% curcumin or control diet.  ACF were evaluated and  levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and 2 mRNA and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured. Next, we investigated the short-term effect of AOM and curcumin on  metabolism in young rats. Six week-old rats were given injections of either AOM or untreated following their experimental diets.  COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA as well as PGE2 levels were measured shortly after AOM treatment. Lastly, three different ages of F344 rats were treated with either AOM or saline, and  COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA levels were measured shortly after the injections to find if aging alters the effect of AOM on COX mRNA expression.In middle-aged rats, dietary curcumin did not reduce the number of ACF and surprisingly increased  levels of COX-2 mRNA.  COX-2 and PGE2 levels were also significantly increased in young rats fed curcumin after AOM injections. Interestingly, AOM did not affect COX-2 but decreased COX-1 expression in all ages.Our study suggests that during initiation, AOM inhibits  COX-1 expression without affecting COX-2 and dietary curcumin may increase COX-2 expression to compensate AOM-induced reduction of COX-1 expression.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23404351>Genetic variation in the lipoxygenase pathway and risk of colorectal neoplasia.</a></h2><p>Arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX) enzymes metabolize  to generate potent inflammatory mediators and play an important role in inflammation-associated diseases.

We genotyped fifty tagSNPs, one candidate SNP, and two functional promoter variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms in three US population-based case-control studies of  (1,424 cases/1,780 controls), rectal  (583 cases/775 controls), and colorectal adenomas (485 cases/578 controls). Individuals with variant genotypes of the ALOX5 VNTR had a decreased risk of rectal , with the strongest association seen for individuals with one or more alleles of >5 repeats (wild type = 5, OR>5/≥5 = 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.92; P = 0.01).

Colorectal neoplasia risk appeared to be modified by NSAID use in individuals with variant alleles in FLAP and ALOX15. One noteworthy interaction (25% FDR) was observed for rectal . Genetic variability in ALOXs may affect risk of colorectal neoplasia, particularly for rectal .

In this study, we determined how CLA could modulate 5-lipoxygenase activity. The t10, c12-CLA isomer reduced production of 5-HETE but not 12- and 15-HETE in MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells.

Interestingly, t10, c12-CLA reduced the expression of five-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) but not the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. Over-expression of FLAP abrogated t10, c12-CLA-reduced viability of MDA-MB-231 cells.

We examined whether this shift occurs in vitro in the human  cell line Caco-2 in association with the loss of terminal differentiation and apoptosis, or in vivo during the formation of colorectal adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Restoring terminal differentiation and apoptosis of Caco-2 cells increased the mRNA levels of 5-LOX, 15-LOX-2, and 15-LOX-1, but the only significant increases in protein expression and enzymatic activity were of 15-LOX-1. In FAP patients, 15-LOX-1 expression and activity were significantly down-regulated in adenomas (compared with paired nonneoplastic epithelial mucosa), whereas 5-LOX and 15-LOX-2 protein expressions and enzymatic activities were not. We conducted a validation study with immunohistochemical testing in a second group of FAP patients; 15-LOX-1 expression was down-regulated in colorectal adenomas (compared with nonneoplastic epithelial mucosa) in 87% (13 of 15) of this group. We confirmed the mechanistic relevance of these findings by demonstrating that ectopically restoring 15-LOX-1 expression reestablished apoptosis in Caco-2 cells. Therefore, 15-LOX-1 down-regulation rather than a shift in the balance of LOXs is likely the dominant alteration in LOX metabolism which contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis by repressing apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19347299>Inflammatory bowel disease: a model of chronic inflammation-induced .</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is a well-recognized risk factor for the development of human .

Since histone deacetylase inhibitors have been well-known to suppress  cell migration and invasion, we thus tested whether knockdown of delta-5-desaturase and DGLA treatment could also be used to inhibit  migration and invasion of  and pancreatic  cells. Wound healing assay, transwell assay and western blot were used to assess cell migration and invasion as well as the associated molecular mechanisms. Formation of threshold level of 8-hydroxyoctanoic  was quantified from COX-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation in the  cells that overexpress COX-2 and their delta-5-desaturases were knocked down by shRNA transfection. Our results showed that knockdown of delta-5-desaturase along with DGLA supplement not only significantly inhibited cell migration, but also improved the efficacies of 5-flurouracil and gemcitabine, two frontline chemotherapy drugs currently used in the treatment of  and pancreatic , respectively. The molecular mechanism behind these observations is that 8-hydroxyoctanoic  inhibits histone deacetylase, resulting in downregulation of  metastasis promotors, e.g., MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as upregulation of  metastasis suppressor, e.g. E-cadherin. For the first time, we demonstrated that we could take the advantage of the common phenomenon of COX-2 overexpression in cancers to inhibit  cell migration and invasion.

Several cytokines can depress immune cell subpopulations. Increased cytokine response after surgery is assumed to arise mainly from lipooxygenase pathway acting on membrane . Therefore; investigators focused their efforts to alter the membrane fatty  profile by changing the nutritional regimen with epsilon-3 fatty  supplementation and encouraging results were obtained after surgery. Despite the theoretical and clinical advantage of enteral nutrition many surgeons remain committed to parenteral nutrition for feeding of patients due to maintain bowel rest and fear of anastomosis leakage at the postoperative period. Several studies investigating role of the postoperative immunonutrition reported that beneficial immunological changes were associated with reduction of infectious complications. Interestingly; these findings were observed at least five days after the surgery in which the highest incidence of complications was seen. In this prospective study including 42 patients eligible for curative gastric or  surgery; we investigated the beneficial effect of enteral immunonutrition (EEN) compared to total parenteral hyperalimentation (TPN) beginning from the preoperative period. Cortisol and CRP levels as stress parameters significantly increased one day after surgery in both groups but they rapidly returned to (on POD1) preoperative baseline level in EEN group whereas these values remained high in the TPN group. Additionally a significant decrease in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ levels were observed in both groups. However they recovered on POD3 in EEN group and on POD6 in TPN group. CD4+ subset remained almost same as preoperative value in the TPN group whereas it increased from (%) 40.14 to 46.40, 51.29 and 54.7 on PO 6th hr, POD3 and POD6 in the EEN group. Our findings suggest that preoperative nutrition via the enteral route provided better regulation of postoperative immune system restoration than parenteral nutrition.

The PPAR subfamily consists of three members: PPAR-alpha, PPAR-sigma (NUC-1 or beta) and PPAR-gamma. PPARs regulate gene expression by binding, as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR), to specific response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. The prostaglandin 12 especially, all  metabolites and polyunsaturated fatty acids are naturally occuring PPAR ligands. Synthetic PPAR ligands are thiazolidinediones (TZDs--rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, troglitazone). Activation of nuclear hormone receptors has been identified as an approach to induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of  lines. The anti-proliferative, pro-differentiation effects of PPAR activators (TZDs) suggest that these compounds might be useful in slowing the proliferation of un-differentiated tumour cells. TZDs inhibit proliferation of human breast, prostate and  cancers, both in vitro and in tumours derived from these cells implanted into rodents. Furthermore, recent studies show that PPAR-gamma ligands are potent inhibitors of angiogenesis, a process essential for solid-tumour growth and metastasis. In conclusion, the evidence to date suggests that activation of PPAR should suppress tumour growth and development. This represents an exciting novel therapeutic application of TZDs.

Using Nox1 siRNA, we show that Nox1-dependent superoxide production affects the migration of HT29-D4  adenocarcinoma cells on collagen-I. Nox1 inhibition or down-regulation led to a decrease of superoxide production and alpha 2 beta 1 integrin membrane availability. An addition of  stimulated Nox1-dependent superoxide production and HT29-D4 cell migration. Pharmacological evidences using phospholipase A2, lipoxygenases and protein kinase C inhibitors show that upstream regulation of Nox1 relies on  metabolism. Inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase decreased basal and  induced Nox1-dependent superoxide production and cell migration. Migration and ROS production inhibited by a 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor were restored by the addition of 12(S)-HETE, a downstream product of 12-lipoxygenase. Protein kinase C delta inhibition by rottlerin (and also GO6983) prevented Nox1-dependent superoxide production and inhibited cell migration, while other protein kinase C inhibitors were ineffective.

Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that acetylsalicylic  (ASA) helps prevent colorectal  (CRC), possibly through cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated suppression of eicosanoid, particularly PGE, formation. Recent studies suggest that statins prevent CRC and improve survival after diagnosis. We identified patients on ASA and/or statin treatment undergoing routine colonoscopy and measured eicosanoid levels in  mucosa with targeted metabolomics technology (LC-MS/MS). ASA-treated individuals (n = 27) had significantly lower tissue eicosanoid levels of most COX-derived metabolites than untreated individuals (n = 31). In contrast, COX-derived lipid metabolites tended to be higher in patients with statin treatment (n = 7) as compared with those not receiving statins (n = 24). This effect was not discernible in subjects treated with ASA and statins (n = 11): Individuals treated with both drugs showed a pronounced suppression of COX-derived eicosanoids in  tissue, even compared with subjects treated with ASA alone. Our data from a routine clinical setting support the hypothesis that ASA and statins could inhibit CRC development via lipid mediator modification.

An emerging concept suggests that microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may help explain the relationship between walnut consumption and decreased colorectal neoplasia risk.

Thirty samples of tumor and of omental adipose were analyzed to determine changes in lipid composition in each dietary group. In the tumors of the walnut-containing diet, we found significant increases in α-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic and total omega-3 acids, and a decrease in , as compared to the control diet. Final tumor size measured at sacrifice was negatively associated with percentage of total omega-3 fatty  composition (r=-0.641, P=.001).

However, the downstream mechanism(s) that link AA levels to  cell proliferation remain to be elucidated. Initial experiments in the current study showed that exogenous AA and inhibitors of AA metabolism that lead to the accumulation of unesterified AA are cytotoxic to the  cell line, HCT-116. Additionally, exogenous AA and triacsin C, an inhibitor of AA acylation, induced apoptosis and related caspase-3 activity in a transcriptionally dependent manner. Gene array analysis revealed that both exogenous AA and triacsin C alter the expression of similar genes in HCT-116 cells. For example, both downregulate several genes with well-documented roles in cell survival and apoptotic resistance. Conversely, both upregulate genes encoding activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors, which have known roles in inducing apoptosis, and genes that counteract ras (Erk/MAPK) growth signaling pathways.

In vitro analyses indicated that mast cells in particular utilized 5LO to limit proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and to mobilize myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Mice lacking hemapoietic expression of 5LO exhibited reduced recruitment of MDSCs to the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and primary tumor site. 5LO deficiency also reduced the activity in MDSCs of arginase-1, which is thought to be critical for MDSC function.

Inhibition of COX-1/-2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with a decreased risk for these malignancies, whereas high serum gastrin levels elevate this risk. As gastrin exhibits trophical effects on  epithelium we sought to explore whether it is capable to induce COX-2 expression in a human  cell line. The aim of this study is the description of the gastrin evoked effects on the transcriptional activity of the COX-2 gene in colorectal  cells and the identification of regulatory promoter elements. Reporter gene assays were performed with the gastrin-stimulated human colorectal  cell-line Colo-320, which was stable transfected with the human cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor cDNA and COX-2-promoter-luciferase constructs containing different segments of the 5'-region of the COX-2 gene or with mutated promoter constructs. Transcription factors were characterized with electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Gastrin-dependent induction of COX-2 mRNA was shown using "real-time" PCR. Resulting elevated Prostaglandin E2-levels were measured using ELISA. Gastrin stimulated the PGE2-generation and COX-2-mRNA expression in human Colo-320-B cells potently, obviously by transactivating the COX-2-promoter using a region between - 68 bp and + 70 bp. Further examinations identified a CRE-E-box element between - 56 bp and - 48 bp mediating the gastrin-effects on the COX-2 gene. Transcription factors binding to this promoter element were USF-1 und -2.

Of particular interest is the study of omega-3 and omega-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), notably EPA (eicosapentaenoic , 20:5n-3), DHA (docosahexaenoic , 22:6n-3), and ARA (, 20:4n-6), and their transformation into bioactive lipid mediators. In this sense, new families of PUFA-derived lipid mediators, including resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protectins and maresins derived from DHA, are being increasingly investigated because of their active role in the "return to homeostasis" process and resolution of inflammation. Recent findings reviewed in the present study highlight that the omega-6 fatty  ARA appears increased, and omega-3 EPA and DHA decreased in most  tissues compared to normal ones, and that increments in omega-3 LC-PUFAs consumption and an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 2-4:1, are associated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate,  and renal cancers. Along with their lipid-lowering properties, omega-3 LC-PUFAs also exert cardioprotective functions, such as reducing platelet aggregation and inflammation, and controlling the presence of DHA in our body, especially in our liver and brain, which is crucial for optimal brain functionality. Considering that DHA is the principal omega-3 FA in cortical gray matter, the importance of DHA intake and its derived lipid mediators have been recently reported in patients with major depressive and bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study reviews the relationships between major diseases occurring today in the Western world and LC-PUFAs. More specifically this review focuses on the dietary omega-3 LC-PUFAs and the omega-6/omega-3 balance, in a wide range of inflammation disorders, including autoimmune diseases. This review suggests that the current recommendations of consumption and/or supplementation of omega-3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still need more fine tuning for overall human health and well being.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231138>Replacement of an Indole Scaffold Targeting Human 15-Lipoxygenase-1 Using Combinatorial Chemistry.</a></h2><p>Human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) belongs to the class of lipoxygenases, which catalyze oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as  and linoleic .

Here, we report, for the first time, that the dual COX/5-LOX inhibitor licofelone triggers apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in HCA-7  cells. Induction of apoptosis was related to the recruitment of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as shown by loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and 3 activation and poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 cleavage. Moreover, licofelone induced the cleavage of the full-length p21(Bax) into p18(Bax), a more potent inducer of the apoptotic process than the uncleaved form. Pre-treatment of HCA-7 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk significantly blocked licofelone-induced apoptosis, confirming that this process occurred primarily in a caspase-dependent pathway. We also present evidences that licofelone was able to affect the  (AA) cascade, as it blocked the activity of 5-LOX and COX enzymes, and it induced, through the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), the release of unesterified AA from HCA-7 membrane phospholipids. However, apoptosis induction was not related to the ability of licofelone to affect the AA cascade, since neither exogenous prostaglandin E(2) and leukotriene B(4) addition, nor pharmacological inhibition of cPLA(2), was able to rescue HCA-7 cells from apoptosis.

We also observed a decreased ability for vitamin E to upregulate detoxifying enzymes against free-radical peroxidation, with the exception of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in undifferentiated cells. However, there was an increased ability in undifferentiated, rather than in differentiated,  cells to detect DNA damage, initiate cytostasis, and then effect subsequent DNA repair and apoptosis, in the presence of vitamin E. The expression profile implies less genotoxic stress is experienced in vitamin E-supplemented colonocytes, particularly undifferentiated cells, and points to a mechanism by which dietary supplementation may prevent genotoxic damage and subsequent carcinogenic events in the , by both antioxidant and non-antioxidant-related mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206907>A novel bioactive derivative of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) suppresses intestinal tumor development in ApcΔ14/+ mice.</a></h2><p>Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hundreds of polyps throughout the . Without prophylactic colectomy, most individuals with FAP develop colorectal  at an early age. Treatment with EPA in the free fatty  form (EPA-FFA) has been shown to reduce polyp burden in FAP patients. Since high-purity EPA-FFA is subject to rapid oxidation, a stable form of EPA compound has been developed in the form of magnesium l-lysinate bis-eicosapentaenoate (TP-252). We assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of TP-252 on intestinal tumor formation using ApcΔ14/+ mice and compared it with EPA-FFA. TP-252 was supplemented in a modified AIN-93G diet at 1, 2 or 4% and EPA-FFA at 2.5% by weight and administered to mice for 11 weeks. We found that administration of TP-252 significantly reduced tumor number and size in the small intestine and  in a dose-related manner and as effectively as EPA-FFA. To gain further insight into the  protection afforded to the , we performed a comprehensive lipidomic analysis of total fatty  composition and eicosanoid metabolites. Treatment with TP-252 significantly decreased the levels of  (AA) and increased EPA concentrations within the  mucosa. Furthermore, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis revealed that a subset of fatty acids, including EPA and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), and their downstream metabolites, including PGE3 and 14-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic  (HDoHE), were strongly associated with antineoplastic activity.

We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis to measure metabolite levels in pairs of colorectal  tissue samples and samples of the adjacent macroscopically normal mucosal tissue from 10  patients. Regarding nucleotide metabolomic intermediates, the colorectal  tissue contained lower levels of ribulose 5-phosphate and higher levels of xanthine, adenine, and hypoxanthine than the normal tissue. The levels of antioxidant metabolites, such as sulfur-containing amino acids, were also significantly higher in the colorectal  tissue. The level of tryptophan was decreased, and the levels of molecules downstream of the tryptophan pathway, such as kynurenine and quinolinic , which protect colorectal  against the host's immune system and function in de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis, were increased in the colorectal  tissue.

(AA) metabolism, the family of cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenase (LOX) play important roles in AA-related inflammatory cascades. In 94 colorectal  samples collected from the Han population, the immunohistochemical results indicated that 68% of the patients with colorectal  had a co-expression of both COX-2 and 5-LOX, while both displayed low expression in the matched normal tissues. In cell lines, three colorectal  cell lines exhibited high expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX. During stable silencing of the expression of COX-2 or 5-LOX in LoVo  cells, we found that downregulation of either COX-2 or 5-LOX significantly diminished the growth, migration and invasion of the  cells and specifically, downregulation of COX-2 could elicit upregulation of 5-LOX protein and vice versa. The above results suggested that the simultaneous blocking of COX-2 and 5-LOX activity may bring more potential benefits in managing the progression of . Therefore, we sought to explore the effectiveness of a dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitor darbufelone on the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of  cells, as well as the underlying mechanism of action. The results indicated that darbufelone significantly decreased the proliferative and invasive abilities of the  cells, in a dose-dependent manner. During the study of the related mechanisms, we found an upregulation of p27 and downregulation of cyclin D1 as well as CDK4 after darbufelone treatment, which indicated that darbufelone could arrest the cell cycle of LoVo cells at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, the activation of caspase-3 and -9, upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 demonstrated the occurrence of apoptosis by darbufelone. Finally, darbufelone also prevented the migration and invasion of LoVo cells, which may be ascribed to the upregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1.

The production of endogenous protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) varied substantially between the cell lines and was approximately 4-fold higher in WiDr as compared with SW480. Cell killing by 5-ALA-PDT also varied between the cell lines, but without clear correlation with PpIX levels. Treatment with DHA or AA (10 or 70 microM, 48 or 72 h) in combination with 5-ALA-PDT (1 or 2 mM) enhanced the cytotoxic effect in A-172 and A-427 cells, but not in SW480 and WiDr cells. While 5-ALA-PDT alone increased the lipid peroxidation in A-172 and WiDr cells only, 5-ALA-PDT plus PUFAs increased the lipid peroxidation substantially in all four cell lines. Interestingly, alpha-tocopherol (50 microM, 48 h) strongly reduced lipid peroxidation after all treatments in all cell lines, while cytotoxicity was only reduced substantially in A-427 cells. This demonstrates that induction of lipid peroxidation is not a general mechanism responsible for the cytotoxicity of 5-ALA-PDT, although it may be important in cell lines with an inherent sensitivity to lipid peroxidation products.

These findings elucidate a novel mechanism of the signaling by natural ligands of PPARs, which involves modulating the interaction between PPAR-b/d and PPAR-g.Oncogene (2006) 25, 1225-1241. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1209160; published online 14 November 2005.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17332478>Decreased MAPK- and PGE2-dependent IL-11 production in Gialpha2-/-  myofibroblasts.</a></h2><p>Mice deficient in the G-protein alpha subunit G(i)alpha(2) spontaneously develop colitis and . IL-11 is a pleiotropic cytokine known to protect the intestinal epithelium from injury in animal models of colitis and is produced by subepithelial myofibroblasts in response to inflammatory mediators including TGF-beta, IL-1beta, and PGE(2).  release and subsequent PGE(2) production is significantly decreased in the  mucosa of G(i)alpha(2)-/- mice, and we hypothesized that this would affect mucosal IL-11 production. Mucosal levels of IL-11 were found to be significantly decreased in G(i)alpha(2)-/- mice despite the presence of mild colitis. Primary cultures of G(i)alpha(2)-/- intestinal and  myofibroblasts (IMF and CMF, respectively) produced less basal and TGF-beta or IL-1beta-stimulated IL-11 mRNA and protein than wild-type cells. Inhibitors of ERK or p38 MAPK activation dose dependently inhibited IMF and CMF IL-11 production in response to TGF-beta stimulation, whereas 16,16 dimethyl-PGE(2) and prostanoid receptor subtype-selective agonists induced IL-11 production. Treatment of animals with the EP4-specific agonist ONO-AE1-329 resulted in enhanced mucosal levels of IL-11, and increased IL-11 production by ex vivo cultured CMF. Modulation of cAMP levels produced diverging results, with enhancement of TGF-beta-induced IL-11 release in IMF pretreated with 8-Br-cAMP and inhibition in cells treated either with pertussis toxin or the PKA inhibitor H-89. These data suggest a physiological role for prostaglandins, MAPK signaling, and cAMP signaling for the production of myofibroblast-derived IL-11 in the mouse intestinal mucosa.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760534>Pilot clinical study of the effects of ginger root extract on eicosanoids in  mucosa of subjects at increased risk for colorectal .</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) remains a significant cause of mortality. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX) and thus prostaglandin E2, are promising CRC preventives, but have significant toxicities. Ginger has been shown to inhibit COX, to decrease the incidence and multiplicity of adenomas, and decrease PGE2 concentrations in subjects at normal risk for CRC. This study was conducted to determine the effects of 2.0 g/d of ginger given orally on the levels of PGE2, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids, and 5-, 12-, & 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic , in the  mucosa of subjects at increased risk for CRC. We randomized 20 subjects to 2.0 g/d ginger or placebo for 28 d. At baseline and Day 28, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was used to obtain  biopsies. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was used to determine eicosanoid levels in the biopsies, and levels were expressed per amount of protein or free  (AA). There was a significant decrease in AA between baseline and Day 28 (P = 0.05) and significant increase in LTB4 (P = 0.04) when normalized to protein, in subjects treated with ginger versus placebo. No other changes in eicosanoids were observed. There was no difference between the groups in total adverse events (AE; P = 0.06). Ginger lacks the ability to decrease eicosanoid levels in people at increased risk for CRC. Ginger did appear to be both tolerable and safe; and could have chemopreventive effects through other mechanisms. Further investigation should focus on other markers of CRC risk in those at increased CRC risk.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233904>Polymorphic Variants of Cytochrome P450: Relevance to  and Other Diseases.</a></h2><p>Associations of cytochrome P450 (CYP) polymorphisms with risk of disease development have been reported widely. For lung , a large number of studies on CYP1A1, CYP2D6, and CYP2A6 polymorphisms have been performed. However, recent studies, including meta-analyses and genome-wide association studies, suggest that only the CYP2A6 association, where genotypes associated with low activity decrease susceptibility possibly due to slower nicotine metabolism, appears significant. Associations with lung  susceptibility have also been reported for CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and CYP2E1 polymorphisms but these, though biologically plausible, have not been well replicated. For cancers where exposure to xenobiotics other than tobacco smoke affects risk, CYP polymorphisms may also be relevant. Examples include CYP3A for hepatocellular carcinoma due to aflatoxin exposure, CYP1A2 for  associated with heterocyclic arylamine exposure and CYP2E1 for nitrosamine-related nasopharyngeal . For other diseases, a well-established example relates to CYP1B1 where homozygosity for rare mutations occurs in primary congenital glaucoma. Rare CYP1B1 mutations and possibly polymorphisms may also contribute to risk for more common forms of glaucoma. CYP2C isoforms and CYP2J2 contribute to extrahepatic metabolism of  to epoxyeicosanoic acids which have effects in the cardiovascular system. Genotype for these isoforms may be relevant to risk of cardiovascular disease but evidence is still lacking. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may be at increased risk of endometriosis, and CYP2E1 genotype may modulate risk of development of alcoholic liver disease. In conclusion, CYP polymorphisms are relevant to risk for some diseases but this may have been overstated in earlier studies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, sulindac sulfide was shown to possess anti-angiogenic activity. In the present work, the question of whether this activity reflects a specific interaction with angiogenesis or is secondary to the effect of sulindac sulfide on the survival of endothelial cells was addressed.Endothelial and normal mouse fibroblast cell lines were incubated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),  (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Cell viability (survival), PGE2 synthesis, cell cycle and apoptosis were measured. Western blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR multiplex methods verified the changes in the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins and their expressions, respectively.Sulindac sulfide and celecoxib inhibited the survival of endothelial cells, whereas other NSAIDs were ineffective. In contrast to celecoxib, sulindac sulfide did not affect the survival of normal fibroblast cells. Both agents inhibited the production of PGE2 from AA and arrested the cell cycle in the S-phase. Moreover, sulindac sulfide activated caspases 3 and 8, decreased the levels of Bax and Bid proteins, caused cleavage of PARP and increased the expressions of the bax and caspase 3 genes.The results suggest that the anti-angiogenic activity of sulindac sulfide is secondary to the inhibition of endothelial cell survival resulting from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993239>Regulation of NADPH oxidase NOX4 by delta iodolactone (IL-δ) in thyroid  cells.</a></h2><p>Iodine is not used only by the thyroid to synthesize thyroid hormones but also directly influences a number of thyroid parameters such as thyroid proliferation and function. Several iodinated lipids, biosynthesized by the thyroid, were postulated as intermediaries in the action of iodide. Among these, iodolactone (IL-δ) and 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) have shown to inhibit several thyroid parameters. The antiproliferative effect of IL-δ is not restricted to the thyroid gland. IL-δ exhibits anti-tumor properties in breast , neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, melanoma and lung carcinoma cells suggesting that IL-δ could be used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Moreover in a  cell line (HT-29), IL-δ induced cell death, and this effect was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sources of reactive oxygen species induced by IL-δ and to explore the contribution of ROS induced by IL-δ on cell proliferation and apoptosis. thyroid follicular (WRO) and papilar (TPC-1) cells lines were treated with IL-δ. Proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed. IL-δ caused a significant loss of cell viability on WRO and TPC-1 cells in a concentration dependent manner and induced apoptosis after 3 h of treatment. Furthermore, IL-δ (10 μM) increased ROS production (39% WRO and 20% TPC-1). The concomitant treatment of WRO and TPC-1 cells with Trolox or NAC plus IL-δ abrogated the augment of ROS induced by IL-δ exposure. Additionally Trolox and NAC reversed the effect of IL-δ on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Only in WRO cells IL-δ upregulates NADPH oxidase NOX4 expression, and siRNA targeted knock-down of NOX4 attenuates ROS production, apoptosis (p < 0.05) and the inhibitory effect of IL-δ on cell proliferation and PCNA expression (p < 0.05).The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of IL-δ is mediated by different mechanisms and pathway involving different sources of ROS generation depending on the cellular context.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Aim of this article is to describe the role and regulation of 15-LOX-1 in colorectal  and highlight its importance in  therapeutics.For our electronic literature research in PubMed and MEDLINE, key words related to 15-LOX-1 and colorectal  were used to find articles for this review.From the evidences, we believe that 15-LOX-1 has anti-carcinogenic effects in colorectal , dependent or independent of its metabolites, and is manifested through downstream pathways involving cGMP, PPAR, p53, p21 and NAG-1, increasing apoptosis and decreasing proliferation in  cells. Regulation of 15-LOX-1 expression is achieved at transcription level by global histone acetylation and may also be dependent on GATA-6, IL-4 and IL-13. Positive relationship exists between 15-LOX-1 and survival in colorectal .Evidences strongly support that therapeutic modulation of 15-LOX-1 may be a key to the treatment of colorectal . However, it is still undecided whether the up-regulation of 15-LOX-1 alone can be sufficient to treat colorectal  and further studies are awaited.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20372792>Cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase pathways in diosgenin-induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116  cells.</a></h2><p>We studied the relationship between diosgenin-induced apoptosis and  metabolism in two  cell lines, the HT-29 and HCT-116. Diosgenin is a steroidal saponin known for its antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on  cells. We focused our attention on two enzymes intervening in two different pathways of  metabolism: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). HT-29 and HCT-116 cells express 5-LOX but only HT-29 cells express COX-2 since HCT-116 are deficient. After 40 microM diosgenin treatment, we observed apoptosis hallmarks in both cell lines but HT-29 cells were more resistant with delayed apoptosis. In these cells, COX-2 expression and activity were increased and for the first time we showed that diosgenin also increased 5-LOX expression and enhanced leukotriene B4 production. Inhibition of 5-LOX by AA-861 significantly reduced apoptosis in both cell lines but COX-2 inhibition by NS-398 strongly sensitized HT-29 cells to diosgenin-induced apoptosis compared to HCT-116 cells. In this study, we showed the implication of COX-2 and 5-LOX in diosgenin-induced apoptosis but these results demonstrate how difficult it is to assess the correlation between the apoptotic signalling pathway of diosgenin and  metabolism with certitude.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24336194>Differential effects of 2- and 3-series E-prostaglandins on in vitro expansion of Lgr5+  stem cells.</a></h2><p> (20:4(Δ5,8,11,14), AA)-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes  development. In contrast, chemoprotective n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplant AA, thereby decreasing PGE2 biosynthesis in colonocytes, with eicosapentaenoic  (20:5(Δ5,8,11,14,17), EPA) in particular being metabolized to a novel 3-series E-prostaglandin (PGE3), a putative anti-tumorigenic-cyclooxygenase metabolite. Because transformation of adult stem cells is an extremely important route toward initiating intestinal , we utilized the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-enhanced green fluorescent protein-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-creER(T2) knock-in mouse model to isolate and culture  organoids, in order to document ex vivo responses to exogenous PGE2 and PGE3.  crypts were isolated from transgenic mice and cultured in a Matrigel-based three-dimensional platform. Organoids were treated with exogenous PGE2, PGE3 or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle control) for 5 days and the number of viable organoids was recorded daily. Subsequently, samples were processed for immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and real-time PCR analyses. PGE2 promoted optimal organoid growth and induced significantly higher levels of cell proliferation (P < 0.05) compared with PGE3 and control. In contrast, the Lgr5-green fluorescent protein-positive stem cell number was uniquely elevated by >2-fold in PGE2-treated cultures compared with PGE3 and control. This coincided with the upregulation of stem-cell-related Sox9, Axin2 and Cd44 messenger RNAs. Our results demonstrate that relative to AA-derived PGE2, a known promoter of  tumorigenesis, EPA-derived PGE3 has diminished ability to support  stem cell expansion in mouse  organoids.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27663183>Lipid fingerprint image accurately conveys human  cell pathophysiologic state: A solid candidate as biomarker.</a></h2><p>Membrane lipids are gaining increasing attention in the clinical biomarker field, as they are associated with different pathologic processes such as  or neurodegenerative diseases. Analyzing human colonoscopic sections by matrix assisted laser/desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging techniques, we identified a defined number of lipid species changing concomitant to the colonocyte differentiation and according to a quite simple mathematical expression. These species felt into two lipid families tightly associated in signaling: phosphatidylinositols and -containing lipids. On the other hand, an opposed pattern was observed in lamina propria for AA-containing lipids, coinciding with the physiological distribution of the immunological response cells in this tissue. Importantly, the lipid gradient was accompanied by a gradient in expression of enzymes involved in lipid mobilization. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were lost in adenomatous polyps. The latter allowed us to assess how different a single lipid species is handled in a pathological context depending on the cell type. The strict patterns of distribution in lipid species and lipid enzymes described here unveil the existence of fine regulatory mechanisms orchestrating the lipidome according to the physiological state of the cell. In addition, these results provide solid evidence that the cell lipid fingerprint image can be used to predict precisely the physiological and pathological status of a cell, reinforcing its translational impact in clinical research.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
