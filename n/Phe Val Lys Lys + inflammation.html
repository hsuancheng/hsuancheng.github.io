In Lewis rats this epitope induces experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, and is a model of MS. Structure-activity studies have shown that (91) and Pro(96) residues are important for encephalitogenicity. Replacement of  and/or Pro residues with Arg and/or Ala, respectively, results in suppression of EAE. A potent linear altered peptide ligand of the immunodominant sequence MBP(83-99) has been selected for clinical trial (Nat. Med. 2000, 6, 1167, 1176). In the present report, two cyclic analogues, cyclo(91-99)[Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) and cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) were designed by NMR and molecular modeling data on human MBP(87-99) epitope ((87)-His----Asn-Ile--Thr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Pro(99)) and its linear antagonist peptide analogue [Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99). These analogues (altered peptide ligands) inhibited EAE in Lewis rats and decreased  in the spinal cord. In addition, the analogue cyclo(87-99)[Arg(91), Ala(96)]MBP(87-99) induced proliferation of human peripheral blood T-cells. These cyclic MBP(87-99) peptide analogues may lead to the design of potent antagonist mimetics for treating MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15147563>The mechanism for activation of the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase by the peptides formyl-Met-Leu- and Trp--Tyr-Met--Met differs from that for interleukin-8.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil chemotaxis has been shown to be regulated by two different signalling pathways that allow strong chemoattractants, such as bacterial-derived formylated peptides, to dominate over endogenous attractants, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). Here we show that triggering of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) with f-Met-Leu- (fMLF) substantially reduced the neutrophil superoxide production induced by activation of the CXC receptors with IL-8. When the order of agonists was reversed, the cells were primed in their response to fMLF, suggesting that the signalling hierarchy between strong, so-called end-type (i.e. fMLF) and weak or intermediate-type (i.e. IL-8) chemoattractants, is also operating during activation of the NADPH-oxidase. The same result was obtained when fMLF was replaced with the hexapeptide, WKYMVM, specific for the formyl peptide-like receptor 1 (FPRL1). There were additional differences between the agonist receptor pairs fMLF/FPR, WKYMVM/FPRL1 and IL-8/CXCR. In contrast to FPR and FPRL1, no reserve pool of CXCR was present in subcellular granules and it was impossible to prime the oxidative response transduced through CXCR by the addition of priming agents such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and platelet-activating factor. Moreover, the cytoskeleton-disrupting substance, cytochalasin B, had no effect either on IL-8-triggered oxidase activation or on CXCR reactivation. A pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein is involved in signalling mediated through both FPR and CXCR, and the signalling cascades include a transient intracellular calcium increase, as well as downstream p38 MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation. The data presented in this study provide support for two different signalling pathways to the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase, used by ligand binding to FPR/FPRL1 or CXCR, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12750433>Dissection of the anti-inflammatory effect of the core and C-terminal (KPV) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone peptides.</a></h2><p>In this study, we analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)11-13 (KPV) in comparison with other MSH peptides in a model of crystal-induced peritonitis. Systemic treatment of mice with KPV, alpha-MSH, the core melanocortin peptide His--Arg-Trp, and the melanocontin receptor 3/4 agonist Ac-Nle4-c[Asp5,d-Phe7,Lys10]NH2 ACTH4-10 (MTII) but not the selective MC1-R agonist H-Ser-Ser-Ile-Ile-Ser-His--Arg-Trp-Gly--Pro--NH2 (MS05) resulted in a significant reduction in accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte in the peritoneal cavity. The antimigratory effect of KPV was not blocked by the MC3/4-R antagonist Ac-Nle4-c[Asp5,d-2Nal7,Lys10]NH2 ACTH4-10 (SHU9119). In vitro, macrophage activation, determined as release of KC and interleukin (IL)-1beta was inhibited by alpha-MSH and MTII but not by KPV. Furthermore, macrophage activation by MTII led to an increase in cAMP accumulation, which was attenuated by SHU9119, whereas KPV failed to increase cAMP. The anti-inflammatory properties of KPV were also evident in IL-1beta-induced peritonitis  and in mice with a nonfunctional MC1-R (recessive yellow e/e mice). In conclusion, these data highlight that the C-terminal MSH peptide KPV exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect that is clearly different from that of the core MSH peptides. KPV is unlikely to mediate its effects through melanocortin receptors but is more likely to act through inhibition of IL-1beta functions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727380>Purification and partial characterization of canine S100A12.</a></h2><p>Canine S100A12 (cS100A12) is a calcium-binding protein of the S100 superfamily of EF-hand proteins, and its expression is restricted to neutrophils and monocytes. Interaction of S100A12 with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been suggested to play a central role in . Moreover, S100A12 has been shown to represent a sensitive and specific marker for gastrointestinal  in humans. Only human, porcine, bovine, and rabbit S100A12 have been purified to date, and an immunoassay for the quantification of S100A12 is available only for humans. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the purification of S100A12 and to partially characterize this protein in the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) as a prelude to the development of an immunologic method for its detection and quantification in canine serum and fecal specimens. Leukocytes were isolated from canine whole blood by dextran sedimentation, and canine S100A12 was extracted from the cytosol fraction of these cells. Further purification of cS100A12 comprised of ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and strong cation- and anion-exchange column chromatography. Canine S100A12 was successfully purified from canine whole blood. The relative molecular mass of the protein was estimated at 10,379.5 and isoelectric focusing revealed an isoelectric point of 6.0. The approximate specific absorbance of cS100A12 at 280 nm was determined to be 1.78 for a 1 mg/ml solution. The N-terminal AA sequence of the first 15 residues of cS100A12 was Thr--Leu-Glu-Asp-His-X-Glu-Gly-Ile--Asp---His, and revealed 100% identity with the predicted protein sequence available through the canine genome project. Sequence homology for the 14 N-terminal residues identified for cS100A12 with those of feline, bovine, porcine, and human S100A12 was 78.6%. We conclude that canine S100A12 can be successfully purified from canine whole blood using the described methods.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This anti-inflammatory effect is thought to be mediated through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme important for prostaglandin synthesis. We have compared the effects of piroxicam on superoxide production mediated by two closely related G-protein coupled receptors expressed on neutrophils, the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and the formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1). Neutrophils were stimulated with agonists that bind specifically to FPR (the peptide ligand N-formyl-Met-Leu-, fMLF) or FPRL1 (the peptide ligand Trp--Tyr-Met--L-Met-NH(2), WKYMVM) or both of these receptors (the peptide ligand Trp--Tyr-Met--D-Met-NH(2), WKYMVm). Piroxicam reduced the neutrophil superoxide production induced by the FPR agonist but had no significant effect on the FPRL1 induced response. Neutrophil intracellular calcium changes induced by the agonist WKYMVm (that triggers both FPR and FPRL1) were only inhibited by piroxicam when the drug was combined with the FPRL1 specific antagonist, Trp-Arg-Trp-Trp-Trp-Trp (WRW(4)), and this was true also for the inhibition of superoxide anion release. Receptor-binding analysis showed that the fluorescently labelled FPR specific ligand N-formyl-Nle-Leu--Nle-Tyr- (fNLFNYK), was competed for in a dose-dependent manner, by the FPR ligand fMLF and as well as by piroxicam. We show that piroxicam inhibits the neutrophil responses triggered through FPR, but not through FPRL1 and this inhibition is due to a reduced binding of the activating ligand to its cell surface receptor.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589606>Oxygen radical production in leukocytes and disease severity in multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the relationship between the formation of NADPH oxidase-dependent oxygen radicals in peripheral blood leukocytes ('respiratory burst') and disease severity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Oxygen radical production was induced by formyl-Met-Leu- (fMLF), Trp--Tyr-Met--Met-NH2 (WKYMVM) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and was assessed by quantifying superoxide anion, i.e. the initial radical formed by the NADPH oxidase. Disease severity was evaluated using the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS). In patients with severe disease, the production of superoxide anion was significantly lower for all three inducers of radical formation (p=0.04-0.004). Our findings are supportive of a protective role of oxygen radicals in autoimmunity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10969869>Potent cyclic peptide inhibitors of VLA-4 (alpha4beta1 integrin)-mediated cell adhesion. Discovery of compounds like cyclo(MePhe-Leu-Asp--D-Arg-D-Arg) (ZD7349) compatible with depot formulation.</a></h2><p>Additional structure-activity relationship studies on potent cyclic peptide inhibitors of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) are reported. The new N- to C-terminal cyclic hexa-, hepta- and octapeptide inhibitors like cyclo(MeIle/MePhe-Leu-Asp--X) (X = 2-4 amino acids containing hydrophobic and/or basic side chains) were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis methods. The peptides were evaluated in in vitro cell adhesion assays and in in vivo  models. Many of the peptides like cyclo(MePhe-Leu-Asp--D-Arg-D-Arg) (ZD7349) (17), cyclo(MeIle-Leu-Asp--D-Arg-D-Arg-D-) (20), cyclo(MeIle-Leu-Asp--D-Arg-D-Arg-MePhe) (21) and cyclo(MePhe-Leu-Asp--D-Arg-D-Arg-D-Ala-D-Ala) (23) were potent inhibitors of VLA-4-mediated cell adhesion and inhibited ovalbumin-induced delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mice. The more potent compounds were highly selective and did not affect U937 cell adhesion to fibronectin (VLA-5), phorbolmyristate acetate or PMA-differentiated U937 cell adhesion to intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (LFA-1) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (GPIIb/IIIa). In contrast to the inhibitors like Ac-cyclo(D--D-Ile-Leu-Asp-) and cyclo(CH2CO-Ile-Leu-Asp--Pip-CH2CO-Ile-Leu-Asp--Pip) described earlier, the new compounds were much more compatible with the depot formulations based on poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) polymers. The hexapeptide cyclo(MePhe-Leu-Asp--D-Arg-D-Arg) (ZD7349) (17) inhibited MOLT-4 cell adhesion to fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) with IC50 values of 260 and 330 nM, respectively, and did not show any significant effect against other integrins (IC50 > 300 microM). ZD7349 inhibited ovalbumin-induced DTH response in mice when administered continuously using a mini-pump (ED50 0.01 mg/kg/day) or when given as an s.c. or i.v. bolus injection at a dose of 1-10 mg/kg. ZD7349 was also active in type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) tests at a dose of 3-10 mg/kg. The peptide was released from some formulations over a period of 10-20 days. ZD7349 is currently undergoing pre-clinical investigation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23547469>[Peptide fragments of chemokine domain of fractalkine: effect on human monocyte migration].</a></h2><p>Leukocyte chemotaxis to the area of tissue damage is mediated by chemokines. According to the primary structure, chemokines are divided into four families, fractalkine (CX3CL1) is the only one member of CX3C family and the only membrane-bound chemokine. Fractalkine molecule includes the extracellular N-terminal chemokine domain, mucin-like rod, the transmembrane and the intracellular domains. In membrane-bound state fractalkine has the properties of an adhesion molecule. Chemokine domain of fractalkine (CDF) is released from cell membrane by proteolysis, and this soluble form acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes expressing fractalkine receptor CX3CR1. Fractalkine is involved in development of a number of pathological processes caused by , and therefore a search for fractalkine inhibitors is very important. For this purpose we identified several antigenic determinants--the fragments of CDF, and the following peptides were synthesized--P41-52 H-Leu-Glu-Thr-Arg-Gln-His-Arg-Leu--Cys-Ala-Asp-NH2, P53-60 H-Pro--Glu-Gln-Trp---Asp-NH2 and P60-71 H-Asp-Ala-Met-Gln-His-Leu-Asp-Arg-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-NH2. The peptide effects on adhesion and migration of human peripheral blood monocytes expressing fractalkine receptors were investigated. In the presence of CDF and P41-52 we observed the increased adhesion and migration of monocytes compared with spontaneous values. Peptides P53-60 and P60-71 significantly inhibited monocyte adhesion and migration stimulated by CDF. Since the chemotactic activity of chemokines was shown to be dependent on their binding to glycosaminoglycans of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, the effect ofpeptides on the interaction of CDF with heparin was analyzed by ELISA. Peptide P41-52 competed with CDF for heparin binding, while peptides P53-60 and P60-71 had no significant activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985958>Leukocyte chemoattractant peptides from the serpin heparin cofactor II.</a></h2><p>Heparin cofactor II (HC) is a plasma serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that inhibits the coagulant proteinase alpha-thrombin. We have recently demonstrated that proteolysis of HC by catalytic amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocyte proteinases (elastase or cathepsin G) generates leukocyte chemotaxins (Hoffman, M., Pratt, C. W., Brown, R. L., and Church, F. C. (1989) Blood 73, 1682-1685). One of four peptides produced when HC is degraded by neutrophil elastase has chemotactic activity for both monocytes and neutrophils with maximal migration comparable to formyl-Met-Leu-, the "gold standard" bacterially derived chemotaxin. The amino-terminal sequence of this HC peptide is Asp--His--Glu-Asn-Thr--... and the peptide corresponds to Asp-39 to Ile-66 of HC. A variety of synthetic peptides derived from this sequence were evaluated for leukocyte migration activity, and a dodecapeptide from Asp-49 to Tyr-60 (Asp-Trp-Ile-Pro-Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr) was identified as the active site for leukocyte chemotactic action. The 12-mer synthetic peptide possesses significant neutrophil chemotactic action at 1 nM (60% of the maximal activity of formyl-Met-Leu-), while a peptide with the reverse sequence has essentially no chemotactic activity. Cross-desensitization experiments also show that pretreatment of neutrophils with a 19-mer peptide (Asn-48 to Ile-66) greatly reduces subsequent chemotaxis to HC-neutrophil elastase proteolysis reaction products. When injected intraperitoneally in mice, the HC-neutrophil elastase digest elicits neutrophil migration. Our results demonstrate that not only does HC function as a thrombin inhibitor, but that limited proteolysis of HC near the amino terminus yields biologically active peptide(s) which might participate in  and in wound healing and tissue repair processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11359654>Interleukin-6 production by endothelial cells via stimulation of protease-activated receptors is amplified by endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.</a></h2><p>Human endothelial cells respond to extracellular proteases, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), and inflammatory cytokines. Endothelial cells express several protease-activated receptors (PAR), including the thrombin-activated receptors PAR-1 and PAR-3 and a thrombin-independent, protease-activated receptor, PAR-2. To examine the potential cooperation between PAR and inflammatory stimuli, we investigated the effects of the PAR-1 agonist peptide Ser--Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn (SFLLRN) and PAR-2 agonist peptide Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly-- (SLIGKV) on endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in vitro with SFLLRN or SLIGKV in the presence and absence of LPS or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the culture supernatants were assayed. Both SFLLRN and SLIGKV induced detectable levels of IL-6 production in a dose-dependent fashion, with the PAR-1 receptor agonist being more potent. In the presence of all stimulatory concentrations of LPS or TNF-alpha tested, both peptides were found to further enhance IL-6 production. The effects of SFLLRN and SLIGKV were specific, as related peptides with identical amino acid compositions, but lacking in consensus sequences, were biologically inactive either alone or in the presence of LPS. Both the direct and the amplifying effects of PAR agonist peptides on IL-6 production were pertussis toxin sensitive and caused an increase in the intracellular levels of calcium, implicating G-proteins and calcium mobilization in these pathways. Furthermore, the amplifying effect of LPS or TNF-alpha on PAR-mediated cytokine production was associated with corresponding increases in nuclear NF-kappaB proteins. The results demonstrate significant potentiation of PAR-induced signaling by LPS and TNF-alpha and indicate the potential cooperation of proteases and inflammatory stimuli in amplifying vascular .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2745979>Human eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor. Purification, physical characteristics, and partial amino acid sequence of an active polypeptide.</a></h2><p>Medium conditioned by PMA/LPS-stimulated U937 cells was processed for the purification of an eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor (ECEF) by the following sequence: 1) phenyl-Sepharose chromatography; 2) DEAE-cartridge chromatography; 3) preparative SDS-gel electrophoresis; and 4) reversed-phase HPLC. This resulted in the isolation of a 10 kDa polypeptide with ECEF activity. Purified material from 21 different preparations enhanced eosinophil killing of antibody-coated Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula by a mean of 206% (increase from 13.2 +/- 7.9% to 40.4 +/- 20.2% of targets killed, p less than 0.0001). Activity was maximal at a concentration of 20 ng ECEF polypeptide/ml and half-maximal between 0.8 and 4 ng/ml. Antibody specific for the 10 kDa polypeptide precipitated ECEF activity from a crude preparation and, by Western blot analysis, reacted only with a 10 kDa species in that preparation. The following N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined for the purified polypeptide: --Gln-Ile-Glu-Ser--Thr-Ala--Gln--Ala-Leu- -Ala- Gly- --Leu.... Computer search showed that this sequence is unrelated to other known protein sequences. Thus, the ECEF polypeptide is a newly defined monokine, with the ability to enhance eosinophil cytotoxic function in vitro. This monokine may be an important regulator of eosinophil function in  in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7489322>Binding of anti-inflammatory alpha-melanocyte-stimulating-hormone peptides and proinflammatory cytokines to receptors on melanoma cells.</a></h2><p>alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH1-13), a peptide derived from proopiomelanocortin, has remarkable anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activities. This peptide and a tripeptide that forms the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule (alpha-MSH11-13;  Pro ) inhibit  when given centrally or peripherally. Because of the similarity in their actions, the tripeptide has been presumed to be the amino acid message sequence underlying the effects of alpha-MSH1-13. To test the possibility that the two peptides occupy the same receptors, competitive binding experiments were performed with B16 mouse melanoma cells that are known to have alpha-MSH1-13 receptors. In these experiments, alpha-MSH11-13 did not inhibit binding of a radiolabelled alpha-MSH1-13 analog. This finding suggests that alpha-MSH1-13 and alpha-MSH11-13 exert their anti-inflammatory/antipyretic/anticytokine effects via stimulation of separate receptors. Because alpha-MSH inhibits the effects of several cytokines including  caused by interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, the capacity of these cytokines to compete for alpha-MSH binding sites was tested. There was no evidence that these proinflammatory cytokines bind to alpha-MSH receptors on murine melanoma cells. Although further tests with host cells involved in  are required, the latter result is the first evidence that the mechanism of anticytokine action of alpha-MSH does not depend upon peptide/cytokine competition for binding sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18047634>Induction of inflammatory cytokine release from human umbilical vein endothelial cells by agonists of proteinase-activated receptor-2.</a></h2><p>1. Human endothelial cells express proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), inflammatory cytokines and trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4). However, little is known about the mechanism through which trypsin induces cytokine release from endothelial cells. 2. In the present study, we investigated the effect of trypsin on cytokine release from primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using an antibody based protein microarray and ELISA. 3. The results showed that 1 microg/mL trypsin induced release of 32 different inflammatory factors, whereas 100 micromol/L Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly---NH2 (SLIGKV-NH2) only stimulated secretion of 16 inflammatory factors from HUVEC, as assessed by an antibody based protein microarray. Because the release of interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 was markedly increased following PAR-2 activation, their release was investigated further using ELISA. Increases in release of up to approximately 4.8-, 4.3-, 4.1- and 1.8-fold were observed for IL-1a, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-8, respectively, when HUVEC were challenged with trypsin for 16 h. Agonist peptides of PAR-2, namely SLIGKV-NH2 and trans-cinnamoyl-Leu-Ile-Gly-Arg-Leu-Orn-NH2 (tc-LIGRLO-NH2), also provoked significant release of IL-8. Trypsin-induced cytokine release was inhibited by its inhibitors soybean trypsin inhibitor, alpha1-antitrypsin and the inhibitor peptide of PAR-2 -Ser-Leu-Leu-Arg-Tyr-NH2 (FSLLRY-NH2). 4. These data indicate the action of trypsin on HUVEC is most likely through activation of PAR-2, suggesting that PAR-2-related mechanisms are involved in the inflammatory process in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531693>NADPH-oxidase activation in murine neutrophils via formyl peptide receptors.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils play a key role at inflammatory sites where, in addition to destroying infecting microorganisms, they may also have deleterious effects on host tissues. Both activities involve activation of the NADPH-oxidase that produces bactericidal and tissue-destructive reactive oxygen species (ROS). We activated the murine NADPH-oxidase using different types of neutrophil activators and characterized the oxidative responses with respect to magnitude, localization, and kinetics. We show that agonist-induced activation of murine neutrophils results exclusively in extracellular release of ROS and no intracellular production could be detected. We also show that the formylated peptide, formyl-Met-Leu- (fMLF), is a much less potent activator of the murine NADPH-oxidase than of the human analogue. Nevertheless, fMLF responses can be primed by pretreating the murine neutrophils with either cytochalasin B or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Finally, we show that a synthetic hexapeptide, WKYMVM, is a more potent stimulus than fMLF for murine neutrophils and that these two agonists probably act via nonidentical high-affinity receptors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849491>Synthesis of N-Chloroamino Acids and Their Biological Activities in LPS Stimulated RAW 264.7 Cells.</a></h2><p>Amino acids (AAs) are essential for protein synthesis, neurotransmission and macro molecule biosynthesis. Ala, Gln, Gly, ,  and taurine (Tau) are the most abundant free AAs in mammals, and some of these react with hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl) produced by myeloperoxidase in activated phagocytes to form N-chloroamino acids (NCAA). In this study, we reacted 20 AAs and Tau with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then classified the products into five types (I-V) based on the change in their absorbance. Type I AAs (Ala, Arg, Gln, Gly, Ile, , , Ser, Tau, Thr and ) generated a typical monochloramine peak at 252 nm, while Type II AAs (Asn and Tyr) and Type III AAs (Glu and Leu) produced peaks at 275 nm and 225 nm, respectively. The Type IV AAs (His, Met and Trp) did not show any distinct absorption peak, and Type V AAs (Asp, Cys and Pro) did not appear to react with NaOCl. The ArgCl and TauCl were stable, while GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, PheCl and ValCl were less stable and AlaCl, SerCl and ThrCl were the least stable. Tau is the most abundant non-proteinogenic free AA in cellular fluid and has many physiological functions in the nervous, cardiovascular, renal and immune systems. Tau reacts with HOCl to form TauCl, which inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators such as superoxide, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukins, while increasing the antioxidant proteins in macrophages. We determined the effects of Type I NCAA on cell viability, NO and TNF-α production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. All Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited LPS-induced NO production. However, only GlnCl, GlyCl, IleCl, LysCl, SerCl and TauCl inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production. In summary, Type I NCAA showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited NO production, while their effects on TNF-α varied. Our results suggest that Type I NCAA may serve as biological regulators similar to TauCl during .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18768476>Discovery of mitocryptide-1, a neutrophil-activating cryptide from healthy porcine heart.</a></h2><p>Although neutrophils are known to migrate in response to various chemokines and complement factors, the substances involved in the early stages of their transmigration and activation have been poorly characterized to date. Here we report the discovery of a peptide isolated from healthy porcine hearts that activated neutrophils. Its primary structure is H-Leu-Ser--Leu-Ile-Pro-Ala-Gly-Trp--Leu-Ser-His-Leu-Asp-His-Tyr--Arg-Ser-Ser-Ala-Ala-OH, and it was indicated to originate from mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII. This peptide caused chemotaxis at concentrations lower than that inducing beta-hexosaminidase release. Such responses were observed in neutrophilic/granulocytic differentiated HL-60 cells but not in undifferentiated cells, and G(i2)-type G proteins were suggested to be involved in the peptide signaling. Moreover the peptide activated human neutrophils to induce beta-hexosaminidase secretion. A number of other amphipathic neutrophil-activating peptides presumably originating from mitochondrial proteins were also found. The present results suggest that neutrophils monitor such amphipathic peptides including the identified peptide as an initiation signal for  at injury sites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27694331>A Role for Human N-alpha Acetyltransferase 30 (Naa30) in Maintaining Mitochondrial Integrity.</a></h2><p>N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) by N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes. The NatC complex represents one of three major NATs of which the substrate profile remains largely unexplored. Here, we defined the in vivo human NatC Nt-acetylome on a proteome-wide scale by combining knockdown of its catalytic subunit Naa30 with positional proteomics. We identified 46 human NatC substrates, expanding our current knowledge on the substrate repertoire of NatC which now includes proteins harboring Met-Leu, Met-Ile, Met-, Met-Trp, Met-, Met-Met, Met-His and Met- N termini. Upon Naa30 depletion the expression levels of several organellar proteins were found reduced, in particular mitochondrial proteins, some of which were found to be NatC substrates. Interestingly, knockdown of Naa30 induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and fragmentation of mitochondria. In conclusion, NatC Nt-acetylates a large variety of proteins and is essential for mitochondrial integrity and function.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p></html>
