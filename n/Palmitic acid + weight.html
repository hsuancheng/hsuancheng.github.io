Forty mid-lactation Holstein cows (18 primiparous and 22 multiparous) were used in a block design. Cows were assigned to receive either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a C16:0-enriched supplemented diet (PA; 1.5% diet dry matter) fed for 10 wk. Compared with CON, PA increased dry matter intake, milk yield, cumulative milk yield, milk fat content, milk fat yield, 16-carbon milk fatty  (FA) yield, 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield, and energy-corrected milk yield. Additionally, PA increased  change, but did not affect  condition score change compared with CON. A tendency for a treatment by parity interaction was observed for milk yield due to PA increasing milk yield in multiparous but not in primiparous cows. In addition, we observed interactions between treatment and parity for fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk fat yield due to PA increasing these variables to a greater extent in multiparous compared with primiparous cows. Interestingly, we observed an interaction between treatment and parity for  change, due to PA increasing  change in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. The PA treatment increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibilities compared with CON. Although PA did not affect 18-carbon FA digestibility, compared with CON, PA decreased 16-carbon and total FA digestibilities and increased total FA intake by 470 g/d and absorbed total FA by 316 g/d. We also observed an interaction between treatment and parity for total absorbed FA due to PA increasing it to a greater extent in multiparous than in primiparous cows. Compared with CON, PA increased apparent energy intake and milk energy output. We observed an interaction between treatment and parity for milk energy output due to PA increasing milk energy output to a greater extent in multiparous than primiparous cows. Additionally, an interaction between treatment and parity was observed for energy output in  reserves due to PA increasing energy output in  reserves in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. In conclusion, production responses of dairy cows to PA were consistent throughout the 10-wk treatment period. In addition, PA supplementation interacted with parity, with production responses increased to a greater extent in multiparous than primiparous cows and energy partitioned to  reserves only increased in primiparous cows.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

The common variant in the  gene,  (A/G), whose allele A is characterized by a reduced protein expression, has been associated with taste sensitivity to and preference for fat. We therefore aimed at evaluating whether the  polymorphism may influence fatty  metabolism and endocannabinoid biosynthesis in normal  (NW) and obese (OB) subjects. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty  composition, and plasma endocannabinoid levels were determined. In NW subjects with AA genotype was found a marked reduction of RBC saturated fatty acids and /linoleic ratio (PA/LA), considered as  lipogenesis (DNL) biomarkers. Remarkably, to the reduction of DNL biomarkers corresponded an increase of omega-6 index, an indirect marker of the impact on fatty  metabolism of dietary omega-6 fatty acids, endocannabinoid levels and a higher waist/hip ratio. The presence of the G allele was instead associated with increased endocannabinoid plasma levels and a trend for increased waist/hip ratio in obese subjects, even though exhibited decreased BMI with respect to those with AA genotype. These data indicate that the  polymorphism, , leads to a distinct metabolic pattern in NW and in OB subjects. Therefore, their determination may be crucial in developing personalized therapeutic strategies for ameliorating dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759454>Assessing biodiesel quality parameters for wastewater grown Chlorella sp.</a></h2><p>Microalgae are reported as the efficient source of renewable biodiesel which should be able to meet the global demand of transport fuels. Present study is focused on assessment of wastewater grown indigenous microalga Chlorella sp. for fuel quality parameters. This was successfully grown in secondary treated waste water diluted with tap water (25% dilution) in glass house. The microalga showed a dry  of 0.849 g L with lipid content of 27.1% on dry  basis on 21st day of incubation. After transesterification, the yield of fatty  methyl ester was 80.64% with major fatty acids as , linoleic, oleic and linolenic. The physical parameters predicted from empirical equations in the biodiesel showed cetane number as 56.5, iodine value of 75.5 g I 100 g, high heating value 40.1 MJ kg, flash point 135 °C, kinematic viscosity 4.05 mm s with density of 0.86 g cm and cold filter plugging point as 0.7 °C. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), H, C NMR spectrum confirmed the chemical nature of biodiesel. The results indicated that the quality of biodiesel was almost as per the criterion of ASTM standards; hence, wastewater grown Chlorella sp. can be used as a promising strain for biodiesel production.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30208301>Trigonelline prevents high cholesterol and high fat diet induced hepatic lipid accumulation and lipo-toxicity in C57BL/6J mice, via restoration of hepatic autophagy.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is often linked with impaired hepatic autophagy. Here, we studied the alterations in hepatocellular autophagy by high cholesterol and high-fat diet (HC-HF) diet in C57BL/6J mice, and by  (PA), in AML-12 and HepG2 cells. Further, we analysed role of Trigonelline (TG), a plant alkaloid, in preventing NAFLD, by modulating autophagy. For this, C57BL/6J mice were fed with Standard Chow (SC) or HC-HF diet, with and without TG for 16 weeks. In-vitro; AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells, were exposed to PA with and without TG, for 24 h. Cellular events related to autophagy, lipogenesis, and lipo-toxicity were studied. The HC-HF diet fed mice showed hepatic autophagy blockade, increased triglycerides and steatosis. PA exposure to AML-12 cells and HepG2 cells induced impaired autophagy, ER stress, resulting in lipotoxicity. TG treatment in HC-HF fed mice, restored hepatic autophagy, and prevented steatosis. TG treated AML-12, and HepG2 cells exposed to PA showed autophagy restoration, and reduced lipotoxicity, however, these effects were diminished in Atg7-/- HepG2 cells, and in the presence of chloroquine. This study shows that HC-HF diet-induced impaired autophagy, and steatosis is prevented by TG, which attributes to its novel mechanism in treating NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Mice ( = 10) were fed with HFD for 16 weeks to induce obesity and hepatosteatosis and then divided into two groups: HFD + vehicle group injected with the vehicle solution (saline) and HFD + compound C group injected with compound C in saline (5 mg/kg i.p., once a day) for 4 weeks. Liver histology was observed. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism and proinflammation in liver tissue were examined. NLRP3 inflammasome expression in liver tissue was detected by the western blot assay. HepG2 cells were pretreated with compound C and/or AICAR for 1 h and then treated with  (PA) for 3 h. The cells were collected, and mRNA levels were determined.There was a significant reduction in  gain and daily food intake in the HFD + compound C group compared with the HFD + vehicle group ( < 0.05). The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that compound C alleviated insulin resistance. Histology analysis showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis by compound C. Compound C also significantly decreased fatty  synthesis genes, while increased fatty  oxidation genes. Furthermore, compound C significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory markers and NLRP3 inflammasome ( < 0.05). Compound C enhanced mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, catalase, GPx1, and GPx4 and reduced the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio, which were stimulated by  (PA).

Male C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 wk were treated with GLP-1 (200 μg/kg) or 0.9% saline for 4 wk. Fasting blood glucose and insulin and the expression of podocin, nephrin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), glucose transporter type (Glut4), and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) were assayed. Glomerular morphology and podocyte foot structure were evaluated by periodic -Schiff staining and electron microscopy. Podocytes were treated with 150 nM GLP-1 and incubated with 400 μM  (PA) for 12 h. The effect on autophagy was assessed by podocyte-specific Glut4 siRNA. Insulin resistance and autophagy were assayed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The high-fat diet resulted in  gain, ectopic glomerular lipid accumulation, increased insulin resistance, and fusion of podophyte foot processes. The decreased translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane and excess autophagy seen in mice fed a high-fat diet and in PA-treated cultured podocytes were attenuated by GLP-1. Podocyte-specific Glut4 siRNA promoted autophagy, and rapamycin-enhanced autophagy worsened the podocyte injury caused by PA. Excess autophagy in podocytes was induced by inhibition of Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane and was involved in the pathology of ORG.

The effects of the B100 and B100⁻ blends on polymeric materials were examined by comparing changes in the gain/loss of mass and by measuring the hardness, the impact strength, and the tensile strength of the materials at the end of the exposure. The characterization of the polymers was carried out before and after exposure by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). After the immersion in B100⁻acids blends, the HDPE exhibited an increase in mass of 5%, which was very similar in all blends. The PA66 showed a small decrease in  (2% approx.) in all mixtures. The POM presented an increase in the percentage of  in the mixture of B100 with acetic  of 0.3%. A decrease was observed in the crystallinity of the HDPE when exposed to blends of B100⁻acids. This behavior may be associated with a plasticizing effect in the HDPE exposed to the blends. The mechanical properties of POM and HDPE showed no significant changes after immersion in the fuels. On the other hand, PA66 exhibited a significant decrease in maximum stress value after immersion in B100, B100⁻oleic  and B100⁻ blends. The variation of the mechanical properties of the PA66 after exposure to B100 was potentiated by addition of organic acids. The assessed polymers did not undergo appreciable changes in the chemical structure of the samples after immersion in the fuels, so the variation in the mechanical properties could be explained by physical absorption of the fuel into the polymers.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006154>GCN2 deficiency protects against high fat diet induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic lipid deposition and oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is required to maintain hepatic fatty  homeostasis under conditions of amino  deprivation. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of NAFLD has not been investigated. In this study, we used Gcn2 mice to investigate the effect of GCN2 on high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. After HFD feeding for 12 weeks, Gcn2 mice were less obese than wild-type (WT) mice, and Gcn2 significantly attenuated HFD-induced liver dysfunction, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. In the livers of the HFD-fed mice, GCN2 deficiency resulted in higher levels of lipolysis genes, lower expression of genes related to FA synthesis, transport and lipogenesis, and less induction of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, -induced steatosis, oxidative & ER stress, and changes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), fatty  synthase (FAS) and metallothionein (MT) expression in HepG2 cells. Collectively, our data provide evidences that GCN2 deficiency protects against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis and reducing oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that strategies to inhibit GCN2 activity in the liver may provide a novel approach to attenuate NAFLD development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to characterize the fatty  esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), namely  hydroxystearic acids (PAHSAs)-endogenous lipids with anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties, in human breast milk. Breast milk samples from 30 lean (BMI=19-23) and 23 obese (BMI>30) women were collected 72h postpartum. Adipose tissue and milk samples were harvested from C57BL/6J mice. FAHFA lipid profiles were measured using reverse phase and chiral liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. PAHSA regioisomers as well as other FAHFAs were present in both human and murine milk. Unexpectedly, the levels of 5-PAHSA were higher relative to other regioisomers. The separation of both regioisomers and enantiomers of PAHSAs revealed that both R- and S-enantiomers were present in the biological samples, and that the majority of the 5-PAHSA signal is of R configuration. Total PAHSA levels were positively associated with  gain during pregnancy, and 5-PAHSA as well as total PAHSA levels were significantly lower in the milk of the obese compared to the lean mothers.

Meat samples were collected from the longissimus dorsi muscles of 1000 Hanwoo steers that were 30-month-old (progeny of 85 proven Hanwoo bulls) to determine intramuscular fatty  profiles. Phenotypic data on carcass  (CWT), eye muscle area (EMA), back fat thickness (BFT), marbling score (MS), Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and intramuscular fat content (IMF) were also investigated using this half-sib population. Variance and covari.ance components were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood procedures under univariate and pairwise bivariate animal models. Oleic  (C18:1n-9) was the most abundant fatty , accounting for 50.69% of all investigated fatty acids, followed by  (C16:0; 27.33%) and stearic  (C18:0; 10.96%). The contents of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were 41.64%, 56.24% and 2.10%, respectively, and the MUFA/SFA ratio, PUFA/SFA ratio, desaturation index (DI) and elongation index (EI) were 1.36, 0.05, 0.59 and 0.66, respectively. The h 2 estimates for individual fatty acids ranged from very low to high (0.03±0.14 to 0.63±0.14). The h 2 estimates for SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, DI and EI were 0.53±0.14, 0.49±0.14, 0.23±0.10, 0.51±0.13 and 0.53±0.13, respectively. The genetic and phenotypic correlations among individual fatty acids and fatty  classes varied widely (-0.99 to 0.99). Notably, C18:1n-9 had favourable (negative) genetic correlations with two detrimental fatty acids, C14:0 (-0.76) and C16:0 (-0.92). Genetic correlations of individual and group fatty acids with CWT, EMA, BFT, MS, WBSF and IMF ranged from low to moderate (both positive and negative) with the exception of low-concentration PUFAs. Low or near-zero phenotypic correlations reflected potential non-genetic contributions.

In other words, is it better to cut fat or cut carbohydrate for  loss. However, going beyond this debate (fat versus carbohydrate), are questions around whether certain fatty acids are worse for promoting insulin resistance, inflammation, and obesity. The overall evidence in the literature suggests that medium-chain saturated fats (such as lauric , found in coconut oil) and monounsaturated fat (oleic , found in olive oil) are less likely to promote insulin resistance, inflammation, and fat storage compared to long-chain saturated fatty acids (such as stearic  found in large quantities in butter, but particularly  found in palm oil) especially when consumed on top of a diet moderate in refined carbohydrates. Compared to long-chain saturated fats, lauric  and oleic  have an increased fatty  oxidation rate, are more likely to be burned for energy and less likely to be stored in adipose tissue, and thus promote increased energy expenditure. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as linoleic , as found in vegetable oils may contribute to obesity, whereas omega-3 PUFA may be protective.

Part of this capacity results from induction of brown-like adipocytes within classical white depots, making it difficult to determine the oxidative contribution of the more abundant white adipocytes. Avian genomes lack a gene for uncoupling protein 1 and are devoid of brown adipose cells, making them a useful model in which to study white adipocyte metabolism in vivo. We recently reported that a brief (5 hour) period of fasting significantly upregulated many genes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation pathways in white adipose tissue of young broiler chickens. The objective of this study was to determine if the effects on gene expression manifested in increased rates of fatty  oxidation. Abdominal adipose tissue was collected from 21 day-old broiler chicks that were fasted for 3, 5 or 7 hours or fed ad libitum (controls). Fatty  oxidation was determined by measuring and summing CO production and C-labeled -soluble metabolites from the oxidation of [1-C] . Fasting induced a progressive increase in complete fatty  oxidation and citrate synthase activity relative to controls. These results confirm that fatty  oxidation in white adipose tissue is dynamically controlled by nutritional status. Identifying the underlying mechanism may provide new therapeutic targets through which to increase fatty  oxidation in situ and protect against the detrimental effects of excess free fatty acids on adipocyte insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29798686>Effects of saturated  and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on Sertoli cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Obesity is believed to negatively affect male semen quality and is accompanied by dysregulation of free fatty  (FFA) metabolism in plasma. However, the implication of dysregulated FFA on semen quality and the involvement of Sertoli cells remain unclear. In the present study, we report obesity decreased Sertoli cell viability through dysregulated FFAs. We observed an increased rate of apoptosis in Sertoli cells, accompanied with elevated FFA levels, in the testes of obese mice that were provided a high-fat diet (HFD). Moreover, the levels of reactive oxygen species were elevated. Furthermore, we demonstrated by in vitro assays that saturated  (PA), which is the most common saturated FFA in plasma, led to decreased cell viability of TM4 Sertoli cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar finding was noted in primary mouse Sertoli cells. In contrast to saturated FFA, omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protected Sertoli cells from PA-induced lipotoxicity at the physiologically relevant levels. These results indicated that the lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids might be the cause of obesity-induced Sertoli cell apoptosis, which leads to decreased semen quality. In addition, ω-3 PUFAs could be classified as protective FFAs.FFA: free fatty ; HFD: high-fat diet; SD: standard diet; PA: ; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty ; AI: apoptotic index; MTT: 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide; ROS: reactive oxygen species; HE: Hematoxylin and eosin; WT1: Wilm Tumor 1; NAFLD: non- alcoholic fatty liver disease; DCFH-DA: 2', 7' dichloroﬂuorescin diacetate; 36B4: acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0; SD: standard deviation; EPA: eicosapentaenoic ; PI: propidium iodide; DHA: docosahexenoic .</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28384417>Dehydration Causes Increased Reliance on Protein Oxidation in Mice: A Test of the Protein-for-Water Hypothesis in a Mammal.</a></h2><p>During fasting, animals rely on a mixture of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins that are derived solely from endogenous sources. The relative contributions of these metabolic fuels chiefly depend on the duration of the fast, but other factors including previous diet, environmental temperature, and activity level can modulate the fuel mixture. It has long been held that endogenous proteins are spared from catabolism until the final stages of prolonged fasting and contribute a significant proportion of energy once the other metabolic fuels have been depleted. However, evidence is mounting that protein is catabolized supplemental to fat metabolism under some circumstances. This has been shown in migratory birds that exhibit dramatic reductions in lean mass during flights. One hypothesis to explain this seemingly maladaptive metabolic strategy is that the catabolism and oxidation of protein in situ yields five times more metabolic water than that generated through fat oxidation alone. Recent support for this hypothesis is that birds benefit from such a strategy due to their uricotelic nature. However, it remains unclear whether ureotelic mammals would also employ this strategy. Here we test the protein-for-water hypothesis in resting laboratory mice subjected to water deprivation during fasting while we tracked rates of protein and lipid catabolism using endogenously incorporated C-leucine and C-. We found no differences in instantaneous leucine oxidation; however, cumulative differences in instantaneous leucine oxidation ultimately resulted in a higher total leucine oxidation after 72 h of fasting in water-deprived animals. We also found that lipid oxidation was 8% higher in the hydrated mice, but the difference was not significant presumably because of a concomitant reduction in metabolic rates of the water-deprived mice. Our results indicate that mammals do increase rates of protein catabolism during dehydration but to a lesser degree than birds. The ability of mammals to produce highly concentrated urine and their lower inherent rates of protein turnover apparently preclude mammals from taking full advantage of the protein-for-water strategy during fasting under dehydrating conditions.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31495626>Altering the ratio of dietary C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 interacts with production level in dairy cows: Effects on production responses and energy partitioning.</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of altering the dietary ratio of  (C16:0) and oleic (cis-9 C18:1) acids on nutrient digestibility, energy partitioning, and production responses of lactating dairy cows. Cows were blocked by milk yield and assigned to 3 groups (12 cows per group) in a main plot: low (45.2 ± 1.7 kg/d), medium (53.0 ± 1.6 kg/d), and high (60.0 ± 1.9 kg/d). Within each production group, a truncated Latin square arrangement of fatty  (FA) treatments was used in 2 consecutive 35-d periods. The FA treatments supplemented at 1.5% of diet dry matter were (1) 80:10 (80% C16:0 + 10% cis-9 C18:1), (2) 73:17 (73% C16:0 + 17% cis-9 C18:1), (3) 66:24 (66% C16:0 + 24% cis-9 C18:1), and (4) 60:30 (60% C16:0 + 30% cis-9 C18:1). Treatment × production group interactions were observed for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, milk fat, milk protein, and milk lactose and energy partitioned to milk. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments reduced fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk energy output in low-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments did not affect milk yield, milk protein yield, and milk lactose yield in low- and medium-producing cows but increased these in high-producing cows. Regardless of production level, there was no effect of treatments on dry matter intake; however, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased  change and  condition score change. Increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased total FA digestibility due to a linear increase in 16- and 18-carbon FA digestibilities. Interactions between FA treatments and production level were observed for the yield of milk fat and milk FA sources. In low-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments decreased milk fat yield due to a decrease in de novo and mixed milk FA without changes in preformed milk FA. In contrast, in high-producing cows, increasing cis-9 C18:1 in FA treatments increased milk fat yield due to an increase in de novo and preformed milk FA. Our results indicate that high-producing dairy cows (averaging 60 kg/d) responded better to a fat supplement containing more cis-9 C18:1, whereas low-producing cows (averaging 45 kg/d) responded better to a supplement containing more C16:0.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Activation of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) can promote the browning of white fat. 9-PAHSA, an endogenous mammalian lipid, which is acting as the ligand of GPR120 to enhance glucose uptake and exert anti-inflammatory effect. In the study, we would like to investigate the biological effects of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning. Here, we show that 9-PAHSA induces browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via enhanced expression of brown fat specific genes. 9-PAHSA-induced browning in white adipocytes of WT mice and ob/ob mice was investigated by determining expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific genes/proteins by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunoblot analysis and immunochemical staining. The effects of 9-PAHSA on brown fat markers in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased when GPR120 gene was silenced. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was conducted. 9-PAHSA treatment abolished LPS-induced NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. But these anti-inflammatory effects of 9-PAHSA were attenuated by GPR120 knockdown. Our finding demonstrated that the browning of adipocyte was induced by 9-PAHSA through activating GPR120 and inhibiting the LPS/NF-κB pathway.

The mice were then treated with berberine (BBR) (100 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks to test the impact on GLP-1 expression. Mitochondrial activities of the colon enterocytes were compared among three groups of mice (lean, DIO, and DIO + BBR) at the end of treatment. Gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were examined to understand the mitochondrial responses. A cellular model treated with  (PA) was used in the mechanism study.A reduction in GLP-1 expression was observed in DIO mice with mitochondrial stress responses in the colon enterocytes. The mitochondria exhibited cristae loss, membrane rupture, and mitochondrial swelling, which was observed with an increase in ATP abundance, complex I activity, and deficiency in the activities of complexes II and IV. Those changes were associated with dysbiosis and a reduction in SCFAs in the colon of DIO mice. In the cellular model, an increase in ATP abundance, loss of mitochondrial potential, and elevation of apoptosis were induced by PA. All of the alterations in DIO mice and the cellular model were attenuated by BBR.The mitochondrial stress responses were observed in the colon enterocytes of DIO mice for GLP-1 reduction.

Previous studies have found that cell apoptosis exerts an important role in obesity-related male infertility. C1q/TNF-related protein 3 (CTRP3), a paralog of adiponectin, has been proposed to exert anti-apoptotic effects and to attenuate diabetes-related cardiac injuries. However, the role of CTRP3 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced spermatogenic impairment remains unclear. In the present study, we fed male mice an HFD for 24 weeks to induce obesity. The expression of CTRP3 was decreased by HFD feeding. Supplementation with the recombinant human globular domain of CTRP3 (0.25 μg/g/day) for 4 weeks beginning at 20 weeks of the HFD improved spermatogenic function in the HFD-fed mice, which were characterized by improved testis morphology, increased testis / ratio, and increased sperm count, sperm viability, and sperm motility. We also found that CTRP3 infusion resulted in the attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the activation of silence information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in the testes of obese mice. Our  study also suggested that CTRP3 attenuated the  (PA)-induced reductions in sperm viability and motility via the inhibition of ER stress. Moreover, germ cell-specific  knockout abolished the protective effects of CTRP3  and  studies of human sperm showed that the protective effects of CTRP3 on sperm viability and motility were abrogated by a specific inhibitor of SIRT1. Thus, our results demonstrated that CTRP3 expression protected against HFD-induced spermatogenic deficiency through the SIRT1/ER stress pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

Fifteen Holstein cows (139 ± 39 d in milk) were randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments were a control diet (CON; no fat supplement) and 1.5% of FA added either as a -enriched triglyceride supplement (PA-TG) or as calcium salts of palm FA supplement (Ca-FA). Fat-supplemented treatments did not affect dry matter intake (DMI) compared with CON, but Ca-FA reduced DMI compared with PA-TG. Compared with CON, fat-supplemented treatments increased 18-carbon FA digestibility by 2.0 percentage units but did not affect digestibility of total FA or 16-carbon FA. Compared with Ca-FA, PA-TG reduced total FA digestibility by 8.7 percentage units due to a decrease in 16-carbon FA digestibility (21.7 percentage units). Both fat supplements increased neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility compared with CON (3.90 percentage units), and PA-TG tended to increase NDF digestibility by 1.60 percentage units compared with Ca-FA. Compared with CON, fat-supplemented treatments increased milk yield (1.05 kg/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield (2.20 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk yield (1.80 kg/d). Also, PA-TG increased milk fat yield (50 g/d) and milk energy output (1.0 Mcal/d) and tended to increase milk fat content (0.07 percentage units) and energy-corrected milk yield (1.0 kg/d) compared with Ca-FA. Fat-supplemented treatments reduced the yield of de novo milk FA (23 g/d) and increased the yields of mixed (43 g/d) and preformed (52 g/d) milk FA compared with CON. The PA-TG treatment increased the yield of 16-carbon (66 g/d) milk FA compared with Ca-FA, whereas Ca-FA increased the yield of preformed (60 g/d) milk FA. Fat-supplemented treatments increased intake of net energy for lactation by 1.80 Mcal/d, milk energy output by 1.30 Mcal/d, and energy in  reserves by 0.30 Mcal/d compared with CON. The Ca-FA treatment increased energy allocated to  reserves (0.60 Mcal/d), energy partitioning toward  reserves (1.20 percentage units), and  condition score change (0.06 units), and tended to increase  change (0.16 kg/d) and  condition score (0.08 units) compared with PA-TG. In conclusion, feeding a -enriched triglyceride supplement increased milk energy output due to increased yields of milk and milk fat, whereas feeding a calcium salts of palm FA supplement increased FA digestibility and energy partitioned to  reserves.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Here we tested the in-vitro effects of ZP3022 on β-cell proliferation, islet apoptosis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rat islets of Langerhans. Moreover, gene expression profiling in whole pancreas from Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats was performed to characterize genes differently regulated by short-term treatment with ZP3022. Treatments with exendin-4, gastrin-17 alone or in combination were included in the studies. ZP3022 promoted β-cell proliferation, protected from palmitate-, but not from cytokine-induced apoptosis, and induced an increase in GSIS, demonstrating a glucose dependent insulinotropic action of ZP3022 on β-cells. The combination treatment with exendin-4 and gastrin-17 showed comparable effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and GSIS as did ZP3022. Microarray analysis revealed that ZP3022 exerted specific effects on pancreatic gene expression not observed when treating ZDF rats with either exendin-4 alone or in combination with gastrin-17. In particular MAPK signaling pathway was observed among the highest affected pathways; while also pathways related to insulin signaling and secretion were regulated by ZP3022. Moreover, rats treated with ZP3022 had a higher expression of genes encoding for the specific β-cell/endocrine cell markers, such as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), protein convertase 1/3 and -2 (PC 1/3 and-2), as well as transmembrane protein 27(TMEM27) compared to vehicle treated rats.

PVAT dysfunction has a crucial role in regulating vascular remodeling, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how obesity-induced PVAT dysfunction affected adventitia remodeling in early vascular injury stages. Mini pigs were fed a high sugar and fat diet for 6 months to induce metabolic syndrome and obesity. In the mini pigs, left carotid vascular injury was then generated using balloon dilation. Compared with normal mini pigs, obese mini pigs displayed significantly enhanced vascular injury-induced adventitial responses, evidenced by adventitia fibroblast (AF) proliferation and differentiation, and adventitia fibrosis, as well as exacerbated PVAT dysfunction characterized by increased accumulation of resident macrophages, particularly the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, increased expression of leptin and decreased expression of adiponectin, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Primary AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium from obese mini pigs also showed significantly increased proliferation and differentiation.

Previous studies have suggested that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b (HNF1b) ameliorates insulin resistance. However, the role of HNF1b in the regulation of lipid metabolism and hepatic steatosis remains poorly understood. We found that HNF1b expression was decreased in steatotic livers. We injected mice with lentivirus (LV) expressing HNF1b shRNA to generate mice with hepatic knockdown of HNF1b. We also injected high fat (HF) diet-induced obese and db/db diabetic mice with LV expressing HNF1b to overexpress HNF1b. Knockdown of HNF1b increased hepatic lipid contents and induced insulin resistance in mice and in hepatocytes. Knockdown of HNF1b worsened HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid contents, liver injury and insulin resistance in mice and PA-induced lipid accumulation and impaired insulin signaling in hepatocytes. Moreover, overexpression of HNF1b alleviated HF diet-induced increases in hepatic lipid content and insulin resistance in mice. Knockdown of HNF1b increased expression of genes associated with lipogenensis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. DPP4 and NOX1 expression was increased by knockdown of HNF1b and HNF1b directly bound with the promoters of DPP4 and NOX1. Overexpression of DPP4 or NOX1 was associated with an increase in lipid droplets in hepatocytes and decreased expression of DPP4 or NOX1 suppressed the effects of knockdown of HNF1b knockdown on triglyceride (TG) formation and insulin signaling. Knockdown of HNF1b increased superoxide level and decreased glutathione content, which was inhibited by downregulation of DPP4 and NOX1. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed HNF1b knockdown-induced ER stress, TG formation and insulin resistance.  (PA) decreased HNF1b expression which was inhibited by NAC. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HNF1b plays an essential role in controlling hepatic TG homeostasis and insulin sensitivity by regulating DPP4/NOX1mediated generation of superoxide.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The observations are in line with the assumption that the molecular mechanisms of 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD toxicity differ. Observed proteomic alterations point towards effects of 2-MCPD on mitogen-dependent signaling and mitochondrial energy utilization. Presented data for the first time provide insight into proteomic effects of 2-MCPD in testicular tissue.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In a series of assays of bacterial reverse-mutation, in vitro chromosomal aberration, and in vivo micronucleus, negative responses were found by the treatment of 2-dDCB comparing vehicle control, dimethyl sulfoxide or corn oil. In the acute oral toxicity test, all of the mice administrated 2-dDCB survived, and there were no clinical and necropsy signs observed at any doses (0, 300, and 2000 mg/kg ) during the experimental period of 14 days. These results suggested that 2-dDCB is a relatively non-toxic substance with median lethality dose higher than 2000 mg/kg . Moreover, there were no adverse effects noted in rats orally administrated 2-dDCB everyday via gavage for 28 days, even at the highest dose (2.0 mg/kg /day) tested, which is 1000-times higher than the human daily intake of 2-dDCB estimated through an extreme exposure scenario. Overall, these results indicate that 2-dDCB is not likely to raise any human health concerns and irradiated foods containing  can be recognized as safe for human consumption under the current international regulation systems for food irradiation.Copyright © 2018.

Despite the significant role of these compounds in grape berries, knowledge of grape lipid composition is still limited. This study addresses the free fatty  composition and other lipids in skins and seeds of several Vitis vinifera grape cultivars using LC-MS/MS. A different profile of free fatty acids was determined in the grape tissues, showing a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in seeds (ca. 60%). Lignoceric  was one of the main free saturated fatty acids found in grape skins, together with  and stearic acids. Berry skins showed similar ranges of C18-unsaturated fatty acids, whereas linoleic  was predominant in the seed fatty  composition. Higher content of glycerophospholipids was determined in grape seeds. Uvaol and oleanolic  were only quantified in skins (1.5-3.9 and 38.6-57.6 mg/kg fresh , respectively). These preliminary results suggest a certain diversity in grape lipids according to their location in the berry tissues and cultivar, providing useful information for the fermentation process due to their role in wine sensory profile and yeast growth.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to examine the impact of ET-1 receptor A (ET) ablation on obesity-induced changes in cardiac geometry and contractile function, as well as the mechanisms involved with a focus on autophagy. Cardiomyocyte-specific ET receptor knockout (ETAKO) and WT mice were fed either low-fat (10% calorie from fat) or high-fat (45% calorie from fat) diet for 24 weeks. Glucose tolerance test was examined to confirm insulin resistance. High-fat diet intake compromised myocardial geometry (enlarged left ventricular diameters in systole and diastole), morphology (cardiac hypertrophy, increased wall thickness and interstitial fibrosis), contractile function (reduced fractional shortening, ejection fraction and cardiomyocyte shortening) and intracellular Ca handling, the effect of which was significantly attenuated by ETAKO. TUNEL staining revealed overt apoptosis in high-fat-fed group, the effect was reverted by ETAKO. Western blot analysis noted that high-fat intake downregulated leptin receptor and PPARγ, insulin signaling (elevated basal/dampened insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and IRS1), phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, upregulated GATA-4, ANP, NFATc3, PPARα, m-TOR/p70s6k signaling, which were attenuated by ETAKO with the exception of AMPK/ACC. Furthermore, high-fat intake suppressed cardiac autophagy, which was abrogated by ETAKO. In cultured murine cardiomyocytes,  challenged mimicked high-fat diet-induced hypertrophic and autophagic responses, the effect of which were abolished by the ET receptor antagonist BQ123 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These results suggest that inhibition of ET rescues high-fat intake-induced cardiac anomalies possibly through autophagy regulation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the hepatoprotective effects in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-like C57BL/6J mice.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is involved in the development of IR and obesity in vivo. However, its possible contribution to NAFLD and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of its role on IR or fat mass accretion has not been explored. Here, we used wild-type (WT) or GRK2 hemizygous (GRK2±) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) as a model of NASH independent of adiposity and IR. GRK2± mice were protected from HFD-induced NAFLD. Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to- ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and lipid-uptake markers and less signs of inflammation in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating obesity-related nephropathy.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411435>The effect of surfactant crystallization on partial coalescence in O/W emulsions.</a></h2><p>Partial coalescence is a ubiquitous instability in emulsions whose dispersed phase is partially crystallized. When emulsions are stabilized with proteins, interfacial stiffness and long-range repulsive surface forces hinder this type of instability. The addition of low molecular  surfactants modifies the interfacial properties and surface forces, generally promoting partial coalescence. In the present work, various surfactants (Tween® 80,  and monoglycerides) differing in their crystallization temperature were probed for their ability to induce partial coalescence in model O/W emulsions stabilized by sodium caseinate. The initially fluid emulsions were submitted to a tempering cycle leading to the gelation of the system. The extent of partial coalescence was evaluated by measuring the bulk storage modulus. DSC was used to determine the melting range of the oil phase and surfactants, while polarized microscopy, Raman imaging, and surface rheology measurements were performed to characterize the oil/water interface. The experimental conditions in terms of droplet size, surfactant-to-protein molar ratio and tempering history favoring partial coalescence were first explored in presence of Tween® 80. We show that partial coalescence is rather marginal when crystallizable surfactants are added, and pronounced with liquid surfactants. The phenomena underlying this result, especially interfacial crystallization of surfactants, are evidenced and discussed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

De novo ceramide synthesis was inhibited either by pharmacological (myriocin) or molecular (si-Serine Palmitoyl Transferase 2, siSPT2) approaches. Obese Zucker rats (OZR) were intracerebroventricularly infused with myriocin to inhibit de novo ceramide synthesis. Insulin resistance was determined by quantification of Akt phosphorylation. Ceramide levels were quantified either by a radioactive kinase assay or by mass spectrometry analysis. Glucose homeostasis were evaluated in myriocin-treated OZR. Basal and glucose-stimulated parasympathetic tonus was recorded in OZR. Insulin secretion from islets and β-cell mass was also determined.We show that palmitate impaired insulin signaling and increased ceramide levels in hypothalamic neuronal GT1-7 cells. In addition, the use of deuterated  demonstrated that palmitate activated several enzymes of the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway in hypothalamic cells. Importantly, myriocin and siSPT2 treatment restored insulin signaling in palmitate-treated GT1-7 cells. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor or a dominant-negative PKCζ also counteracted palmitate-induced insulin resistance. Interestingly, attenuating the increase in levels of hypothalamic ceramides with intracerebroventricular infusion of myriocin in OZR improved their hypothalamic insulin-sensitivity. Importantly, central myriocin treatment partially restored glucose tolerance in OZR. This latter effect is related to the restoration of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and an increase in β-cell mass of OZR. Electrophysiological recordings also showed an improvement of glucose-stimulated parasympathetic nerve activity in OZR centrally treated with myriocin.Our results highlight a key role of hypothalamic de novo ceramide synthesis in central insulin resistance installation and glucose homeostasis dysregulation associated with obesity.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Mechanistic studies revealed that plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 was significantly raised in the vagotomized mice, which was associated with significant reductions in mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), SCD-1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1), and FASN (fatty  synthase), as well as enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity. In vitro, treating mouse primary hepatocytes with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, exendin-4, for 48 hours inhibited free fatty ,  treatment induced de novo lipid synthesis, and VLDL secretion from hepatocytes.Elevation of glucagon-like peptide-1 in vagotomized mice may prevent VLDL overproduction and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet. These novel findings, for the first time, delineate an intrinsic gut-liver regulatory circuit that is mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 in regulating hepatic energy metabolism.© 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500968>Effects of a hypoenergetic diet rich in α-linolenic  on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in overweight and obese patients with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived α-linolenic  (ALA) may exert cardioprotective effects. Dietary ALA can undergo desaturation and elongation to form long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but the extent to which this occurs in humans is unclear. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of an energy-restricted diet enriched with ALA on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in patients with metabolic syndrome.The present analysis compared the effects of a hypoenergetic diet high in ALA (3.4 g/d) with a control diet low in ALA (0.9 g/d) on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in 81 overweight or obese patients with features of metabolic syndrome.After a 26-wk intervention, concentration of ALA in serum phospholipids remained constant in both diet groups. The control group had a significant decrease in serum phospholipid eicosapentaenoic  concentration, although no significant intergroup difference was observed. Serum phospholipid docosahexaenoic  concentration significantly decreased to a similar extent with both interventions. Additionally, both interventions significantly decreased serum phospholipid concentrations of , stearic , total saturated fatty acids, linoleic , total ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, with no effect of diet group on these changes. Compared with the ALA diet, the control diet led to a significant increase in serum phospholipid oleic  concentration.Daily intake of 3.4 g of ALA during a 26-wk energy-restricted diet did not lead to an enrichment of serum phospholipids with ALA and did not increase eicosapentaenoic  due to conversion.

However, their effects on heat shock response (HSR) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigate whether the GLP-1 analogue, exendin-4, triggers the expression of HSR and increases MAPK activity under metabolic stress.The effects of exendin-4 in the presence or absence of  (PA; 400 μm) or glucose (30 mm) in the HepG2 liver cell line are assessed using Western blots, quantitative real-time PCR, and label-free proteomics.Heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP72, HSP90, and GRP78) and other chaperones are not significantly affected by exendin-4 under the conditions tested. In contrast, the presence of exendin-4 alone increases the MAPK phosphorylation levels (JNK, ERK1/2, and p38). For short incubation periods, in the presence of PA or glucose, treatment with exendin-4 exhibits limited effects but significantly attenuates MAPK phosphorylation after a 24-h incubation. Interestingly, canonical signaling pathways, such as EIF2, ILK, PKA, and Rho, are modulated by exendin-4.Identifying new pathways modulated by GLP-1 analogues will provide further insights into their benefits beyond their currently recognized roles in glycemic control, such as MAPK activity, energy homeostasis, and  decrease.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Both dimerization and lipidation effectively prolong the half-life of peptides in vivo by increasing hydrodynamic size and facilitating physical interactions with serum albumin. Here, we report a novel method to discover long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues by rational design based on Xenopus GLP-1 through a combined dimerization and lipidization strategy. On the basis of our previous structure analysis of Xenopus GLP-1,  and a C-terminal Cys were firstly introduced into two Xenopus GLP-1 analogues (1 and 2), and the afforded 3 and 4 were further reacted with bis-maleimide amine to afford two dimeric lipidated Xenopus GLP-1 analogues (5 and 6). The in vitro and in vivo biological activities of 5 and 6 were significantly improved as compared with their monomers. Moreover, the selected compound 6 showed greater hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activities than liraglutide even when the dose of 6 was reduced to half in db/db mice. Pharmacokinetic test revealed that 6 had a ∼ 3-fold longer half-life than liraglutide in Kunming mice and SD rats, and the longer half-life of 6 led to excellent long-acting hypoglycemic effects as confirmed by two different pharmacological methods conducted on db/db mice. Finally, a 7 weeks chronic study conducted on db/db mice demonstrated the better therapeutic efficacies of 6 on glucose tolerance normalization, HbA1c reduction and pancreas islets protection than liraglutide. The present research showed that combined dimerization and lipidization is effective when applied to Xenopus GLP-1 analogue to develop novel GLP-1 analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Diet-induced obesity models (DIO) show that changes in hypothalamic mitochondria fusion and fission dynamics modulate metabolic dysfunction. Using three selective diet formula including a High fat diet (HFD), Cafeteria (CAF) and High Sugar Diet (HSD), we hypothesized that maternal diets exposure program leads to selective changes in hypothalamic mitochondria fusion and fission dynamics in male offspring leading to metabolic dysfunction which is exacerbated by a second exposure after weaning.We exposed female Wistar rats to nutritional programming including Chow, HFD, CAF, or HSD for 9 weeks (pre-mating, mating, pregnancy and lactation) or to the same diets to offspring after weaning. We determined , food intake and metabolic parameters in the offspring from 21 to 60 days old. Hypothalamus was dissected at 60 days old to determine mitochondria-ER interaction markers by mRNA expression and western blot and morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mitochondrial-ER function was analyzed by confocal microscopy using hypothalamic cell line mHypoA-CLU192.Maternal programming by HFD and CAF leads to failure in glucose, leptin and insulin sensitivity and fat accumulation. Additionally, HFD and CAF programming promote mitochondrial fusion by increasing the expression of MFN2 and decreasing DRP1, respectively. Further, TEM analysis confirms that CAF exposure after programing leads to an increase in mitochondria fusion and enhanced mitochondrial-ER interaction, which partially correlates with metabolic dysfunction and fat accumulation in the HFD and CAF groups. Finally, we identified that lipotoxic  stimulus in hypothalamic cells increases Ca overload into mitochondria matrix leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.We concluded that maternal programming by HFD induces hypothalamic mitochondria fusion, metabolic dysfunction and fat accumulation in male offspring, which is exacerbated by HFD or CAF exposure after weaning, potentially due to mitochondria calcium overflux.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384366>Shengmai San Alleviates Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Through Improvement of Mitochondrial Lipid Metabolic Disorder.</a></h2><p>Shengmai San (SMS), prepared from Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Schisandra chinensisin, has been widely used to treat ischemic disease. In this study, we investigated whether SMS may exert a beneficial effect in diabetic cardiomyopathy through improvement of mitochondrial lipid metabolism.A leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model was utilized, and lean age-matched C57BLKS mice served as non-diabetic controls. Glucose and lipid profiles, myocardial structure, dimension, and function, and heart  to tibial length ratio were determined. Myocardial ultrastructural morphology was observed with transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex were assessed using western blotting and microplate assay kits. We also observed cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, OXPHOS complex activity, and cellular ATP level in -stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Changes in the sirtuin (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) pathway and mitochondrial uncoupling signaling were assessed using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR.Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by distinct myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS at a dose of 3 g/kg  contributed to a recovery of diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS administration led to an effective restoration of mitochondrial structure and function both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, SMS markedly enhanced SIRT1 and p-AMPKα protein levels and decreased the expression of acetylated-PGC-1α and uncoupling protein 2 protein.

Some mice develop diet-induced obesity (DIO), but others remain diet resistant (DR) despite intake of the same high-saturated-fat diet, a phenomenon that mimics characteristics of the human obese phenotype. Microbiota-colon-brain axis regulation is important for energy metabolism and cognition. Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut microbiota, colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of microbiota-gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant  gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier  than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut microbiota richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut microbiota. DIO mice exhibited reduced tight junction proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut microbiota, colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

Panaxynol was isolated from Saposhnikovia divaricata as an active compound with HMW adiponectin promoting properties. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists are reported to increase the secretion of HMW adiponectin, although the effects of panaxynol were found to be independent of PPARγ activation. When the underlying mechanisms were further examined, panaxynol was found to inhibit the -induced downregulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) protein, and the anti-lipotoxic effects were abolished by a FoxO1 inhibitor.

The objective of this study was to utilize crude glycerol from biodiesel (CGB) as a substrate, which is a major byproduct from biodiesel production, to produce lipophilic compounds. Bacillus megaterium INCQS 425 was cultivated and evaluated for the production of lipophilic compounds and the properties of these compounds were investigated. Cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 0.60:1 favored the accumulation of lipids by (17.5%) comprising mainly  (13.08%), palmitoleic (39.48%), and especially oleic  (37.02%), which imparts good characteristics to biodiesel. Meanwhile, cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 4:1 favored the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.31gL) mainly comprising medium and long chain PHA. Low crystallinity (<30%) and excellent thermal properties make them suitable for processes that demand high temperatures, such as extrusion. The lipids produced in the present study had satisfactory oxidative stability for the production of quality biodiesel.

Cholesterol efflux via the transporters ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles is a critical mechanism to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Little is known about the impact of the obese microenvironment on cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of macrophages. In this study, the CEC of obese-derived primary adipose-tissue macrophages (ATM) is evaluated and the in vivo microenvironment is modeled in vitro to determine mechanisms underlying modulated CEC.F4/80 ATM are labeled with  H-cholesterol ex vivo, and CEC and ABCA1/ABCG1 protein levels are determined. Total, ABCA1-dependent, and ABCA1-independent CECs are determined in J774 macrophages polarized to M1 (LPS&IFNγ), M2 (IL-4&IL-13), or metabolic phenotypes (glucose, insulin, and ).Obese ATM exhibit enhanced CEC and ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression compared to lean ATM. In contrast, ABCA1-CEC is suppressed from M1 polarized macrophages compared to untreated in vitro, by activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Incubation of macrophages in vitro in high glucose augments cAMP-induced ABCA1 protein expression and ABCA1-CEC.These novel findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity of macrophages to respond to their environment with specific modulation of ABCA1 depending on whether classical pro-inflammatory or metabolic cues predominate.© 2018 The Authors.

Thus, the aim of this study was to contribute to the popularization of pansies (Viola × wittrockiana), through the analysis of the nutritional and nutraceutical features of pansies with different colors (white, yellow, and red) and flowering stages. Both flower type and flowering stage influenced the flower composition. When completely open, white and yellow pansies had the highest contents of protein (>2.00 g/100 g fresh ), while red pansies had the highest content of carbohydrates (8.0 g/100 g fresh ). Regarding the fatty  profiles, linoleic  was always predominant (ranging between 18.7 and 51.0 g/100 g fatty acids), followed by the  and linolenic acids. During flowering, there was an increase in protein, fat, and linolenic  contents in white and yellow pansies, whereas in red pansies the values did not change. Red pansies were characterized by the highest contents of total carotenoids (873 to 1300 µg β-carotene/g dry ) and monomeric anthocyanins (303 to 402 µg Cy-3 glu/g dry ); however, white and yellow pansies showed an increase in the values of total reducing capacity (total phenols), hydrolysable tannins, flavonoids, monomeric anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity from the bud to completely open flower stage. Our results underline the nutritional differences between pansies with different colors at distinct stages of development and their potential health benefits, suggesting that they can be used as ingredient to improve the nutritional properties of foods. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The market of edible flowers is increasing, although little information in nutritional view is available.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood.In order to investigate this process the current study examined ectopic fat accumulation in rats with high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Levels of lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation and islet function were assessed via intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipid metabolism- and ISC activation-related markers was evaluated in cultured ISCs treated with  (PA) using quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on insulin release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.HFD increased  and ectopic fat accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and insulin secretion in co-cultures.These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of lipid metabolism, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic  and IGF-I was associated with higher . The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic  (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic,  and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic . The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic,  and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Little information is currently available on the utility of these larvae in poultry feed, so goals of this study were to determine whether larvae could be reared on horse manure under traditional farming conditions and to evaluate the growth performances of a local poultry fed these larvae and the fatty acids profiles of their meat. After freezing and thawing, larvae were introduced in the feed of Ardennaise chickens between 30 and 80 days of age.

Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system, play a crucial role in pathological hypothalamic inflammatory processes. Here, we demonstrate that hypothalamic astrocytes accumulate lipid droplets under saturated fatty -rich conditions, such as obese environment, and that the lipid-laden astrocytes increase astrogliosis markers and inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1) at the transcript and/or protein level. Medium conditioned by the lipid-laden astrocytes stimulate microglial chemotactic activity and upregulate transcripts of the microglia activation marker Iba-1 and inflammatory cytokines. These findings indicate that the lipid-laden astrocytes formed in free fatty -rich obese condition may participate in obesity-induced hypothalamic inflammation through promoting microglia migration and activation.© 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712280>NDP-MSH reduces oxidative damage induced by  in primary astrocytes.</a></h2><p>Recent findings relate obesity to inflammation in key hypothalamic areas for  control. Hypothalamic inflammation has also been related to oxidative stress.  (PA) is the most abundant free fatty  found in food, and in vitro studies indicate that it triggers a pro-inflammatory response in the brain. Melanocortins are neuropeptides with proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action mediated by melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), but little is known about the effect of melanocortins on oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether melanocortins could alleviate oxidative stress induced by a high fat diet (HFD) model. We found that NDP-MSH treatment decreased PA-induced reactive oxygen species production in astrocytes, an effect blocked by the MC4R inhibitor JKC363. NDP-MSH abolished nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by PA and blocked the inhibitory effect of PA on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione levels while it also per se increased activity of SOD and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (γ-GCL) antioxidant enzymes. However, HFD reduced hypothalamic MC4R and brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels, thereby preventing the neuroprotective mechanism induced by melanocortins.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28490059>Lipid classes and fatty acids composition of the roe of wild Silurus glanis from subalpine freshwater.</a></h2><p>The fat content and the fatty  composition of the roe of European catfish (Silurus glanis) wild specimens captured in the Lambro river basin (Como, Northern Italy) were investigated in order to assess their nutritional value.

Myeloid differentiation 2 (MD2), an important protein in innate immunity, is requisite for endotoxin lipopolysaccharide responsiveness. This study shows that  (PA) also bonds to MD2, initiating cardiac inflammatory injury. However, it is not clear whether MD2 plays a role in noninflammatory systems such as obesity- and FFA-related oxidative stress involved in vascular remodeling and injury. The aim of this study is to examine whether MD2 participates in reactive oxygen species increase and vascular remodeling.Male MD2 mice and wild-type littermates with a C57BL/6 background were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish obesity-induced vascular remodeling. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated with PA to induce oxidative stress and injury.In vivo, MD2 deficiency significantly reduced HFD-induced vascular oxidative stress, fibrosis, and remodeling, accompanied with AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation and nuclear factor erythroid (Nrf2) upregulation. In VSMCs and RAECs, inhibition of MD2 by neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MD2 or small interfering RNA knockdown significantly activated the AMPK/Nrf2-signaling pathway and reduced PA-induced oxidative stress and cell injury.It was demonstrated that the deletion or inhibition of MD2 protects against HFD/FFA-induced vascular oxidative stress and remodeling by activating the AMPK/Nrf2-signaling pathway.© 2017 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804206>Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase attenuates a high-fat diet-mediated renal injury by activating PAX2 and AMPK.</a></h2><p>A high-fat diet (HFD) causes obesity-associated morbidities involved in macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). AMPK, the mediator of macroautophage, has been reported to be inactivated in HFD-caused renal injury. However, PAX2, the mediator for CMA, has not been reported in HFD-caused renal injury. Here we report that HFD-caused renal injury involved the inactivation of Pax2 and Ampk, and the activation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), in a murine model. Specifically, mice fed on an HFD for 2, 4, and 8 wk showed time-dependent renal injury, the significant decrease in renal Pax2 and Ampk at both mRNA and protein levels, and a significant increase in renal sEH at mRNA, protein, and molecular levels. Also, administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea, significantly attenuated the HFD-caused renal injury, decreased renal sEH consistently at mRNA and protein levels, modified the renal levels of sEH-mediated epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) as expected, and increased renal Pax2 and Ampk at mRNA and/or protein levels. Furthermore,  (PA) treatment caused significant increase in , and decrease in both Pax2 and Ampk in murine renal mesangial cells (mRMCs) time- and dose-dependently. Also, 14(15)-EET (a major substrate of sEH), but not its sEH-mediated metabolite 14,15-DHET, significantly reversed PA-induced increase in , and PA-induced decrease in Pax2 and Ampk.

Ovariectomy (OVX) was performed on 6‑month‑old female rats treated with or without E2. Subsequently, various serum biochemical markers were measured. Additionally, pathological alterations of the uterus, liver and skeletal muscle were analyzed, and the content of triglycerides (TG) in muscle was detected. Differentiated myotubes formed by C2C12 cells were treated with  (PA) or pretreated with E2, estrogen receptor (ESR) 1 agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) and ESR2 agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN). Subsequently, the mRNA or protein expression levels of ESR1/2, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), CD36 molecule (CD36), fatty  synthase (FASN), perilipin 2 (PLIN2), phosphorylated acetyl‑CoA carboxylase α (p‑ACACA), p‑AKT serine/threonine kinase (p‑AKT) and p‑mitogen‑activated protein kinase 8 (p‑MAPK8) were analyzed in skeletal muscle or in C2C12 cells by reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The present results suggested that treatment with E2 inhibited OVX‑induced  gain, TG accumulation and insulin resistance. The protein or mRNA expression levels of ESR1, CD36, PPARα, p‑ACACA and p‑AKT were decreased, whereas the protein or mRNA expression levels of ESR2, PLIN2, FASN and p‑MAPK8 were increased in the OVX group.

However, the underlying mechanism of paeoniflorin in treating atherosclerosis is unclear. A rat model of high-fat diet-induced atherosclerosis and  (PA)-treated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used in this study. The serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined, and the results indicated that paeoniflorin remarkably lowered the levels of TC, TG and LDL-C induced by a high-fat diet. Histopathological results showed that paeoniflorin significantly improved the pathological changes in the aorta. In addition, paeoniflorin also maintained a normal  gain speed. Subsequently, the effects of paeoniflorin on the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were detected by qPCR and ELISA. The qPCR and ELISA results showed that paeoniflorin decreased the levels of these inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the expression of TLR4 and its downstream pathway molecules was measured by Western blot. The results indicated that paeoniflorin significantly reduced the expression of TLR4 and MyD88 as well as the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p65.

Since the levels of sphingolipid (SLs) in adipose tissue (AT) are altered during obesity we investigated the potential impact of SLs on ATMs. For this, we first analyzed expression of SL metabolizing genes in ATMs isolated from obese mice. A marked induction of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) expression was observed in obese ATM when compared to lean ATM. This induction was observed in both MGL-ve (M1) and MGL1+ve (M2) macrophages from obese WAT. Next, RAW264.7 cells were exposed to excessive palmitate, resulting in a similar induction of Sphk1. This Sphk1 induction was also observed when cells were treated with chloroquine, a lysosomotropic amine impacting lysosome function. Simultaneous incubation of RAW cells with palmitate and the Sphk1 inhibitor SK1-I promoted cell death, suggesting a protective role of Sphk1 during lipotoxic conditions. Interestingly, a reduction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related genes was detected in obese ATM and was found to be associated with elevated Sphk1 expression.

In the present study, the nutritional value and chemical composition of purslane plants in relation to plant part and harvesting stage were evaluated. Plants were harvested at three growth stages (29, 43 and 52 days after sowing (DAS)), while the edible aerial parts were separated into stems and leaves. Leaves contained higher amounts of macronutrients than stems, especially at 52 DAS. α-tocopherol was the main isoform, which increased at 52 DAS, as well total tocopherols (values were in the ranges of 197-327 μg/100 g fresh  (fw) and 302-481 μg/100 g fw, for α-tocopherol and total tocopherols, respectively). Glucose and fructose were the main free sugars in stems and leaves, respectively, whereas stems contained higher amounts of total sugars (values were ranged between 0.83 g and 1.28 g/100 g fw). Oxalic and total organic  content was higher in leaves, especially at the last harvesting stage (52 DAS; 8.6 g and 30.3 g/100 g fw for oxalic  and total organic acids, respectively). Regarding the fatty  content, stems contained mainly  (20.2-21.8%) and linoleic  (23.02-27.11%), while leaves were abundant in α-linolenic  (35.4-54.92%). Oleracein A and C were the major oleracein derivatives in leaves, regardless of the harvesting stage (values were in the ranges of 8.2-103.0 mg and 21.2-143 mg/100 g dried  (dw) for oleraceins A and C, respectively). Cytotoxicity assays showed no hepatotoxicity, with GI values being higher than 400 μg/mL for all the harvesting stages and plant parts. In conclusion, early harvesting and the separation of plant parts could increase the nutritional value of the final product through increasing the content of valuable compounds, such as omega-3 fatty acids, phenolic compounds and oleracein derivatives, while at the same time, the contents of anti-nutritional compounds such as oxalic  are reduced.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429609>Chemical evaluation of the Rhynchophorus ferrugineus larvae fed on different substrates as human food source.</a></h2><p>We investigated the chemical composition of the weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus larvae, traditionally used as human food in Asia and known worldwide as one of the most significant pest for palm trees. Total fat content and fatty  composition were analyzed using standard methodologies in (1) weevil larvae reared on apple fruit slices and wild specimens collected from attacked (2) Phoenix canariensis and (3) Syagrus romanzoffiana palm trees. Total fat content was extremely high in all the specimens (ranged between 57.62 and 60.03% based on dry ). Despite sharing the same prevalent fatty acids (myristic , , stearic , palmitoleic , oleic , α-linoleic , and α-linolenic ), fatty  composition of the wild weevil larvae significantly differed from that of the specimens raised on apple fruit, due to the presence of other minor compounds. In general, a good balance between unsaturated fatty acids (∼53.68% of total fatty acids) and saturated fatty acids (∼43.41% of total fatty acids) and a low cholesterol content (74.61-152.32 mg/kg based on dry matter) were detected in all the specimens. Conversely, the weevil larvae did not represent a good source of α-tocopherol (14.17-26.22 mg/kg based on dry matter).

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) induces cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in the context of obesity; however, its role in the metabolic consequences of obesity is not totally established. We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in the cardiac metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. In addition, we have explored whether this participation is, at least partially, acting on mitochondrial damage. Gal-3 inhibition in rats that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks with modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100 mg/kg/day) attenuated the increase in cardiac levels of total triglyceride (TG). MCP treatment also prevented the increase in cardiac protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA, mitofusin 1, and mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive oxygen species accumulation and decrease in those of complex V but did not affect the reduction in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake observed in HFD rats. The exposure of cardiac myoblasts (H9c2) to  increased the rate of respiration, mainly due to an increase in the proton leak, glycolysis, oxidative stress, β-oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Gal-3 activity was unable to affect these changes. Our findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibition attenuates some of the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity induced by a HFD since it reduced TG and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) levels.

Herein, we investigated the effects of METRNL on lipid-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Treatment with METRNL suppressed inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation, inhibitory κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and MCP-1). METRNL treatment also attenuated the impaired insulin response both in palmitate-treated differentiated C2C12 cells and the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, METRNL administration rescued glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced  gain in mice; however, METRNL did not affect calorie intake.

Based on US patent, the yield of bioactive compounds (such as gamma-linolenic  GLA, C18:3) extracted from microalgae biomass, mainly depends on the extraction processes (1). GLA has much attention in respect of its therapeutic properties such as its ability to decrease blood cholesterol levels.The impact of the addition of N in cultures of S. platensis in terms of growth, biomasses and induced lipid compounds (total carotenoids and total lipid contents and its fatty  profile) as well as the sonication (SON) and microwave (MIC) process as aiding techniques for lipid extraction compared with a cold condition (COL) were examined. GC/MS method was used to determine the fatty  profile of lipid extract of SP cultures.In all S. platensis tested culture, the SP was growing successfully, with varied degrees. In N-rich media, the highest cell growth rate and biomass yield were obtained compared with that recorded in other cultures. Under an N-limited condition, SP had a higher total carotenoids (TCAR, 45.54 mg/g dw) and total lipid contents (TL, 29.51%± 1.92 g/100g dw) compared with that recorded either in N-rich (11.2 mg/g dw) or in N-optimal (6.23 mg/g dw) cultures. Thus, SP copes with the N -stress by altering the metabolic pathways toward inducing lipid biosynthesis. To maximize the TL and TCAR extraction yields, from N-limited cultures, a set of operating process was applied including the sonication (SON) and microwave (MIC), which were used as aiding techniques for lipid extraction compared with the cold condition (COL) techniques. The results showed that the extraction efficiency of the S. platensis TL increased in the following order: MIC (29.51%± 1.92) > SON (25.46% ± 1.65> COL (20.43% ±1.43).

The predominant fatty acids (>10%, of total FA) were found to be myristic  (C14:0, MA),  (C16:0, PA) and oleic  (C18:1).The study concluded that N-limited condition was found to be a strong influence on biomass dry  and lipid contents and total carotenoids in SP cells compared to either N-rich or N-optimal conditions. The use of sonication and the microwave techniques lead to great increase in the extraction of lipid contents and in high amount polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in N-limited cultures, in particular the omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3 (ω3) of the essential C18 fatty acids. It seems that the SP rich in lipid content with a high amount of GLC produced under nitrogen limitation in PBR conditions can be used as a food additive or as a nutritional supplement.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471852>Optimisation, experimental validation and thermodynamic study of the sequential oil extraction and biodiesel production processes from seeds of Sterculia foetida.</a></h2><p>Non-edible seeds are not used in any commercial applications, which implies that they can be used for biofuel applications. The present study aimed to maximise the process conditions for oil extraction and sterculia biodiesel production from Sterculia foetida (poon oil). GC-MS identified the methyl esters of sterculia oil as sterculic  (32%),  (15.88%), oleic  (10.00%), linoleic  (9.95%) and malvalic  (9%). Response surface methodology (RSM) based parametric optimisation of oil extraction was carried out by choosing process variables such as sample , volume of solvent to seed ratio and time. The optimum sample amount of 7.5 g and the volume of solvent to seed ratio of 40 mL/g resulted in a maximum oil yield of 45.27% at 3 h. The results were statistically significant (P < 0.05) with a regression coefficient (R) of 0.9988. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in an R value greater than 0.9, which validates the RSM. Conventional optimisation of the temperature (55 °C), feedstock to methanol ratio (1:12), catalyst proportion (1.5%) and transesterification reaction time (60 min) yield 90.87% biodiesel production. The physicochemical characteristics of oil and biodiesel complied with the requirements of the ASTM standards. The rate constant and thermodynamic variables at the optimum temperature (333 K) were calculated from the experimental data. The activation energy (E), activation enthalpy in transition state theory (ΔH), activation entropy in transition state theory (ΔS) and Gibbs free energy in transition state theory (ΔG) were 37.91 kJ mol, 35.14 kJ mol, - 239.58 J mol K and 79.81 kJ mol respectively.

MiR-27a is highly expressed in sera of obese individuals with prediabetes and T2DM, and mainly derived by adipose tissues. Thus, miR-27a secreted into circulation by adipose tissue may regulate insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.  The association between miR-27a and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle was determined in obese children, high-fat diet-induced miR-27a knockdown obese mice, db/db mice and C2C12 cells overexpressing miR-27a. The crosstalk mediated by exosomal miR-27a between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle was determined in C2C12 cells incubated with conditioned medium prepared from palmitate-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  We showed that serum miR-27a level correlated positively with obesity and insulin resistance in obese children, and that elevated serum miR-27a levels correlated with insulin resistance in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, and with obesity and insulin resistance in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. MiR-27a released from adipocytes of high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice was associated with triglyceride accumulation. MiR-27a derived from these adipocytes induced insulin resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells through miR-27a-mediated repression of PPARγ and its downstream genes involved in the development of obesity.  These results identify a novel crosstalk signaling pathway between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in the development of insulin resistance, and indicate that adipose tissue-derived miR-27a may play a key role in the development of obesity-triggered insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483636>Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Response of  Seed Oil on Metabolism Disorder Induced by Excess Alcohol Consumption.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the modulatory effects of  seed oil (DISO), which was rich in palmitoleic  (55.25%),  (12.25%), and oleic  (28.74%), on alcohol-induced metabolism disorder in mice.

Recently, several studies have shown that mitophagy mediated by PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin may play a critical role in clearing the damaged mitochondria and maintaining the overall balance of intracellular mitochondria in quality and quantity. A previous study showed that PINK1 and Parkin were overexpressed in adipose tissue in obese subjects. However, it is still unclear whether a direct relationship exists between obesity and mitophagy. In this study, we created a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model and examined the expression of PINK1 and Parkin in adipose tissue using western blot and real-time quantitative PCR. After we confirmed that there is an interesting difference between regular-chow-fed mice and HFD-induced obese mice in the expression of PINK1 and Parkin in vivo, we further tested the expression of PINK1 and Parkin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in vitro by treating cells with  (PA) to induce metabolic stress. To better understand the role of PINK1 and Parkin in metabolic stress, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of PINK1 and Parkin followed by PA treatment. Our results showed that under lower concentrations of PA, PINK1 and Parkin can be activated and play a protective role in resisting the harmful effects of PA, including protecting the mitochondrial function and resisting cellular death, while under higher concentrations of PA, the expression of PINK1 and Parkin can be inhibited. These results suggest that PINK1-Parkin can protect mitochondrial function against metabolic stress induced by obesity or PA to a certain degree.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) is a mitochondrial enzyme with some promises in a number of cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of ALDH2 on cardiac remodeling and contractile property in high fat diet-induced obesity.Wild-type (WT) and ALDH2 transgenic mice were fed low (10% calorie from fat) or high (45% calorie from fat) fat diet for 5 months prior to the assessment of cardiac geometry and function using echocardiography, IonOptix system, Lectin, and Masson Trichrome staining. Western blot analysis was employed to evaluate autophagy, CaM kinase II, PGC-1α, histone H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H, and Sirt-1.Our data revealed that high fat diet intake promoted  gain, cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, p < 0.0001) and contractile dysfunction (reduced fractional shortening (p < 0.0001), cardiomyocyte function (p < 0.0001), and intracellular Ca handling (p = 0.0346)), mitochondrial injury (elevated O levels, suppressed PGC-1α, and enhanced PGC-1α acetylation, p < 0.0001), elevated SUV39H, suppressed Sirt1, autophagy and phosphorylation of AMPK and CaM kinase II, the effects of which were negated by ALDH2 (p ≤ 0.0162). In vitro incubation of the ALDH2 activator Alda-1 rescued against -induced changes in cardiomyocyte function, the effect of which was nullified by the Sirt-1 inhibitor nicotinamide and the CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 (p < 0.0001). The SUV39H inhibitor chaetocin mimicked Alda-1-induced protection again  (p < 0.0001). Examination in overweight human revealed an inverse correlation between diastolic cardiac function and ALDH2 gene mutation (p < 0.05).Taken together, these data suggest that ALDH2 serves as an indispensable factor against cardiac anomalies in diet-induced obesity through a mechanism related to autophagy regulation and facilitation of the SUV39H-Sirt1-dependent PGC-1α deacetylation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971573>Apigenin Ameliorates the Obesity-Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy by Attenuating Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Muscle of Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>It was investigated whether apigenin (AP) protected against skeletal muscle atrophy induced by obesity.Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks to induce obesity, and then were assigned to two groups; the HFD group received a high-fat diet, and the HFD+AP group received a 0.1% AP-containing HFD. After additional feeding of the experimental diet for 8 weeks, mice in the HFD group were highly obese compared with the mice in the standard diet fed mice group. The mice in the AP-treated group showed less fat pad accumulation and less inflammatory cytokines without  reduction. The  of skeletal muscle in the AP group tended to increase as compared with that of the HFD group. Furthermore, AP reduced the expression of atrophic genes, including MuRF1 and Atrogin-1, but increased the exercise capacity. The mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis were enhanced by AP. In cultured C2C12 cells, AP also suppressed -induced muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction.

In a completely randomised design involving six replicate pens of five chickens assigned to each of five treatments,  gain (BWG), feed intake (FI), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and carcass characteristics were measured in an experiment in which 150 28-day-old broilers were fed maize-based diets containing, respectively, 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% MSC at finisher phase. The results showed MSC to be remarkably high in CP (470.0 g/kg DM) and EE (343.5 g/kg DM), with moderate CF (58.2 g/kg DM), ash (54.3 g/kg DM), Ca (1.1 g/kg DM) and P (11.0 g/kg DM). Whilst very poor in lysine, MSC was found to be rich in methionine, cyst(e)ine, arginine and glutamic ; it also contains good levels of valine, glycine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, histidine, phenylalanine, serine, proline and alanine. Also, it contained 85.24% oleic (OA), 9.65%  and 5.11% stearic acids, with a high peroxide value and low levels of mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and T-2 toxin. BWG, FI and FCE of broiler chickens significantly decreased (P < 0.001) as the dietary level of MSC increased.

In this study, the effects of media and carbon sources on lipid and metabolite production were investigated by profiling fatty acids and intracellular metabolites of Y. lipolytica grown in various media. The highest total fatty  yield 114.04 ± 6.23 mg/g dry cell  was achieved by Y. lipolytica grown in minimal medium with glycerol (SCG) in the exponential phase. The high lipid production by Y. lipolytica in SCG was presumed to be due to the higher C/N ratio in SCG than in the complex media. Moreover, glycerol promoted lipid production better than glucose in both complex and minimal media because glycerol can easily incorporate into the core of triglycerides. Metabolite profiling revealed that levels of long-chain fatty acids, such as stearic , , and arachidic , increased in SCG medium. Meanwhile, in complex media supplemented with either glucose or glycerol, levels of amino acids, such as cysteine, methionine, and glycine, highly increased. This metabolomic approach could be applied to modulate the global metabolic network of Y. lipolytica for producing lipids and other valuable products.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

PAHSA levels are reduced in serum and adipose tissue of insulin-resistant people and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Here, we investigated whether chronic PAHSA treatment enhances insulin sensitivity and which receptors mediate PAHSA effects. Chronic PAHSA administration in chow- and HFD-fed mice raises serum and tissue PAHSA levels ∼1.4- to 3-fold. This improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance without altering . PAHSA administration in chow-fed, but not HFD-fed, mice augments insulin and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion. PAHSAs are selective agonists for GPR40, increasing Ca flux, but not intracellular cyclic AMP. Blocking GPR40 reverses improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in PAHSA-treated chow- and HFD-fed mice and directly inhibits PAHSA augmentation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets. In contrast, GLP-1 receptor blockade in PAHSA-treated chow-fed mice reduces PAHSA effects on glucose tolerance, but not on insulin sensitivity.

Thirty-two Nellore bull male were distributed in a completely randomized design and fed diets with condensed tannin extract as follows: 0, 10, 30, and 50 g/kg total DM basis. The physicochemical composition of the meat, lipid oxidation, fatty  profile, flavor, tenderness, and overall acceptance were evaluated. There was a linear decrease (P ≤ 0.05) on lipid content, tenderness, cooking  loss, myristic, , and oleic acids in meat as tannin increased in the diets. The total saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, the atherogenicity index decreased. However, a linear increase (P ≤ 0.05) was observed for linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids. The physicochemical characteristic of the meat, such as moisture, ash, and protein contents, water retention capacity, final pH, Warner-Bratzler shear force, collagen, and color indexes (lightness, redness, yellowness, and chrome) did not change with dietary tannin. Also, CLA, n-6:n-3 ratio, Δ -desaturase, and elongase activity were not different among diets. In conclusion, condensed tannin linearly increases unsaturated fatty acids and decreases the atherogenicity index of meat; thus, it can be recommended at the highest level (50 g/kg DM) in the diet of Nellore steers.Agriculture byproducts plays an important part in the diet of ruminant animals and consequently on food chain and has implications for the composition and quality of the livestock products (milk, meat, and eggs) that people consume. Feeding tannin to steers increases the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and meat tenderness, with a concomitant reduction on saturated fatty acids and the atherogenicity index in meat. Thus, we recommend adding tannin to steer diets to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in red meat for human consumption.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649558>Obesity Mediates Apoptosis and Extracellular Matrix Metabolic Imbalances via MAPK Pathway Activation in Intervertebral Disk Degeneration.</a></h2><p>Obesity may promote intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) by non-mechanical means, by influencing levels of free fatty acids which could impair cell metabolism. This study aims to establish metabolic factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading.

Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk metabolism and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (, PA) to gauge its effects on cell metabolism and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway.

Metabolic phenotypes including tissue , glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, fatty  profile, oxygen consumption, physical activity were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Pex11a fed with a high-fat diet. Molecular changes and peroxisome abundance in adipose tissue were evaluated through qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence. Pex11a showed increased fat mass, decreased skeletal muscle, higher cholesterol levels, and more severely impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Pex11a consumed less oxygen, indicating a decrease in fatty  oxidation, which is consistent with the accumulation of very long- and long-chain fatty acids. Adipose  (C16:0) levels were elevated in Pex11a , which may be because of dramatically increased fatty  synthase mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Pex11a deficiency increased ventricle size and macrophage infiltration, which are related to the reduced physical activity. These data demonstrate that Pex11a deficiency impairs physical activity and energy expenditure, decreases fatty  β-oxidation, increases de novo lipogenesis and results in dyslipidaemia and obesity.© 2018 The Authors.

As the number of experimentally identified S-palmitoylated peptides increases, it is imperative to investigate substrate motifs to facilitate the study of protein S-palmitoylation. Based on 710 non-homologous S-palmitoylation sites obtained from published databases and the literature, we carried out a bioinformatics investigation of S-palmitoylation sites based on amino  composition. Two Sample Logo indicates that positively charged and polar amino acids surrounding S-palmitoylated sites may be associated with the substrate site specificity of protein S-palmitoylation. Additionally, maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) was applied to explore the motif signatures of S-palmitoylation sites by categorizing a large-scale dataset into subgroups with statistically significant conservation of amino acids. Single features such as amino  composition (AAC), amino  pair composition (AAPC), position specific scoring matrix (PSSM), position  matrix (PWM), amino  substitution matrix (BLOSUM62), and accessible surface area (ASA) were considered, along with the effectiveness of incorporating MDD-identified substrate motifs into a two-layered prediction model. Evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that a hybrid of AAC and PSSM performs best at discriminating between S-palmitoylation and non-S-palmitoylation sites, according to the support vector machine (SVM). The two-layered SVM model integrating MDD-identified substrate motifs performed well, with a sensitivity of 0.79, specificity of 0.80, accuracy of 0.80, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) value of 0.45. Using an independent testing dataset (613 S-palmitoylated and 5412 non-S-palmitoylated sites) obtained from the literature, we demonstrated that the two-layered SVM model could outperform other prediction tools, yielding a balanced sensitivity and specificity of 0.690 and 0.694, respectively.

Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic inflammation, lipid peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced lipid accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose.

The degree of cardiac atrophy after HT(x) was determined on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after HT(x) in recipients of either healthy or failing hearts. HT(x) of healthy hearts resulted in 23+/-3, 46+/-3, 48+/-4 and 46+/-4 % HW loss at the four time-points. HT(x) of the failing heart resulted in even greater HW losses, of 46+/-4, 58+/-3, 66+/-2 and 68+/-4 %, respectively (P<0.05). Activation of "fetal gene cardiac program" (e.g. beta myosin heavy chain gene expression) and "genes reflecting cardiac remodeling" (e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression) after HT(x) was greater in failing than in healthy hearts (P<0.05 each time). Exposure to isocaloric high sugar diet caused significant increases in fatty  concentrations in healthy and in failing hearts.

The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased  (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased energy partitioning toward  reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased energy partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased energy partitioned to  reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased energy output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased energy storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Low molecular  fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds, has shown strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which has not been explored in diabetes-induced NAFLD. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether LMWF protects obese diabetic db/db mice against NAFLD. Results showed LMWF administration decreased plasma level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, as well as alleviated hepatic accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol in db/db mice. LMWF also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress by suppressing superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, and increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the liver of db/db mice. Furthermore, LMWF down-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor, and up-regulated the anti-inflammatory adiponectin. These changes were accompanied by the activation of hepatic SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling with LMWF treatment. In addition, blocking SIRT1 or AMPK by inhibitor notably abolished LMWF-elicited protection against -induced oxidative stress and inflammation in hepatocytes. These results suggest LMWF prevents NAFLD in db/db mice by activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway, which prevents lipotoxicity-related oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, LMWF provides a potential supplementary treatment for obesity/diabetes-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A canola (Brassica napus var. Monty) crop was established in a small-scale agricultural farm and harvested 148 days after sowing. Four levels of molasses were tested with respect to the fresh  (1.5 kg); these were 1% (CS-1), 2% (CS-2), 3% (CS-3) and 4% (CS-4) molasses, and 0% molasses (CS-0) was included as a control. A total of 45 microsilages were prepared using PVC pipes (4 in. of diameter × 20 cm of length), and the forage was compressed using a manual press. The effects of control and treatments were tested using the general linear model Y = μ + T + E. The linolenic  (C18:3n3),  (C16:0) and linoleic  methyl ester (C18:2n6c) accounted for 30%, 21% and 10.5% of total fatty acids, respectively; the fermentation parameters and in vitro methane production were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments; in vitro digestibility decreased significantly (P < 0.05) as the level of molasses increased. It was concluded that CS-4 improved the DM content by 9% and showed high content of linolenic  methyl ester.

Food habit changes, such as the quality of fatty acids in the diet, are proposed to treat and prevent these disorders. Some studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in , a SFA, is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters. On the other hand, a high intake of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids may promote positive effects, especially on triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are effective at limiting the hepatic steatosis process through a series of biochemical events, such as reducing the markers of non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, increasing the gene expression of lipid metabolism, decreasing lipogenic activity, and releasing adiponectin. This current review shows that the consumption of unsaturated fatty acids, MUFA, and PUFA, and especially EPA and DHA, which can be applied as food supplements, may promote effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as on metabolic inflammation, gut microbiota, and hepatic metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365872>Saturated Fatty  Increases Lung Macrophages and Augments House Dust Mite-Induced Airway Inflammation in Mice Fed with High-Fat Diet.</a></h2><p>Obesity is one of the phenotypes of severe asthma, which is considered to be a heterogeneous syndrome; however, its interaction with airway inflammation is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of saturated fatty acids in augmenting airway inflammation induced by house dust mite (HDM) in obesity. Subjects were Balb/c mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks, followed by sensitization and exposure to HDM. Subjects were also administered  (PA) for 4 weeks with concurrent sensitization and exposure to HDM. Airway inflammation was assessed by quantifying the amount of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and airway resistance was measured. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages were stimulated by PA. The amount of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) was examined in the supernatant. Compared to normal chow mice, HFD mice underwent significant increases in ; increases in number of lung macrophages, including circulating monocytes and alveolar macrophages; and increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) total cell count, including neutrophils but not eosinophils, after HDM sensitization and exposure. In vitro, PA induced MCP-1 and augmented LPS-primed production of IL-1β and TNF-α in macrophages. Among HDM mice that were administered PA, there was an increase BALF total cell count, including neutrophils but not eosinophils, compared to vehicle mice.

This study aims at identifying islet-related biological events potentially linked with the observed insulin hypersecretion and later secretory decline in these obese children and adolescents using the islet model. We analyzed protein expression data obtained from human islets exposed to elevated palmitate levels for 2 and 7 days by an improved methodology for statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins. Protein profiling of islet samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 115 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Several DEPs including sorcin were associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets after 2 days of exposure to palmitate. Similarly, several metabolic pathways including altered protein degradation, increased autophagy, altered redox condition, and hampered insulin processing were coupled to the functional impairment of islets after 7 days of culture in the presence of palmitate. Such biological events, once validated in the islets, may give rise to novel treatment strategies aiming at normalizing insulin levels in obese children with high palmitate levels, which may reduce or even prevent obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909920>Lipopolysaccharide and  synergistically induced MCP-1 production via MAPK-meditated TLR4 signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity increases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Clinical studies suggest that risk factors like  (PA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exist simultaneously in diabetes with obesity. Combination of PA and LPS even at low concentration can induce strong inflammatory reaction. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is an important inflammatory chemokine related to insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Our previous study using PCR array revealed that LPS and PA synergistically induce MCP-1 mRNA expression in macrophage cells RAW264.7, while the protein expression of MCP-1 in this case was not investigated. Moreover, the underling mechanism in the synergistic effect of MCP-1 expression or production induced by treatment of LPS and PA combination remains unclear.Protein secretion of MCP-1 was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mRNA levels of MCP-1 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were measured by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software.LPS could increase MCP-1 transcription as well as secretion in RAW264.7, and PA amplified this effect obviously. Meanwhile, combination of LPS with PA increased TLR4 mRNA expression while LPS alone or PA alone could not, TLR4 knockdown inhibited MCP-1 transcription/secretion induced by LPS plus PA. Moreover, not NF-κB inhibitor but inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 MAPK were found to block MCP-1 generation stimulated by LPS plus PA.LPS and PA synergistically induced MCP-1 secretion in RAW264.7 macrophage cells, in which MCP-1 transcription mediated by MAPK/TLR4 signaling pathways was involved. Combined treatment of PA and LPS in RAW264.7 cells mimics the situation of diabetes with obesity that has higher level of PA and LPS, MAPK/TLR4/ MCP-1 might be potential therapeutic targets for diabetes with obesity.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637873>Antarctic thraustochytrids: Producers of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Thraustochytrids have been isolated from different aquatic systems; however, few studies have reported their occurrence in Antarctica. In this study, 13 strains close to strains belonging to the genera Oblongichytrium, Thraustochytrium, and Aurantiochytrium were isolated from seawater samples collected near the Antarctic Base Professor Julio Escudero (S 62°12'57' E 58°57'35″). Docosahexaenoic  (DHA) was found in the total lipids of all the isolates; DHA content of the biomass (dry ) varied between 3.3 and 33 mg/g under the growth conditions for isolation. Five of the Antarctic thraustochytrids were able to accumulate lipids at levels higher than 20% w/w. Two strains, RT2316-7 and RT2316-13, were selected to test the effect of the incubation temperature (at 5°C for 14 days and at 15°C for 5 days). Incubation temperature had little effect on the lipid content and biomass yield; however, its effect on the fatty  composition was significant (p < .05). The low incubation temperature favored the accumulation of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA),  and stearic  in the total lipids of RT2316-7. Percentage of EPA, DHA and the omega-6 fatty  dihomo-γ-linolenic  of total fatty acids of RT2316-13 was higher at the low incubation temperature. RT2316-13 accumulated the highest lipid content (30.0 ± 0.5%) with a carbon to nitrogen mass ratio equal to 16.9. On the contrary, lipid accumulation in RT2316-7 occurred at high concentration of the nitrogen sources (monosodium glutamate or yeast extract). The capability to accumulate lipids with a fatty  profile that can be tuned through cultivation temperature make the Antarctic thraustochytrid RT2316-13 a candidate for the production of lipids with different uses.© 2019 The Authors.

A total of 720 broilers (Ross 308; average BW [] 541±5.7 g) were randomly allotted to six treatments. Birds were fed three different feed forms (mash; SP, simple pellet; EP, expanded pellet) and DDGS (0 or 200 g kg) in a 3×2 factorial arrangement. The addition of DDGS and EP to the diet resulted in increased shear force of breast meat. Moreover, DDGS inclusion in the diet reduced the concentration of stearic  and behenic  in thigh meat. Pelleting (SP and EP) of the diets increased  content in the thigh, whereas the linolenic  content decreased. The breast mass was higher with EP and SP diets than with the mash diet.

Recently, silymarin has shown protective effects on renal tissue injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential capacity of silymarin to prevent renal injury during obesity induced by high fat diet (HFD) in mice. In vivo, male C57BL/6 mice received HFD (60% of total calories) for 12 weeks, randomized and treated orally with vehicle saline or silymarin (30mg/kg /d) for 4 weeks. In vitro, human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were exposed to 300μM  (PA) for 36h followed by silymarin administration at different concentrations. The administration of silymarin significantly ameliorated HFD induced glucose metabolic disorders, oxidative stress and pathological alterations in the kidney. Silymarin significantly mitigated renal lipid accumulation, fatty  β-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis in HFD mice and PA treated HK2 cells. Furthermore, silymarin partly restored mitochondrial membrane potential of HK2 cells after PA exposure. In conclusion, silymarin can improve oxidative stress and preserve mitochondrial dysfunction in the kidney, potentially via preventing accumulation of renal lipids and fatty  β-oxidation.Copyright © 2017.

Male mice were subjected to moderate intensity exercise training on a treadmill. Cardiomyocytes of untrained and trained mice were isolated, treated for 30 min with palmitate and intracellular calcium transient and action potential duration were recorded. Additionally, we assessed reactive oxygen species generation. Treatment of cardiomyocytes from untrained mice with palmitate induced a significant decrease in Ca transient magnitude by 34%. Exercise training did not change cardiomyocyte Ca dynamics in the control group. However, trained cardiomyocytes were protected from deleterious effects of palmitate. Action potential duration was not altered by palmitate in either untrained or trained cardiomyocytes. Moreover, palmitate treatment increased reactive oxygen species generation in both untrained and trained cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, the levels of reactive oxygen species in trained cardiomyocytes treated with palmitate were still 27% lower than those seen at basal conditions in untrained cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings indicate that exercise training protects cardiomyocytes from deleterious effects of palmitate possibly by inhibiting exacerbated ROS production.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30806233>Nutritive Value of Desert Truffles Species of Genera Terfezia and Picoa (Ascomycetes) from Arid and Semiarid Regions of Eastern Turkey.</a></h2><p>Terfezia and Picoa species contained 63-94 kcal energy, 76.93-83.81 g moisture, 0.78-1.52 g ash, 2.19-4.69 g protein, 2.14-9.48 g carbohydrate, 2.54-11.23 g dietary fiber, and 0.96-3.40 g fat per 100 g wet .

It has been reported that the injection of hemin improves lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in various genetic models. However, the effect of hemin supplementation in food on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity is still unclear, and whether hemin directly affects cellular insulin sensitivity is yet to be elucidated. Here we show that hemin enhances insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptors, Akt, Gsk3β, FoxO1 and cytoplasmic translocation of FoxO1 in cultured primary hepatocytes under insulin-resistant conditions. Furthermore, hemin diminishes the accumulation of triglyceride and increases in free fatty  content in primary hepatocytes induced by palmitate. Oral administration of hemin decreases , energy intake, blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and improves insulin and glucose tolerance as well as hepatic insulin signaling and hepatic steatosis in male mice fed a high-fat diet. In addition, hemin treatment decreases the mRNA and protein levels of some hepatic genes involved in lipogenic regulation, fatty  synthesis and storage, and increases the mRNA level and enzyme activity of CPT1 involved in fatty  oxidation. These data demonstrate that hemin can improve lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in both cultured hepatocytes and mice fed a high-fat diet, and show the potential beneficial effects of hemin from food on lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879815>Milk production and nutrient digestibility responses to triglyceride or fatty  supplements enriched in .</a></h2><p>The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of feeding triglyceride and fatty  (FA) supplements enriched in  (PA; C16:0) on production and nutrient digestibility responses of mid-lactation dairy cows. Fifteen Holstein cows (137 ± 49 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a control diet (CON; no added PA) or 1.5% FA added as either a FA supplement (PA-FA) or a triglyceride supplement (PA-TG). The PA supplements replaced soyhulls, and diets were balanced for glycerol content. Periods were 21 d in length with sample and data collection occurring during the final 5 d. Compared with CON, PA treatments increased dry matter (66.5 vs. 63.9%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) apparent digestibility (42.0 vs. 38.2%). Although PA treatments tended to increase 18-carbon FA apparent digestibility (79.1 vs. 77.9%), PA treatments decreased 16-carbon (63.1 vs. 75.8%) and total FA (72.0 vs. 76.5%) apparent digestibilities compared with CON. The PA treatments increased milk fat content (3.60 vs. 3.41%), milk fat yield (1.70 vs. 1.60 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (570 vs. 471 g/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk (47.6 vs. 46.5 kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (47.4 vs. 46.6 kg/d) compared with CON. The PA treatments did not affect dry matter intake (28.5 vs. 29.2 kg/d), milk yield (47.0 vs. 47.4 kg/d), milk protein yield (1.42 vs. 1.45 kg/d), milk lactose yield (2.29 vs. 2.31 kg/d), yield of <16-carbon milk FA (360 vs. 370 g/d), yield of >16-carbon milk FA (642 vs. 630 g/d),  (720 vs. 723 kg), or  condition score (3.14 vs. 3.23). We did not observe differences in digestibilities of dry matter, NDF, and 18-carbon FA between PA-TG and PA-FA. In contrast, PA-FA increased 16-carbon (68.6 vs. 57.6%) and total FA apparent digestibility (73.8 vs. 70.1%) compared with PA-TG. This resulted in PA-FA supplementation increasing the apparent digestibility of the PA supplement by ∼10 percentage points compared with PA-TG. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased 16-carbon FA intake by 60 g/d, absorbed 16-carbon FA by 86 g/d, and absorbed total FA by 85 g/d. Compared with PA-TG, PA-FA increased dry matter intake (29.1 vs. 27.8 kg/d), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (596 vs. 545 g/d), and tended to increase milk yield (47.6 vs. 46.4 kg/d), milk fat yield (1.70 vs. 1.66 kg/d), and 3.5% fat-corrected milk (48.1 vs. 47.2 kg/d). In conclusion, the production response of dairy cows to PA tended to be greater for a FA supplement compared with a triglyceride supplement.

Metformin, an antidiabetes drug, has antiproliferative effects being proposed for cancer treatment. However, under intense proliferative stimulation conditions such as those found in obesity, its efficacy is still uncertain. Thus, we analyzed the effects of saturated fatty  and/or insulin under high concentrations, with or without metformin, on the proliferation and migration of prostate cells.Human prostate epithelial cell lines non-tumor (PNT1A) and tumor (PC3) were treated with control media (DMEM, C), palmitate (100 µM, HF), and/or insulin (50 µU, HI) with or without metformin (100 µM) for 24 or 48 h.Both PNT1A and PC3 cells had greater proliferation when treated with HF, while HI treatment stimulated only PNT1A. Metformin inhibited cell proliferation caused by HF in both cell lines, but it did not block the proliferative action of HI in PNT1A cells. PNT1A increased cell migration after all treatments, while only HF influenced PC3; metformin inhibited the migration stimulated by all obese microenvironments. Both HF and HI treatments in PNT1A and HF treatment in PC3 augmented vimentin expression, resulting in a higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition (which, in turn, could influence cell migration). Metformin inhibited vimentin expression in both normal and tumor cells. Although HF treatment had increased AMPK activation, it also increased the levels of activated ERK1/2, which could be responsible for high cell proliferation in both cell lines. In contrast, HI decreased AMPK activation in both cell lines, whereas it increased ERK1/2 levels in PNT1A and decreased them in PC3 (reflecting greater cell proliferation only in non-tumor cells). Metformin maintained high activation of AMPK and decreased ERK1/2 levels after HF in both cell lines and only after HI in PNT1A, which was able to decrease the cell proliferation triggered by these treatments.Higher concentrations of palmitate on PC3 cells and palmitate and insulin on PNT1A cells stimulate cellular activities that could favor cancer progression. Metformin inhibited most of these stimuli, showing the efficacy of this drug for cancer adjuvant therapy in obese patients (a group at increased risk for the development of prostrate cancer).© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28341047>Short communication: Effects of prill size of a -enriched fat supplement on the yield of milk and milk components, and nutrient digestibility of dairy cows.</a></h2><p>The objective of our experiment was to evaluate the effects of prill size of a -enriched fatty  supplement (PA; 85% C16:0) on feed intake, nutrient digestibility, and production responses of dairy cows.

Phthalate has been considered an obesogen and contributing to overweight and obesity in children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in urine metabolites in response to the environmental phthalate exposure among overweight or obese children, and to investigate the metabolic mechanisms involved in the obesogenic effect of phthalate on children at puberty.Within the national Puberty Timing and Health Effects in Chinese Children (PTHEC) study, 69 overweight/obese children and 80 normal  children were selected into the current study according to their puberty timing and WGOC (The Working Group for obesity in China) references. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate monoesters (MMP, MEP, MnBP, MEHP, MEOHP and MEHHP) were measured using API 2000 electrospray triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESIMS/MS). Metabolomic profiling of spot urine was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differentially expressed urinary metabolites associated with phthalate monoesters exposure were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and multiple linear regression models. In addition, the candidate metabolites were regressed to obesity indices with multiple linear regression models and logistic regression models in all subjects.Compared with normal  children, higher levels of MnBP were detected in urinary samples of children with overweight and obesity. After adjusting for confounders including chronological age, gender, puberty onset, daily energy intake and physical activity and socio-economic level, positive association remained between urinary MnBP concentration and childhood overweight/obesity [OR = 1.586, 95% CI:1.043,2.412]. We observed elevated MnBP concentration was significantly correlated with increased levels of monostearin, 1-monopalmitin, stearic , itaconic , glycerol 3-phosphate, 5-methoxytryptamine, kyotorphin, 1-methylhydantoin, d-alanyl-d-alanine, pyrrole-2-carboxylic , 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylglycol, and butyraldehyde. Meanwhile, increased MnBP concentration was also significantly correlated with decreased levels of lactate, glucose 6-phosphate, d-fructose 6-phosphate, , 4-acetamidobutyric , l-glutamic , n-acetyl-l-phenylalanine, iminodiacetic , hydroxyproline, pipecolinic , l-ornithine, n-acetyl-l-glutamic , guanosine, cytosin, and (s)-mandelic  in the normal  subjects. The observations indicated that MnBP exposure was related to global urine metabolic abnormalities characterized by disrupting arginine and proline metabolism and increasing oxidative stress and fatty  reesterification. Among the metabolic markers related to MnBP exposure, 1-methylhydantoin, pyrrole-2-carboxylic  and monostearin were found to be positively correlated with obesity indices, while hydroxyproline, l-ornithine, and lactate were negatively associated with overweight/obesity in children.Our results suggested that the disrupted arginine and proline metabolism associated with phthalate exposure might contribute to the development of overweight and obesity in school-age children, providing insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms involved in childhood obesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the complete molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, zebrafish were fed a long-term high-fat diet to induce type 2 diabetes, which resulted in a higher ,  mass index, more lipid vacuoles in liver, increased insulin transcription level in liver, brain and muscle, and high fasting blood glucose in the high-fat diet zebrafish. Oppositely, the transcription levels of insulin substrate-2 and glucose transporter 2 were significantly decreased, indicating insulin signaling pathway and glucose transport impaired in the insulin-targeting tissues. Transcription of the autophagy-related genes, ATG3, ATG4B, ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, and FOXO3, were decreased but autophagy inhibitor gene m-TOR increased, and autophagy-flux was inhibited in liver of the high-fat diet zebrafish. Main of these changes were confirmed in -treated HepG2 cells. Further, in co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular co-localization experiments, the conjunction of preproinsulin with cargo-recognition protein p62 increased, but conjuncts of autophagosome with p62-cargo, lysosomes with p62-cargo, and autolysosomes decreased apparently. Interestingly, lysosomes, autolysosomes and conjuncts of p62-insulin localized at the periphery of -treated cells, the margination of lysosomes may mediate deactivation of proteases activity. These findings suggest that intracellular high-lipid may trigger defective autophagy, defective downstream signaling of insulin and accumulated intracellular preproinsulin, leading to dysregulation of cell homeostasis mechanism, which may be one of reasons involved in insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565391>Superhydrophobic Polypropylene Functionalized with Nanoparticles for Efficient Fast Static and Dynamic Separation of Spilled Oil from Water.</a></h2><p>Frequent oil spills not only threaten the ecosystem, but they are also a waste of a valuable source of energy. There is an urgent need to develop materials that can readily remove spilled oil from water bodies and also have the capacity to collect it for energy applications. Herein, a superhydrophobic fiber of functionalized polypropylene is engineered with the help of  interaction with incorporated copper oxide nanoparticles. The successful development of functionalized polypropylene is confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The scanning electron microscopy images reveal that the surface roughness of the polypropylene is enhanced after functionalization. The optimized functionalized polypropylene displays an ultrahydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 162.42°. The functionalized polyprolyene displays good absorption capacity. It has the capacity to take 30 to 40 times its own  in oils and nonpolar organic solvents, which makes it useful for small spills. With a flux of 11 204 Lm h, functionalized polypropylene is as an ideal material for the dynamic separation of oil spills from water. It also has excellent selectivity towards oil, water rejection, and oil absorption capacity.© 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Its widespread use has provoked an intense debate about whether it is a potential danger to human health. In a careful review of the scientific literature, we focused on nutritional characteristics and health effects of the use of palm oil with regards to children, seeking to determine whether there is evidence that justifies fears about the health effects of palm oil. Our review showed that palm oil represents a significant source of saturated fatty acids, to which scientific evidence attributes negative health effects when used in excess, especially with regards to cardiovascular diseases. However, to date, there is no evidence about the harmful effects of palm oil on the health of children. Nevertheless, palm oil has possible ill health effects linked to its composition of fatty acids: its consumption is not correlated to risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in young people with a normal  and cholesterol level; the elderly and patients with dyslipidaemia or previous cardiovascular events or hypertension are at a greater risk. Therefore, the matter is not palm oil itself but the fatty--rich food group to which it belongs. The most important thing is to consume no more than 10% of saturated fatty acids, regardless of their origin and regardless of one's age. Correct information based on a careful analysis of the scientific evidence, rather than a focus on a singular presumed culprit substance, should encourage better lifestyles.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717326>Phytochemical Analysis and Potential Biological Activities of Essential Oil from Rice Leaf.</a></h2><p>Although many investigations on phytochemicals in rice plant parts and root exudates have been conducted, information on the chemical profile of essential oil (EO) and potent biological activities has been limited. In this study, chemical compositions of rice leaf EO and in vitro biological activities were investigated. From 1.5 kg of fresh rice leaves, an amount of 20 mg EO was obtained by distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), electrospray ionization (ESI), and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) to reveal the presence of twelve volatile constituents, of which methyl ricinoleate (27.86%) was the principal compound, followed by  (17.34%), and linolenic  (11.16%), while 2-pentadecanone was the least (2.13%). Two phytoalexin momilactones A and B were first time identified in EO using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-MS) (9.80 and 4.93 ng/g fresh , respectively), which accounted for 7.35% and 3.70% of the EO, respectively. The assays of DPPH (IC = 73.1 µg/mL), ABTS (IC = 198.3 µg/mL), FRAP (IC = 700.8 µg/mL) and β-carotene oxidation (LPI = 79%) revealed that EO possessed an excellent antioxidant activity. The xanthine oxidase assay indicated that the anti-hyperuricemia potential was in a moderate level (IC = 526 µg/mL) as compared with the standard allopurinol. The EO exerted potent inhibition on growth of , and two noxious weeds , and , but in contrast, the growth of rice seedlings was promoted. Among the examined plants, the growth of the  root was the most inhibited, proposing that constituents found in EO may have potential for the control of the problematic paddy weed . It was found that the EO of rice leaves contained rich phytochemicals, which were potent in antioxidants and gout treatment, as well as weed management. Findings of this study highlighted the potential value of rice leaves, which may provide extra benefits for rice farmers.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28869040>The impact of obesity in the cardiac lipidome and its consequences in the cardiac damage observed in obese rats.</a></h2><p>To explore the impact of obesity on the cardiac lipid profile in rats with diet-induced obesity, as well as to evaluate whether or not the specific changes in lipid species are associated with cardiac fibrosis.Male Wistar rats were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD, 35% fat) or standard diet (3.5% fat) for 6 weeks. Cardiac lipids were analyzed using by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.HFD rats showed cardiac fibrosis and enhanced levels of cardiac superoxide anion (O), HOMA index, adiposity, and plasma leptin, as well as a reduction in those of cardiac glucose transporter (GLUT 4), compared with control animals. Cardiac lipid profile analysis showed a significant increase in triglycerides, especially those enriched with , stearic, and arachidonic . An increase in levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) was also observed. No changes in cardiac levels of diacyl phosphatidylcholine, or even a reduction in total levels of diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine, diacyl phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelins (SM) was observed in HFD, as compared with control animals. After adjustment for other variables (oxidative stress, HOMA, cardiac hypertrophy), total levels of DAG were independent predictors of cardiac fibrosis while the levels of total SM were independent predictors of the cardiac levels of GLUT 4.These data suggest that obesity has a significant impact on cardiac lipid composition, although it does not modulate the different species in a similar manner. Nonetheless, these changes are likely to participate in the cardiac damage in the context of obesity, since total DAG levels can facilitate the development of cardiac fibrosis, and SM levels predict GLUT4 levels.Copyright © 2017 Sociedad Española de Arteriosclerosis.

In addition, changes in the total phospholipid fatty  content and cold tolerance of non-diapausing and diapausing pupae were examined. The critical daylength for diapause induction were 12.43 h at 20°C and lower temperatures that can induce in 50% of population. Moreover, the composition of total phospholipid fatty acids in the pupae revealed seven major fatty acids in both non-diapausing and diapausing pupae: oleic (26-32%),  (21-29%), linoleic (18-21%), palmitoleic (4-10%), stearic (9%), linolenic (7-8%), and pentadecanoic acids (3-5%) with an increase in proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in diapause state. In contrast to increase of oleic  (C18:1) from 26 to 32% in non-diapausing to diapausing pupae, a decrement trend from 29 to 21% in  (C16:0) was observed at the same state. Additionally, supercooling point was observed to be significantly lower in diapausing (-22.6°C) than in non-diapausing pupae (-18.5°C) and the fresh  of diapausing pupae was found to be significantly higher than non-diapausing ones. The significance of these findings would allow us a better understanding of interrelationship between diapause and cold tolerance.© The Authors 2017.

In this work, a selective process using carbon feast-famine cycles was applied to obtain an indigenous microbial community of hydrocarbon-degrading and lipid-accumulating bacteria, using a real lubricant-based wastewater as carbon source. In the conditions applied, the enriched bacterial community, dominated by members of the genus Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, was able to degrade almost all hydrocarbons present in the wastewater within 24 h' incubation and to accumulate, although in low levels, triacylglycerol (TAG) (<5% of cell dry  (CDW)) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.8% ± 1.1% of the CDW) as well as an unknown lipid (29% ± 6% of CDW), presumably a wax ester-like compound. The influence of culture conditions, namely carbon and nitrogen concentrations (and C/N ratio) and cultivation time, on the amount and profile of produced storage compounds was further assessed using a statistical approach based on a central composite circumscribed design and surface response methodology. The regression analysis of the experimental design revealed that only nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio are significant for neutral lipid biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Maximum neutral lipid content, i.e. 33% (CDW basis), was achieved for the lowest carbon and nitrogen concentrations evaluated (10 g COD L and 0.02 g N L). PHA accounted for less than 5% of CDW. In these conditions, neutral lipid content was mainly composed by TAG, about 70% (w/w). TAG precursors, namely monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and fatty acids (FA), accounted for 22% of total neutral lipids and WE for about 7%. Nevertheless, according to the applied response surface model, further improvement of neutral lipids content is still possible if even lower nitrogen concentrations are used. The fatty acids detected in TAG extracts ranged from myristic  (C14:0) to linoleic  (C18:2), being the most abundant  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0) and oleic  (C18:1). This study shows the feasibility of combining treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated wastewater, herein demonstrated for lubricant-based wastewater, with the production of bacterial neutral lipids using open mixed bacterial communities. This approach can decrease the costs associated to both processes and contribute to a more sustainable waste management and production of lipid-based biofuels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

During the dry season, pasture scarcity leads animals to lose up to 40% of their , a condition known as Seasonal  Loss (SWL) that is one of the major constraints in ruminant production. Breeds with high tolerance to SWL are relevant to understand the physiological responses to pasture scarcity so they could be used in programs for animal breeding. In the Canary Islands there are two dairy goat breeds with different levels of tolerance to SWL: the Palmera, susceptible to SWL; and the Majorera, tolerant to SWL. Fat is one of the milk components most affected by environmental and physiological conditions. This study hypothesises that feed-restriction affects Majorera and Palmera breeds differently, leading to different fatty  profiles in the mammary gland and milk. An interaction between breed and feed-restriction was observed in the mammary gland. Feed-restriction was associated with an increase in oleic  and a decrease in  percentage in the Palmera breed whereas no differences were observed in the Majorera breed.  and oleic acids together constituted around 60% of the total fatty acids identified, which suggests that Palmera breed is more susceptible to SWL. In milk, feed-restriction affected both breeds similarly. Regarding the interaction of the breed with the treatment, we also observed similar responses in both breeds, but this influence affects only around 2% of the total fatty acids. In general, Majorera breed is more tolerant to feed-restriction.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30215261>LC-MS/MS bioanalysis of plasma 1, 14-tetradecanedioic  and 1, 16-hexadecanedioic  as candidate biomarkers for organic anion-transporting polypeptide mediated drug-drug interactions.</a></h2><p>A robust LC-MS/MS assay was developed to quantify endogenous 1, 14-tetradecanedioic  (TDA) and 1, 16-hexadecanedioic  (HDA) in human plasma as potential biomarkers for evaluating drug-drug interactions mediated by the hepatic drug transporters, organic anion-transporting polypeptides.This assay was validated using fit-for-purpose approach over standard curve range of 2.5-1000 nM for TDA and HDA using analyte-free charcoal-stripped human plasma as the surrogate matrix.

We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-linolenic , 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes.

The present study intended to reveal the effect and mechanism of AA on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with lipid accumulation by activating Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and liver X receptors (LXRs) signaling. C57BL/6 mice were received a modified Lieber-DeCarli diet with 71% high-fat (L-D) and treated with AA (20 and 40 mg/kg) or equal volume of saline for 12 weeks. The regulation of AA on lipid accumulation was also detected in pro-steatotic stimulated AML12 cells with  (PA). When L-D diet-fed mice were treated with AA, loss in , liver index, and liver lipid droplet were observed along with reduced triglyceride (TG) and serum transaminase. Furthermore, AA decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and target genes expression, regulated PPARα and PPARγ expressions, ameliorated hepatic fibrosis markers, enhanced hepatic FXR and LXR, and regulated AMPK-LKB1 and SIRT1 signaling pathway. Moreover, AA attenuated lipid accumulation via FXR and LXR activation in steatotic AML-12 cells, which was confirmed by guggulsterones (FXR antagonist) or GW3965 (LXR agonist). Activation of FXR and LXR signaling caused by AA might increase AMPK-SIRT1 signaling and then contribute to modulating lipid accumulation and fatty  synthesis, which suggested that activated FXR-LXR axis by AA represented an effective strategy for relieving NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, PEA does not possess the ability to prevent free radicals formation. Polydatin (PLD), a biological precursor of resveratrol, has antioxidant activity. A combination of PEA and PLD could, conceivably, have beneficial effects on oxidative stress produced by inflammatory processes. In the present study we investigated the effects of a co-micronized composite containing PEA and PLD (m(PEA/PLD)) in a model of testosterone-induced benign hyperplasia (BPH). BPH was provoked in rats by daily administration of testosterone propionate (3mg/kg) for 14days. This protocol leads to alterations in prostate morphology and increased levels of prostaglandin E2 and dihydrotestosterone as well as of 5α-reductase 1 and 5α-reductase 2 expression. Moreover, testosterone induced marked inflammation in terms of an increase in nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 and consequently in IκB-α degradation as well as disregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and manganese superoxide dismutase expression and in the apoptosis pathway. Our results show, for the first time, that m(PEA/PLD) is capable of decreasing prostate  and dihydrotestosterone production in BPH-induced rats. These effects were most likely correlated to the anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects of m(PEA/PLD).

It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty  profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty  methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, , stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic  significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the oleic  and vaccenic  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic  levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis-vaccenic  concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty  profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789928>Effects of fundamental nutrient stresses on the lipid accumulation profiles in two diatom species Thalassiosira weissflogii and Chaetoceros muelleri.</a></h2><p>Microalgae are considered as attractive feedstocks for biofuel production nowadays because of their high lipid contents and easy cultivation.

Fertility is regulated by hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone, encoded by the Gnrh1 gene. Because obesity promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, we sought to determine how tunicamycin-induced ER stress affected Gnrh1 gene expression in the mouse hypothalamic cell line GT1-7. Tunicamycin repressed expression of Gnrh1 in a PKC- and JNK-dependent manner, while upregulating expression of a known Gnrh1 repressor, Fos. Obesity is associated with increased circulating free fatty acids, and exposure to palmitate promoted ER stress and inflammation. Fos expression increased with palmitate dose, but Gnrh1 expression was upregulated with low-dose palmitate and repressed with high-dose palmitate. Using a small molecule inhibitor, we determined that AP-1 was required for Gnrh1 repression by high-dose palmitate or tunicamycin-induced ER stress. These findings suggest that hypogonadism driven by decreased hypothalamic GnRH may be a component of obesity-related infertility.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new Thraustochytrid Schizochytrium sp. from the west coastal area of Korea. This newly isolated Thraustochytrid, identified as Schizochytrium sp. through 18S rRNA analysis and named SH104, simultaneously produces high levels of DHA and carotenoid-based antioxidant pigments. An improved Schizochytrium mutant, named SHG104, was obtained from the original host strain by γ-irradiation-induced mutagenesis. Under combined temperature-shift cultivation conditions employing white-light LEDs (light-emitting diodes), Schizochytrium sp. SHG104 yielded 10.8 g L of biomass comprising 45.8% total lipids (32.1% DHA) and 4.6 mg L of astaxanthin. In addition to DHA, the main fatty acids produced by Schizochytrium sp. SHG104 were  and a trace of other long-chain fatty acids. The carotenoid profile of SH104 and SHG104 was β-carotene, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, pheonicoxanthin and echinenone, which analyzed by HPLC and LC/APCI-MS. Furthermore, genomic analysis of Schizochytrium and Aurantiochytrium microalgae confirmed that the presence of carotenogenesis pathway enzymes and genes including geranylgeranyl diphosphate, phytoene synthase, lycopene cyclase, and cytochrome P450 hydroxylase that necessary for the production of antioxidants via a complete biosynthetic KEGG synthesis pathway. This newly isolated Schizochytrium microalga potentially have wide application as a source of antioxidants for astaxanthin-containing pigments, commercial omega-3 lipids and feed additives, such as nutritional supplements for aquaculture.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208557>Demonstration of bioprocess factors optimization for enhanced mono-rhamnolipid production by a marine Pseudomonas guguanensis.</a></h2><p>We identified that Pseudomonas guguanensis produced macromolecular mono-rhamnolipid (1264.52 Da) upon sensing n-hexadecane/diesel/kerosene from its surroundings. Permutation experiments were done to improve the laboratory-scale mono-rhamnolipid production (ie, a three-fold increase) using RSM validation. Consequently, maximal mono-rhamnolipids production [40-50 mg/L] and emulsification abilities [65-70%] were encountered on day 8 using vegetable oil, peptone + yeast extract. EI values for the rhamnolipids were found to be 78±1.75% at 12.5 mg/ mL. Production and secretion of rhamnolipids were accompanied by aggregation of cells at day 6 as pictured in SEM. Pure monorhamnolipids of P. guguanensis was found to lower the surface tension of water to 32.98±0.3 mN/m than the crude and CFSs of P. aeruginosa indicating efficient activity. Utilization and subsequent removal of hexadecane was 77.2% and the breakdown products were fatty acids [decanoic, hexadecanoic, octadecanoic acids and methyl stearates] as signified in Head-space GC-MS. The breakdown products of hexadecane are also present in the synthesized rhamnolipids suggesting their biosynthetic role. Rapid degradation of hexadecane, diesel and kerosene by this emulsifier combined with non-pathogenic trait of P. guguanensis identifies this organism as a viable option to remove n-alkanes from aquatic environments.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo- and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma lipid classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar metabolism (stearic :  C-SA; :  C-PA; oleic :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a  mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a  mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma lipid classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to test HMRLignan™, a purified form of 7-HMR, and the corresponding Picea abies extract (total extract P. abies; TEP) as dietary supplements on a background of a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome in mice and in the 3T3-L1 adipogenesis model. Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg  7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg  TEP by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in  (-11 and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65 %). Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11 % cholesterol, -23 % LDL and -15 % TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan preparations, as shown by a more than 70 % decrease in insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The expression of several metabolic genes was modulated by the HFD with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In 3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) showed a 40 % inhibition of cell differentiation accompanied by the inhibited expression of the adipogenic genes PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 % reduction in TAG uptake in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells. In conclusion, 7-HMR and TEP reduce metabolic imbalances typical of the metabolic syndrome and obesity in male mice, whereas their metabolites inhibit adipogenesis and lipid uptake in vitro.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759573>Alternation of plasma fatty acids composition and desaturase activities in children with liver steatosis.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate changes in plasma fatty acids proportions and estimated desaturase activities for variable grading of liver steatosis in children.In total, 111 schoolchildren (aged 8-18 years) were included in the analysis from March 2015 to August 2016. Anthropometric evaluation, liver ultrasound examination and scoring for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD score = 0-6), and biochemical and plasma fatty acids analysis were performed. We compared the composition ratio of fatty acids between children with high-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 4-6), low-grade liver steatosis (NAFLD score = 1-3), and healthy controls (NAFLD score = 0). In addition, correlation coefficients (r) between NAFLD score, metabolic variables, and estimated activity of desaturase indices (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1), delta-5 and delta-6 desaturase) were calculated.Compared with healthy controls, children with liver steatosis showed a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (21.16 ± 2.81% vs. 19.68 ± 2.71%, p = 0.024). In addition, children with high- grade liver steatosis exhibited higher proportions of  (C16:0), palmitoleic  (C16:1n-7), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), adrenic  (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic  (C22:5n-6); and lower proportions of eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3) (P< 0.05). In all subjects, the NAFLD score was positively correlated with  mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (r = 0.696), homeostasis model of assessment ratio-index (HOMA-IR) (r = 0.510), SCD1(16) (r = 0.273), and the delta-6 index (r = 0.494); and inversely associated with the delta-5 index (r = -0.443).Our current data suggested that children with liver steatosis was highly associated with obesity, and insulin resistance.

The experiment lasted 230 d, with 1 to 120 d in milk (DIM) for indoor feeding (P1), 120 to 200 DIM for mountain grazing (P2), and 200 to 230 DIM for indoor feeding (P3). Grass silage was fed according to appetite during indoor feeding periods. After an adjustment period (1-60 DIM) when the control diet was given to the goats, the animals were subdivided into 3 groups of 10 goats. Treatments (60-230 DIM) were (1) basal concentrate (control; no added fat); (2) control concentrate with 8% (added on air-dry basis) hydrogenated palm oil enriched with  (POFA); and (3) control concentrate with 8% (added on air-dry basis) rapeseed oil (RSO). Individual energy balances based on energy intake and milk production were estimated on 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 200, and 230 DIM. At the same times,  (BW),  condition score (BCS),  mass index, and  tissue stores using computed tomography were monitored. Silage intake was depressed by POFA throughout the experimental period. Reduced BW and  mass index were observed in the POFA and RSO groups, whereas no effect on BCS or  composition was observed throughout lactation. Generally, a minor decrease in BW was observed from 10 to 120 DIM (only 0.6 kg on average) and the total amount of  lipid was reduced by 4.4 kg. During the mountain grazing period, a further reduction in  lipid stores (2.7 kg) was observed, and BW was reduced by 3.9 kg in the same period. The goats mobilized, on average, 72% of their fat reserves during the first 200 DIM. In this period, dietary fat supplementation did not reduce the mobilization of adipose tissue but resulted in greater milk fat yield (2 kg more, on average, compared with the control group). Milk yield was not affected by POFA or RSO supplementation. Milk fat content was higher in the POFA group than in the control and RSO groups. Milk protein and lactose contents were not affected by lipid supplements. In late lactation, a rapid accumulation of fat deposits followed the intense mobilization during the grazing period. Dietary lipid supplements had no effect on milk fat yield at this stage. Milk production depends heavily on the ability to mobilize  lipid stores, and neither POFA nor RSO supplements at rates used in our study affected this mobilization.Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

We hypothesized that increasing PUFA intake in mice would increase peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARδ) expression and activity, and we sought to examine the effect of different PUFA-enriched oils on muscle PPARδ expression. One of the oils we tested was cottonseed oil (CSO) which is primarily linoleic  (53%) and  (24%). Mice fed a CSO-enriched diet (50% energy from fat) displayed no change in muscle PPARδ expression; however, in the liver, it was consistently elevated along with its transcriptional coactivator Pgc-1. Male mice were fed chow or CSO-, saturated fat (SFA)-, or linoleic  (18:2)-enriched diets that were matched for macronutrient content for 4 weeks. There were no differences in food intake, , fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, or energy expenditure between chow- and CSO-fed mice, whereas SFA-fed mice had increased fat mass and 18:2-fed mice were less glucose tolerant. Metabolomic analyses revealed that the livers of CSO-fed mice closely matched those of chow-fed but significantly differed from SFA- and 18:2-enriched groups. Fatty  composition of the diets and livers revealed an impairment in desaturase activity and the presence of dihydrosterculic  (DHSA) in the CSO-fed mice. The effect of DHSA on PPARδ and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 expression mimicked that of the CSO-fed mice. Taken together, these data suggest that DHSA from CSO may be an effective means to increase PPARδ expression with concomitant suppression of liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are scant data regarding the relationships of the visceral fat area (VFA) with the plasma fatty  profiles and desaturase activities following  loss. We investigated the effect of  loss with mild calorie restriction on the circulating fatty  profiles and desaturase activities in nondiabetic overweight subjects with high VFA.Eighty overweight subjects with high VFA (L4 VFA ≥100 cm) were randomized into the 12-week mild-calorie-restriction (300 kcal/day) or control groups.Comparison of the percent of  changes between groups revealed that the -loss group had greater reductions in . The VFA decreased by 17.7 cm from baseline in the -loss group (P < 0.001). At follow-up, the -loss group showed greater reductions in serum triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR than the control group. Significantly greater reductions in total saturated fatty acids, , stearic , total monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , eicosadienoic , and dihomo-γ-linolenic  levels were detected in the -loss group compared with the control group after adjusting for baseline values. Following  loss, C16 Δ9-desaturase activity was significantly decreased and Δ5-desaturase activity was significantly increased, and the changes were greater in the -loss group than in the control group.The results suggest that mild  loss improves abdominal obesity, overall fatty  profiles, and desaturase activities; therefore, mild calorie restriction has potential health benefits related to obesity-related diseases in overweight subjects with high VFA..

Studies have demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation, including regulating the expression of inflammatory factors. The purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the role of mTOR in obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial inflammation. In the clinical study, obese and healthy subjects were recruited for physical examination, as well as the collection of blood and urine samples. Further study was performed on a high fat diet (HFD)‑induced obese rat model and a cultured human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK‑2). The clinical study demonstrated that the participants with obesity had increased serum lipids, creatinine (Cr), urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) and urinary neutrophil gelatinase‑associated lipocalin (u‑NGAL). Moreover, the level of urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 (u‑MCP‑1) was increased in the participants with obesity, and it was positively correlated with free fatty  (FFA), UACR and u‑NGAL. In the in vivo study, the results indicated that the levels of serum lipids, Cr and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as 24 h urine protein and u‑NGAL, were signiﬁcantly increased in the HFD‑fed obese rats. In addition, the infiltration of CD68+ cells into the renal interstitial area and the release of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) was observed in the kidneys of obese rats. Meanwhile, the supernatant from HK‑2 cells treated with  stimulated THP‑1 monocyte migration. The upregulation of MCP‑1, phosphorylated forkhead boxO1 (p‑FOXO1), and phosphorylated mTOR (p‑mTOR) was observed in vivo and in vitro. However, inhibition of mTOR was able to alleviate the above effects. Overall, these results demonstrated that activated mTOR induced FOXO1 phosphorylation, which mediates renal MCP‑1 release, causes tubulointerstitial inflammation and ultimately leads to pathological renal changes and dysfunction. However, inhibition of mTOR may play a renoprotective role during the progression of obesity‑associated tubulointerstitial inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252854>Human milk enriched with human milk lyophilisate for feeding very low birth  preterm infants: A preclinical experimental study focusing on fatty  profile.</a></h2><p>Human milk, with essential nutrients and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) such as the omega 3 and 6 fatty acids is important for development of the central nervous system and the retina in very low birth  infants (<1,500 g).

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) accepts cellular free cholesterol and phospholipids transported by ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 to generate nascent high density lipoprotein particles. Previous studies have revealed that the overexpression of apoA-I alleviated hepatic lipid levels by modifying lipid transport. Here, we examined the effects of apoA-I overexpression on ER stress and genes involved in lipogenesis in both HepG2 cells and mouse hepatocytes.Human apoA-I was overexpressed in HepG2 hepatocytes, which were then treated with 2 μg/mL tunicamycin or 500 μM . Eight-week-old male apoA-I transgenic or C57BL/6 wild-type mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg/kg  tunicamycin or with saline. At 48 h after injecting, blood and liver samples were collected.The overexpression of apoA-I in the models above resulted in decreased protein levels of ER stress makers and lipogenic gene products, including sterol regulatory element binding protein 1, fatty  synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1. In addition, the cellular levels of triglycerides and free cholesterol also decreased. Some of gene products which are related to ER stress-associated apoptosis were also affected by apoA-I overexpression.

In the current study, in vitro and in vivo the metabolic effects of two of these FAHFAs, namely -5- (or -9) -hydroxy-stearic  (5- or 9-PAHSA, respectively) were profiled. In DIO mice fed with differentially composed low- or high-fat diets, acute and subchronic treatment with 5-PAHSA and 9-PAHSA alone, or in combination, did not significantly improve the deranged metabolic status. Neither racemic 5- or 9-PAHSA, nor the enantiomers were able to: (1) increase basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vitro, (2) stimulate GLP-1 release from GLUTag cells, or (3) induce GSIS in rat, mouse, or human islets or in a human pancreatic β cell line. Therefore, our data do not support the further development of PAHSAs or their derivatives for the control of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The main environmental factor data in six ecological area in Guizhou province were collected, and the correlation analysis with yield and quality traits of 15 perilla strains was conducted. The results showed that the cultivation environment has significant effects on the yield and quality traits of perilla. The effect of environment on main yield composed traits, contained grain number in top spike, effective panicle number per plant, plant height, top spike length, growth period, and thousand seed  was degressive. In the different environmental factors, the latitude showed positive correlation with yield, growth period and effective panicle number per plant, and negative correlation with top spike length and grain number in top spike. Elevation showed negative correlation with the growth period of perilla. The perilla yield increased at first and then decreased with altitude rising, with the maximum in the 800 m altitude. The 600-900 m altitude is suitable area for perilla. Except for positive correlation with the plant height, and negative correlation with top spike length, the longitude showed in apparent impact on other traits. Sunshine duration, temperature and rainfall accumulation showed different effect on the different perilla strains. For yield composed traits, the sunshine duration was negatively correlation with the plant length. The accumulated temperature and mean temperature showed negative correlation with the main spike length, the rainfall showed negative correlation with the precipitation and growth period, plant height, ear number. The environmental impact on the oil compounds decreased with oleic , stearic , linoleic , -linolenic ,  and oil content. Correlation analysis showed that the significantly negative correlation between the oil content and  and linoleic  content, and the positive correlation between linolenic  content, -linolenic  content showed significant negative correlation with other fatty acids composition, and , stearic , oleic , linoleic  showed significant positive correlation with each other. The influence of different environmental factors on the quality of perilla were as follows: the oil content was positively associated with elevation and sunshine duration. -Linolenic  content showed negative correlation with longitude, latitude, accumulated temperature and mean temperature, but positive correlation with altitude, sunlight and rainfall capacity. The correlation between , stearic , oleic , linoleic  and environmental factors showed contrast character of -linolenic .

Subjects with hyperlipidemia (n=22) and age-matched healthy controls (n=19) were included in this study. Results showed that plasma levels of Gla-Gas6 protein and VK were significantly lower in hyperlipidemic subjects compared to control. Moreover, Gla-Gas6 levels were significantly and positively correlated with VK (P=.034, r=0.452) and negatively with triglyceride (P=.022, r=-0.485) and total cholesterol (P=.043, r=-0.435) in hyperlipidemic subjects, which suggest that VK supplementation may have a positive effect in activating Gas6 protein and thereby reducing the aberrant plasma lipid levels. Further studies with high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animal model of hyperlipidemia demonstrated that VK supplementation (5 μg/kg , 8 weeks) reduced the plasma lipid levels, stimulated both the plasma levels and the hepatic protein expression of Gla-Gas6 protein, and regulated the AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα signaling pathways of hepatic lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, by using  (PA, 0.75 mM)-treated both control and GGCX knockdown hepatocytes, this study dissected the direct role of Gla-Gas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on preventing the PA-induced impaired hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα pathways. Combining all, the present study demonstrated the beneficial effect of VK supplementation in preventing the impaired lipid homeostasis via activating VK-dependent Gas6 protein.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have shown that dysregulated lipid homeostasis caused by increased lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) in the obese state is a trigger of inflammatory responses. We investigated the role of M2 macrophages in lipotoxicity-induced inflammation.We used microarray experiments to profile macrophage gene expression regulated by two M2 inducers, interleukin-4 (Il-4), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta/gamma (Pparδ/Pparγ) agonists. Functional validation studies were performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages and mice deprived of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 gene (Stat6; downstream effector of Il-4) or Pparδ/Pparγ genes (downstream effectors of Stat6).  (PA) and β-adrenergic agonist were employed to induce macrophage lipid loading in vitro and in vivo, respectively.Profiling of genes regulated by Il-4 or Pparδ/Pparγ agonists reveals that alternative activation promotes the cell survival program, while inhibiting that of inflammation-related cell death. Deletion of Stat6 or Pparδ/Pparγ increases the susceptibility of macrophages to PA-induced cell death. NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome activation by PA in the presence of lipopolysaccharide is also increased in Stat6 macrophages and to a lesser extent, in Pparδ/γ macrophages. In concert, β-adrenergic agonist-induced lipolysis results in higher levels of cell death and inflammatory markers in ATMs derived from myeloid-specific Pparδ/γ or Stat6 mice.Our data suggest that ATM cell death is closely linked to metabolic inflammation. Within WAT where concentrations of free fatty acids fluctuate, M2 polarization regulated by the Stat6-Ppar axis enhances ATM's tolerance to lipid-mediated stress, thereby maintaining the homeostatic state.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

In the present study, the concentrations of phenolics, triterpenic acids, carotenoids and vitamins, as well as fatty  profiles and antioxidant activity, were analyzed in the edible portion of black table olives (Olea europea L.) from Italian (Cellina di Nardò and Leccino) and Greek (Kalamàta and Conservolea) cultivars fermented with selected autochthonous starters and in the corresponding monovarietal olive oils.On a fresh  basis, Cellina di Nardò and Leccino table olives showed the highest total phenolic content. No significant differences were found with respect to the levels of total triterpenic (maslinic and oleanolic) acids and vitamin E among cultivars. All table olives were characterized by high amounts of oleic, linoleic and  acids.

Data from epidemiological and in vitro studies suggest that orange juice (OJ) may have a positive impact on lipid metabolism. However, the effect of orange juice intake on blood lipid profile is still poorly understood. We have used two different blood samples, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and plasma, to assess the effect of two-week orange juice consumption in healthy volunteers by a mass-spectrometry based metabolomics approach.

Metabolic insults arising from obesity promote inflammation, which in turn impedes insulin signalling and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Key cells in the process are metabolically activated macrophages, which up-regulate both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways in response to lipid spillover from adipocytes. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are regulators of cellular homeostasis that influence both inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Dietary fats, such as saturated fatty acids (SFAs), can differentially modulate metabolic inflammation. , in particular, is a well-characterized nutrient that promotes metabolic inflammation via the NLRP3 (the nod-like receptor containing a pyrin domain) inflammasome, which is partly attributable to AMPK inhibition. Conversely, some unsaturated fatty acids are less potent agonists of metabolic inflammation. For example, monounsaturated fatty  does not reduce AMPK as potently as SFA and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids actively resolve inflammation via resolvins and protectins. Nevertheless, the full extent to which nutritional state modulates metabolic inflammation requires greater clarification.© 2017 The Author(s); published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158183>Serine prevented high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress by activating AMPK and epigenetically modulating the expression of glutathione synthesis-related genes.</a></h2><p>Serine deficiency has been observed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Whether serine supplementation has any beneficial effects on the prevention of NAFLD remains unknown. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of serine supplementation on hepatic oxidative stress and steatosis and its related mechanisms. Forty male C57BL/6J mice (9week-old) were randomly assigned into four groups (n=10) and fed: i) a low-fat diet; ii) a low-fat diet supplemented with 1% (wt:vol) serine; iii) a high-fat (HF) diet; and iv) a HF diet supplemented with 1% serine, respectively.  (PA)-treated primary hepatocytes separated from adult mice were also used to study the effects of serine on oxidative stress. The results showed that serine supplementation increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and protected mice from hepatic lipid accumulation, but did not significantly decreased HF diet-induced  gain. In addition, serine supplementation protected glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system and prevented hypermethylation in the promoters of glutathione synthesis-related genes, while decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mice fed a HF diet. Moreover, we found that serine supplementation increased phosphorylation and S-glutathionylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α subunit (AMPKα), and decreased ROS, malondialdehyde and triglyceride contents in PA-treated primary hepatocytes. However, while AMPK activity or GSH synthesis was inhibited, the abovementioned effects of serine on PA-treated primary hepatocytes were not observed. Our results suggest that serine supplementation could prevent HF diet-induced oxidative stress and steatosis by epigenetically modulating the expression of glutathione synthesis-related genes and through AMPK activation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human relaxin-2 (25 or 75 μg/kg/day) or vehicle for 4 weeks. In HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 decreased systemic insulin resistance and reduced , epididymal fat mass and serum leptin and insulin concentrations. In livers of HFD-fed mice, relaxin-2 attenuated steatosis and increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1, Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and activated genes that regulate fatty  oxidation and suppressed acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Relaxin-2 had no direct anti-steatotic effect on primary mouse hepatocytes, but S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine attenuated -induced steatosis and activated genes regulating fatty  oxidation in hepatocytes.

Although the exact molecular pathway leading to impaired insulin signaling has not been definitively established, ceramides are suspected mediators of lipid induced hepatic insulin resistance. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the serum ceramides concentration in obese children with NAFLD.The prospective study included 80 obese children (aged 7-17 years, median 12 years) admitted to our Department to diagnose initially suspected liver disease. Patients with viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV, CMV), autoimmune (AIH), toxic and metabolic (Wilson's disease, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency) liver diseases and celiac disease were excluded. NAFLD was diagnosed based on pediatric diagnostic criteria in obese children with liver steatosis in ultrasound (US) as well as elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) serum activity after exclusion of other major liver diseases listed before. Ultrasonography was used as a screening method and for qualitative assessment of the steatosis degree (graded according to Saverymuttu scale). Advanced steatosis was defined as a score > 1. The total intrahepatic lipid content (TILC) was assessed by magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy (HMRS) which is the most accurate technique for assessment of ectopic fat accumulation. Fasting serum concentration of ceramides was measured in 62 children.NAFLD was diagnosed in 31 children. Significant, positive correlation was found between total serum concentration of ceramides and insulin (r = 0.3, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Total ceramide concentration as well as specific fatty -ceramides (FA-ceramides) concentrations, namely: myristic, , palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, behenic and lignoceric were significantly higher (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, p = 0.007, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, p = 0.008, p = 0.003, p = 0.006, respectively) in children with NAFLD compared to controls (n = 14). Moreover, children with NAFLD had significantly higher activity of ALT (p < 0.001) and GGT (p < 0.001), HOMA-IR (p = 0.04), BMI (p = 0.046), waist circumference (p = 0.01) steatosis grade in ultrasound (p < 0.001) and TILC in HMRS (p < 0.001) compared to children without NAFLD. We did not find significant differences in total and FA-ceramide species concentrations between children with mild (grade 1) and advanced liver steatosis in ultrasonography (grade 2-3).Elevated ceramide concentrations in obese patients together with their significant correlation with insulin resistance parameters suggest their association with molecular pathways involved in insulin signaling impairment known to be strongly linked to pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28540997>A Combination of Short and Simple Surfactant Protein B and C Analogues as a New Synthetic Surfactant: In Vitro and Animal Experiments.</a></h2><p>Pulmonary surfactants for preterm infants contain mostly animal-derived surfactant proteins (SPs), which are essential for lowering surface tension.

It also acts as a potent antioxidant and regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, although the exact action mechanism is not clear. The α2-HS-glycoprotein gene (AHSG) and its protein, fetuin-A (FETUA), are one of the hepatokines and are known to be associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin improves hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in a FETUA-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells treated with 300 μmol/L of , phosphorylated AKT expression decreased, and FETUA expression increased, but this effect was inhibited by treatment with 10 μmol/L of melatonin. However, melatonin did not improve insulin resistance in FETUA-overexpressing cells, indicating that improvement in insulin resistance by melatonin was dependent on downregulation of FETUA. Moreover, melatonin decreased -induced ER stress markers, CHOP, Bip, ATF-6, XBP-1, ATF-4, and PERK. In addition, in the high-fat diet (HFD) mice, oral treatment with 100 mg/kg/day melatonin for 10 weeks reduced  gain to one-third of that of the HFD group and hepatic steatosis. Insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance improved with the upregulation of muscle p-AKT protein expression.

We also observed the development of low-grade inflammation characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of metabolic disorders, such as overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of metabolic alterations. Rabbits fed with FAED can be used as a model of NAFLD in non-obese and obese groups, especially at early stages of the disease.Copyright © 2019.

The present study investigates aortic vasoreactivity in high fat diet (HFD) induced insulin resistant iNOS KO mice. WT and iNOS KO mice were fed with 45% HFD/10% LFD for ten weeks. Systemic IR was assessed via measurement of circulating lipids, glucose, and insulin; while phenylephrine (PE)/acetylcholine (ACh) induced responses were monitored in the isolated aortic rings. To understand the mechanism, qPCR or Western blotting experiments were performed in aorta and Ea.hy926 cells. After 10 weeks of HFD feeding, significant increase in the /fat mass, augmented circulating lipids, glucose, insulin and inflammatory cytokines along with impaired acetylcholine induced aortic vasorelaxation and enhanced iNOS expression was observed in the aortic tissue of WT mice. In the aminoguanidine (AG, 20 mg/kg for 4 weeks) treated WT mice and also in iNOS KO mice, acetylcholine induced vasorelaxation was significantly preserved. Further, acetylcholine mediated vasorelaxation correlated with increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 residue in the iNOS KO mice and same was also observed in the iNOS silenced Ea.hy926 cells. Moreover, treatment of Ea.hy926 cells with  or TNFα also caused a significant decrease in eNOS activity, which was reversed in iNOS silenced Ea.hy926 cells suggesting the role of iNOS in the reduction of eNOS activity. The study thus implies a critical role of iNOS in vascular diseases associated with dyslipidemia/IR.Copyright © 2019.

This is due to several reasons but mainly to their ability to feed on blood and generate a huge amount of eggs. Lipid transport in arthropods is achieved by highly specialized hemolymphatic lipoproteins, which resemble those described in vertebrate blood. Such lipoproteins continuously deliver lipids through the blood to growing eggs. The injection of radioactive [H]  into tick hemocoel showed that the gut, ovary, fat  and Gene's organ were the main organs of incorporation of this labeled fatty . The rate of [H]  incorporation by the organs was high up to 30 min after injection. The [H]  incorporated by these organs was later found in phospholipids and neutral lipids. Here, we describe the purification and characterization of a key player of lipid dynamics in tick hemolymph. The Rhipicephalus microplus lipid-apolipoprotein complex (RmLCP) is a new high-density lipoprotein (1.18 g/mL), which accounts for over 90% of [H]  present in the hemolymph. It has a native molecular  of 420 kDa and is composed of one subunit of 122 kDa. Protein identification analysis of RmLPC subunit showed two better hits: vitellogenin 2 (23% protein coverage) and vitellogenin 5 (29% protein coverage), respectively and similarities with hemolymphatic apolipoproteins of arachnids such as the tick Ixodes scapularis (80%), the mite Galendromus occidentalis (44%) and the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum (43%) and also for the insects Locusta migratoria (45%), Drosophila melanogaster (42%) and Manduca sexta (47%) to vitellogenin 2 and tick Ixodes scapularis (83%), the crab Limulus polyphemus (55%) and the oyster Crassostrea gigas (55%) to vitellogenin 5. Furthermore, it shows a distinct lipid composition from most arthropod lipoproteins, being composed of 40% free cholesterol, 27% phospholipids, 20% triacylglycerol and 15% hydrocarbons. In addition to binding most hemolymphatic fatty acids, this lipoprotein also binds and transports free cholesterol. In conclusion, the present study provides insight into the macromolecules involved in arachnid metabolism, which have significant potential for future use for the biological control of ticks.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The effect of interesterified fats containing  or stearic acids on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling pathways in adipose and hepatic tissues was evaluated. Male LDLr-KO mice were fed a high-fat diet containing polyunsaturated (PUFA),  (PALM),  interesterified (PALM INTER), stearic (STEAR), or stearic interesterified (STEAR INTER) fats for 16 weeks. The expression of genes and protein levels involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes in liver and white adipose tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and by Western blot, respectively. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in hepatic and adipose tissues was determined by eosin and hematoxylin, while liver collagen content was determined by Sirius Red staining. Both interesterified fats increased liver collagen content and JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, the STEAR INTER group developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with higher neutrophil infiltration. PALM INTER induced adipose tissue expansion and enlargement of adipocytes. Furthermore, PALM INTER triggered increased IKK phosphorylation and TNFα protein content, conditions associated with the upstream activation of the NFkB signaling pathway. STEAR INTER induced NASH, while PALM INTER triggered hepatic fibrosis and adipocyte hypertrophy with inflammatory response in LDLr-KO mice.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31093907>Activity-Structure Study on the Peptide Fraction of AG2: a Potent In Vitro Transfection Agent.</a></h2><p>Gemini-based amphiphiles are candidates for biomedical applications.

Amphiphiles AG10-C and AG10-C were more active at a lower N/P ratio than AG2-C. These amphiphiles showed no activity when lysine was replaced by ornithine, and the activity of all derivatives increased when there were more ornithine residues and a W/O = 1 ratio in the peptide region.

Lipid accumulation within the liver is considered as one of the risk factors for insulin resistance. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is used to treat liver dysfunction; however, the effect and mechanism of HGF on hepatic lipid metabolism are still not fully understood.Male C57BL/6 mice were induced with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week treatment of HGF or vehicle saline. The levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance were calculated for insulin sensitivity. Biochemical plasma parameters were also measured to assess the effect of HGF on lipid accumulation. Additionally, genes in the lipid metabolism pathway were evaluated in -treated HepG2 cells and high-fat diet mice.HGF treatment significantly decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents. Additionally, HGF-regulated expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/fatty  synthase, peroxidase proliferator-activated receptor-α, and upstream nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor and small heterodimer partner. Furthermore, c-Met inhibitor could partially reverse the effects of HGF.HGF treatment can ameliorate hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis through regulation of lipid metabolism. These effects might occur through farnesoid X receptor-small heterodimer partner axis-dependent transcriptional activity.© 2018 The Authors.

The pathogenic mechanisms of obesity-associated renal injury are recognized to at least involve a lipid-rich and pro-inflammatory state of the renal tissues, but specific mechanisms establishing causal relation remain unknown. Saturated fatty acids are elevated in obesity, and known to induce chronic inflammation in kidneys. Myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) is an important protein in lipopolysaccharide-induced innate immunity response and inflammation. We suggested that obesity-associated renal injury is regulated by MD2 thereby driving an inflammatory renal injury. The used three mouse models for in vivo study: MD2 knockout mice (KO) maintained on high fat diet (HFD), wild-type mice on HFD plus L6H21, a specific MD2 inhibitor and KO mice given  (PA) by IV injection. The in vitro studies were carried out in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells, mouse mesangial cells and primary macrophages, respectively. The HFD mice presented with increased hyperlipidemia, serum creatinine and proteinuria. Renal tissue from HFD mice had increased fibrosis, inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. This HFD-induced renal injury profile was not observed in KO mice or L6H21-treated mice. Mice given PA mimmicked the HFD-induced renal injury profiles, which were prevented by MD2 knockout. The in vitro data further confirmed MD2 mediates PA-induced inflammation. MD2 is causally related with obesity-associated renal inflammatory injury. We believe that MD2 is an attractive target for future therapeutic strategies in obesity-associated kidney diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

MFP-I, MFP-II, and MFP-III were isolated from mulberry fruit by stepwise precipitation with 30, 60, and 90% ethanol, respectively. MFP-II at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/mL dramatically attenuated PA-induced hepatic lipotoxicity, while MFP-I and MFP-III showed weak protection. It was demonstrated that MFP-II not only increased nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation, thereby activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, but also enhanced heme oxygenase 1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1, and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase gene expressions and promoted catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, which protected hepatocytes against PA-induced oxidative stress and lipotoxicity. Further investigation indicated that the molecular  of MFP-II was 115.0 kDa, and MFP-II mainly consisted of galactose (30.5%), arabinose (26.2%), and rhamnose (23.1%).

The metabolic effects of CIE fats on insulin activity, lipids, and adiposity in humans are not well established. We investigated the effects of CIE fats rich in  (C16:0, IEPalm) and stearic (C18:0, IEStear) acids on insulin resistance, serum lipids, apolipoprotein concentrations, and adiposity, using C16:0-rich natural palm olein (NatPO) as the control. We designed a parallel, double-blind clinical trial. Three test fats were used to prepare daily snacks for consumption with a standard background diet over a period of 8 weeks by three groups of a total of 85 healthy, overweight adult volunteers. We measured the outcome variables at weeks 0, 6, and at the endpoint of 8. After 8 weeks, there was no significant difference in surrogate biomarkers of insulin resistance in any of the IE fat diets (IEPalm and IEStear) compared to the NatPO diet. The change in serum triacylglycerol concentrations was significantly lower with the IEStear diet, and the changes in serum leptin and  fat percentages were significantly lower in the NatPO-diet compared to the IEPalm diet. We conclude that diets containing C16:0 and C18:0-rich CIE fats do not affect markers of insulin resistance compared to a natural C16:0-rich fat (NatPO) diet. Higher amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and longer chain SFAs situated at the -1,3 position of the triacylglycerol (TAG) backbones resulted in less  gain and lower changes in  fat percentage and leptin concentration to those observed in NatPO and IEStear.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816669>MIP-1α Induction by Palmitate in the Human Monocytic Cells Implicates TLR4 Signaling Mechanism.</a></h2><p>MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein 1α)/CCL3 chemokine is associated with the adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. Both MIP-1α and free fatty acids are elevated in obesity/T2D. We asked if free fatty  palmitate could modulate MIP1α expression in the human monocytic cells.Human monocytic THP-1 cells and macrophages were stimulated with palmitate and TNF-α (positive control). MIP-1α expression was measured with real time RT-PCR, Flow Cytometry and ELISA. Signaling pathways were identified by using THP-1-XBlue™ cells, THP-1-XBlue™-defMyD cells, anti-TLR4 mAb and TLR4 siRNA.Our data show that palmitate induced significant increase in MIP1α production in monocytic THP-1 cells/macrophages. MIP-1α induction was significantly suppressed when cells were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody prior stimulation with palmitate. Using TLR4 siRNA, we further demonstrate that palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression in monocytic cells requires TLR4. Moreover, THP1 cells defective in MyD88, a major adaptor protein involved in TLR4 signaling, were unable to induce MIP-1α production in response to palmitate. Palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression was suppressed by inhibition of MAPK, NFkB and PI3K signaling pathways. In addition, palmitate-induced NF-κB/AP-1 activation was observed while production of MIP-1α. However, this activation of NF-κB/AP-1 was abrogated in MyD88 deficient cells.Overall, these results show that palmitate induces TLR4dependent MIP-1α expression requiring the MyD88 recruitment and activation of MAPK, NF-κB/AP-1 and PI3K signaling. It implies that the increased systemic levels of free fatty  palmitate in obesity/T2D may contribute to metabolic inflammation through excessive production of MIP-1a.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh period (FR; 1-24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a diet supplemented with C16:0 (, PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter). During the peak (PK) period (25-67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA (1.5% of diet dry matter) diet in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, we did not observe treatment differences for dry matter intake or milk yield. Compared with CON, PA increased the yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk by 5.30 kg/d, yield of energy-corrected milk (ECM) by 4.70 kg/d, milk fat content by 0.41% units, milk fat yield by 280 g/d, and protein yield by 100 g/d. The increase in milk fat associated with the PA treatment during the FR period occurred due to an increase in yield of 16-carbon milk fatty acids (FA) by 147 g/d (derived from both de novo synthesis and extraction from plasma) and preformed milk FA by 96 g/d. Compared with CON, PA decreased  (BW) by 21 kg and  condition score (BCS) by 0.09 units and tended to increase BW loss by 0.76 kg/d. Although PA consistently increased milk fat yield and ECM over time, a treatment × time interaction was observed for BW and BCS due to PA inducing a greater decrease in BW and BCS after the second week of treatments. Feeding PA during the PK period increased milk yield by 3.45 kg/d, yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk by 4.50 kg/d, yield of ECM by 4.60 kg/d, milk fat content by 0.22% units, milk fat yield by 210 g/d, protein yield by 140 g/d, and lactose yield by 100 g/d but tended to reduce BW by 10 kg compared with CON. Also, during the PK period we observed an interaction between diet fed in the FR and PK periods for milk fat yield due to feeding PA during the PK period increasing milk fat yield to a greater extent in cows that received the CON diet (+240 g/d) rather than the PA diet (+180 g/d) during the FR period. This difference was associated with the yield of preformed FA because feeding PA during the PK period increased the yield of preformed milk FA only in cows that received the CON diet during the FR period. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased the yield of ECM in both the FR and PK periods compared with a control diet. For some variables, the effect of feeding C16:0 was affected by timing of supplementation because milk yield increased only during the PK period and BW decreased to a greater extent in the FR period. Regardless of diet fed in the FR period, feeding a C16:0 supplement during the PK period increased yields of milk and milk components.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac insulin signaling are not fully understood. The regulatory role of tafazzin in the hearts of HF-diet-fed mice is investigated.Mice are fed a HF diet or low fat (LF) diet for up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, it is found that HF-diet-induced cardiac dysfunction is linked to overexpression of the mitochondrial protein tafazzin. Increased tafazzin promotes mitochondrial fission and impairs insulin signaling, which is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Furthermore, knockdown of tafazzin with siRNA inhibits -induced mitochondrial fission and restores insulin sensitivity. Moreover, miR-125b-5p as an upstream regulator targeting tafazzin is identified and palmitate-induced insulin resistance further rescued.In HF-diet-fed mouse hearts, increased tafazzin contributes to insulin resistance via mediating Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria, and a small non-coding RNA, miR-125b-5p, at least partially regulates this signaling pathway and alleviates insulin resistance.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

DGKδ levels were measured in skeletal muscle from 32-36-week-old NSY mice via western blot.Chronic oral administration of myristic  ameliorated glucose tolerance (24-28% decrease in blood glucose levels during glucose tolerance tests) and reduced insulin-responsive blood glucose levels (~20% decrease) in male NSY mice compared with vehicle and  groups at 24-30 weeks of age (the age at which the severity of type 2 diabetes is exacerbated in NSY mice).

In this work, methyl palmitate ( methyl ester) having a melting point around 30°C, was used as a model solid non-particulate (waxy) soil. A total surfactant concentration of 0.35 wt% of the selected formulation (4:0.65  ratio of C-4PO-SONa:SMDNS) with 5.3 wt% NaCl was able to form a middle phase microemulsion at a high temperature (40°C),which provided the highest oil removal level with the lowest oil redeposition and the lowest IFT, and was much higher than that with a commercial detergent or de-ionized water. Most of the detached oil, whether in liquid or solid state, was in an unsolubilized form. Hence, the dispersion stability of the detached oil droplets or solidified oil particles that resulted from the surfactant adsorption played an important role in the oil redeposition. For an oily detergency, the lower the system IFT, the higher the oil removal whereas for a waxy (non-particulate) soil detergency, the lower the contact angle, the higher the solidified oil removal.

Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic lipid metabolism.LLE significantly decreased the intracellular lipid accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the , relative liver , serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice.

Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

To co-relate the in vivo results we used the human liver carcinoma HepG2 cells, subjected to knockdown with small siRNAs of AdipoR1/R2 and PPARα genes and treated with osmotin and  (P.A.). MTT assay, Western blotting, immunohistofluorescence assays, and plasma biochemical analyses were applied.Osmotin stimulated AdipoR1/R2 and its downstream APPL1/PPAR-α/AMPK/SIRT1 pathways in ob/ob and db/db mice, and HepG2 cells exposed to P.A. Mechanistically, we confirmed that knockdown of AdipoR1/R2 and PPARα by their respective siRNAs abolished the osmotin activity in HepG2 cells exposed to P.A. Overall, the in vivo and in vitro results suggested that osmotin protected against NAFLD through activation of AdipoR1/R2 and its downstream APPL1/PPAR-α/AMPK/SIRT1 pathways as shown by the reduced , blood glucose level and glycated hemoglobin, improved glucose tolerance, attenuated insulin resistance and hepatic glucogenesis, regulated serum lipid parameters, and increased fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial functions.Our findings strongly suggest that novel osmotin might be a potential novel therapeutic tool against obesity/diabetes-induced NAFLD and other metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the mechanisms underlying the association between increased psoriasis severity and concomitant metabolic syndrome have not been fully clarified. Herein, we show that imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation was exacerbated and prolonged in diabetic obese mice compared to that in control mice, accompanied by remarkably increased lesional expressions of Cxcl5 and Il-1b. Notably, a large number of CXCL5 Ly6G cells infiltrated the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue of the diabetic obese mice. Most macrophages in the subcutaneous fat tissues of the diabetic obese mice were positive for expression of IL-1β and GRP78/Bip, an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. Depletion of Ly6G cells and macrophages diminished the imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation. Further, CXCL5 potentiated the secretion of IL-1β from macrophages and , a fatty  released from subcutaneous adipocytes, further enhanced IL-1β secretion via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction. Combined with the fact that the serum levels of both CXCL5 and  are significantly elevated in patients with metabolic syndrome, our results suggest a role for CXCL5 and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the increase of psoriasis severity of patients with concomitant metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The fatty acids profiles can be altered by fatty  desaturase; the activity of which is highly associated with obesity and other metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that fatty  composition, desaturase activity, and accumulation of visceral fat are interrelated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between increased visceral fat area and alterations in plasma fatty  profile in overweight subjects with different amounts of visceral fat.Healthy overweight subjects (25.0 kg/m ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m, n=232) were classified into lower (T1), middle (T2), and upper tertiles (T3) according to L4 visceral fat area (T1: <71.8 cm, T2: 71.8 cm-99.6 cm, T3: >99.6 cm).The T3 group showed higher amounts of cis-10-heptadecenoic  and activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase and lower activity of Δ5-desaturase than the T1 group. Additionally, the T3 group showed higher amounts of saturated fatty acids, myristic , , stearic , monounsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic , oleic , n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic , dihomo-γ-linolenic , arachidonic , n-3 PUFAs, and docosapentaenoic  than the T1 and T2 groups.This study indicates that greater than a certain area (>99.6 cm) of visceral fat is needed to observe altered levels of individual fatty  species and desaturase activities. The results suggest that increased activity of C16 Δ9-desaturase and C18 Δ9-desaturase in parallel with decreased Δ5-desaturase activity may be a causative factor in disturbed fatty  metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895067>A GC-MS untargeted metabolomics analysis in the plasma and liver of rats lacking dipeptidyl-peptidase type IV enzyme activity.</a></h2><p>This study was achieved with the aim to find metabolic changes between Fischer rats with different dipeptidyl peptidase-type 4 (DPPIV) expression. The DPPIV is an enzyme expressed in several tissues and is critically involved in the regulation of meal-related insulin secretion in healthy individuals. The metabolic consequences of chronic DPPIV inhibition were analyzed in a surrogate animal model of genetic enzyme deficiency. Hyphenated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and multivariate data analysis techniques were used to study the metabolic aqueous fraction profile of 18 plasma and liver samples in two syngeneic rat strains differing in DPPIV activity (DPPIV vs. DPPIV). The hyperglycemic response following oral glucose administration was attenuated in DPPIV rats, as expected. Statistical significant differences between the two strains were observed among the low molecular  polar metabolites analyzed from plasma and liver.These included a decrease in malic  and glutamine and an increase in pyroglutamic , serine, and alanine in plasma of DPPIV rats. In addition, , L-proline, and ribitol were decreased in the liver of DPPIV strain. Such alterations were compatible with a normal phenotype.

Quantitative PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix. Statistical significance was assessed using SPSS, with p < 0.05 considered significant.The serum ET-1 content and endothelial expression of ET-1 mRNA were increased in the HFD-fed mice compared to the chow-fed control mice. Moreover, the mRNA expression of ET-1 was significantly increased in cultured HAECs in response to acute (< 24 h) and chronic (12-16 days) treatments with  (PA), one of the most abundant saturated fatty acids in obesity. We found that the induction of ET-1 expression by PA was abolished by pretreating the cells with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric  or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö 6850.Our findings demonstrate for the first time that PA increases ET-1 expression in endothelial cells through the induction of ER stress and the activation of PKC, providing novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.© 2018 S.

Propane-2-sulfonic  octadec-9-enyl-amide (N15) is a novel PPARα/γ dual agonist synthesized in our laboratory. The present study investigates the efficacy and safety of N15 on insulin resistance regulation in high fat diet (HFD)-and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and in  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. Our results showed that N15 remarkably ameliorated insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in vivo, as well as rectified the glucose consumption and gluconeogenesis in vitro. Moreover, the glucose-lowering effect of N15 was associated with PPARγ mediated up-regulation of hepatic glucose consumption and down-regulation of gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, N15 exerted advantageous effects on glucose and lipid metabolism without triggering  gain and hepatotoxicity in mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that by alleviating glucose and lipid abnormalities, N15 could be used as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent against type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although astrocytes have historically been assumed to have little relevance for such neuroendocrine control, we investigated whether lipid uptake via lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in astrocytes is required to centrally regulate energy homeostasis. Ex vivo studies with hypothalamus-derived astrocytes showed that LPL expression is upregulated by oleic , whereas it is decreased in response to  or triglycerides. Likewise, astrocytic LPL deletion reduced the accumulation of lipid droplets in those glial cells. Consecutive in vivo studies showed that postnatal ablation of LPL in glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing astrocytes induced exaggerated  gain and glucose intolerance in mice exposed to a high-fat diet. Intriguingly, astrocytic LPL deficiency also triggered increased ceramide content in the hypothalamus, which may contribute to hypothalamic insulin resistance. We conclude that hypothalamic LPL functions in astrocytes to ensure appropriately balanced nutrient sensing, ceramide distribution,  regulation, and glucose metabolism.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658532>Changes of albumin secondary structure after  binding.

Plasma pool of free fatty acids arising from triglyceride hydrolysis, critical in energy metabolism and etiology of metabolic disorders is transported by albumin. According to various studies albumin has from seven to nine binding sites with diverse affinity to long chain fatty acids. X-ray diffraction crystallography measurements have provided data only for pure human serum albumin or albumin with fully saturated binding sites. These results have shown that amount of -helices is higher after fatty acids binding. Molecular mechanics simulations suggest that binding of fatty acids in two high-affinity sites leads to major conformational changes in albumin structure. The aim of this research was to investigate albumin secondary structure upon gradually increasing fatty acids to protein mole ratio.Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was applied to study changes of bovine serum albumin (as an analogue of human serum albumin) -helical structures after binding  in a range of 0-20 : albumin molar ratios representing pure protein, partial, full saturation and excess binding sites capacity.Amount of -helices was increasing along with the amount of : bovine serum albumin molar ratio and reached maximum value around 2 mol/mol.Our studies confirmed molecular mechanics simulations and crystallographic studies.  binding in two high-affinity sites leads to major structural changes, filling another sites only slightly influenced bovine serum albumin secondary structure.

Among the main factors which contribute to breast milk composition are maternal diet, age and  mass index, parity, duration of pregnancy and stage of lactation. This study aims to investigate the potential impact of several factors including demographic (i.e. maternal age and nationality) on the colostrum fatty  profile. Colostrum was collected the third day postpartum in a Greek maternity hospital. Certain lipid quality indices and fatty  ratios were estimated and results were statistically processed. The main identified fatty acids were  (C16:0), oleic (C18:1ω-9), and linoleic (C18:2ω-6) acids. Among fatty acids, saturated fatty acids predominated (47.61%), followed by monounsaturated fatty acids (39.26%), while polyunsaturated fatty acids had the lowest proportion (13.13%). Values of lipid quality indices were within the reported in the literature ranges. Maternal  mass index, nationality, age, mode of delivery, gender and fetal  percentile were studied in respect to their potential influence on the fatty  profile of colostrum fat. Results suggest that colostrum fatty  profile was mainly dependent on maternal nationality and age rather than mode of delivery and maternal BMI. Regarding the effect of maternal nationality, significant differences were found for saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Of the most interesting findings is that colostrum fat from older (≥35 years) mothers had less saturated fat and more appropriate LQIs values. Finally, a reversed correlation was observed between the customized centile of the infants and the colostrum fat content.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28718808>Beta Palmitate Improves Bone Length and Quality during Catch-Up Growth in Young Rats.</a></h2><p> (PA) is the most abundant saturated fatty  in human milk, where it is heavily concentrated in the --position (termed beta palmitate, BPA) and as such is conserved in all women, regardless of their diet or ethnicity, indicating its physiological and metabolic importance.

Pre-pubertal male rats were subjected to a 17 days food restriction followed by re-feeding for nine days with  PA or BPA-containing diets. We measured bone length, epiphyseal growth plate height (EGP, histology), bone quality (micro-CT and 3-point bending assay), and gene expression (Affymetrix). The BPA-containing diet improved most growth parameters: humeri length and EGP height were greater in the BPA-fed animals. Further analysis of the EGP revealed that the hypertrophic zone was significantly higher in the BPA group. In addition, Affymetrix analysis revealed that the diet affected the expression of several genes in the liver and EGP. Despite the very subtle difference between the diets and the short re-feeding period, we found a small but significant improvement in most growth parameters in the BPA-fed rats.

The filamentous fungus  was cultivated in whey permeate, a byproduct from cheese production, to produce an oil-rich fungal biomass. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the fermentation conditions such as pH and temperature for increased biomass yield and lipid accumulation. Quantification and characterization of the fungal biomass oil was conducted.Upstream lactose hydrolysis of the whey permeate increased the biomass yield from 2.4 to 7.8 (g dry biomass/L) compared to that of non-hydrolyzed whey permeate. The combination of low pH (4.5) and pasteurization minimized microbial competition, thus favoring fungal growth. A central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the effects of temperature (22.4-33.6 °C) and a lower pH range (3.6-4.7) on biomass yield and composition. The highest biomass yield and oil content was observed at high temperature (33.6 °C), while the pH range evaluated had a less pronounced effect. The predictive model was validated at the optimal conditions of 33.6 °C and pH 4.5. The fungal biomass yield plateaued at 9 g dry cell  per liter, while the oil content and lipid yield reached a maximum of 24% dry biomass and 2.20 g/L, respectively, at 168 h. Triacylglycerides were the major lipid class (92%), which contained predominantly oleic (41%),  (23%), linoleic (11%), and γ-linolenic  (9%).This study provided an alternative way of valorization of cheese whey permeate by using it as a substrate for the production of value-added compounds by fungal fermentation.
