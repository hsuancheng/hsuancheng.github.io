Furthermore, the caecal microbiomes patterns were analysed using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing with a next generation sequencer (MiSeq) system. Green loofah was homogenized and autoclaved (LH), and subsequently fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum Uruma-SU4 (FL). In vitro bile  (taurocholic, glycocholic and  acids (DCA)) lowering capacity was significantly high in FL. The levels of plasma triacylglyceride in mice which were fed a high-fat diet containing 17% beef tallow was lowered by 5% dried FL (FLD) and was unaffected by dried LH (LHD). Caecal Lactobacillus johnsonii and Clostridium disporicum known as predominant lactic  bacteria in mice gut and urso-DCA producer, respectively, were increased by FLD. On the other hand, Flintibacter butyricus was lowered by both LHD and FLD. These results suggest that if green loofah cannot be consumed as a fresh vegetable, lactic  fermentation may be useful in generating effective nutritional supplements and functional foods.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Obeticholic  (OCA) is a FXR agonist being developed for treating various chronic liver diseases. Previous studies reported inconsistent effects of OCA on regulating plasma cholesterol levels in different animal models and in different patient populations. The mechanisms underlying its divergent effects have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is a FXR-modulated gene and the major receptor for HDL-C. We investigated the effects of OCA on hepatic SR-BI expression and correlated such effects with plasma HDL-C levels and hepatic cholesterol efflux in hyperlipidemic hamsters. We demonstrated that OCA induced a time-dependent reduction in serum HDL-C levels after 14 days of treatment, which was accompanied by a significant reduction of liver cholesterol content and increases in fecal cholesterol in OCA-treated hamsters. Importantly, hepatic SR-BI mRNA and protein levels in hamsters were increased to 1.9- and 1.8-fold of control by OCA treatment. Further investigations in normolipidemic hamsters did not reveal OCA-induced changes in serum HDL-C levels or hepatic SR-BI expression. We conclude that OCA reduces plasma HDL-C levels and promotes transhepatic cholesterol efflux in hyperlipidemic hamsters via a mechanism involving upregulation of hepatic SR-BI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031618>Lipid accumulation inhibitory activities of novel isoxazole-based chenodeoxycholic acids: Design, synthesis and preliminary mechanism study.</a></h2><p>In continuation of our drug discovery program on , a series of novel isoxazole-chenodeoxycholic  hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their lipid-lowering effects. Preliminary screening of all the synthesized compounds was done by using a 3T3-L1 adipocyte model, in which the most active compound 16b could significantly reduce the lipid accumulation up to 30.5% at a nontoxic concentration 10 μM. Further mechanism studies revealed that 16b blocked lipid accumulation via activating FXR-SHP signaling pathway, efficiently down-regulated the expression of key lipogenesis regulator SREBP-1c.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a critical role in maintaining bile acids and triglycerides (TG) homeostasis. Here we report that FXR regulates serum TG level in part through PLA2G12B. Activation of FXR by chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) or GW4064 significantly decreased PLA2G12B expression in HepG2 cells. PLA2G12B expression was transcriptionally repressed due to an FXR-mediated up-regulation of small heterodimer partner (SHP) which functionally suppresses HNF-4α activity. We found that hepatic PLA2G12B expression was suppressed and serum TG level reduced in high fat diet mice treated with CDCA. Concurrently, CDCA treatment lowered hepatic VLDL-TG secretion. Our data demonstrate that activation of FXR promotes TG lowering, not only by decreasing de novo lipogenesis but also reducing hepatic secretion of TG-rich VLDL particles in part through suppressing PLA2G12B expression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We hypothesized that the cross-linking of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and saccharides such as starch or dextrin with divinyl sulfone (DVS) yields homo- and hetero-polymeric materials with the ability to trap sterols. Our hypothesis was put to test by synthesizing a library of 22 polymers that were screened to evaluate their capability to sequester both cholesterol (CHOL) and cholic and  acids (CA and DCA). Three polymers synthesized in high yield were identified as promising. Two were neutral hetero-polymers of β-CD and starch or dextrin and the third was a weakly cationic homo-polymer of starch, highlighting the importance of the cavity effect. They were tested in hypercholesterolemic male Wistar rats and their ability to regulate hypercholesterolemia was similar to that for the reference BAS cholestyramine, but with two additional advantages: (i) they normalized the TG level and (ii) they did not increase the creatinine level. Neither hepatotoxicity nor kidney injury was detected, further supporting them as therapeutical candidates to manage hypercholesterolemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25411028>A metabolomic and pharmacokinetic study on the mechanism underlying the lipid-lowering effect of orally administered berberine.</a></h2><p>Clinical and animal studies demonstrated that orally administered berberine had a distinct lipid-lowering effect. However, pharmacokinetic studies showed that berberine was poorly absorbed into the body so the levels of berberine in the blood and target tissues were far below the effective concentrations revealed. To probe the underlying mechanism, the effect of berberine on the biological system was studied on a high-fat-diet-induced hamster hyperlipidemia model. Our results showed that intragastrically-administered berberine was poorly absorbed into circulation and most berberine accumulated in gut content. Although the bioavailability of intragastrically administered berberine was much lower than that of intraperitoneally administered berberine, it had a stronger lipid-lowing effect, indicating that the gastrointestinal tract is a potential target for the hypolipidemic effect of berberine. A metabolomic study on both serum and gut content showed that orally administered berberine significantly regulated molecules involved in lipid metabolism, and increased the generation of bile acids in the hyperlipidemic model. DNA analysis revealed that the orally administered berberine modulated the gut microbiota, and berberine showed a significant inhibition of the 7α-dehydroxylation conversion of cholic  to , indicating a decreased elimination of bile acids in the gut. However, in model hamsters, elevated bile acids failed to downregulate the expression and function of CYP7A1 in a negative feedback loop. It was suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of orally administered berberine involves modulating the turnover of bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor signal pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25533429>Effects of ursodeoxycholic  therapy on carotid intima media thickness, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent liver disease that is increasingly being associated with cardiovascular disease. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and may reduce liver injury in NASH. To date, no studies have assessed the efficacy of UDCA in carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), serum lipids, apolipoprotein A1 (apo A), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and apolipoprotein B/A1 (apo B/A1) ratios in patients with NASH.In this prospective study, 30 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and 25 healthy adults as a control group were evaluated. None of the participants had , hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Patients with NASH received UDCA 15 mg/kg/day for 6 months. BMI, waist circumference, homeostasis model assessment, lipids, apo A1, apo B, apo B/A1 ratios, and CIMT were analyzed before and after the treatment period.At the end of the study, there were no statistically significant changes in BMI or waist circumference. Liver enzymes decreased gradually. The homeostasis model assessment decreased from 3.4 ± 1.89 to 2.06 ± 1.68 (P < 0.001). No significant changes in the mean triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, or apo B levels were observed. The mean high-density lipoprotein (42.9 ± 7.1 vs. 45.5 ± 9.8; P = 0.037) and apo A1 (127.6 ± 17.7 vs. 135.9 ± 22.2; P = 0.02) increased significantly. Apo B/A1 ratios tended to decrease, but this decrease was not statistically significant. The mean CIMT decreased significantly (0.56 ± 0.15 vs. 0.47 ± 0.12; P = 0.001).UDCA treatment in NASH patients resulted in statistically significant reductions in the mean CIMT over a 6-month period. We believe that this benefit of UDCA may have resulted from decreased insulin resistance and increased serum high-density lipoprotein-apo A1 levels. However, larger, longer-term studies are needed to confirm this effect of UDCA in NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529824>A novel analytical approach towards in-vitro bile  binding studies to Colesevelam Hydrochloride tablets: An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method.</a></h2><p>Colesevelam hydrochloride is a bile  sequestrant used as a low density lipoprotein (LDL) reducing agent in  with an additional advantage to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients. The objective of the study was to develop and validate a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopic method for the simultaneous in-vitro estimation of bile  salts of Glycocholic  (GC), Glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDC) and Taurodeoxycholic  (TDC) and its application in performing in-vitro binding study with Colesevelam Hydrochloride tablets. The method was developed using C-18 (50 x 4.6 mm, 3 μm) column with detection on negative ion mode and acquisition time of 3.5 min. The calibration range was linear from 0.0002 mM to 0.0065 mM for GC, 0.0002 mM to 0.0065 mM for GCDC and 0.0001 mM to 0.0021 mM for TDC. The precision was less than 3.0% and accuracy was found well within the range of 85 to 115%. The validated method was further applied to conduct in-vitro equilibrium binding study. The data was subjected to Langmuir isotherm and affinity constant (k) and capacity constant (k) were calculated.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
