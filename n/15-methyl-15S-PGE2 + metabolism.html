Though not available therapeutically, SARMs are available for purchase online as supplement products. The potential for performance enhancing effects associated with these products makes them a significant concern with regards to doping control in sports. The purpose of this study was to investigate the  of LGD-4033 in the horse following oral administration, in order to identify the most appropriate analytical targets for doping control laboratories. LGD-4033 was orally administered to two Thoroughbred horses and urine, plasma and hair samples were collected and analysed for parent drug and metabolites. LC-HRMS was used for metabolite identification in urine and plasma. Eight metabolites were detected in urine, five of which were excreted only as phase II conjugates, with the longest detection time being observed for di- and tri-hydroxylated metabolites. The parent compound could only be detected in urine in the conjugated fraction. Seven metabolites were detected in plasma along with the parent compound where mono-hydroxylated metabolites provided the longest duration of detection. Preliminary investigations with hair samples using LC-MS/MS analysis indicated the presence of trace amounts of the parent compound and one of the mono-hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro incubation of LGD-4033 with equine liver microsomes was also performed for comparison, yielding 11 phase I metabolites. All of the metabolites observed in vivo were also observed in vitro.This article is protected by copyright.

These RNAs are able to negatively affect the gene expression at post-transcriptional level. It has been demonstrated that microRNAs play a significant role in cell proliferation, cell migration, cell death, cell differentiation, infection, immune response and . Besides, the dysfunction of microRNAs has been observed in a variety of cancers. So, modulation of microRNAs is of interest in treatment of disorders.The aim of the current review is to investigate the modulatory effect of propofol on microRNAs in cancer therapy.This review was performed at PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Science data-bases using keywords "propofol', "microRNA", "cancer therapy", "propofol + microRNA" and "propofol + miR".It was found that propofol dually down-regulates/upregulates microRNAs to exert its anti-tumor activity. In terms of oncogenesis microRNAs, propofol exert inhibitory effect, while propofol significantly enhances the expression of oncosuppressor microRNAs.It seems that propofol is a potential modulator of microRNAs and this capability can be used in treatment of various cancers.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656566>Hyperlipidaemia in primary biliary cholangitis: treatment, safety and efficacy.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease associated with altered lipoprotein , mainly cholesterol. Hypercholesterolaemia, a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population, occurs in 75%-95% of individuals with PBC. The impact of hypercholesterolaemia on cardiovascular risk in PBC, however, is controversial. Previous data have shown that hypercholesterolaemia in PBC is not always associated with an increase in cardiovascular events. However, patients with PBC with cardiovascular risk factors may still warrant cholesterol-lowering therapy. Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC poses unique challenges among primary care providers due to concerns of hepatotoxicity associated with cholesterol-lowering medications. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypercholesterolaemia in PBC and its pertinent cardiovascular risk. We will also discuss indications for treatment and the efficacy and safety of available agents for hypercholesterolaemia in PBC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and sestrin 1 (SESN 1) play a central role in cell , proliferation, and survival. The aim of our study is to present serum mTOR and SESN 1 levels by comparing patients with or without bone fracture. It is also a guide for further research on the role of these proteins in fracture healing.A total of 34 patients (10 female, 24 male) with the bone fracture and 32 controls (10 female, 22 male) participated in this study. After collecting serum venous blood samples, the quantitative sandwich ELISA technique was used for the determination of serum mTOR and Sestrin-1 levels.The mean serum mTOR level was significantly higher in the fracture group compared to the control group (p=0.001). However, Sestrin-1 levels did not significantly differ between groups (p=0.913).According to our results, we found that serum mTOR levels increased on the first day after fracture compared to the control group. However, we obtained no significant difference between groups in terms of Sestrin-1 levels. This study may guide further clinical studies investigating the potential role of mTOR signaling in the bone healing process.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656995>Epoxidation is the preferred pathway of first-stage  of abiraterone acetate in brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus).</a></h2><p>Twenty juvenile individuals of brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), average weight 77 g, were fed by abiraterone acetate prodrug dissolved in olive oil via gastric probe. Dose applied was 3 mg/10 g fish weight. After feeding, they were let out into aquarium and kept there for 3 days. Aquarium water containing excreted metabolites was extracted, and sample was purified and finally analyzed by means of HPLC/MS. Expected both primary (products of hydroxylation) and secondary (products of glucuronidation and sulfatation) metabolites of abiraterone acetate were identified. The NMR measurement of one of the prevailing metabolites presumed to be one of possible hydroxy-abiraterones discovered that it is not hydroxy-abiraterone but abiraterone 16,17-epoxide. Closer analysis of MS and MS spectra revealed that one of presumed hydroxy-abiraterone acetates and also some secondary metabolites are probably 16,17-epoxides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659697>Dissecting the target leukocyte subpopulations of clinically relevant inflammation radiopharmaceuticals.</a></h2><p>Leukocyte subtypes bear distinct pro-inflammatory, reparative, and regulatory functions. Imaging inflammation provides information on disease prognosis and may guide therapy, but the cellular basis of the signal remains equivocal. We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant inflammation-targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino acid  and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino acid C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for  radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific inflammation-targeted radiotracers. The pathogenetic cell population in specific inflammatory diseases should be considered in the selection of an appropriate imaging agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered Fat .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early  abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular lipid content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic fat fraction (HFF) and visceral fat were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral fat (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular lipid content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty acid concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty acids and liver fat were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for lipid-targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661297>Cardiac overexpression of perilipin 2 induces atrial steatosis, connexin 43 remodeling, and atrial fibrillation in aged mice.</a></h2><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent in patients with obesity and diabetes, and such patients often exhibit cardiac steatosis. Since the role of cardiac steatosis  in the induction of AF has not been elucidated, the present study was designed to explore the relation between cardiac steatosis and AF. Transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2) were housed in the laboratory for more than 12 months before the study. Electron microscopy of the atrium of PLIN2-Tg mice showed accumulation of small lipid droplets around mitochondrial chains, and 5- to 9-fold greater atrial triacylglycerol (TAG) content compared to wildtype (Wt) mice. Electrocardiography showed significantly longer RR intervals in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice. Transesophageal electrical burst pacing resulted in significantly higher prevalence of sustained (>5 min) AF (69%) in PLIN2-Tg mice than Wt mice (24%), although it was comparable in younger (4-month-old) mice. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein, was localized at the intercalated discs in Wt atria, but was heterogeneously distributed on the lateral side of cardiomyocytes in PLIN2-Tg atria. Langendorff-perfused hearts using the optical mapping technique showed slower and heterogeneous impulse propagation in PLIN2-Tg atria compared with Wt atria. Cardiac overexpression of hormone-sensitive lipase in PLIN2-Tg mice resulted in atrial TAG depletion and amelioration of AF susceptibility. The results suggest that PLIN2-induced steatosis is associated with Cx43 remodeling, impaired conduction propagation, and higher incidence of AF in aged mice. Therapies targeting cardiac steatosis could be potentially beneficial against AF in patients with obesity or diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h2><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of energy  thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a  sensor of cellular energy and exerts essential functions on energy , oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of energy  involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac energy  is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac energy  and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657241>Transcerebral exchange kinetics of large neutral amino acids during acute inspiratory hypoxia in humans.</a></h2><p>Hypoxaemia is present in many critically ill patients, and may contribute to encephalopathy. Changes in the passage of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with an increased cerebral influx of aromatic amino acids into the brain may concurrently be present and also contribute to encephalopathy, but it has not been established whether hypoxaemia  may trigger such changes. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 11 healthy men using the Kety-Schmidt technique and obtained paired arterial and jugular-venous blood samples for the determination of LNAAs by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline and after 9 hours of poikilocapnic normobaric hypoxia (12% O). Transcerebral net exchange was determined by the Fick principle, and transport of LNAAs across the BBB was determined mathematically. Hypoxia increased both the systemic and corresponding cerebral delivery of the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine, and the branched-chain amino acids leucine and isoleucine. Despite this, the transcerebral net exchange values and mathematically derived brain extracellular concentrations for all LNAAs were unaffected. In conclusion, the observed changes in circulating LNAAs triggered by hypoxaemia do not affect the transcerebral exchange kinetics of LNAAs to such an extent that their brain extracellular concentrations are affected.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks mitochondria down triggering  rewiring in yeast.</a></h2><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete  rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole  suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657684>The Association of Potassium Status with Parameters of Glucose  is influenced by Age in Adults.</a></h2><p>Potassium status has been found to affect glucose homeostasis.This study therefore aimed at investigating relationships between potassium status or dietary intake and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in a sample of Austrian adults (18-80 years, n = 421, 61% women) from the Austrian Study on Nutritional Status 2012.Dietary potassium intake was obtained by two 24 h recalls. FPG, plasma K+, and urinary K+ were determined photometrically, HbA1c by HPLC. Associations between the parameters were studied using multiple regression analysis after controlling for confounders and after age stratification of the sample (18-64 y vs. 65-80 y).Most of the participants had a potassium intake of less than the estimated adequate daily intake of 4000 mg/d. In the multiple regression analyses in the whole sample plasma K+ had a statistically significant positive effect on FPG only in the crude model (ß = 0.128, p < 0.01) and on HbA1c also in the fully adjusted model (ß = 0.129, p < 0.05). The small effects on HbA1c were also detected in the younger age group but were absent in the older population. However, in this latter, a reverse association of urinary K+ on HbA1c was observed as well as of dietary potassium intake on FPG with no effects in the younger sample.We suggest that age dependent differences in the association between parameters of potassium status and blood glucose regulation should be also taken into account.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659118>Promoter demethylation of the asparagine synthetase gene is required for an ATF4-dependent adaptation to asparagine depletion.</a></h2><p>Tumor cells adapt to nutrient-limiting environments by inducing gene expression that ensures adequate nutrients to sustain  demands. For example, during amino acid limitations, ATF4 in the amino acid response induces expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), which provides for asparagine biosynthesis. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are sensitive to asparagine depletion, and administration of the asparagine-depletion enzyme L-asparaginase is an important therapy option. ASNS expression can counterbalance L-asparaginase treatment by mitigating nutrient stress. Therefore understanding the mechanisms regulating ASNS expression is important to define the adaptive processes underlying tumor progression and treatment. Here, we show that DNA hypermethylation at the ASNS promoter prevents its transcriptional expression following asparagine depletion. Insufficient expression of ASNS leads to asparagine deficiency, which facilitates an ATF4-independent induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) that triggers apoptosis. We conclude that chromatin accessibility is critical for ATF4 activity at the ASNS promoter, which can switch ALL cells from an ATF4-dependent adaptive response to ATF4-independent apoptosis during asparagine depletion.  This work may also help explain why ALL cells are most sensitive to L-asparaginase treatment when compared to other cancers.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657647>Inositol polyphosphate multikinase is a metformin target that regulates cell migration.</a></h2><p>Metformin has been shown to alter cell adhesion protein expression, which is thought to play a role in its observed antitumor properties. We found that metformin treatment down-regulated integrin β1 concomitant with the loss of inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) in murine myocytes, adipocytes, and hepatocytes. To determine if IPMK was upstream of integrin β1 expression, we examined IPMK mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and found that integrins β1 and β3 gene expression was reduced by half, relative to wild-type cells, whereas focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 protein levels were increased, resulting in migration defects. Using nanonet force microscopy, we determined that cell:extracellular matrix adhesion and cell contractility forces were decreased, confirming the functional relevance of integrin and Rho protein dysregulation. Pharmacological studies showed that inhibition of both FAK1 and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 partially restored integrin β1 expression, suggesting negative regulation of integrin β1 by FAK. Together our data indicate that IPMK participates in the regulation of cell migration and provides a potential link between metformin and wound healing impairment.-Tu-Sekine, B., Padhi, A., Jin, S., Kalyan, S., Singh, K., Apperson, M., Kapania, R., Hur, S.

Furthermore, PR expression can predict response to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Current immunohistochemical approaches to PR detection are limited by sampling error associated with biopsy and lack of standardised protocols; positron emission tomography (PET) using receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals to provide quantitative, whole-body imaging may overcome these limitations. PR expression has been successfully imaged with PET in the clinical setting, however investigation into new radioligands with improved pharmacokinetics and  stability is desirable.We report the synthesis of a focused library of non-steroidal PR ligands evaluated for use as PET radioligands. A lead candidate ([F]2) with low nanomolar activity was selected and radiolabelled with a radiochemical yield of 2.29 ± 2.31% (decay-corrected), radiochemical purity (RCP) > 95% and a molar activity of 2.5 ± 1.6 GBq/μmol. Cell uptake studies showed a significant and specific accumulation of [F]2 in T47D (PR++) breast cancer cell compared to MDA-MB-231 (PR-) control; however, in vivo evaluation was confounded by rapid defluorination of the radioligand. In vitro metabolite analysis of 2 in MLM confirmed defluorination and oxidative  of the thiocarbamate to oxocarbamate moiety by mass spectrometry.A route to access [F]2 was developed to allow in vitro and in vivo evaluation, albeit with low radiochemical yield and modest molar activity. [F]2 demonstrated selective uptake in PR++ T47D cells which could be blocked in a dose dependent manner with progesterone. However, [F]2 showed poor in vivo  stability with rapid defluorination within the time frame of the imaging protocol.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657337>[Role and mechanism of Ly6C monocyte in ventilator-induced lung injury in mice].</a></h2><p>To investigate the role and mechanism of Ly6C monocyte in mice with ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).Forty-eight healthy male SPF C57BL/6 mice were divided into spontaneous breathing group (n = 8), normal tidal volume (VT) group (VT was 8 mL/kg, n = 8), and high VT group (VT was 20 mL/kg, n = 32). The mice in the high VT group were subdivided into 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours subgroups, with 8 mice in each subgroup. All mice underwent direct tracheal intubation, those in the spontaneous breathing group maintained spontaneous breathing, and those in the normal VT group and high VT group were mechanically ventilated with different VT. After ventilation for 4 hours, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected to determine total protein, and the levels of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were determined by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). The lung tissues were harvested to determine the wet/dry (W/D) ratio, and lung tissue injury was assessed in terms of lung histopathologic examination after hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining under the light microscope. The protein expressions of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) in lung tissues were determined by Western Blot. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Ly6C monocyte in lung tissue.The histopathology of lung tissue structures was normal in the spontaneous breathing group and the normal VT group. Inflammatory reaction began to appear at 2 hours of high VT ventilation, and inflammatory reaction was gradually aggravated with the time extension. Compared with the spontaneous breathing group, the total protein, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels in BALF, the lung W/D ratio and MCP-1 expression were increased from 2 hours of high VT ventilation [total protein in BALF (g/L): 1.05±0.13 vs. 0.58±0.11, TNF-α in BALF (ng/L): 116.86±16.14 vs. 38.27±8.00, IL-1β in BALF (ng/L): 178.98±10.41 vs. 117.56±23.40, lung W/D ratio: 5.76±0.27 vs. 4.98±0.39, MCP-1/GAPDH: 0.87±0.19 vs. 0.29±0.12, all P < 0.05], and CCR2 expression and the proportion of Ly6C monocyte was significantly increased from 3 hours of high VT ventilation [CCR2/GAPDH: 0.84±0.19 vs. 0.24±0.11, Ly6C monocyte proportion: (9.01±2.47)% vs. (1.06±0.35)%, both P < 0.05], and they all showed an increased tendency with the time extension.

After a single gavage of sodium selenite, a concentration of Se in plasma and tissues was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at different time points. Through fitting the data with the  kinetic model, the corresponding kinetic parameters were determined for plasma and tissues, including kidney, liver, heart, muscle, and gonad. While the  kinetics of sodium selenite in plasma, liver, and kidney of rats was well reflected by a two-compartment open model, that in heart and gonad was fitted to a one-compartment open model, and that in muscle was fitted to a one-compartment open model with a lag time. The results indicate that sodium selenite was absorbed by plasma and tissues quickly and was eliminated slowly after intragastric administration. Based on the results, we propose that multi-supplementation of Se with low dosage is superior to single supplementation with high dosage, in terms of avoiding selenosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655737>Multiple degrees of separation in the central  of the catabolism of aromatic compounds in fungi belonging to the Dikarya sub-Kingdom.</a></h2><p>The diversity and abundance of aromatic compounds in nature is crucial for proper  in all biological systems, and also impacts greatly the development of many industrial processes. Naturally, understanding their catabolism becomes fundamental for many scientific fields of research, from clinical and environmental to technological. The genetic basis of the central  for the catabolism of aromatic compounds in fungi, particularly of benzene derivatives, remains however poorly understood largely overlooking their significance. In some Dikarya species the genes of the central  are clustered in the genome, often in an array with peripheral pathway genes, even if the existence of a specific pathway does not necessarily mean that the composing genes are clustered. The current availability of many annotated fungal genomes in the postgenomic era creates conditions to reach a more holistic view of these processes through target analysis of the central  gene clusters. Inspired by this, we have critically analyzed the established biochemical and genetic data on the catabolism of aromatic compounds in Dikarya after dissecting the presence and distribution of central catabolic gene clusters (at times including also details on gene diversity, order and orientation) and of peripheral genes. Our methodological approach illustrates the multiple degrees of separation in these central  gene clusters across Dikarya. Surprisingly, they show a great degree of similarity irrespectively of the Dikarya division, emphasizing that knowledge established on either phyla can guide the identification of clusters of comparable composition (in-cluster plus peripheral genes) in uncharacterized species.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined whether PKCα regulates recovery of mitochondrial and kidney functions after ischemia-induced acute injury (AKI) in vivo. Markers of kidney injury were increased after bilateral ischemia and returned to normal levels in wild-type (WT) mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complexes and F F -ATPase decreased after ischemia and recovered in WT mice. Reperfusion after ischemia was accompanied by translocation of active PKCα to mitochondria. PKCα deletion reduced mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complex I and F F -ATPase in non-injured kidneys, indicating that PKCα is essential in developing fully functional renal mitochondria. These changes in PKCα-deficient mice were accompanied by lower levels of complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) and the γ-subunit of F F -ATPase. Also, lack of PKCα exacerbated ischemia-induced decreases in respiration, complex I and F F -ATPase activities, and blocked their recovery after injury, indicating a crucial role of PKCα in promoting mitochondrial recovery after AKI. Further, PKCα deletion exacerbated acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins of energy  after ischemia due to decreases in deacetylase and desuccinylase (sirtuin3 and sirtuin5) levels in renal mitochondria. Thus, our data show a novel role for PKCα in regulating levels of mitochondrial sirtuins and acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that PKCα deletion: 1) affects renal physiology by decreasing mitochondrial capacity for maximum respiration, 2) blocks recovery of mitochondrial functions, renal morphology and functions after AKI, and 3) decreases survival after AKI.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657685>Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of cerebral frontal lobe tissue indentified RNA  dysregulation as one potential pathogenic mechanism in cerebral autosomal dominant.</a></h2><p>Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is an important cause of stroke and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), leading to subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. As a hereditary form of SVD with early onset, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) represents a pure form of SVD and may thus serve as a model disease for SVD. To date, underlying molecular mechanisms linking vascular pathology and subsequent neuronal damage in SVD are incompletely understood.We performed comparative transcriptional profiling microarray and proteomic analyses on post-mortem frontal lobe specimen from 2 CADASIL patients and 5 non neurologically diseased controls in order to identify dysregulated  potentially involved in the development of tissue damage in CADASIL.Transcriptional microarray analysis of material extracted from frontal grey and white matter (WM) identified subsets of up- or down-regulated genes enriched into biological  mostly in WM areas.

We comprehensively searched the ancient medical records to identify empirical evidence; conducted a systematic review (SR) based on moderate- to high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to synthesize the clinical evidence; and reviewed the possible mechanisms of its antidiabetic effects. Empirical application of  in treating diabetic symptoms dated back to more than 2000 years ago. Common herbs used in RCTs that accompany with  included Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae, Radix et Rhizoma Ginseng, Rhizoma Dioscoreae, Poria, and Radix Ophiopogonis. The combinations used today are consistent with their usage in ancient times. Results of the SR showed that GGFs could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes for blood glucose control. When in combination with hypoglycemic agents or insulin, GGFs enhanced the glucose-lowering effect as well as the lipid-lowering effects. Also, the incidence and the risk of adverse events (AE), especially the hypoglycemic episodes, were lower in the combination group. No serious or life-threatening AE was reported. The experimental evidence presented that  and GGFs might exert and enhance the anti-diabetic effects through activation of multiple mechanisms, such as reducing insulin resistance, increasing insulin release, inhibiting glucose absorption and reabsorption, and improving insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake, and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661531>Transcript profile of skeletal muscle lipid  genes affected by diet in a piglet model of low birth weight.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated skeletal muscle  (DSMM) is associated with increased inter- and intramuscular fat deposition in low birth weight (L) individuals. The mechanisms behind DSMM in L individuals are not completely understood but decreased muscle mass and shifts in lipid and carbohydrate utilisation may contribute. Previously, we observed lower fat oxidation in a porcine model of low birth weight. To elucidate the biological activities underpinning this difference microfluidic arrays were used to assess mRNA associated with lipid  in longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) skeletal muscle samples from thirty-six female L and normal birth weight (N) pigs. Plasma samples were collected from a sub-population to measure metabolite concentrations. Following overnight fasting, skeletal muscle and plasma samples were collected and the association with birth weight, diet and age was assessed. Reduced dietary fat was associated with decreased LD intermuscular fat deposition and beta-oxidation associated mRNA, in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake and intramuscular fat deposition associated mRNA was reduced in only L pigs. Abundance of ST mRNA associated with lipolysis, lipid synthesis and transport increased in both birth weight groups. Lipid uptake associated mRNA reduced in only L pigs. These changes were associated with decreased plasma L glucose and N triacylglycerol. Post-dietary fat reduction, LD mRNA associated with lipid synthesis and inter- and intramuscular fat deposition increased in L, whilst beta-oxidation associated mRNA remains elevated for longer in N. In the ST, mRNA associated with lipolysis and intramuscular fat deposition increased in both birth weight groups, however this increase was more significant in L pigs and associated with reduced beta-oxidation. Analysis of muscle lipid  associated mRNA revealed that profile shifts are a consequence of birth weight. Whilst, many of the adaptions to diet and age appear to be similar in birth weight groups, the magnitude of response and individual changes underpin the previously observed lower fat oxidation in L pigs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661737>Project profile: a multicenter study on breast cancer in young women in Latin America (PRECAMA study).</a></h2><p>To describe the rationale and the methodology of a multicenter project to study the etiology of breast cancer in young Latin American women.The International Agency for Research on Cancer has established an international collaborative population-based case-control study in four countries in Latin America: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico (the PRECAMA study).

However, there have been concerns regarding calorie deficits in fulfilling resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing MNT as defined by 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.To measure REE in patients with type 2 diabetes and verify the validity of MNT with 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 52 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age was 65.9 ± 7.3 years, body weight 65.0 ± 11.3 kg, body mass index 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m ). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry.Mean REE was 1601.0 ± 253.1 kcal/day. Assuming that all patients strictly observed daily energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW/day, 41 of 52 patients (78.9%) did not reach their REE. The greater the body weight, the greater the difference between assumed energy intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW and REE.We call attention to the potential risk of total dietary energy intake set to 25 kcal/kg IBW/day. Clinicians should carefully plan MNT to not fall below patient's REE to prevent sarcopenia and ensure MNT continuity.© 2019 The Authors.

Glutamine (Gln) has been documented to play a critical role in tumor growth. In this study, we aimed to to explore the mechanisms through which bladder cancer cells utilize Gln to fulfill their biosynthetic needs during proliferation. In addition, the roles of Gln in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression were examined in vitro in the T24 bladder cancer cell line. The results revealed that the T24 cell line was markedly Gln‑dependent and that Gln supplementation promoted T24 proliferation through the actions of Gln as a ROS moderator and as a  fuel in the TCA cycle. Importantly, extracellular Gln deprivation deregulated the production of the transcription factor, STAT3. Additionally, STAT3 expression was affected by the degree of Gln , as regulated by Gln intermediates and ROS. Thus, on the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Gln promotes the proliferation of the Gln‑dependent bladder cancer cell line, T24, by supplementing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and neutralizing ROS to activate the STAT3 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related  abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related  indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid , transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid  including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid . Our studies indicate that cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657332>[Effects of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (CORM-2) on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats.140 healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into sham operation (Sham) group, model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, inactivated carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (iCORM) pretreatment group, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group by random number table, with 28 rats in each group. The rat sepsis model was reproduced by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The rats in the Sham group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of normal saline (NS). The rats in the CORM-2 and iCORM-2 pretreatment groups were injected intraperitoneally with 8 mg/kg CORM-2 or iCORM-2 at 1 hour before LPS injection, respectively, and those in the DMSO group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of DMSO, but the rats in the Sham group and the model group were not treated after injection of NS or LPS. Twenty rats were randomly selected from each group to observe 10-day survival rate. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the remaining 8 rats at 12 hours after modeling, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) were calculated to evaluate heart function. The blood of the inferior vena cava was harvested, then serum myocardial troponin I (cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then the rats were sacrificed, and the myocardial tissues were harvested, the pathological morphology and ultrastructure of myocardium were observed.(1) Survival rates: all rats in the Sham group survived; compared with the Sham group, the survival rates of the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased at 10 days [10% (2/20), 70% (14/20), 25% (5/20), 15% (3/20) vs. 100% (20/20), all P < 0.01]. However, the 10-day survival rate in the CORM-2 pretreatment group was significantly higher than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group (all P < 0.01). (2) Cardiac function: compared with the Sham group, LVEF and LVFS in the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased, and left ventricular dilatation was obvious, indicating myocardial dysfunction in rats. However, LVEF and LVFS in the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly higher than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group, and DMSO control group [LVEF: 0.760±0.029 vs. 0.634±0.021, 0.629±0.066, 0.673±0.023; LVFS: (39.32±2.38)% vs. (29.75±1.52)%, (29.61±4.15)%, (32.43±1.66)%, all P < 0.05], and the left ventricular dilatation in the septic rats was attenuated. (3) Myocardial injury markers: compared with the Sham group, serum cTnI and BNP levels were significantly higher in the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group. However, the levels of cTnI and BNP in the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly lower than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group [cTnI (ng/L): 3 283.54±803.50 vs. 6 449.18±1 105.10, 5 919.21±1 068.27, 6 349.80±1 153.08; BNP (ng/L): 3 456.62±905.85 vs. 6 070.18±1 287.62, 5 581.13±1 161.17, 5 974.89±988.89, all P < 0.05].

Transmission electron microscopy showed mitochondrial swelling, and some vacuoles changed. But the myocardial pathological morphology and mitochondrial ultrastructural integrity of the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly better than other groups of sepsis.CORM-2 can attenuate myocardial dysfunction and improve survival rate of septic rats, especially to protect myocardial mitochondrial integrity in sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659054>Passive membrane transport of lignin-related compounds.</a></h2><p>Lignin is an abundant aromatic polymer found in plant secondary cell walls. In recent years, lignin has attracted renewed interest as a feedstock for bio-based chemicals via catalytic and biological approaches and has emerged as a target for genetic engineering to improve lignocellulose digestibility by altering its composition. In lignin biosynthesis and microbial conversion, small phenolic lignin precursors or degradation products cross membrane bilayers through an unidentified translocation mechanism prior to incorporation into lignin polymers (synthesis) or catabolism (bioconversion), with both passive and transporter-assisted mechanisms postulated. To test the passive permeation potential of these phenolics, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for 69 monomeric and dimeric lignin-related phenolics with 3 model membranes to determine the membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients for each compound. The results support an accessible passive permeation mechanism for most compounds, including monolignols, dimeric phenolics, and the flavonoid, tricin. Computed lignin partition coefficients are consistent with concentration enrichment near lipid carbonyl groups, and permeability coefficients are sufficient to keep pace with cellular . Interactions between methoxy and hydroxy groups are found to reduce membrane partitioning and improve permeability. Only carboxylate-modified or glycosylated lignin phenolics are predicted to require transporters for membrane translocation. Overall, the results suggest that most lignin-related compounds can passively traverse plant and microbial membranes on timescales commensurate with required biological activities, with any potential transport regulation mechanism in lignin synthesis, catabolism, or bioconversion requiring compound functionalization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657086>PRRX1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma activates the  reprogramming of free fatty acids to promote invasion and metastasis.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidences demonstrate a close correlation between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction and cancer lipid . However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clarified.In our study, the relative expression level of PRRX1 was detected, its relationship with free fatty acid (FFA) and PPARG2 was analysed in 85 SACC tissues and 15 salivary glands from the benign salivary tumours. We also compared the FFAs composition and levels in these SACC cells. PPARG2 was detected in PRRX1-induced FFAs treatment as well as Src and MMP-9 were detected in FFAs treatment-induced invasion and migration of SACC cells, and ChIP test was performed to identify the target interactions.Our data showed that overexpression of PRRX1 induced EMT and facilitated the invasion and migration of SACC cells, and PRRX1 expression was closely associated with high FFAs level and poor prognosis of SACC patients. Furthermore, PRRX1 silence led to the increase of PPARG2 and the reduction of FFAs level and the migration and invasion of SACC cells. And inhibition of PPARG2 rescued FFAs level and migration and invasion capabilities of SACC cells. Free fatty acids treatment induced an increase of Stat5-DNA binding activity via Src- and MMP-9-dependent pathway.Collectively, our findings showed that the PRRX1/PPARG2/FFAs signalling in SACC was important for accelerating tumour metastasis through the induction of EMT and the  reprogramming of FFAs.© 2019 The Authors.

To characterize as-yet-unknown pathophysiologies of schizophrenia, we undertook proteomics analysis of the brain in these strains, and detected elevated levels of Mpst, a hydrogen sulfide (H S)/polysulfide-producing enzyme, and greater sulfide deposition in C3H than B6 mice. Mpst-deficient mice exhibited improved PPI with reduced storage sulfide levels, while Mpst-transgenic (Tg) mice showed deteriorated PPI, suggesting that "sulfide stress" may be linked to PPI impairment. Analysis of human samples demonstrated that the H S/polysulfides production system is upregulated in schizophrenia. Mechanistically, the Mpst-Tg brain revealed dampened energy , while maternal immune activation model mice showed upregulation of genes for H S/polysulfides production along with typical antioxidative genes, partly via epigenetic modifications. These results suggest that inflammatory/oxidative insults in early brain development result in upregulated H S/polysulfides production as an antioxidative response, which in turn cause deficits in bioenergetic processes. Collectively, this study presents a novel aspect of the neurodevelopmental theory for schizophrenia, unraveling a role of excess H S/polysulfides production.© 2019 The Authors.

While the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is well recognized for its peripheral effects on reproductive behavior, release of OXT from somatodendrites and axonal terminals within the central nervous system (CNS) is also implicated in the control of control of energy balance. In this review we summarize historical data highlighting the effects of exogenous OXT as a short-term regulator of food intake in a context specific manner and the receptor populations that may mediate these effects. We also describe what is known about the physiological role of endogenous OXT in the control of energy balance and whether serum and brain levels of OXT relate to obesity on a consistent basis across animal models and humans with obesity. We describe recent data on the effectiveness of chronic CNS administration of OXT to decrease food intake and weight gain or to elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically obese mice and rats. Of clinical importance is the finding that both chronic central and peripheral OXT treatment evoke weight loss in obese animal models with impaired leptin signaling at doses that are not associated with visceral illness, tachyphylaxis, or adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these results have been largely recapitulated following chronic subcutaneous or intranasal treatment in DIO nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) and obese humans, respectively. We also identify plausible mechanisms that contribute to the effects of OXT on body weight and glucose homeostasis in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. We conclude by describing ongoing challenges that remain in order for OXT-based therapeutics to be used as a long-term strategy to treat obesity in humans.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659056>Plant defense resistance in natural enemies of a specialist insect herbivore.</a></h2><p>Plants defend themselves against herbivores through the production of toxic and deterrent metabolites. Adapted herbivores can tolerate and sometimes sequester these metabolites, allowing them to feed on defended plants and become toxic to their own enemies. Can herbivore natural enemies overcome sequestered plant defense metabolites to prey on adapted herbivores? To address this question, we studied how entomopathogenic nematodes cope with benzoxazinoid defense metabolites that are produced by grasses and sequestered by a specialist maize herbivore, the western corn rootworm. We find that nematodes from US maize fields in regions in which the western corn rootworm was present over the last 50 y are behaviorally and metabolically resistant to sequestered benzoxazinoids and more infective toward the western corn rootworm than nematodes from other parts of the world. Exposure of a benzoxazinoid-susceptible nematode strain to the western corn rootworm for 5 generations results in higher behavioral and  resistance and benzoxazinoid-dependent infectivity toward the western corn rootworm. Thus, herbivores that are exposed to a plant defense sequestering herbivore can evolve both behavioral and  resistance to plant defense metabolites, and these traits are associated with higher infectivity toward a defense sequestering herbivore. We conclude that plant defense metabolites that are transferred through adapted herbivores may result in the evolution of resistance in herbivore natural enemies. Our study also identifies plant defense resistance as a potential target for the improvement of biological control agents.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

GT in primary‑cultured chondrocytes enhances expression of type II collagen, an indicator of differentiation, and cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2), which mediates inflammatory reactions. In contrast, 2DG reduces type II collagen and COX‑2 expression while driving ER‑stress‑induced unglycosylation. In the present study, it was investigated whether GT could attenuate 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress. Following treatment with GT and 2DG, chondrocytes were assessed using western blotting, RT‑PCR, immunofluorescence, and alcian blue staining. GT restored type II collagen expression that was reduced by 2DG, inhibited ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation, and induced COX‑2 expression. The expression of a glucose‑regulated protein, GRP78, which is an indicator of reduced ER‑stress, was decreased. To link the GT signaling pathway with  that inhibit 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress, inhibitors were treated in chondrocytes. The results revealed that, among the different signaling  triggered by ER‑stress, the p38 kinase pathway was involved in the inositol‑requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) downstream signaling pathway. Following inhibition of the IRE1 pathway, type II collagen expression was increased and COX‑2 expression was decreased. In addition, after examining the splicing of X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1) which is dependent on IRE1 activation induced by ER‑stress, it was revealed that GT inhibited the increase of XBP‑1s after splicing due to 2DG‑induced ER stress. GT in chondrocytes inhibited 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation while regulating differentiation and inflammation via the ER‑stress‑induced p38 kinase pathway downstream from the IRE1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657331>[Effect of autophagy on expression of neutrophil programmed death ligand-1 in mice with sepsis].</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect and mechanism of autophagy on the expression of neutrophil programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in mice with sepsis.(1) In vivo experiment: male C57BL/6 mice aged 6-8 weeks were divided into sham operation group (Sham group), cecum ligation and perforation (CLP) group, and rapamycin (RAP)+CLP group by random number table with 10 mice in each group. The sepsis model was reproduced by CLP, and the cecum and perforation were not ligated in Sham group, and other operations were the same as CLP group. The mice in RAP+CLP group were intraperitoneally injected with autophagy agonist RAP 4 mg×kg×d 7 days before modeling, while the mice in Sham group and CLP group were not treated. Lung, liver, spleen and pancreas tissues were harvested for immunohistochemical staining 4 days after the operation, and the infiltration of neutrophils in various organs was observed under light microscope. Meanwhile, the expressions of immunosuppressive molecule PD-L1 and autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in lung neutrophils were determined by immunofluorescence staining. (2) In vitro experiment: mouse bone marrow neutrophils were extracted and re-suspended to 1×10/L, and they were divided into blank control group (without any treatment), RAP control group (RAP 100 μmol/L), autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Baf) control group (Baf 10 μmol/L), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation group (LPS 1 mg /L), RAP+LPS group, and Baf+LPS group. The latter two groups were pretreated with 100 μmol/L RAP or 10 μmol/L Baf 30 minutes before LPS stimulation, respectively. The expression of PD-L1 mRNA of neutrophils was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 0, 4, 12 hours after LPS stimulation. At the same time, the expressions of PD-L1, LC3 and p62 at the protein level were determined by Western Blot.(1) In vivo experiment: according to immunohistochemical experiments, a large amount of infiltration of neutrophils in lung, liver, spleen and pancreas was found at 4 hours after CLP. In the immunofluorescence, with the time extension after CLP, the positive expression of LC3 in the lung tissue showed a decreased tendency, and PD-L1 expression was significantly increased. RAP pretreatment could promote the expression of LC3 and reduce the expression of PD-L1 in CLP mice. (2) In vitro experiment: in terms of mRNA levels, with the extension of LPS stimulation time, the expression of PD-L1 mRNA in mouse neutrophils was increased continuously, and peaked at 12 hours, it was significantly higher than that in the blank control group (2: 72.2±10.0 vs. 13.0±0.8, P < 0.01). Compared with LPS stimulation group, the expression of PD-L1 mRNA in RAP+LPS group was significantly down-regulated [12-hour PD-L1 mRNA (2): 47.4±7.3 vs. 72.2±10.0, P < 0.01]. In Baf+LPS group, PD-L1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated as compared with that in LPS stimulation group [12-hour PD-L1 mRNA (2): 109.1±7.4 vs. 72.2±10.0, P < 0.01]. At the protein levels, at 4 hours after LPS stimulation, the positive expressions of PD-L1, LC3 and p62 were increased significantly as compared with those in the blank control group, and PD-L1 and p62 were increased continuously with time. Compared with the LPS stimulation group, the expressions of PD-L1 and p62 in the RAP+LPS group were significantly down-regulated, while the expression of LC3 was continually increased, indicating that the level of autophagy was increased, and autophagy was circulated smoothly. On the contrary, the expressions of PD-L1, LC3 and p62 in the Baf+LPS group were significantly up-regulated, indicating that the binding of autophagy and lysosome was blocked, and autophagy was not smooth.In sepsis, the infiltration of neutrophils in all organs increased, and the expression of PD-L1 of neutrophils in lungs was increased significantly, while the expression level of autophagy was decreased. The expression of PD-L1 stimulated by LPS can be inhibited by autophagy agonists, and promoted by autophagy inhibitors. PD-L1 has a negative regulatory effect on sepsis. It can reduce the expression of PD-L1 molecule in sepsis by targeting autophagy, so as to improve sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661127>Prognostic implications of aberrantly expressed methylation‑driven genes in hepatocellular carcinoma: A study based on The Cancer Genome Atlas.</a></h2><p>RNA‑Sequencing and methylation data for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct a prognostic risk model of HCC. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the clinical utility of the risk model. A total of 238 methylation‑driven genes were successfully identified from cancer and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis indicated that these genes functioned in the extracellular space, interfering with lipid  in hepatocytes and regulating adaptive immune responses. In total, 14 relevant  were identified. The following prognostic risk model was generated: Risk score=CALML3 (degree of methylation) x (‑4.860) + CCNI2 x (2.071) + TNFRSF12A x (‑3.369) + IFITM1 x (1.203) + ENPP7P13 x (‑1.366) + DDT x (2.139) + RASAL2‑AS1 x (‑1.384) + ANKRD22 x (‑3.215). The median risk score (0.970) derived from this model was set as cutoff value for assigning patients to high‑ or low‑risk group. The 5‑year survival rate was 35.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.1‑47.4%] in the high‑risk group and 61.7% (95% CI=51.4‑74.2%) in the low‑risk group (P<0.0001). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.742, indicating that this model is appropriate for predicting the survival rate of patients. Furthermore, the methylation and expression levels of two key genes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12A and D‑dopachrome decarboxylase, were significantly associated with prognosis and were correlated with cg00510447, cg26808293, cg11060661 and cg16132339 methylation. In conclusion, a prognostic risk model for HCC is proposed based on the bioinformatic analysis of methylation‑driven genes. The findings of the present study may improve understanding of the pathogenesis and prognosis of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659686>Salicibibacter halophilus sp. nov., a moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from kimchi.</a></h2><p>A Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped, alkalitolerant, and halophilic bacterium-designated as strain NKC3-5-was isolated from kimchi that was collected from the Geumsan area in the Republic of Korea. Cells of isolated strain NKC3-5 were 0.5-0.7 μm wide and 1.4-2.8 μm long. The strain NKC3-5T could grow at up to 20.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 10%), pH 6.5-10.0 (optimum pH 9.0), and 25-40°C (optimum 35°C). The cells were able to reduce nitrate under aerobic conditions, which is the first report in the genus Salicibibacter. The genome size and genomic G + C content of strain NKC3-5 were 3,754,174 bp and 45.9 mol%, respectively; it contained 3,630 coding sequences, 16S rRNA genes (six 16S, five 5S, and five 23S), and 59 tRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA showed that strain NKC3-5 clustered with bacterium Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1, with a similarity of 96.2-97.6%, but formed a distinct branch with other published species of the family Bacillaceae. In addition, OrthoANI value between strain NKC3-5 and Salicibibacter kimchii NKC1-1 was far lower than the species demarcation threshold. Using functional genome annotation, the result found that carbohydrate, amino acid, and vitamin  related genes were highly distributed in the genome of strain NKC3-5. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that strain NKC3-5 had 716 pan-genome orthologous groups (POGs), dominated with carbohydrate . Phylogenomic analysis based on the concatenated core POGs revealed that strain NKC3-5 was closely related to Salicibibacter kimchii. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified lipids. Anteiso-C, iso-C, anteiso-C, and iso-C were the major cellular fatty acids, and menaquinone-7 was the major isoprenoid quinone present in strain NKC3-5. Cell wall peptidoglycan analysis of strain NKC3-5 showed that meso-diaminopimelic acid was the diagnostic diamino acid. The phephenotypic, genomic, phylogenetic, and chemotaxonomic properties reveal that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Salicibibacter, for which the name Salicibibacter halophilus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain NKC3-5 (= KACC 21230 = JCM 33437).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658163>Estimation of External Dose Rates to Hotel Workers from bed linens Contaminated by 131I Patients.</a></h2><p>Iodine-131 is commonly used in medical diagnosis and therapy for patients with hyperthyroidism or differentiated thyroid cancer. Following treatment, patients may recuperate in a hotel room to avoid exposing family members. The main purpose of this study was to estimate external effective dose rate coefficients to a hotel worker who handles potentially contaminated bed linens due to secretions from I patients as sweat or urine. The external dose rate estimates were derived using Monte Carlo radiation transport code and the phantom with movable arms and legs to model a housekeeper standing in an upright position holding a pile of bed linens. Simulations further integrated the body burden of time-dependent biokinetic  of I in the patient's body, differentiating between biokinetic excretion models of hyperthyroid vs. cancer patients. Organ absorbed dose rate and effective dose rate coefficients were calculated for three scenarios of bed linen contamination and estimated out to 5 d postadministration and compared to past I patient contamination measurements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659255>Aneuploidy-inducing gene knockdowns overlap with cancer mutations and identify Orp3 as a B-cell lymphoma suppressor.</a></h2><p>Aneuploidy can instigate tumorigenesis. However, mutations in genes that control chromosome segregation are rare in human tumors as these mutations reduce cell fitness. Screening experiments indicate that the knockdown of multiple classes of genes that are not directly involved in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy induction. The possible contribution of these genes to cancer formation remains yet to be defined. Here we identified gene knockdowns that lead to an increase in aneuploidy in checkpoint-deficient human cancer cells. Computational analysis revealed that the identified genes overlap with recurrent mutations in human cancers. The knockdown of the three strongest selected candidate genes (ORP3, GJB3, and RXFP1) enhances the malignant transformation of human fibroblasts in culture. Furthermore, the knockout of Orp3 results in an aberrant expansion of lymphoid progenitor cells and a high penetrance formation of chromosomal instable, pauci-clonal B-cell lymphoma in aging mice. At pre-tumorous stages, lymphoid cells from the animals exhibit deregulated phospholipid  and an aberrant induction of proliferation regulating  associating with increased aneuploidy in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Together, these results support the concept that aneuploidy-inducing gene deficiencies contribute to cellular transformation and carcinogenesis involving the deregulation of various molecular processes such as lipid , proliferation, and cell survival.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659241>Target site as the main mechanism of resistance to imazamox in a Euphorbia heterophylla biotype.</a></h2><p>Euphorbia heterophylla is a weed species that invades extensive crop areas in subtropical regions of Brazil. This species was previously controlled by imazamox, but the continuous use of this herbicide has selected for resistant biotypes. Two biotypes of E. heterophylla from southern Brazil, one resistant (R) and one susceptible (S) to imazamox, were compared. The resistance of the R biotype was confirmed by dose-response assays since it required 1250.2 g ai ha to reduce the fresh weight by 50% versus 7.4 g ai ha for the S biotype. The acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme activity was studied using ALS-inhibiting herbicides from five different chemical families. The R biotype required the highest concentrations to reduce this enzyme activity by 50%. A Ser653Asn mutation was found in the ALS gene of the R biotype. The experiments carried out showed that imazamox absorption and  were not involved in resistance. However, greater C-imazamox root exudation was found in the R biotype (~70% of the total absorbed imazamox). Target site mutation in the ALS gene is the principal mechanism that explains the imazamox resistance of the R biotype, but root exudation seems to also contribute to the resistance of this biotype.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656199>Reduced expression of PD-L1 in autoimmune thyroiditis attenuate trophoblast invasion through ERK/MMP pathway.</a></h2><p>Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) with euthyroid is associated with miscarriage. But the exact mechanism remains unclear. Studies have shown that the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death -ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway is essential for normal pregnancy. However, the expression of PD-L1 in gestational trophoblasts in mice with autoimmune thyroiditis and the mechanisms leading to miscarriage have not been fully investigated.Immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to detect the expression of PD-L1, p-ERK, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in embryonic trophoblast cells of pregnant mice with AIT. The expression of PD-L1 in HTR-8/SVneo cells were silenced, and the expression of PD-L1, MMP-2, MMP-9, ERK and p-ERK1/2 was detected by Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence assays. Invasive assays were performed in PD-L1 silenced HTR-8/SVneo cells using a Transwell chamber.Compared with normal pregnancy, the expression of PD-L1, ERK, p-ERK, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in embryonic trophoblast cells was significantly lower in pregnant mice with AIT. Compared with the negative control (NC) group (cells transfected with negative control siRNA), phosphorylation of MMP-2, MMP-9 and P-ERK1/2 proteins was significantly reduced in HTR-8/SVneo cells transfected with PD-L1 siRNA, and the number of cells penetrating the membrane was reduced.AIT inhibits ERK/MMP-2 and MMP-9  through PD-L1 reduction, attenuates embryonic trophoblast invasion and ultimalely induces miscarriage ultimately.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661721>Metabolomic Investigations of the Temporal Effects of Exposure to Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products and their Mixture in the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica).</a></h2><p>The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) supports a large aquaculture industry and is a keystone species along the Atlantic seaboard. Native oysters are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of contaminants that increasingly includes pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Unfortunately, the biological effects of chemical mixtures on oysters are poorly understood. Untargeted GC-MS metabolomics was utilized to quantify the response of oysters exposed to fluoxetine, N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), diphenhydramine, and their mixture. Oysters were exposed to 1 µg/L of each chemical or mixture for ten days, followed by an eight-day depuration period. Adductor muscle (n = 14/treatment) was sampled at days 0, 1, 5, 10 and 18. Trajectory analysis illustrated that  effects and class separation of the treatments varied at each time point and that overall, the oysters were only able to partially recover from these exposures post-depuration. Altered metabolites were associated with cellular energetics (i.e., Krebs cycle intermediates), as well as amino acid  and the urea cycle. Exposure to these PPCPs also affected   associated with anaerobic , osmotic stress, and oxidative stress, in addition to the physiological effects of each chemical's postulated mechanism of action. Following depuration, there were fewer metabolites altered, but none of the treatments returned to their initial control values, indicating that  disruptions were long-lasting. Interestingly, the mixture did not directly cluster with individual treatments in the scores plot from partial least squares discriminant analysis, and many of its affected   were not well-predicted from the individual treatments. This research highlights the utility of untargeted metabolomics in developing exposure biomarkers for compounds with different modes of action in bivalves. This article is protected by copyright.

BMD is a heritable trait, more than 70% of its variability among a population is affected by genetic factors.In the present study, we wanted to investigate the association between estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) polymorphisms, PvuII (rs2234693) and XbaI (rs9340799), and bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and also of the total body less the head in Iranian children.The ESR1 gene PvuII and XbaI genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Bone area, BMC, BMD, and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Linear regression was carried out to examine the effects of the ESR1 (PvuII and XbaI) polymorphisms on DEXA outputs when adjusted for confounding factors (i.e., age, sex, BMI, and pubertal stage) in 3 models.ESR1 (PvuII) gene polymorphisms (CT vs. CC) showed significant effects on the BMC of the total body less the head in all 3 models. For ESR1 (XbaI), individuals with the AG genotype had higher lumbar spine BMD and lumbar spine BMAD compared to other genotypes.It seems that the PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms of ESR1 could be associated with BMC and BMD variation in Iranian children and adolescents.© 2019 S.

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every 5 days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial energy balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced  depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of energy assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher energy efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected  performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the function of endogenous adipose tissue-derived omentin-1 in arterial calcification and the detailed mechanism involved.

Here, we aim to analyse a panel of circulating miRNAs in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and individuals with type 1 diabetes.We adopted standardised methodologies for extracting miRNAs from small sample volumes to evaluate a profiling panel of mature miRNAs in paired plasma and laser-captured microdissected immune-infiltrated islets of recently diabetic and normoglycaemic NOD mice. Moreover, we validated the findings during disease progression and remission after anti-CD3 therapy in NOD mice, as well as in individuals with type 1 diabetes.Plasma levels of five miRNAs were downregulated in diabetic vs normoglycaemic mice. Of those, miR-409-3p was also downregulated in situ in the immune islet infiltrates of diabetic mice, suggesting an association with disease pathogenesis. Target-prediction tools linked miR-409-3p to immune- and -related signalling molecules. In situ miR-409-3p expression correlated with insulitis severity, and CD8 central memory T cells were found to be enriched in miR-409-3p. Plasma miR-409-3p levels gradually decreased during diabetes development and improved with disease remission after anti-CD3 antibody therapy. Finally, plasma miR-409-3p levels were lower in people recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes compared with a non-diabetic control group, and levels were inversely correlated with HbA levels.We propose that miR-409-3p may represent a new circulating biomarker of islet inflammation and type 1 diabetes severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655540>Dynamic  modelling of overproduced protein secretion in Streptomyces lividans using adaptive DFBA.</a></h2><p>Streptomyces lividans is an appealing host for the production of proteins of biotechnological interest due to its relaxed exogenous DNA restriction system and its ability to secrete proteins directly to the medium through the major Sec or the minor Tat routes. Often, protein secretion displays non-uniform time-dependent patterns. Understanding the associated  changes is a crucial step to engineer protein production. Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (DFBA) allows the study of the interactions between a modelled organism and its environment over time. Existing methods allow the specification of initial model and environment conditions, but do not allow introducing arbitrary modifications in the course of the simulation. Living organisms, however, display unexpected adaptive  behaviours in response to unpredictable changes in their environment. Engineering the secretion of products of biotechnological interest has systematically proven especially difficult to model using DFBA. Accurate time-dependent modelling of complex and/or arbitrary, adaptive  processes demands an extended approach to DFBA.In this work, we introduce Adaptive DFBA, a novel, versatile simulation approach that permits inclusion of changes in the organism or the environment at any time in the simulation, either arbitrary or interactively responsive to environmental changes. This approach extends traditional DFBA to allow steering arbitrarily complex simulations of  dynamics. When applied to Sec- or Tat-dependent secretion of overproduced proteins in S. lividans, Adaptive DFBA can overcome the limitations of traditional DFBA to reproduce experimental data on plasmid-free, plasmid bearing and secretory protein overproducing S. lividans TK24, and can yield useful insights on the behaviour of systems with limited experimental knowledge such as agarase or amylase overproduction in S. lividans TK21.Adaptive DFBA has allowed us to overcome DFBA limitations and to generate more accurate models of the  during the overproduction of secretory proteins in S. lividans, improving our understanding of the underlying processes. Adaptive DFBA is versatile enough to permit dynamical  simulations of arbitrarily complex biotechnological processes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659421>The growth and lutein accumulation in heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides provoked by waste Monascus fermentation broth feeding.</a></h2><p>Although the potential of heterotrophic microalgae served as a sustainable source for lutein, it was still crucial to formulate a suitable medium to offset the cost involved in algal biomass cultivation while improve inherent lutein productivity. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibilities of waste Monascus fermentation broth medium (MFBM) toward heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides-enriched lutein. The results indicated that C. protothecoides subjected to MFBM batch feeding achieved 7.1 g/L biomass and 7.27 mg/g lutein. The resulting lutein productivity (7.34 mg/L/day) represented 1.54-fold more than that of frequently used Basal medium. Concurrently, the effective  and absorption of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in MFBM by C. subellipsoidea cultivation make it easily complied with the permissible dischargeable limits for fermentation broth. When response to fed-batch culture mode, the biomass and lutein productivity peaked 20.4 g/L and 9.11 mg/L/day with concentrated MFBM feeding. Transcriptomics data hinted that MFBM feeding manipulated lutein biosynthesis key checkpoints (e.g., lycopene β-cyclase and lycopene ε-cyclase) while accelerated energy  (e.g., glycolysis and TCA cycle) to contribute such high lutein productivity in C. protothecoides. These encouraging findings not only provided indications in applying nutrient-rich fermentation broth for affordable microalgae cultivation but also presented possibilities in linking algal high value-added products like lutein with high-efficient biological nutrition removal from industrial fermentation processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658717>Oxygraphy Versus Enzymology for the Biochemical Diagnosis of Primary Mitochondrial Disease.</a></h2><p>Primary mitochondrial disease (PMD) is a large group of genetic disorders directly affecting mitochondrial function. Although next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the diagnosis of these disorders, biochemical tests remain essential and functional confirmation of the critical genetic diagnosis. While enzymological testing of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes remains the gold standard, oxygraphy could offer several advantages. To this end, we compared the diagnostic performance of both techniques in a cohort of 34 genetically defined PMD patient fibroblast cell lines. We observed that oxygraphy slightly outperformed enzymology for sensitivity (79 ± 17% versus 68 ± 15%, mean and 95% CI), and had a better discriminatory power, identifying 58 ± 17% versus 35 ± 17% as "very likely" for oxygraphy and enzymology, respectively. The techniques did, however, offer synergistic diagnostic prediction, as the sensitivity rose to 88 ± 11% when considered together. Similarly, the techniques offered varying defect specific information, such as the ability of enzymology to identify isolated OXPHOS deficiencies, while oxygraphy pinpointed PDHC mutations and captured POLG mutations that were otherwise missed by enzymology. In summary, oxygraphy provides useful information for the diagnosis of PMD, and should be considered in conjunction with enzymology for the diagnosis of PMD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661627>Associations between Folate  Enzyme Polymorphisms and Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Some previous studies already investigated potential associations between folate  enzyme polymorphisms and lung cancer (LC). However, the results of these studies were inconsistent. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to explore associations between folate  enzyme polymorphisms and LC in a larger pooled population. Systematic literature research of PubMed, WOS, Embase and CNKI was performed to identify eligible studies. Review Manager Version 5.3.3 was used to conduct statistical analyses. Totally 37 genetic association studies were included for analyses. The pooled analyses showed that  rs1801394 (dominant model:  = 0.01; recessive model:  = 0.04; allele model:  = 0.005) and  rs1801133 (dominant model:  = 0.008; recessive model:  = 0.0003; allele model:  = 0.0002) polymorphisms were both significantly associated with susceptibility to LC in overall population. Subgroup analyses revealed similar significant findings for  rs1801133 polymorphism in East Asians. Significant associations with LC were also observed for  rs1801394 and  rs1801133 polymorphisms in smokers. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that  rs1801394 was significantly associated with LC in smokers, and  rs1801133 polymorphisms was also significantly associated with LC in smokers and East Asians. These results suggested that these two polymorphisms could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing LC in certain populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659151>Preparation of a new type 2 diabetic miniature pig model via the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</a></h2><p>Diabetes has become one of the major noninfectious diseases that seriously endanger public health.

In animals, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists limit ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury by increasing extracellular adenosine formation and adenosine receptor stimulation. Adenosine is an endogenous compound with profound cardiovascular protective effects. We hypothesized that patients with PA have lower circulating adenosine levels which might contribute to the observed increased cardiovascular risk. Secondly, we hypothesized that by this mechanism, patients with PA are more susceptible to IR compared to patients with EHT.In our prospective study in 20 patients with PA and 20 patients with EHT, circulating adenosine was measured using a pharmacological blocker solution that halts adenosine  after blood drawing. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) before and after forearm IR was used as a well-established method to study IR injury.Patients with PA had a 33% lower adenosine level compared to patients with EHT (15.3 (13.3-20.4) versus 22.7 (19.4-36.8) nmol/l respectively, p<0.01). The reduction in FMD after IR however, did not differ between patients with PA and patients with EHT (-1.0 ± 2.9 % versus -1.6 ± 1.6 % respectively, p=0.52).As adenosine receptor stimulation induces various powerful protective cardiovascular effects, its lower concentration in patients with PA might be an important novel mechanism that contributes to their increased cardiovascular risk. We suggest that modulation of the adenosine  is an exciting novel pharmacological opportunity to limit cardiovascular risk in patients with PA that needs further exploration.© 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657746>Effects and transcriptional responses in the hepatopancreas of red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus under cold stress.</a></h2><p>The red claw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, is an economically important freshwater crustacean that cannot tolerate low temperature, which diminishes survival via unknown mechanisms. Herein, physiological regulation of C. quadricarinatus was investigated following exposure to low temperature stress at 9 ± 2 °C for 4 weeks. Hepatopancreas tissue was tested for nonspecific enzyme activity, histological structure, and transcriptome sequencing analyses. The results showed that the activities of nonspecific enzymes were inhibited following low temperature stress. Ultrastructural observation revealed that the hepatopancreas structure was oxidatively damaged at low temperature, with numerous autophagic vesicles visible. Apoptosis in the hepatopancreas was significantly increased in the cold stress group, indicating diminished function. Transcriptome sequencing identified 2615 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following low temperature stress, of which 1147 and 1468 were up- and down-regulated, respectively.

However, the relationship between the transcriptome and the dynamic regulation of early development is still uncharacterized in the bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis). In the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of six development stages in H. nobilis, aiming to understand the dynamic molecular regulation of early development in this fish.A total of 76,573 unigenes were assembled from clean sequence reads, with an average length of 1768 base. Among which, 41,742 (54.54%) unigenes were annotated to public protein databases, and an additional 59,014 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were identified among the unigenes. Furthermore, 30,199 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) (fold change > 4 or < 0.25, and the false discovery rate FDR < 0.01) were observed in comparisons between the adjacent developmental stages, and nine expression patterns (profiles) were simulated using series-cluster analysis across six developmental stages. The unigenes expression level markedly increased after the DS1 stage (early blastula), and the numbers of DETs gradually decreased during subsequent development. The largest transcriptomic change (up- or down-regulated) was detected during the period from DS1 to DS2 (6-somite stage), which was enriched for many biological processes and   related to maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). Distinctly protein-protein interaction (PPI)  were plotted for DETs during the period from DS1 to DS2. The genes (or proteins) from the same  were integrated together, and showed with obvious co-regulation patterns. In the series-cluster analysis, a remarkable profile of gene expression (profile_48) was identified that is probably related to the hatching during H. nobilis development, and the strict co-expression of a hatching enzyme gene (hce1) with 33 other annotated genes was identified from this profile.The results indicated that strict dynamic regulation occurs during the early development in H. nobilis, especially in embryogenesis before hatching. This study provides valuable new information and transcriptomic resources related to H. nobilis early development, and for certain events such as MZT and hatching.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661586>A novel MCT1 and MCT4 dual inhibitor reduces mitochondrial  and inhibits tumor growth of feline oral squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) support tumor growth by regulating the transport of metabolites in the tumor microenvironment. High MCT1 or MCT4 expression is correlated with poor outcomes in human patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Recently, drugs targeting these transporters have been developed and may prove to be an effective treatment strategy for HNSCC. Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is an aggressive and treatment-resistance malignancy resembling advanced or recurrent HNSCC. The goals of this study were to investigate the effects of a previously characterized dual MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitor, MD-1, in OSCC as a novel treatment approach for feline oral cancer. We also sought to determine the potential of feline OSCC as a large animal model for the further development of MCT inhibitors to treat human HNSCC. In vitro, MD-1 killed feline OSCC and human HNSCC cell lines, altered glycolytic and mitochondrial , and synergized with platinum-based chemotherapies. While MD-1 treatment increased lactate concentrations in an HNSCC cell line, the inhibitor failed to alter lactate levels in feline OSCC cells, suggesting an MCT-independent activity. In vivo, MD-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model and prolonged overall survival in an orthotopic model of feline OSCC. Our results show that MD-1 may be an effective therapy for the treatment of feline oral cancer. Our findings also support the further investigation of feline OSCC as a large animal model to inform the development of MCT inhibitors and future clinical studies in human HNSCC.

The recruitment process from bulk soil communities was identified as the major direct driver of the composition of active rhizosphere bacterial communities. Unexpectedly, the effect of soil properties, particularly soil texture, water content, and soil type, strongly dominated over plant properties and the composition of polar root exudates of the primary . While plant species-specific selection of bacteria was minor, the RNA-based composition of active rhizosphere bacteria substantially differed between rhizosphere and bulk soil. Although other variables could additionally be responsible for the consistent enrichment of particular bacteria in the rhizosphere, distinct bacterial OTUs were linked to the presence of specific polar root exudates independent of individual plant species. Our study also identified numerous previously unknown taxa that are correlated with rhizosphere dynamics and hence represent suitable targets for future manipulations of the plant rhizobiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658105>Correction: 18th International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen  Meeting Abstracts.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656670>Discovery of potential plasma protein biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction via proteomics.</a></h2><p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an acute disease with high mortality and seriously threatens human health. The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins, lipid  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Here we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) manipulation in rats that models a low resource environment to examine effects on growth, developmental milestones, and endocrine endpoints. In LBN, dams and pups, from pups' postnatal days 2-9, are exposed to a limited resource environment where dams lack proper materials to build a nest. This manipulation is compared to control housing conditions, where rat dams have access to ample nesting materials and enrichment throughout pups' development. We found that the LBN condition altered maternal care, increasing pup-directed behaviors while reducing self-care. This, perhaps compensatory, increase in nursing and attention to pups did not mitigate against changes in , as LBN reduced weight gain in both sexes and this effect persisted into adulthood. Although adult stress hormone levels in both sexes and vaginal opening and estrous cycle length in females were not disrupted, there was other evidence of endocrine dysregulation. Compared to controls, LBN rats of both sexes had shorted anogenital distances, indicating reduced androgen exposure. LBN males also had higher plasma estradiol levels in adulthood. This combination of results suggests that LBN causes a demasculinizing effect in males that could contribute to lasting changes in the brain and behavior. Importantly, alterations in  and endocrine systems due to early life adversity could be one mechanism by which stress early in life increases risk for later disease.© 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655769>Adrenal Imaging in Patients with Endocrine Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Hypertension is one of the commonest chronic diseases contributing to cardiovascular disease. Idiopathic (primary) hypertension accounts for approximately 85% of the diagnosed cases, and 15% of hypertensive patients have other contributing conditions leading to elevated blood pressure (secondary hypertension). Endocrine hypertension is a common secondary cause of hypertension. The most common causes of endocrine hypertension are excess production of mineralocorticoids (ie, primary hyperaldosteronism), glucocorticoids (Cushing syndrome), and catecholamines (pheochromocytoma).

Recently, the neurotrophin - brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) has implicated in SC regulation in animals. To date, little is known regarding the role of BDNF in human SC function in vivo. Twenty-nine males (21±0.5y) participated in the study. Muscle biopsies from the thigh were obtained prior to a bout of 300 maximal eccentric contractions (PRE), and 6h, 24h, 72h, and 96h of post-exercise. BDNF was not detected in any quiescent (Pax7+/MyoD-) SCs across the time-course. BDNF co-localized to 39±5% of proliferating (Pax7+/MyoD+) cells at PRE, which increased to 84±3% by 96h (P<0.05). BDNF was only detected in 13±5% of differentiating (Pax7-/MyoD+) cells at PRE, which increased to 67±4% by 96h (P<0.05). The number of Myogenin+ cells increased 95% from PRE (1.6±0.2 cells/100MF) at 24h (3.1±0.3 cells/100MF) and remained elevated until 96h (cells/100MF), p<0.05. The proportion of BDNF+/Myogenin+ cells was 26±0.3% at PRE, peaking at 24h (49±3%, p<0.05) and remained elevated at 96h (p<0.05). These data are the first to demonstrate an association between SC proliferation and differentiation and BDNF expression in humans in vivo, with BDNF co-localization to SCs increasing during the later stages of proliferation and early differentiation. Novelty: • BDNF is associated with SC response to muscle injury • BDNF was not detected in non-activated (quiescent) SCs • BDNF is associated with late proliferation and early differentiation of SCs in vivo in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655543>Comparative transcriptome and metabolome analyses provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying taproot thickening in Panax notoginseng.</a></h2><p>Taproot thickening is a complex biological process that is dependent on the coordinated expression of genes controlled by both environmental and developmental factors. Panax notoginseng is an important Chinese medicinal herb that is characterized by an enlarged taproot as the main organ of saponin accumulation. However, the molecular mechanisms of taproot enlargement are poorly understood.A total of 29,957 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during the thickening process in the taproots of P. notoginseng. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment revealed that DEGs associated with "plant hormone signal transduction," "starch and sucrose ," and "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis" were predominantly enriched. Further analysis identified some critical genes (e.g., RNase-like major storage protein, DA1-related protein, and Starch branching enzyme I) and metabolites (e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose, malate, and arginine) that potentially control taproot thickening. Several aspects including hormone crosstalk, transcriptional regulation, homeostatic regulation between sugar and starch, and cell wall , were identified as important for the thickening process in the taproot of P. notoginseng.The results provide a molecular regulatory network of taproot thickening in P. notoginseng and facilitate the further characterization of the genes responsible for taproot formation in root medicinal plants or crops.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658729>Sugar-Lowering Drugs for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and  Syndrome-Review of Classical and New Compounds: Part-I.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a  disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia together with disturbances in the  of carbohydrates, proteins and fat, which in general results from an insulin availability and need imbalance.

Night temperature is an important factor that influences the plug seedling quality. However, little research has focused on how the night temperature affects the growth and development of plug seedlings of these two medicinal species. In this study, uniform plug seedlings were cultivated in three environmentally controlled chambers for four weeks under three sets of day/night temperatures (25/10 °C, 25/15 °C, or 25/20 °C), the same relative humidity (75%), photoperiod (12 h), and light intensity (150 μmol·m·s PPFD) provided by white LEDs. The results showed that night temperature had a marked influence on the growth and development of both species. The night temperature of 15 °C notably enhanced the quality of plug seedlings evidenced by the increased shoot, root, and leaf dry weights, stem diameter, and Dickson's quality index. Moreover, a night temperature of 15 °C also stimulated and increased contents of primary and secondary metabolites, including soluble sugar, starch, total phenols and flavonoids. Furthermore, the 15 °C night temperature increased the chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance and decreased the hydrogen peroxide content.

Mutations in the exon 6 of the PPM1D result in production of a highly stable, C-terminally truncated PPM1D. These gain-of-function PPM1D mutations are present in various human cancers but their role in tumorigenesis remains unresolved. Here we show that truncated PPM1D impairs activation of the cell cycle checkpoints in human non-transformed RPE cells and allows proliferation in the presence of DNA damage. Next, we developed a mouse model by introducing a truncating mutation in the PPM1D locus and tested contribution of the oncogenic PPM1D allele to colon tumorigenesis. We found that p53 pathway was suppressed in colon stem cells harboring PPM1D resulting in proliferation advantage under genotoxic stress condition. In addition, truncated PPM1D promoted tumor growth in the colon in Apc mice and diminished survival. Moreover, tumor organoids derived from colon of the ApcPpm1d mice were less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil when compared to ApcPpm1dand the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was restored by inhibition of PPM1D. Finally, we screened colorectal cancer patients and identified recurrent somatic PPM1D mutations in a fraction of colon adenocarcinomas that are p53 proficient and show defects in mismatch DNA repair. In summary, we provide the first in vivo evidence that truncated PPM1D can promote tumor growth and modulate sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655813>Serum Level of Biotin Rather than the Daily Dosage Is the Main Determinant of Interference on Thyroid Function Assays.</a></h2><p>Several case reports stress that high-dose biotin causes incorrect laboratory results. However, the extent of this interference in children is not systematically studied.To assess factors associated with biotin interference on thyroid function tests in subjects with biotinidase deficiency.The study included 44 children who were treated with oral biotin (Group 1, median dose: 10 mg/day [25-75p; 10-10], age: 1.83 years [1.04-2.90]) and 30 healthy subjects (Group 2, age: 1.05 years [0.37-3.37]). Thyroid function tests were performed with two different assays, and streptavidin-coated particles were used in order to remove biotin from serum samples of cases with biotin interference.The measurements were first performed with Beckman Coulter. In Group 1, remarkably high levels of fT3 and fT4 were found in 26 (59.1%) and 25 (56.8%) patients, respectively. Thyroid hormone functions were all normal in Group 2. Significantly higher serum biotin levels were detected in interference-positive children (p < 0.001). The serum biotin levels in Group 1 showed a strong positive correlation with fT3 (r = 0.867, p < 0.001) and fT4 levels (r = 0.905, p < 0.001). A serum biotin level of 80.35 µg/L was found to be the best cut-off value for predicting interference (sensitivity: 96.2% and specificity: 94.4%). When analyzed with Siemens Advia Centaur XP, all thyroid function tests were normal in both groups except in one patient (2.27%) with slightly elevated fT3 level in Group 1. Repeated tests with Beckman Coulter after neutralization of biotin with streptavidin magnetic particles in serum samples of the interference-positive cases revealed normal thyroid hormone levels.Interference is an important problem in thyroid function tests in nearly 60% of all children receiving biotin treatment for biotinidase deficiency. Serum levels of biotin rather than the dosage are the main determinant of interference, which can be eliminated by choosing appropriate laboratory methods.© 2019 S.

By ligating feeding arteries in the mouse ear, we induced network-wide hemodynamic redistribution and localized arteriogenesis. The utility of this technology's was demonstrated by studying the influence of obesity on microvascular arteriogenesis.Simultaneously monitoring the remodeling of competing collateral arterioles revealed a new, inverse relationship between initial vascular resistance and extent of arteriogenesis. Obese mice exhibited similar remodeling responses to lean mice through the first week, including diameter increase and flow upregulation in collateral arterioles. However, these gains were subsequently lost in obese mice.Capable of label-free, comprehensive, and dynamic quantification of structural and functional changes in the microvascular network in vivo, this platform opens up new opportunities to study the mechanisms of microvascular arteriogenesis, its implications in diseases, and approaches to pharmacologically rectify microvascular dysfunction.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657806>[Delirium: a reappraisal of clinical characteristics and treatment perspectives after the transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5].</a></h2><p>The aim of this commentary is to discuss some clinical characteristics and treatment perspectives of delirium in the light of transition from the DSM-IV to the DSM-5.

However, lower productivity and high saline medium seriously hinder its wide applications.The entire ectoine , including  for ectoine synthesis and catabolism, was identified in the genome of an ectoine-excreting strain Halomonas hydrothermalis Y2. By in-frame deletion of genes encoding ectoine hydroxylase (EctD) and (or) ectoine hydrolase (DoeA) that responsible for ectoine catabolism, the  for ectoine utilization were disrupted and resulted in an obviously enhanced productivity. Using an optimized medium containing 100 g L NaCl in a 500-mL flask, the double mutant of Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA synthesized 3.13 g L ectoine after 30 h cultivation. This is much higher than that of the wild type strain (1.91 g L), and also exceeds the production of Y2/ΔectD (2.21 g L). The remarkably enhanced accumulation of ectoine by Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA implied a critical function of Doe pathway in the ectoine catabolism. Furthermore, to reduce the salinity of fermentation medium and overcome the wastewater treatment difficulty, mutants that lacking key Na/H antiporter, Mrp and (or) NhaD2, were constructed based on strain Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA. As a result, the Mrp-deficient strain could synthesize equal amount of ectoine (around 7 g L or 500 mg (g DCW) ) in the medium containing lower concentration of NaCl. During a fed-batch fermentation process with 60 g L NaCl stress, a maximum 10.5 g L ectoine was accumulated by the Mrp-deficient strain, with a specific production of 765 mg (g DCW) and a yield of 0.21 g g monosodium glutamate.The remarkably enhanced production of ectoine by Y2/ΔectD/ΔdoeA implied the critical function of Doe pathway in the ectoine catabolism.

Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the   that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661191>Genetic insight into cytochrome P450 in Chinese from Chinese Millionome Database.</a></h2><p>Genetic variations of cytochrome P450 (CYP) influence the inter-individual differences of drug response.

Lack of a good mammalian model has impeded studies of pathogenesis and development of rational therapeutics. We took a new approach to investigating an existing mouse mutant of Pank2 and found that isolating the disease-vulnerable brain revealed regional perturbations in CoA , iron homeostasis, and dopamine  and functional defects in complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Feeding mice a CoA pathway intermediate, 4'-phosphopantetheine, normalized levels of the CoA-, iron-, and dopamine-related biomarkers as well as activities of mitochondrial enzymes. Human cell changes also were recovered by 4'-phosphopantetheine. We can mechanistically link a defect in CoA  to these secondary effects via the activation of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, which is essential to oxidative phosphorylation, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. We demonstrate the fidelity of our model in recapitulating features of the human disease. Moreover, we identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers, provide insights into disease pathogenesis, and offer evidence for 4'-phosphopantetheine as a candidate therapeutic for PKAN.© 2019 The Authors.

The standard SABRE homogeneous catalyst ["Ir-IMes"; [IrCl(COD)(IMes)], (IMes = 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl), imidazole-2-ylidene; COD = cyclooctadiene)] was first activated in the presence of an auxiliary substrate (pyridine) in alcohol. Following addition of sodium 1- 13 C-acetate, parahydrogen bubbling within a microtesla magnetic field (i.e. under conditions of SABRE in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei, SABRE-SHEATH) resulted in positive enhancements of up to ~100-fold in the 13 C NMR signal compared to thermal equilibrium at 9.4 T.  The present results are consistent with a mechanism of "direct" transfer of spin order from parahydrogen to 13 C spins of acetate weakly bound to the catalyst, under conditions of fast exchange with respect to the 13 C acetate resonance, but we find that relaxation dynamics at microtesla fields alter the optimal matching from the traditional SABRE-SHEATH picture.  Further development of this approach could lead to new ways to rapidly, cheaply, and simply hyperpolarize a broad range of substrates (e.g. metabolites with carboxyl groups) for various applications, including biomedical NMR and MRI of cellular and in vivo .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs, which activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptor, are potent stimuli for adipocyte browning yet fail to induce  expression in mouse adipocytes. In contrast,  is one of the most strongly TZD-induced transcripts in human adipocytes, although not in cells from all individuals. Two putative PPARγ binding sites exist near the gene's transcription start site (TSS) in human but not mouse adipocytes. The -4 kb upstream site falls in a segmental duplication of a nearly identical intronic region +2.5 kb downstream of the TSS, and this duplication occurred in the primate lineage and not in other mammals, like mice. PPARγ binding and gene activation occur via this upstream duplicated site, thus explaining the species difference. Furthermore, this functional upstream PPARγ site exhibits genetic variation among people, with 1 SNP allele disrupting a PPAR response element and giving less activation by PPARγ and TZDs. In addition to this upstream variant that determines PPARγ regulation of  in adipocytes, distinct variants downstream of the TSS have strong effects on  expression in human fat as well as other tissues. A haplotype of 7 tightly linked downstream SNP alleles is associated with very low  expression and correspondingly high DNA methylation at the TSS. These  low-expression variants may account for human genetic associations in this region with obesity as well as neurodegenerative diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660891>Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of tissue, serum, and serum exosomes from hepatocellular carcinoma patients.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is a promising prognostic and diagnostic tool in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we performed small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) of tissue, serum and serum exosomes to investigate changes in miRNA expression between the different sample types and correlated the expression with clinical parameters. We also performed gene expression arrays on tumor and normal tissue.Paired tissue, serum and serum exosomes sequencing revealed consistent positive correlation of miR-21 between serum exosomes and tumor tissue, indicating that miR-21 could be exported from tissue to circulation via exosomes. We found that let-7 miRNAs are generally upregulated in serum exosomes compared to whole serum, indicating that these miRNAs could be preferentially loaded into exosomes. Comparing serum from HCC patients with serum from healthy individuals revealed a global increase of miRNAs in serum from HCC patients, including an almost 4-fold increase of several miRNAs, including the liver-specific miR-122. When correlating miRNA expression with clinical parameters we detected significant association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and miR-122 in serum as well as several serum and tissue-miRNAs that correlated with surgery type. We found that miR-141 and miR-146 correlated with cirrhosis in tumor tissue and normal tissue, respectively. Finally, high expression of miR-21 in tumors were associated with poor survival. Focusing on gene expression we found several significant messenger RNAs (mRNAs) between tumor and normal tissue and a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these changes were mainly related to cell cycle and . Further, we detected mRNAs that correlated with cirrhosis and HBV infection in tissue. Finally, GO analysis of predicted targets for miRNAs down-regulated in tumor found that these were enriched for functions related to collagen synthesis.Our combined data point to altered miRNA and mRNA expression contributing to both generally impaired lipid  and increased cell proliferation and a miRNA-driven increase in collagen synthesis in HCC. Our results further indicate a correlation in miRNA expression between exosomes, serum, and tissue samples suggesting export from tumors via exosomes. This correlation could provide a basis for a more tumor-specific miRNA profile in serum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658881>Anti-hyperlipidemic effects of Campomanesia xanthocarpa aqueous extract and its modulation on oxidative stress and genomic instability in Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The use of natural products from herbs may be a therapeutic option in dyslipidemia treatment.  (Mart.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae) leaves have been used to decrease cholesterol levels. However, studies to determine activities of this plant on triglycerides  have received little attention. The aim of this study was to examine anti-hyperlipidemic effects of a  aqueous leaf extract (CxAE) and assess protective actions against oxidative stress and DNA damage. The tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia model was used in Wistar rats. Rats were treated orally with CxAE either 250 or 500 mg/kg/day for 7 days prior to tyloxapol administration. Biochemical parameters, oxidative stress levels, and genomic instability were assessed in several tissues. CxAE decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum and hepatic and renal DNA damage in tyloxapol-treated rats. There was no marked effect on the micronucleus frequency in bone marrow. The extract increased catalase activity and decreased glutathione S-transferase activity in kidney tissue. CxAE showed anti-hyperlipidemic effects, improved oxidative parameters, and protected DNA against damage induced by tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia, suggesting  leaves may be useful in preventing dyslipidemias.

The possible association between cancer and cognitive impairment is important to elucidate, because it can have a serious impact on quality of life. Here, we focused on glucose  as a factor that links cancer and cognitive impairment.Thirteen subjects with solid cancers and cognitive impairment were recruited. As a control group, 14 subjects with cognitive impairment alone and 8 subjects with cancer alone were recruited. A Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and that of β-cell function (HOMA-B) were used. In comparison with patients with solid cancer alone, those with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cancer and cognitive impairment had increased HOMA-IR values. Insulin resistance was increased in patients with cognitive impairment alone and those with both cognitive impairment and solid cancer than in patients without cognitive impairment; however, β-cell function was not affected. The present data indicated that elderly cancer patients with high HOMA-IR score may be at a relatively high risk for developing cognitive impairment.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659545>Expression dynamics of autophagy-related genes in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus during embryonic development and under increasing larval starvation.</a></h2><p>Rhipicephalus microplus is a hematophagous ectoparasite that significantly affects parasitized cattle. As a one-host tick its entire life cycle consists of free-living and parasitic forms. Its extraordinary ability to survive during prolonged off-host periods has been related to the process of cytoplasmic degradation called autophagy. In order to deepen our understanding of this process during R. microplus non-parasitic stages, we determined the expression dynamics of a set of five autophagy-related genes (ATG genes) during embryonic development and over an increasing larval starvation period of 50 days. We found two apparent successive waves of ATG genes transcriptional activation, which paralleled key embryonic changes such as cellularization and organogenesis, as well as nutrient utilization. Moreover, during increasing larval starvation, ATG genes were up-regulated cyclically every 10-15 days. Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy is playing a major role in embryo development and energy  during starvation in R. microplus.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658667>Revising PTEN in the Era of Immunotherapy: New Perspectives for an Old Story.</a></h2><p>Immunotherapy has emerged as the new therapeutic frontier of cancer treatment, showing enormous survival benefits in multiple tumor diseases. Although undeniable success has been observed in clinical trials, not all patients respond to treatment. Different concurrent conditions can attenuate or completely abrogate the usefulness of immunotherapy due to the activation of several escape mechanisms. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has an almost full immunosuppressive profile, creating an obstacle to therapeutic treatment. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) governs a plethora of cellular processes, including maintenance of genomic stability, cell survival/apoptosis, migration, and . The repertoire of PTEN functions has recently been expanded to include regulation of the tumor microenvironment and immune system, leading to a drastic reevaluation of the canonical paradigm of PTEN action with new potential implications for immunotherapy-based approaches. Understanding the implication of PTEN in cancer immunoediting and immune evasion is crucial to develop new cancer intervention strategies. Recent evidence has shown a double context-dependent role of PTEN in anticancer immunity. Here we summarize the current knowledge of PTEN's role at a crossroads between tumor and immune compartments, highlighting the most recent findings that are likely to change future clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659021>An onboard checking mechanism ensures effector delivery of the type VI secretion system in .</a></h2><p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal yet energetically costly weapon in gram-negative bacteria. Through contraction of a long sheath, the T6SS ejects a few copies of effectors accompanied by hundreds of structural carrier proteins per delivery. The few ejected effectors, however, dictate T6SS functions. It remains elusive how the T6SS ensures effector loading and avoids futile ejection. Here, by systemically mutating the active sites of 3  effectors, TseL, VasX, and VgrG3, we show that the physical presence but not their activities is crucial for T6SS assembly. We constructed catalytic mutants of TseL and VgrG3 and truncated VasX mutants. These mutations abolished the killing of the effector-cognate immunity mutants. We determined that the VasX-mediated antimicrobial activity is solely dependent on the C-terminal colicin domain. Removal of the colicin domain abolished VasX secretion and reduced T6SS assembly, while deletion of the colicin internal loop abolished its toxicity but had little effect on secretion and assembly. The triple effector-inactive mutant maintains an active T6SS that is capable of delivering chimeric VgrG, PAAR, and TseL proteins fused with a cargo nuclease, indicating effector activities are not required for T6SS assembly or penetration into the cytosol of recipient cells. Therefore, by recruiting effectors as critical components for T6SS assembly, it represents an effective onboard checking mechanism that ensures effectors are loaded in place to prevent futile secretion. Our study also demonstrates a detoxified secretion platform by inactivating native effector activities that could translocate engineered cargo proteins via multiple routes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659814>GPETAFLR, a biopeptide from Lupinus angustifolius L., protects against oxidative and inflammatory damage in retinal pigment epithelium cells.</a></h2><p>GPETAFLR, an octapeptide released from the enzymatic hydrolysis of lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L.) protein, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effect in myeloid lineage. This work aims to evaluate in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells the protective role of GPETAFLR on both oxidative and inflammatory markers known to be involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In comparison with stimulated control cells, GPETAFLR increased glutathione production and diminished the secretion and gene expression of VEFG, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF-α, as well as reactive oxygen species, and nitrite output. Our findings reveal that GPETAFLR, a novel plant peptide, is able to protect against RPE oxidative stress and inflammation. Taken together, these results strongly support innovative nutritional strategies considering Lupinus angustifolius L. as source of proteins to prevent the onset and progression of AMD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: We reveal a novel nutraceutical impact of GPETAFLR peptide in human RPE cells to prevent oxidative and inflammatory mediators. Our results support that the intake of Lupine angustifolius L., proposed to be a reservoir of GPETAFLR, could lessen the functional decay of RPE cells, leading therefore to a slowdown of the progress of AMD during age. Not only this work, but also future simple clinical studies should raise new nutritional strategies focused on understanding the etiological role of the foods, nutrition, and  in the pathogenesis of ocular disorders.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655784>More Needs to Be Done for Patients with Endocrine Hypertension.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659627>Impact of Carbohydrate on Glucose Variability in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Assessed Through Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring: A Retrospective Study.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to objectively analyze the correlation between dietary components and blood glucose variation by means of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who received CGM to manage their blood glucose levels were enrolled into the study, and the components of their total caloric intake were analyzed. Glycemic variation parameters were calculated, and dietary components, including percentages of carbohydrate, protein and fat in the total dietary intake, were analyzed by a dietitian. The interaction between parameters of glycemic variability and dietary components was analyzed.Sixty-one patients with T1DM (33 females, 28 males) were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 34.7 years, and the average duration of diabetes was 14 years. Glycated hemoglobin before CGM was 8.54%. Participants with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake had a longer DM duration and a higher protein and fat intake than did those with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for ≥ 50% of total caloric intake, but there was no between-group difference in total caloric intake per day. The group with a carbohydrate intake that accounted for < 50% of their total caloric intake also had lower nocturnal continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA) 1, - 2 and - 4 values. The percentage of protein intake had a slightly negative correlation with mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) (r = - 0.286, p < 0.05) and a moderately negative correlation with coefficient of variation (CV) (r = 0.289, p < 0.05).

Predictors of PET thalamic changes and its role in predicting postsurgical outcome were also studied.This was a retrospective study of 39 patients with TLE who underwent MRI, PET, and scalp video EEG monitoring at the University at Buffalo, New York from 2001 to 2011 during presurgical evaluation. PET-defined  of the temporal lobes was evaluated using a 4-point ordinal rating scale.PET hypometabolism was associated with a variation in ictal (P = .034) and interictal (P < .001) foci in both lesional (by MRI) and nonlesional patients. Nonlesional MRI scans were associated with none to mild temporal PET hypometabolism (71% of patients) while lesional MRI scans were associated with moderate to severe hypometabolism (82% of patients) (P = .006). The odds of thalamic hypometabolism were 5.36 times higher when there was moderate to severe temporal hypometabolism (P = .039).This study underscores the utility of PET in localizing ictal foci in TLE patients even in those with normal MRI.

To uncover the genetic background of the ability of microaerobic toluene degradation in Z. oleivorans, the whole-genome sequence of the type strain Buc was revealed. Metatranscriptomic sequence reads, originated from a previous SIP study on microaerobic toluene degradation, were mapped on the genome.

We compared the effects of SGLT2is with those of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) on the risk of diabetic retinopathy and its progression in people with type 2 diabetes. We performed a retrospective cohort study among people with type 2 diabetes who started on a SGLT2i or DPP4i from 2014 to 2016 according to the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Subjects initiated on a SGLT2i or DPP4i were matched on a 1:1 basis according to their propensity scores, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios for the risk of diabetic retinopathy and its progression. After propensity score-matching, 41,430 patients without a history of diabetic retinopathy were identified as new users of a SGLT2i (n = 20,175) or DPP4i (n = 20,175). The hazard ratio (95% CI) for diabetic retinopathy was 0.89 (0.83-0.97) for SGLT2i initiators compared with DPP4i initiators.

Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the  of 5-10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate . To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on lipid membranes. Free energy calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel.

In the current study, we explored the upstream mediator for cardiomyocytes necrosis induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury with a focus on mitochondrial function and JNK-Bnip3 pathway.  Cell necrosis was determined via MTT assay, TUNEL staining and PI staining. siRNA transfection was performed to inhibit Ripk3 activation in response to HR injury. Pathway blocker was applied to prevent JNK activation.  Ripk3 was rapidly increased in HR-treated cardiomyocytes and correlated with the necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, silencing of Ripk3 attenuated HR-mediated cardiomyocytes necrosis. At the molecular levels, Ripk3 deletion sustained mitochondrial bioenergetics and stabilized mitochondrial glucose . Besides, Ripk3 deletion also reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and inhibited mPTP opening. To the end, we found Ripk3 activation was along with JNK pathway activation and Bnip3 upregulation. Interestingly, blockade of JNK pathway abolished the harmful effects of HR injury on mitochondrial function, energy  and redox balance. Moreover, overexpression of Bnip3 abrogated the protection action played by Ripk3 deletion on cardiomyocytes survival.  Taken together, these data may identify Ripk3 upregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and JNK-Bnip3 axis activation as the novel mechanisms underlying cardiomyocytes necrosis achieved by HR injury. Thereby, approaches targeted to the Ripk3-JNK-Bnip3-mitochondria cascade have the potential to ameliorate the progression of HR-related cardiomyocytes necrosis in the clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659587>Performance Comparison of Individual and Ensemble CNN Models for the Classification of Brain 18F-FDG-PET Scans.</a></h2><p>The high-background glucose  of normal gray matter on [18F]-fluoro-2-D-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain results in a low signal-to-background ratio, potentially increasing the possibility of missing important findings in patients with intracranial malignancies. To explore the strategy of using a deep learning classifier to aid in distinguishing normal versus abnormal findings on PET brain images, this study evaluated the performance of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to classify FDG PET brain scans as normal (N) or abnormal (A).Two hundred eighty-nine brain FDG-PET scans (N; n = 150, A; n = 139) resulting in a total of 68,260 images were included. Nine individual 2D-CNN models with three different window settings for axial, coronal, and sagittal axes were trained and validated. The performance of these individual and ensemble models was evaluated and compared using a test dataset. Odds ratio, Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and area under curve (AUC) on receiver-operative-characteristic curve, accuracy, and standard deviation (SD) were calculated.An optimal window setting to classify normal and abnormal scans was different for each axis of the individual models. An ensembled model using different axes with an optimized window setting (window-triad) showed better performance than ensembled models using the same axis and different windows settings (axis-triad). Increase in odds ratio and decrease in SD were observed in both axis-triad and window-triad models compared with individual models, whereas improvements of AUC and AIC were seen in window-triad models. An overall model averaging the probabilities of all individual models showed the best accuracy of 82.0%.Data ensemble using different window settings and axes was effective to improve 2D-CNN performance parameters for the classification of brain FDG-PET scans. If prospectively validated with a larger cohort of patients, similar models could provide decision support in a clinical setting.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659213>Central  of functionally heterogeneous mesenchymal stromal cells.</a></h2><p> and mitochondrial biology have gained a prominent role as determinants of stem cell fate and function. In the context of regenerative medicine, innovative parameters predictive of therapeutic efficacy could be drawn from the association of  or mitochondrial parameters to different degrees of stemness and differentiation potentials. Herein, this possibility was addressed in human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSC) previously shown to differ in lifespan and telomere length. First, these hMSC were shown to possess significantly distinct proliferation rate, senescence status and differentiation capacity. More potential hMSC were associated to higher mitochondrial (mt) DNA copy number and lower mtDNA methylation. In addition, they showed higher expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation subunits. Consistently, they exhibited higher coupled oxygen consumption rate and lower transcription of glycolysis-related genes, glucose consumption and lactate production. All these data pointed at oxidative phosphorylation-based central  as a feature of higher stemness-associated hMSC phenotypes. Consistently, reduction of mitochondrial activity by complex I and III inhibitors in higher stemness-associated hMSC triggered senescence. Finally, functionally higher stemness-associated hMSC showed  plasticity when challenged by glucose or glutamine shortage, which mimic bioenergetics switches that hMSC must undergo after transplantation or during self-renewal and differentiation. Altogether, these results hint at  and mitochondrial parameters that could be implemented to identify stem cells endowed with superior growth and differentiation potential.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646119>Editorial.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660733>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry enables rapid characterisation of enzyme kinetics and inhibition for the human soluble Epoxide Hydrolase.</a></h2><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is conventionally used to acquire thermodynamic data for biological interactions. In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors. This also promises to provide a general approach for the characterisation of lipid catalysis, given the challenges that lipid  studies pose to traditional spectroscopic techniques.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660280>Exploration of the effects of a  mutant on the growth of  and the global regulatory function of  by RNA sequencing.</a></h2><p>DegS is a periplasmic serine protease that is considered to be the initiator of the σ stress response pathway, and this protein plays an important role in the regulation of the stress response in .

Bacterial colony morphology was observed by a plate-based growth experiment, and bacterial growth ability was observed by a growth curve experiment. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology was used to analyze the differential transcriptomic profiles between the wild-type and  mutant strains. Gene ontology (GO), pathway analysis and Gene-Act-network analysis were performed to explore the main functions of the differentially expressed genes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to validate the reliability and accuracy of the RNA-Seq analysis. The complementation experiments were used to test the roles of  and  in the small colony  mutant phenotype.When  was deleted, the  mutant exhibited smaller colonies on various media and slower growth than the wild-type strain. A total of 423 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 187 genes that were upregulated in the  mutant compared to the wild-type strain and 236 genes that were relatively downregulated. GO categories and pathway analysis showed that many differentially expressed genes were associated with various cellular   and the cell cycle. Furthermore, Gene-Act network analysis showed that many differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular   and bacterial chemotaxis. The cAMP-CRP-RpoS signaling pathway and the LuxPQ signal transduction system were also affected by the  mutant. The expression patterns of nine randomly selected differentially expressed genes were consistent between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq results.

These detrimental environmental factors enhanced the ROS production such as singlet oxygen (O), superoxide (O ), hydrogen peroxide (HO) and hydroxyl radicals (OH). ROS are highly reactive and directly target several cellular molecules and metabolites, which lead to severe cellular dysfunction. Plants respond to oxidative damages by activating antioxidant machinery to trigger signalling cascades for stress tolerance. HO signalling balances the plant  through cross-talk with other signals and plant hormones during growth, development and stress responses. HO facilitates the regulation of different stress-responsive transcription factors (TFs) including NAC, Zinc finger, WRKY, ERF, MYB, DREB and bZIP as both upstream and downstream events during stress signalling. The present review focuses on the biological synthesis of the HO and its effect on the upregulation of kinase genes and stress related TFs for imparting stress tolerance.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658093>Using the OVAKO working posture analysis system in cleaning occupations.</a></h2><p>Cleaning workers experience severe musculoskeletal symptoms.The objective of this paper was to examine musculoskeletal symptoms in cleaners of different heights to evaluate the effects of height on working postures in the work environment (schools).We used a three-stage method including using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) to evaluate musculoskeletal symptoms, a task analysis to confirm typical cleaning tasks, and the OVAKO Working Posture Assessment System (OWAS) for posture analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate the adjusted effects of individual characteristics on painful body regions, using individuals without any pain as the reference category.This study found that the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms is very high for cleaners, especially in the shoulders, elbows, and lower back. Odds ratios for the accumulation of two or more risk factors were higher among men and were inversely associated with national economic indicators. The relatively high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms may stem from the multiple operations involved in cleaning tasks, such as trash collecting, floor mopping, toilet cleaning, and mirror polishing. Workers of different heights had differential work loadings for different tasks.This paper proposes recommendations for job adaptations and occupational safety training. Cleaners of different heights execute the typical tasks via different postures, and awkward postures often result in musculoskeletal symptoms. Cleaners should be provided with specific tools and training regarding working postures on the basis of height. These findings can be used as a reference for related operation designs and task improvements to ensure correct tool usage and safer working postures during cleaning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646124>Effect of vitamin D status on lipid profile in premenopausal women: a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>High lipid levels play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and some authors suggest vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D status on lipid profile in premenopausal women.A total of 315 nonsmoking premenopausal female volunteers without diabetes mellitus were included in the study. Patients were divided into four subgroups. The groups were as follows: patients with less than or equal to 12 ng/ml (group 1, =126) vitamin D levels, between 20 and 12 ng/ml (group 2, =48), between 30 and 20 ng/ml (group 3, =21), and at least 30 ng/ml (group 4, =120) vitamin D levels. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively). In unadjusted analysis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were found to be correlated negatively with BMI (=0.0005), LDL-C (=0.01), and non-HDL-C (=0.003) and correlated positively with HDL-C levels (=0.006). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, and log parathormone levels were made, no correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lipid (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG) levels (=0.91, 0.06, 0.95, 0.79, respectively).There may be an association between vitamin D insufficiency and dyslipidemia.

Differential translational regulation in cercarial heads and tails of schistosome worms.</a></h2><p>Schistosomes are obligate helminths responsible for over 218 million cases of human schistosomiasis in 78 countries around the world. Infection occurs when free-swimming cercariae penetrate human skin and initiate developmental progression into parasitic obligate worms that consume red blood cells. Transcriptomic studies of infectious cercariae reveal abundant mRNAs associated with energy  and host invasion. However, the cercaria is mostly transcriptionally quiescent, suggesting that most mRNAs are primed prior to cercarial escape from the snail host. The use of transcriptomics to understand protein expression presumes that transcription and translation are functionally coupled and the cercarial stage has categorically been treated as a single unit for -omic analysis. Per contra, the relationship between transcription and translation in infectious cercariae has not been described. To understand the correlation between transcription and translation in cercariae, we separately measured nascent translation levels in cercarial heads, cercarial tails and in the developing schistosomula, the next stage of its life cycle. The loss of the cercarial tail is essential for the transformation from a cercaria to a schistosomulum. We observed that translation was initially limited and the translation rate accelerated during the first 72-hours after tail loss. When we tested nascent translation in cercarial heads, cercarial tails, whole cercariae, and 4-hour schistosomula, we found that translation is significantly upregulated in the cercarial tail when compared to the cercarial head and that translation was undetectable in heads using immunofluorescent image quantification (p = .0005). These data represent a major shift in how we understand the cercarial stage. The cercarial head is mostly transcriptionally and translationally quiescent while being sufficient for progression into a schistosomulum. In addition, transcription and translation are not linked in Schistosoma mansoni cercaria. Thus, our current conceptual approach of treating the cercaria as a single functional unit for -omic studies may be insufficient to understand cercarial development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656282>Effect of olive oil consumption on aging in a senescence-accelerated mice-prone 8 (SAMP8) model.</a></h2><p>Background : Mediterranean diets have been linked to a reduced risk of cancer, vascular illnesses, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.

Reduction in memory in passive avoidance learning was examined after two months from the initiation of the experiment. Results : The weight of organs including the liver, kidney, spleen, and fat tissue changed significantly and memory performance was reduced in SAMP8 than in SAMR1 mice. There were no significant differences in SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice; however, blood triglyceride level decreased significantly in SAMP8 mice fed on olive oil.

Polyphenols, as important constituents of human diet and potent in vitro free radical scavengers, have been extensively studied for their beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health. However, it has been demonstrated that the in vivo antioxidant activity of polyphenols is distinct from their in vitro free radical scavenging capacity. Indeed, bioavailability of nutritional polyphenols is low, and conditioned by complex mechanisms of absorption, distribution,  and excretion. Nowadays it is commonly accepted that the cellular antioxidant activity of polyphenols is mainly carried out via modification of transcription of genes involved in antioxidant defense. Importantly, polyphenols contribute to the cardiometabolic health also by modulation of plethora of cellular processes that are not directly associated with antioxidant enzymes, through nutri(epi)genomic mechanisms. Numerous human intervention studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of polyphenols on the key cardiometabolic risk factors. However, inconsistency of the results of some studies led to identification of the inter-individual variability in response to consumption of polyphenols. In perspective, a detailed investigation of the determinants of this inter-individual variability will potentially lead us towards personalized dietary recommendations.

Thus, for the production of valuable secondary metabolites by genetic engineering, the species is considered a clean host, enabling easy purification from cultured cells. A. oryzae has been evaluated for secondary metabolite production utilizing strong constitutive promoters of genes responsible for primary . However, secondary metabolites are typically produced by residual nutrition after microbial cells grow to the stationary phase and primary  slows. We focused on a promoter of the secondary  gene kojA, a component of the kojic acid biosynthetic gene cluster, for the production of other secondary metabolites by A. oryzae.A kojA disruptant that does not produce kojic acid was utilized as a host strain for production. Using this host strain, a mutant that expressed a polyketide synthase gene involved in polyketide secondary metabolite production under the kojA gene promoter was constructed. Then, polyketide production and polyketide synthase gene expression were observed every 24 h in liquid culture. From days 0 to 10 of culture, the polyketide was continuously produced, and the synthase gene expression was maintained. Therefore, the kojA promoter was activated, and it enabled the continuous production of polyketide for 10 days.The combined use of the kojA gene promoter and a kojA disruptant proved useful for the continuous production of a polyketide secondary metabolite in A. oryzae.

Filamentous bacterial cells could represent a possible strategy to increase PHA yield, since more abundant PHA inclusions can be stored in elongated than in rod-shaped cells. At first, we determined the optimal batch culture conditions to induce filamentation in Pseudomonas mediterranea CFBP-5447T, using glutamine, glycerol, glucose, and sodium octanoate, as the sole carbon source, at low- (100 rpm) or high- (250 rpm) shaking speeds. Successively, a fermentative process was set up using glutamine in a co- strategy with glycerol, and the PHAs production was compared in rod-shaped and filamentous cells. High glutamine concentrations (from 28 to 56 mM) were able to induce alone filamentation, whereas at lower glutamine concentrations (5-10 mM), the shaking speeds became critical to allow or not filamentous phenotype. PHA granule production was higher in filamentous than in rod-shaped cells, when glycerol (46.6 mM) was added to glutamine (5 mM) in co-, and fermentation was performed at a low-shaking speed. After extraction and precipitation, PHA yield was about two times higher in filamentous than that rod-shaped cells. Our results provide new insights into filament-inducing conditions and indicate a potential use of filamentous P. mediterranea CFBP-5447T cells to increase PHA yield. These findings could have great advantages in PHAs recovering during downstream processes, since the harvesting of elongated cells is much less time-consuming and energy expensive than required with rod-shaped cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657348>[Role and mechanism of vitamin D in sepsis].</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the host's imbalance in response to infection, which is still the leading cause of death in critically ill patients.

We report a new high-resolution system to measure the stable carbon isotopic composition of carboxyl atoms within amino acids. The automated system used HPLC to separate amino acids followed by addition of ninhydrin for decarboxylation and transfer of the evolved CO2 to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for δ13CCARBOXYL measurement. The ninhydrin reaction was conducted at acidic pH (1.5) and elevated temperature (160 oC) giving yields close to 100% for most common amino acids. Eight mammalian keratin samples from herbivores (kudu and caribou), omnivores (humans) and carnivores (bowhead and humpback zooplanktivorous whales) were analysed with this new system. The data provide an initial calibration of reference materials to be used in studies of this type and is the first report of carboxyl carbon isotope distributions in mammals. Results showed widespread 13C enrichments in both essential and non-essential amino acid carboxyl groups, likely linked to decarboxylation of amino acids during normal .

However, the role of PLK3 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and glucose  remains to be known.The expression of PLK3 in CRC tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry. Cells proliferation was examined by EdU, CCK-8 and in vivo analyses. Glucose  was assessed by detecting lactate production, glucose uptake, mitochondrial respiration, extracellular acidification rate, oxygen consumption rate and ATP production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assays and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to explore the signaling pathway. Specific targeting by miRNAs was determined by luciferase reporter assays and correlation with target protein expression.PLK3 was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues and its low expression was correlated with worse prognosis of patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that PLK3 contributed to growth inhibition of CRC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLK3 impeded glucose  via targeting Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression. Mechanically, PLK3 bound to Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and facilitated its degradation, which led to a significant decrease of phosphorylated STAT3. The downregulation of p-STAT3 further suppressed the transcriptional activation of HK2. Moreover, our investigations showed that PLK3 was directly targeted by miR-106b at post-transcriptional level in CRC cells.This study suggests that PLK3 inhibits glucose  by targeting HSP90/STAT3/HK2 signaling and PLK3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657228>Nitric Oxide-Dependent Protein Posttranslational Modifications Impair Mitochondrial Function and  to Contribute to Neurodegenerative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Most brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases manifest mitochondrial dysfunction as well as elevated production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to synapse loss and neuronal injury. Recent Advances: Excessive production of RNS triggers nitric oxide (NO)-mediated posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues and nitration of tyrosine residues. Proteins thus affected impair mitochondrial , mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy in the nervous system.Identification and better characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms for NO-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction will provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries concerning S-nitrosylation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1, and mitophagy-related proteins Parkin and PINK1. We delineate signaling cascades affected by pathologically S-nitrosylated proteins that diminish mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative diseases.Further elucidation of the pathological events resulting from aberrant S-nitrosothiol or nitrotyrosine formation may lead to new therapeutic approaches to ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659239>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin ameliorates hepatic glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice via activating insulin signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Osteocalcin, expressed in osteoblasts of the bone marrow, undergoes post-translational carboxylation and deposits in mineralized bone matrix. A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with  syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and lipid  in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose , hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty-acid β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating  syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659215> of the predominant human milk oligosaccharide fucosyllactose by an infant gut commensal.</a></h2><p>A number of bifidobacterial species are found at a particularly high prevalence and abundance in faecal samples of healthy breastfed infants, a phenomenon that is believed to be, at least partially, due to the ability of bifidobacteria to metabolize Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs). In the current study, we isolated a novel strain of Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, named APCKJ1, from the faeces of a four-week old breastfed infant, based on the ability of the strain to utilise the HMO component fucosyllactose. We then determined the full genome sequence of this strain, and employed the generated data to analyze fucosyllactose  in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Transcriptomic and growth analyses, combined with metabolite analysis, in vitro hydrolysis assays and heterologous expression, allowed us to elucidate the pathway for fucosyllactose  in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Homologs of the key genes for this  pathway were identified in particular in infant-derived members of the Bifdobacterium genus, revealing the apparent niche-specific nature of this pathway, and allowing a broad perspective on bifidobacterial fucosyllactose and L-fucose .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659573>A transcriptomic study of selenium against liver injury induced by beta-cypermethrin in mice by RNA-seq.</a></h2><p>Evidence from biochemical liver function index and histopathology analysis suggested that selenium could effectively repair the liver injury caused by beta-cypermethrin (β-CYP). However, the molecular mechanism of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP remains unclear. In the present study, dynamic changes in gene expression profiles before and after the treatment of NaSeO in liver injury mice were analyzed by using RNA sequencing. As a result, several essential genes and  were identified to be significantly associated with this process. In particular, ten genes including Cyp2j11, Cyp2b10, Cyp3a13, Dhrs9, Socs2, Stat4, Gm13305, Cyp3a44, Retsat, and Cyp26b1 were significantly enriched in the functional categories related to retinol , linoleic acid , and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Among them, the expression patterns of nine genes were validated by qRT-PCR, except for Cyp3a44. Furthermore, we have constructed the associated regulatory network based on the identified targets revealed by high throughput screening. Our study may provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of selenium against liver injury induced by β-CYP in mammals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657947>Media Optimization, Strain Compatibility, and Low-Shear Modeled Microgravity Exposure of Synthetic Microbial Communities for Urine Nitrification in Regenerative Life-Support Systems.</a></h2><p>Urine is a major waste product of human  and contains essential macro- and micronutrients to produce edible microorganisms and crops. Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of oxygen demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino acid concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino acid nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced oxygen competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655942>Lipoprotein(a) and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: Current Understanding and Future Perspectives.</a></h2><p>To review current knowledge of elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels in relation to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and discuss their potential use as biomarkers and therapeutic approaches in clinical practice.We summarized the current understanding and recent advances in the structure, , atherogenic mechanisms, standardized laboratory measurement, recommended screening populations, and prognostic value of Lp(a), with a special focus on the current potential treatment approaches for hyperlipoprotein(a)emia in patients with ASCVD.Lp(a) is composed of LDL-like particle and characteristic apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] connected by a disulfide bond. Substantial evidence shows that elevated plasma Lp(a) level is a heritable, independent, and possibly causal risk factor for ASCVD through its proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and potentially prothrombotic properties. Current guidelines recommend Lp(a) measurement for patients with an intermediate-high risk of ASCVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, a family history of early ASCVD or elevated Lp(a), and progressive ASCVD despite receiving optimal therapy. Traditional Lp(a)-lowering approaches such as niacin, PCSK9 inhibitors, mipomersen, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis were associated with a non-specific and limited reduction of Lp(a), intolerable side effects, invasive procedure, and high expense. The phase 2 randomized controlled trial of antisense oligonucleotide against the apo(a) encoding gene LPA mRNA showed that IONIS-APO(a)-L could specifically reduce the level of Lp(a) by 90% with good tolerance, which may become a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of ASCVD in the future.It is reasonable to measure Lp(a) levels to reclassify ASCVD risk and manage individuals with elevated Lp(a) to further reduce the residual risk of ASCVD, especially with IONIS-APO(a)-L.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661365>Phytotoxic effect of silver nanoparticles on seed germination and growth of terrestrial plants.</a></h2><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) exhibit size and concentration dependent toxicity to terrestrial plants, especially crops. AgNP exposure could decrease seed germination, inhibit seedling growth, affect mass and length of roots and shoots. The phytotoxic pathway has been partly understood. Silver (as element, ion or AgNP) accumulates in roots/leaves and triggers the defense mechanism at cellular and tissue levels, which alters , antioxidant activities and related proteomic expression. Botanical changes (either increase or decrease) in response to AgNP exposure include reactive oxygen species generation, superoxide dismutase activities, HO level, total chlorophyll, proline, carotenoid, ascorbate and glutathione contents, etc. Such processes lead to abnormal morphological changes, suppression of photosynthesis and/or transpiration, and other symptoms. Although neutral or beneficial effects are also reported depending on plant species, adverse effects dominate in majority of the studies.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of low (≤0.75) . high (>0.75) drops in body condition score (BCS) until day 60 post-partum on energy  indices during mid-lactation in Holstein cows.Twenty-eight Holstein cows were included in the study from the day of calving to day 120 of lactation. Whole blood samples were taken on 60, 90, and 120 days in milk (DIM). Serum was analyzed for insulin, glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels.In cows with low BCS drop (LoD group), insulin did not change significantly through days 60 to 120 of lactation, but increased in high drop cows (HiD group) (P<0.001). Glucose concentrations decreased linearly in the LoD cows (P=0.039) and showed a quadratic increase in the HiD group on day 90 (P=0.028). Concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids showed both linear (P=0.04) and quadratic (P=0.002) changes in the HiD group. The HiD cows had significantly higher concentrations of insulin on day 120 (P=0.017) compared to the LoD group. Glucose concentration was lower (P<0.01) in HiD cows on 60 DIM. The concentration of non-esterified fatty acids was higher in HiD cows on day 90 (P<0.01). Surrogate indices of insulin resistance (calculated based on the concentrations of the measured metabolites) were different between the groups on day 90, indicating decreased insulin sensitivity in the HiD cows.Greater depletion of body reserves during early lactation may result in some inconsistencies in energy  during mid-lactation periods. Controlling BCS loss during early lactation may help alleviate such alterations possibly through modifying insulin sensitivity of the tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655771>Low-Renin Hypertension.</a></h2><p>Low-renin hypertension affects 30% of hypertensive patients.

Although reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) enabling the determination of these analytes has been used, they were limited in chromatographic signal intensity and reproducibility due to significant peak tailing caused by complexing with metallic cations and phosphate groups. In this work, we applied the LC-MS/MS with metal-free column for comprehensive quantification of 40 analytes regarding to purine and pyrimidine  in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (pCSF) from AD. For the analytical column, an InertSustain AQ-C18 metal-free PEEK column was used. MS detection is electrospray positive ionization. Metal-free column allows for a sharp peak detection of highly polar metabolites within running time (17 min). In validation, LOD, LOQ and recovery using pooled pCSF sample showed 1-500 nM, 0.5-250 nM and a range of 53.1%-144.0% (RSD ranged from 0.4% to 19.6%).

Experts in this field have become aware of the need to carefully evaluate the effectiveness of these compounds in vivo, because of their absorption and  kinetics once ingested. Indeed, it has been established that phenolic compounds are exposed to extensive  in the human body, and their bioavailability is poor with respect to their metabolites. Thus, considering the biological activity of parent compounds, instead of that of their metabolites, is the major concern in relation to the studies on these molecules, especially in vitro. Recently, the main metabolites of polyphenols have become the subject of manifold research studies, which have revealed their beneficial effects particularly as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents. They have also been investigated for their role in the prevention of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.

Compared with well-described single contaminant treatments, the number of studies reporting phytoremediation of soil mixed pollutants has increased recently. Endophytes, including bacteria and fungi, exhibit beneficial traits for the promotion of plant growth, stress alleviation, and biodegradation. Moreover, endophytes either directly or indirectly assist host plants to survive high concentrations of organic and inorganic pollutants in the soil. Endophytic microorganisms can also regulate the plant  in different ways, exhibiting a variety of physiological characteristics. This review summarizes the taxa and physiological properties of endophytic microorganisms that may participate in the detoxification of contaminant mixtures. Furthermore, potential biomolecules that may enhance endophyte mediated phytoremediation are discussed. The practical applications of pollutant-degrading endophytes and current strategies for applying this valuable bio-resource to soil phytoremediation are summarized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658308>Do we know enough about the genetic involvement in laryngeal cancer susceptibility and prognostic outcome?</a></h2><p>Advances in molecular biology have opened the door to a wide range of research material through the usage of genetic testing on certain variables within the human genome known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).The purpose of this article is to present a review on the influence variants within SNPs have on the outcome of laryngeal cancer when associated with different variables, such as external toxins or survival rate. Amongst these toxins, the most frequent and most studied have been alcohol and tobacco consumption, with a proven increased rate of overall cancer risk within the aero-digestive tract.The review was realized utilizing available studies on the subject of genetic polymorphisms analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and laryngeal cancer published in the PubMed database.Statistical analysis of 262 polymorphisms shows a predominantly positive association between two genetic variants of the human genome (mutant homozygote and heterozygote) and cancer risk with significant influence on patient outcome and survival. Genotype combinations were divided into two categories depending on the individual 'at risk' and 'protective' allele within the loci of each inherited gene block. Amongst the genes involved with aero-digestive cancers, the most studied were those belonging to the xenobiotic , nucleotide excision repair (NER) and DNA repair . The presence of toxins has a distinct cumulative effect within the genotype-phenotype relationship, which further influences the presence of malignancy depending on the adaptability of each individual genome.Laryngeal cancer evolution is linked to inherited risk factors found within the genetic code. Most studied were the genes belonging to NER , DNA repair and xenobiotic , which all favored mutant homozygote and heterozygote variants, as high risk factors. Only five articles focused on overall survival rates with insufficient results to undisputedly predict the risk variants. The consumption of external toxins has a positive effect on the overall cancer risk in consumers.

These patients receive low-toxicity disease-stabilizing treatment. The combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid can stabilize the disease for a subset of such patients. We performed untargeted serum metabolomic profiling for 44 AML patients receiving treatment based on ATRA and valproic acid combined with low-dose cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) which identified 886 metabolites. When comparing pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, metabolites mainly belonging to amino acid and lipid (i.e., fatty acid)  were altered. Furthermore, patients with rapidly progressive disease showed an extensively altered lipid . Both ATRA and valproic acid monotherapy also altered the amino acid and lipid metabolite profiles; however, these changes were only highly significant for valproic acid treatment. Twenty-three metabolites were significantly altered by seven-day valproic acid treatment ( < 0.05,  < 0.05), where the majority of altered metabolites belonged to lipid (especially fatty acid ) and amino acid , including several carnitines.

The mechanisms of BMD decline with FTC/TDF remain unclear, and studies in HIV-positive individuals have been confounded by the effects of HIV and concomitant antiretroviral medications. We evaluated the impact of FTC/TDF on biomarkers of bone remodeling and bone mineral  in HIV-negative men and women enrolled in the Partners PrEP Study.In a random sample of HIV-negative participants randomized to FTC/TDF PrEP (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50), serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone biomarkers (C-telopeptide, procollagen 1 intact N-terminal propeptide, and sclerostin), and plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 were measured at baseline and month 24, and the percentage change was compared between groups. In a complementary analysis, we compared the change in biomarkers between participants with and without a 25% decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on FTC/TDF.Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups (median age, 38 years; 40% women). Vitamin D insufficiency was common, but baseline GFR and PTH were in the normal range. We observed a significantly greater percent increase in serum C-telopeptide in participants randomized to FTC/TDF vs placebo ( = .03), suggesting an increase in bone remodeling. We observed no differences in the other biomarkers, or in a separate analysis comparing participants with and without a decline in GFR.Increased bone remodeling may mediate the BMD decline observed with tenofovir-containing PrEP and antiretroviral therapy, independent of a TDF-mediated decrease in kidney function.© The Author(s) 2019.

As a consequence, Poldip2 deficiency induces  reprograming with repressed mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity. Though homozygous deletion of Poldip2 is lethal, heterozygous mice are viable and show protection against aneurysm and injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia, diseases linked to loss of VSMC differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that the  reprograming induced by Poldip2 deficiency controls VSMC differentiation.  To determine the role of Poldip2-mediated  reprograming in phenotypic modulation of VSMC.  We show that Poldip2 deficiency in vascular smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of the serum response factor (SRF), Myocardin, and MRTFA and dramatically represses KLF4. Consequently, Poldip2-deficient VSMC and mouse aorta express high levels of contractile proteins and, more significantly, these cells do not dedifferentiate nor acquire macrophage-like characteristics when exposed to Cholesterol or PDGF. Regarding the mechanism, we found that Poldip2 deficiency upregulates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and OGT-mediated protein O-GlcNAcylation. Increased protein glycosylation causes the inhibition of a nuclear UPS responsible for SRF stabilization and KLF4 repression and is required for the establishment of the differentiated phenotype in Poldip2-deficient cells.  Our data show that Poldip2 deficiency induces a highly differentiated phenotype in VSMCs through a mechanism that involves regulation of  and proteostasis. Additionally, our study positions mitochondria-initiated signaling as key element of the VSMC differentiation programs that can be targeted to modulate VSMC phenotype during vascular diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659216>Modeling Snyder-Robinson Syndrome in multipotent stromal cells reveals impaired mitochondrial function as a potential cause for deficient osteogenesis.</a></h2><p>Patients with Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS) exhibit deficient Spermidine Synthase (SMS) gene expression, which causes neurodevelopmental defects and osteoporosis, often leading to extremely fragile bones. To determine the underlying mechanism for impaired bone formation, we modelled the disease by silencing SMS in human bone marrow - derived multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) derived from healthy donors. We found that silencing SMS in MSCs led to reduced cell proliferation and deficient bone formation in vitro, as evidenced by reduced mineralization and decreased bone sialoprotein expression. Furthermore, transplantation of MSCs in osteoconductive scaffolds into immune deficient mice shows that silencing SMS also reduces ectopic bone formation in vivo. Tag-Seq Gene Expression Profiling shows that deficient SMS expression causes strong transcriptome changes, especially in genes related to cell proliferation and  functions. Similarly, metabolome analysis by mass spectrometry, shows that silencing SMS strongly impacts glucose . This was consistent with observations using electron microscopy, where SMS deficient MSCs show high levels of mitochondrial fusion. In line with these findings, SMS deficiency causes a reduction in glucose consumption and increase in lactate secretion. Our data also suggests that SMS deficiency affects iron  in the cells, which we hypothesize is linked to deficient mitochondrial function. Altogether, our studies suggest that SMS deficiency causes strong transcriptomic and  changes in MSCs, which are likely associated with the observed impaired osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659941>Thyrotropin-releasing-hormone-synthesizing neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus are inhibited by glycinergic inputs.</a></h2><p>Glycine is a classical neurotransmitter that has role in both inhibitory and excitatory synapses. To understand whether glycinergic inputs are involved in the regulation of the hypophysiotropic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) neurons, the central controllers of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, the glycinergic innervation of the TRH neurons was studied in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN).Double-labeling immunocytochemistry and patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the role of the glycinergic neurons in the regulation of TRH neurons in the PVN. Anterograde- and retrograde tracing methods were used to determine the sources of the glycinergic input of TRH neurons.Glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2), a marker of glycinergic neurons, containing axons was found to establish symmetric type of synapses on TRH neurons in the PVN. Furthermore, glycine receptor-immunoreactivity was observed in these TRH neurons. The raphe magnus (RMg) and the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG) were found to be the exclusive sources of the glycinergic innervation of the TRH neurons within the PVN. Patch-clamp electrophysiology using sections of TRH-IRES-tdTomato mice showed that glycine hyperpolarized the TRH neurons and completely blocked the firing of these neurons. Glycine also markedly hyperpolarized the TRH neurons in the presence of tetrodotoxin demonstrating the direct effect of glycine. In more than 60% of the TRH neurons, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) were observed, even after the pharmacological inhibition of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal transmission. The glycine antagonist, strychnine, almost completely abolished these sIPSCs, demonstrating the inhibitory nature of the glycinergic input of TRH neurons.These data demonstrate that TRH neurons in the PVN receive glycinergic inputs from the RMg and the VLPAG. The symmetric type of synaptic connection and the results of the electrophysiological experiments demonstrate the inhibitory nature of these inputs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660859>Genomic characteristics and comparative genomics analysis of the endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae.</a></h2><p>Sarocladium brachiariae is a newly identified endophytic fungus isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. A previous study indicated that S. brachiariae had antifungal activity; however, limited genomic information restrains further study. Therefore, we sequenced the genome of S. brachiariae and compared it with the genome of S. oryzae to identify differences between a Sarocladium plant pathogen and an endophyte.In this study, we reported a gapless genome sequence of a newly identified endophytic fungus Sarocladium brachiariae isolated from Brachiaria brizantha. The genome of S. brachiariae is 31.86 Mb, with a contig N50 of 3.27 Mb and 9903 protein coding genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on single copy orthologous genes provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of S. brachiariae and its closest species was identified as S. oryzae. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that S. brachiaria has 14.9% more plant cell wall degradation related CAZymes to S. oryzae, and 33.3% more fungal cell wall degradation related CAZymes, which could explain the antifungal activity of S. brachiaria. Based on Antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell (antiSMASH) analysis, we identified a contact helvolic acid biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for the first time in S. oryzae. However, S. brachiaria had seven fewer terpene gene clusters, including helvolic acid BGC, compared with S. oryzae and this may be associated with adaptation to an endophytic lifestyle. Synteny analysis of polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and hybrid (PKS-NRPS) gene clusters between S. brachiariae and S. oryzae revealed that just 37.5% of tested clusters have good synteny, while 63.5% have no or poor synteny. This indicated that the S. brachiariae could potentially synthesize a variety of unknown-function secondary metabolites, which may play an important role in adaptation to its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.The data provided a better understanding of the Sarocladium brachiariae genome. Further comparative genomic analysis provided insight into the genomic basis of its endophytic lifestyle and antifungal activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659606>Contribution of Baroreflex Afferent Pathway to NPY-Mediated Regulation of Blood Pressure in Rats.</a></h2><p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a -related cardiovascular factor, plays a crucial role in blood pressure (BP) regulation via peripheral and central .

To this end, rats with hypertension induced by N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) or high fructose drinking (HFD), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were used to explore the effects/mechanisms of NPY on BP using functional, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. The data showed that BP was elevated along with baroreceptor sensitivity dysfunction in model rats; YR was up- or down-regulated in the NG or NTS of male and female HFD/L-NAME groups, while YR was only down-regulated in the HFD groups as well as in the NG of the male L-NAME group. In SHRs, YR and YR were both down-regulated in the NTS, and not in the NG. In addition to NPY-mediated energy homeostasis, leptin-melanocortin activation may be essential for  disturbance-related hypertension. We found that leptin and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) receptors were aberrantly down-regulated in HFD rats. In addition, α-MSH concentrations were reduced and NPY concentrations were elevated in the serum and NTS at 60 and 90 min after acute leptin infusion. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the decay time-constant and area under the curve of excitatory post-synaptic currents were decreased by YR activation in A-types, whereas, both were increased by YR activation in Ah- or C-types. These results demonstrate that sex- and afferent-specific NPY receptor expression in the baroreflex afferent pathway is likely to be a novel target for the clinical management of -related and essential hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657171>[Development of research on mechanisms of acupuncture intervention and relationship between astrocyte and ischemic stroke].</a></h2><p>Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the central nervous system, which has been demonstrated to be one of the targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Many studies have confirmed that acupuncture can effectively regulate astrocyte activity in ischemic stroke through these approaches: repairing astrocyte morphology structure, regu-lating energy , inhibiting excitotoxicity, inhibiting inflammation response and promoting nerve regeneration. In this paper, the authors summarized the relationship between astrocyte and ischemic stroke, and discussed the mechanisms of acupuncture therapy underlying improvement of ischemic stroke. Additionally, the authors also put forward some suggestions about future researches on acupuncture in ischemic stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661602>Tracking mitochondria's intra- and inter-organelle signaling.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria are as highly specialized organelles and masters of the cellular energy  in a constant and dynamic interplay with their cellular environment, providing adenosine trisphosphate, buffering Ca and fundamentally contributing to various signaling . Hence, such broad field of action within eukaryotic cells requires a high level of structural and functional adaptation. Therefore, mitochondria are constantly moving and undergoing fusion and fission processes, changing their shape and their interaction with other organelles. Moreover, mitochondrial activity gets fine-tuned by intra- and inter-organelle H , K , Na and Ca signaling. In this review we provide an up-to-date overview on mitochondrial strategies to adapt and respond to, as well as affect, their cellular environment. We also present cutting-edge technologies used to track and investigate subcellular signaling, essential to the understanding of various physiological and pathophysiological processes.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656079>MicroRNA Targeting NADPH Oxidases in Cancer.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production occurs primarily in the mitochondria as a byproduct of cellular . ROS are also produced by NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidases in response to growth factors and cytokines by normal physiological signaling . NADPH oxidase, a member of NOX family, utilizes molecular oxygen (O2) to generate ROS such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2•-). Imbalance between ROS production and its elimination is known to be the major cause of various human diseases. NOX family proteins are exclusively involved in ROS production which makes them attractive target(s) for the treatment of ROS-mediated diseases including cancer. Molecules such as Keap1/Nrf2, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDRs), NF-κB, KRAS, kallistatin, gene associated with retinoic-interferon-induced mortality-19 and deregulated   are involved in ROS production in association with NADPH oxidase. Therapeutic strategies targeting NADPH oxidases in ROS driven cancers are not very effective due to its complex regulatory circuit. Tumor suppressor miRNAs viz. miR-34a, miR-137, miR-99a, and miR-21a-3p targeting NADPH oxidases are predominantly downregulated in ROS driven cancers. miRNAs also regulate other cellular machineries such as Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and NMDRs involved in ROS production and consequently drug resistance. Here we discuss the structure, function and  role of NADPH oxidase, NOX family protein-protein interaction, their association with other  and NADPH oxidase alteration by miRNAs. Moreover, we also discuss and summarize studies on NADPH oxidase-associated with various malignancies and their therapeutic implications. Targeting NADPH oxidases through miRNAs appears to be a promising strategy for the treatment of ROS driven cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657414>Roles of different n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios in ovarian cell development and steroidogenesis in PCOS rats.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, which is accompanied by follicle growth arrest at the small antral stage, minimal granulosa cell proliferation, and chronic anovulation. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are necessary for the body's , growth and development. Although PUFAs play an important role in the regulation of female reproduction, their role in ovarian development in PCOS is still unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of different ratios of n-3/n-6 PUFAs (omega-3/omega-6) on ovary development in PCOS rats. Serum levels of reproductive hormones and enzymes related to steroidogenesis were assessed. The results indicated that PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) significantly increased ovarian weight and improved the ovarian structure although they had no significant effect on body weight in PCOS rats. Meanwhile, apoptosis was attenuated accompanied by increased cell proliferation by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15). Moreover, serum levels of hormones (FSH and E2) were also significantly increased by PUFAs (n-3/n-6: 1/15) accompanied by decreased T levels. To investigate whether PUFAs regulate the expression of enzymes related to hormone synthesis, western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of CYP51, CYP19, StAR and 3β-HSD. The results showed that PUFAs significantly increased the protein levels of all of these enzymes. These results indicate that PUFAs enhance the reproductive performance of PCOS by increasing the expression of steroidogenesis enzymes, which are related to hormone secretion and ovarian functions. These findings provide evidence that a balanced n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio is beneficial for PCOS reproduction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659405>3-Amidinophenylalanine-derived matriptase inhibitors can modulate hepcidin production in vitro.</a></h2><p>Matriptase-2 (MT-2) is a type II transmembrane serine protease and predominantly attached to the surface of hepatocytes. MT-2 decreases the production of hepcidin, a key regulator of iron homeostasis. In this study, the effects of four 3-amidinophenylalanine-derived combined matriptase-1/matriptase-2 (MT-1/2) inhibitors (MI-432, MI-441, MI-460, and MI-461) on hepcidin production were investigated in hepatocyte mono- and hepatocyte-Kupffer cell co-cultures. In MI-461-treated cell cultures, the extracellular hydrogen peroxide contents and the interleukin-6 and -8 (IL-6 and IL-8) levels were determined and compared to controls. Hepcidin overproduction was observed in hepatocytes upon treatment with MI-432, MI-441 and MI-461 at 50 μM. In contrast, extracellular hydrogen peroxide levels were not elevated significantly after matriptase inhibition with MI-461. Furthermore, MI-461 did not induce increases in IL-6 and IL-8 levels in these hepatic models. A model of the binding mode of inhibitor MI-461 in complex with MT-2 revealed numerous polar contacts contributing to the nanomolar potency of this compound. Based on the in vitro data on hepcidin regulation, treatment with MI-461 might be valuable in pathological states of iron  without causing excessive oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656044>Development and validation of LC-MS/MS method for urinary 39 steroid (estrogens, androgens, corticoids, and progestins) profiling.</a></h2><p>Abnormal production or  of steroid hormones are responsible for the development of endocrine diseases. The accurate quantification of steroid hormones is needed for both research into clinical conditions as well as for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. The improved analytical method for 39 steroid profiling in urine was developed using LC-MS/MS. As a pre-treatment procedure prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, hydrolysis using β-glucuronidase and solid-phase extraction for purifying the samples were performed. Steroids were separated using Waters ACQUITY @ BEH C column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 μm) and a mobile phase consisting of eluent A (0.01% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate in water) and eluent B (0.01% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate in methanol) with a gradient program at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Under the optimized method, the linearity of calibration curves was higher than 0.992. The limits of detection (LOD) at signal to noise (S/N) ratio of 3 were 0.03-90 ng/mL. The developed novel LC-MS/MS method can quantitatively profile 39 steroids in a single analytical run. Steroid profiling based on quantitative results could improve the diagnosis and monitoring of hormone-dependent diseases.This article is protected by copyright.

Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate , protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first report to measure rice phosphoproteomic changes in response to SA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of SA-induced rice defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658492>Rosiglitazone alleviates α-naphthylisothiocyanate-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in mice - The role of circulating 15d-PGJ and Nogo.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic cholestasis is mainly caused by dysfunctions of molecules for bile secretion with limited treatment. Rosiglitazone is a synthetic ligand while 15-deoxy-Δ -prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ ) is the endogenous agonist of PPARγ. Reticulon 4B (Nogo-B) is the detectable Nogo protein family member in the liver and secreted into circulation. Herein, we determined if rosiglitazone can alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis in mice.Wild type, hepatocyte-specific PPARγ or Nogo-B knockout mice received intragastric administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and/or rosiglitazone, followed by determination of intrahepatic cholestasis and the involved mechanisms. Serum samples were collected from PBC patients and non-PBC controls to analyze cholestasis-related serum parameters.Rosiglitazone prevented wild type but not hepatocyte-specific PPARγ deficient mice from ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis by activating expression of bile homeostatic molecules, reducing hepatic necrosis, and correcting abnormal serum parameters and bile enterohepatic circulation. Nogo-B deficiency had similar protections to rosiglitazone. ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis reduced 15d-PGJ but increased Nogo-B in serum, and both were corrected by rosiglitazone. Nogo-B deficiency in the liver boosted 15d-PGJ production, thereby activating expression of PPARγ and bile homeostatic molecules. Rosiglitazone and Nogo-B deficiency also alleviated cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia. Furthermore, reduced 15d-PGJ and increased Nogo-B in PBC patients' serum were determined, with a negative or positive correlation to classical cholestatic parameters. In addition, rosiglitazone reduced symptoms of the established intrahepatic cholestasis.Our study demonstrates that 15d-PGJ and Nogo are important biomarkers for intrahepatic cholestasis. Synthetic PPARγ ligands can be used for treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis and cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia potentially.This article is protected by copyright.

These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic lipid species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency. Furthermore, this assay can also be used in a high-throughput pipeline to test novel therapeutic compounds, which restore defects in LD formation in intestinal or other types of organoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661710>Bridging the gap or paving the way for uninvited guests?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657329>[Clinical significance of antibacterial peptide LL-37 in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis in emergency department].</a></h2><p>To discuss the clinical significance of antibacterial peptide LL-37 in the early diagnosis of patients with sepsis in emergency department.Forty patients diagnosed with sepsis in the emergency department of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College from December 2017 to March 2018 were enrolled as sepsis group. Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled contemporaneously in our hospital at medical center as healthy control group. Peripheral blood was collected immediately after diagnosis in sepsis group or during physical examination in healthy control group. The expression of antibacterial peptide LL-37 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined. The differences in antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP levels between the two groups were compared. Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the early individually or jointly diagnostic value of each detected index for sepsis was analyzed.The levels of antimicrobial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP in peripheral blood of sepsis group were significantly higher than those of healthy control group [LL-37 (μg/L): 1.34±0.69 vs. 0.10±0.06, PCT (μg/L): 46.67±39.51 vs. 0.03±0.02, CRP (mg/L): 129.68±49.83 vs. 3.16±2.85], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the expression of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was positively correlated with PCT and CRP levels (r = 0.835, r = 0.932, both P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of LL-37, PCT and CRP for early diagnosis of sepsis was 0.885, 0.963 and 0.983, respectively, and the AUC of combined diagnosis of the three parameters was as high as 0.994, indicating that the value of combined diagnosis of sepsis was greater than that of single diagnosis; when the combined prediction probability of the three parameters was 0.92, the sensitivity was 97.5%, and the specificity was 95.0%.Antibacterial peptide LL-37 has certain clinical value in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis, which can be used as early routine monitoring indicators for patients with early sepsis when combined with PCT and CRP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658741>Sphingolipid  Perturbations in Rett Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mostly females and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the  gene that encoded the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2.

However, the exact downstream contributors are not completely identified. BAG3 is a cochaperone with multiple cellular functions and is implicated in  reprogramming of pancreatic cancer cells. The current study demonstrated that glucose limitation transcriptionally suppressed BAG3 expression in a p53-dependent manner. Importantly, hinderance of its down-regulation compromised cellular adaptation to  stress triggered by glucose insufficiency, supporting that BAG3 might be one of p53 downstream contributors for cellular adaptation to  stress. Our data showed that ectopic BAG3 expression suppressed p53 accumulation via direct interaction under  stress. Thereby, the current study highlights the significance of p53-mediated BAG3 suppression in cellular adaptation to  stress via facilitating p53 accumulation.© 2019 The Authors.

Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism . To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer inflammation were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both colitis mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660753>A Complex Relationship: Dietary Folate, Arsenic , and Insulin Resistance in Mice.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660948>The human gut bacteria Christensenellaceae are widespread, heritable, and associated with health.</a></h2><p>The Christensenellaceae, a recently described family in the phylum Firmicutes, is emerging as an important player in human health.

Using the transparent visibility of zebrafish, the strains for intestinal peristalsis were quickly screened. The methods and results were as follows: (1) 18 strains with outstanding gastrointestinal viability via their surface hydrophobicity, self-aggregation ability, acid tolerance, bile tolerance, simulated gastric digestion and intestinal fluid tolerance were determined from 54 unpublished strains. (2) 5dpf zebrafish were randomly selected and divided into 22 groups with 12 tails in each group. The intestinal peristalsis frequency of each group within 1 min was calculated after immersing the model zebrafish in a 108 CFU mL-1 strain solution, with 5 effective strains obtained. (3) The serotonin in zebrafish was measured by Elisa and fluorescence immunization.

Rare cases of loss-of-functions mutations affecting leptin and its receptor, as well as polymorphisms concerning ghrelin and its receptor, have been documented in human obesity, apparently validating the relevance of leptin and ghrelin for human physiology. Paradoxically, however, the overwhelming majority of obese individuals manifest high leptin and low ghrelin plasma levels, suggesting that both factors are not directly disease-relevant. We recently discovered that acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP), also known as diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), acts as an efficient lipogenic and appetite stimulator in mice. Indeed, in response to starvation, ACBP/DBI is released from tissues in an autophagy-dependent fashion and increases in the plasma. Intravenous injection of ACBP/DBI stimulates feeding behavior through a reduction of circulating glucose levels, and consequent activation of orexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, neutralization of ACBP/DBI abolishes the hyperphagia observed after starvation of mice. Of note, ACBP/DBI is increased in the plasma of obese persons and mice, pointing to a convergence (rather than divergence) between its role in appetite stimulation and human obesity. Based on our results, we postulate a novel 'hunger reflex' in which starvation induces a surge in extracellular ACBP/DBI, which in turn stimulates feeding behavior. Thus, ACBP/DBI might be the elusive 'hunger factor' that explains increased food uptake in obesity.Copyright: © 2019 Bravo-San Pedro et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659104>Acquisition of Invasiveness by Breast Adenocarcinoma Cells Engages Established Hallmarks and Novel Regulatory Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Proteomics of invasiveness opens a window on the complexity of the metastasis-engaged mechanisms.

However, whether this association is causal is still unclear. We aimed to test whether genetically lowered vitamin D levels were associated with MS and its  traits, using mendelian randomization (MR) methodology.Ten thousand six hundred fifty-five participants were enrolled from the SPECT-China study, which was performed in 23 sites in East China during 2014 to 2016. Using four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC and CYP24A1 genes with known effects on 25(OH) D concentrations, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) as instrumental variable (IV) to estimate the effect of genetically lowered 25(OH) D on MS and cardiometabolic risk factors. MS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria.Lower measured 25(OH)D levels were associated with MS (OR 0.921, 95% CI 0.888, 0.954) after multivariable adjustment. However, the MR-derived odds ratio of genetically determined 25(OH) D for risk of MS was 0.977 (95% CI 0.966, 1.030). The MR-derived estimates for raised fasting plasma glucose was 0.578 (95% CI 0.321, 0.980) per 10 nmol/L GRS determined increase of 25(OH) D levels.We found no evidence that genetically determined reduction in 25(OH)D conferred an increased risk of MS and its  traits. However, we created our GRS only on the basis of common variants, which represent limited amount of variance in 25(OH)D. MR studies using rare variants, and large-scale well-designed RCTs about the effect of vitamin D supplementation on MS are warranted to further validate the findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657101>High-quality genome-scale  modeling of Pseudomonas putida highlights its broad  capabilities.</a></h2><p>Genome-scale reconstructions of  are computational species-specific knowledge bases able to compute systemic  properties.

Candidate  pathway was validated using in vitro and in vivo assays.From TCGA database, we found that polyamine  was significantly enriched in Cyclin E1-driven OvCa. Expressions of SMS, SRM, and ODC1 were positively correlated with that of CCNE1, respectively. ODC1 and SMS expressions were significantly correlated with decreased immune infiltrates. PGC-1α silencing significantly decreased invasion and migration in both OvCa cell lines. Both spermidine and spermine levels were significantly increased when PGC-1α was silenced. Targeting SRM significantly decreased spermine level in OVCAR3 cells, which was rescued when PGC-1α was silenced. Silencing of PGC-1α resulted in increased SRM in both OvCa cells. Dinaciclib significantly decreased invasion and migration of OVCAR3 cells. Expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were predominantly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Dinaciclib showed no notable effect of PD-1 yet substantially induced the increased levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2.Cyclin E1-driven OvCa is characterized with activated polyamine synthesis, which is associated with decreased cancer immunity.

Previous research observed enhanced activity of the cyanide-detoxifying enzyme β-cyanoalanine synthase (β-CAS) and reduced ethylene production in the resistant line, suggesting β-CAS-mediated cyanide detoxification and insensitivity to quinclorac stimulation as the resistance mechanisms. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of quinclorac resistance, we characterized the β-CAS genes alongside plant transformation studies. The association of β-CAS activity and ethylene production to quinclorac resistance was assayed in the F6 progeny of susceptible and resistant lines of E. phyllopogon.A single nucleotide polymorphism in a β-CAS1 intron deleted aberrantly spliced mRNAs and enhanced β-CAS activity in the resistant line. The enhanced activity, however, was not associated with quinclorac resistance in F6 lines. The results were supported by lack of quinclorac resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana expressing E. phyllopogon β-CAS1 and no difference in quinclorac sensitivity between β-CAS knockout and wild type rice. Reduced ethylene production co-segregated with quinclorac resistance in F6 lines which were previously characterized to be resistant to other herbicides by enhanced .β-CAS does not participate in quinclorac sensitivity in E. phyllopogon. Our results suggest that mechanism(s) leading to reduced ethylene production is behind the resistance. This article is protected by copyright.

Acinetobacin, a siderophore of A. baumannii, is responsible for iron acquisition under nutritional depravation and has been shown to be one of the key virulence factors for this bacterium. In this Highlight, recent findings regarding various chemical and biological aspects of acinetobactin  closely related to the fitness of A. baumannii at the infection sites have been described.

The results indicated that ASM enhanced the hydrogen peroxide (HO) content, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), glutathione reductase (GR) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). ASM also increased the contents of ascorbic acid (AsA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and nicotinamide ademine dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH), MdSOD and MdAPX expression, but decreased MdMDHAR and dehydroascorbate reductase (MdDHAR) expression. DHEA suppressed HO accumulation and POD, APX, MDHAR, G6PDH activities, but increased SOD, CAT and GR activities compared to the control. ASM and DHEA treatments suppressed the contents of AsA, GSH and NADPH, and expression of MdSOD, MdAPX and MdMDHAR. These results suggest that DHEA treatment prevented ROS  induced by ASM which showed the important role of G6PDH in maintaining redox homeostasis in apple exocarp.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in increasing the risk of insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM remained elusive. The current study aimed to determine the role of ART in predicting insulin therapy in GDM women and investigate the clinical and biochemical factors predicting the need for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.In this prospective cohort study, 236 Iranian women with GDM were diagnosed by one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between October 2014 and June 2017. They were mainly assigned to two groups; the first group (n = 100) was designated as ART which was further subdivided into two subgroups as follows: 60 participants who received medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and 40 participants who received MNT plus insulin therapy (MNT-IT). The second group (n = 136) was labeled as the spontaneous conception (SC), consisting of 102 participants receiving MNT and 34 participants receiving MNT in combination with IT (MNT-IT). The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate prognostic factors for insulin therapy.A higher rate of insulin therapy was observed in the ART group as compared with the SC group (40% vs. 25%; P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that maternal age ≥ 35 years [OR: 2.91, 95% CI: (1.28-6.62)], high serum FBS [1.10: (1.04-1.16)], HbA1c [1.91 (1.09-3.34)], and ART treatment [2.94: (1.24-6.96)] were independent risk factors for insulin therapy in GDM women.Apart from risk factors mentioned earlier, ART may be a possible prognostic factor for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid .</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired inflammation at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and inflammation, leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid  genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659504>Correction to: Pathological impact of transanal colorectal tube for obstructive colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>In Methods of Abstract, the word "2015" should be changed to "2011".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657273>Pharmaceutical design and development of perfluorocarbon nanocolloids for oxygen delivery in regenerative medicine.</a></h2><p>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have been investigated as oxygen carriers for several decades in varied biomedical applications.

Yeast phenomic experiments were conducted to assess potential influences of Warburg  on gene-drug interaction underlying the cellular response to doxorubicin. Homologous genes from yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics data were analyzed to infer evolutionary conservation of gene-drug interaction and predict therapeutic relevance.Cell proliferation phenotypes (CPPs) of the yeast gene knockout/knockdown library were measured by quantitative high-throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP), treating with escalating doxorubicin concentrations under conditions of respiratory or glycolytic . Doxorubicin-gene interaction was quantified by departure of CPPs observed for the doxorubicin-treated mutant strain from that expected based on an interaction model. Recursive expectation-maximization clustering (REMc) and Gene Ontology (GO)-based analyses of interactions identified functional biological modules that differentially buffer or promote doxorubicin cytotoxicity with respect to Warburg . Yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics data were integrated to predict differential gene expression causally influencing doxorubicin anti-tumor efficacy.Yeast compromised for genes functioning in chromatin organization, and several other cellular processes are more resistant to doxorubicin under glycolytic conditions. Thus, the Warburg transition appears to alleviate requirements for cellular functions that buffer doxorubicin cytotoxicity in a respiratory context. We analyzed human homologs of yeast genes exhibiting gene-doxorubicin interaction in cancer pharmacogenomics data to predict causality for differential gene expression associated with doxorubicin cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This analysis suggested conserved cellular responses to doxorubicin due to influences of homologous recombination, sphingolipid homeostasis, telomere tethering at nuclear periphery, actin cortical patch localization, and other gene functions.Warburg status alters the genetic network required for yeast to buffer doxorubicin toxicity. Integration of yeast phenomic and cancer pharmacogenomics data suggests evolutionary conservation of gene-drug interaction  and provides a new experimental approach to model their influence on chemotherapy response. Thus, yeast phenomic models could aid the development of precision oncology algorithms to predict efficacious cytotoxic drugs for cancer, based on genetic and  profiles of individual tumors.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658356>Investigation of the association between obesity and Insulin-induced gene 1 polymorphism at 7q36.3 region in Uygur population in Xinjiang, China.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a common heritable trait and a major risk factors of chronic and  diseases. Insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) is known to play important roles in cholesterol and  triacylglycerol (TAG) . In present study, our primary objective was to explore whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in INSIG1 gene were associated with obesity in Uygur subjects, in Xinjiang, China.We designed a case-control study including 516 obese patients and 463 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Three SNPs (rs2721, rs9767875 and rs9719268) were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays.For rs2721, the distribution of genotypes, dominant model (GT + TT vs GG), recessive model (TT vs GT + GG) showed significant differences between obese patients and the controls (P = 0.008, P = 0.005 and P = 0.035 respectively). For rs9719268, the distribution of genotypes showed significant differences between obese patients and the controls (P = 0.004). The dominant model (GT + TT vs GG) of rs2721 and rs9719268 GT genotype remain significantly associated with obesity  after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.393, 95% CI = 1.047-1.853, P = 0.023; OR = 1.631, 95% CI = 1.059-2.512, P = 0.026). The TG levels were significantly higher in rs2721 GT/TT genotypes than that in GG genotypes (P ＜ 0.05).  Conclusions: Rs2721 and rs9719268 of INSIG1 gene are associated with obesity in Uygur subjects. Subjects with GT/TT genotype or T allele of rs2721 and GT genotype of rs9719268 were associated with an increased risk of obesity.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660018>Glycemic Control During Gender-Affirming Therapy in a Patient With Type 1 Diabetes.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656227>Allylic hydroxylation of triterpenoids by a plant cytochrome P450 triggers key chemical transformations that produce a variety of bitter compounds.</a></h2><p>Cucurbitacins are highly oxygenated triterpenoids characteristic of plants in the family Cucurbitaceae and responsible for the bitter taste of these plants. Fruits of bitter melon () contain various cucurbitacins possessing an unusual ether bridge between C5 and C19, not observed in other Cucurbitaceae members. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing and RNA-seq analysis and gene-to-gene co-expression analysis with the ConfeitoGUIplus software, we identified three P450 genes, , , and , expected to be involved in cucurbitacin biosynthesis. CYP81AQ19 co-expression with cucurbitadienol synthase in yeast resulted in the production of cucurbita-5,24-diene-3β,23α-diol. A mild acid treatment of this compound resulted in an isomerization of the C23-OH group to C25-OH with the concomitant migration of a double bond, suggesting that a non-enzymatic transformation may account for the observed C25-OH in the majority of cucurbitacins found in plants. The functional expression of CYP88L7 resulted in the production of hydroxylated C19, as well as C5-C19 ether-bridged products. A plausible mechanism for the formation of the C5-C19 ether bridge involves C7 and C19 hydroxylations, indicating a multifunctional nature of this P450. On the other hand, functional CYP88L8 expression gave a single product, a triterpene diol, indicating a monofunctional P450 catalyzing the C7 hydroxylation. Our findings of the roles of several plant P450s in cucurbitacin biosynthesis reveal that an allylic hydroxylation is a key enzymatic transformation that triggers subsequent processes to produce structurally diverse products.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658975>Redefining Hypoglycemia in Clinical Trials: Validation of Definitions Recently Adopted by the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to determine if the International Hypoglycemia Study Group (IHSG) level 2 low glucose definition could identify clinically relevant hypoglycemia in clinical trials and offer value as an end point for future trials.A post hoc analysis of the SWITCH (SWITCH 1:  = 501, type 1 diabetes; SWITCH 2:  = 721, type 2 diabetes) and the Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin Degludec versus Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE;  = 7,637, type 2 diabetes) using the IHSG low glucose definitions. Patients in all trials were randomized to either insulin degludec or insulin glargine 100 units/mL. In the main analysis, the following definitions were compared: ) American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2005 (plasma glucose [PG] confirmed ≤3.9 mmol/L with symptoms); and ) IHSG level 2 (glucose confirmed <3.0 mmol/L).In SWITCH 2, the estimated rate ratios of hypoglycemic events indicated increasing differences between treatments with decreasing PG levels until 3.0 mmol/L, following which no additional treatment differences were observed. In SWITCH 2, the IHSG level 2 definition produced a rate ratio that was lower than the ADA 2005 definition. Similar results were observed for the SWITCH 1 trial.The IHSG level 2 definition was validated in a series of clinical trials, demonstrating its ability to discriminate between basal insulins.

Vascular calcification is one pathway through which cardiovascular disease risks are increased. We hypothesized that a novel measure of serum calcification propensity is associated with cardiovascular disease events, ESKD, and all-cause mortality among patients with CKD stages 2-4.Among 3404 participants from the prospective, longitudinal Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study, we quantified calcification propensity as the transformation time (T) from primary to secondary calciprotein particles, with lower T corresponding to higher calcification propensity. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the associations of T with risks of adjudicated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease), adjudicated heart failure, ESKD, and mortality.The mean T was 313 (SD 79) minutes. Over an average 7.1 (SD 3.1) years of follow-up, we observed 571 atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, 633 heart failure events, 887 ESKD events, and 924 deaths. With adjustment for traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, lower T was significantly associated with higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio [HR] per SD lower T, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to 1.25), ESKD within 3 years from baseline (HR per SD lower T, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 1.86), and all-cause mortality (HR per SD lower T, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.24), but not heart failure (HR per SD lower T, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.15). After adjustment for eGFR and 24-hour urinary protein, T was not associated with risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ESKD, and mortality.Among patients with CKD stages 2-4, higher serum calcification propensity is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, ESKD, and all-cause mortality, but this association was not independent of kidney function.This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2019_10_28_CJN04710419.mp3.Copyright © 2019 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658747>Structural Determination of Lysosphingomyelin-509 and Discovery of Novel Class Lipids from Patients with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C.</a></h2><p>Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the mutation of cholesterol-transporting proteins. In addition, early treatment is important for good prognosis of this disease because of the progressive neurodegeneration. However, the diagnosis of this disease is difficult due to a variety of clinical spectrum. Lysosphingomyelin-509, which is one of the most useful biomarkers for NPC, was applied for the rapid and easy detection of NPC. The fact that its chemical structure was unknown until recently implicates the unrevealed pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms of NPC. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the structure of lysosphingomyelin-509 by various mass spectrometric techniques. As our identification strategy, we adopted analytical and organic chemistry approaches to the serum of patients with NPC. Chemical derivatization and hydrogen abstraction dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry were used for the determination of function groups and partial structure, respectively. As a result, we revealed the exact structure of lysosphingomyelin-509 as -acylated and -phosphocholine adducted serine. Additionally, we found that a group of metabolites with -acyl groups were increased considerably in the serum/plasma of patients with NPC as compared to that of other groups using targeted lipidomics analysis.

The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on pancreatic β-cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and Insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were detected using HLA class I tetramers and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D, we observed an increase in PPI -specific transitional memory CD8+ T cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore, PPI -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB -specific CD8+ T cells was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of autoantibodies. This is the first study to report HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results provide evidence that β-cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.© 2019 British Society for Immunology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658948>CYP2D1 Gene Knockout Reduces the  and Efficacy of Venlafaxine in Rats.</a></h2><p>Rat CYP2D1 has been considered as an ortholog of human CYP2D6. To assess the role of CYP2D1 in physiological processes and drug , a CYP2D1-null rat model was generated with a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 method. Seven base-pairs were deleted from the exon 4 of CYP2D1 of Sprague-Dawley wild-type (WT) rats. The CYP2D1-null rats were viable and showed no abnormalities in general appearance and behaviors.  of venlafaxine (VLF) was further studied in CYP2D1-null rats. Vmax and CLint of the liver microsomes in vitro from CYP2D1-null rats were decreased (~46% and ~57% in males, ~47% and ~58% in females), while Km was increased (~24% in males, ~25% in females) compared to those of WTs. In the pharmacokinetic studies, compared to the WTs, VLF in the CYP2D1-null rats had significantly lower Cl/F and Vd/F (~36% and ~48% in males, ~23% and ~25% in females), significantly increased AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax (~64%, ~59% and ~26% in males, ~43%, ~35% and ~15% in females). In addition, O-desmethyl venlafaxine (the main active metabolite of venlafaxine) formation was reduced as well in the CYP2D1-null rats compared to that in WTs. Rat depression models were developed by feeding separately and chronic mild stimulations with CYP2D1-null and WT rats. VLF showed a better efficacy in the WT depression rats compared to that in the CYP2D1-null ones. In conclusion, a CYP2D1-null rat model was successfully generated, and CYP2D1 was found to play an important role in the  and efficacy of venlafaxine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A novel CYP2D1-null rat model was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and it was a valuable tool to study the in vivo function of human CYP2D6. Moreover, our data demonstrated that the reduced ODV formation was associated with a lower VLF efficacy in rats, suggesting a potential application of monitoring plasm ODV level in the clinical optimization of VLF for the treatment of depression.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656971>IGF-1 is associated with estimated bone strength in anorexia nervosa.</a></h2><p>IGF-1 and leptin are two nutritionally dependent hormones associated with low bone mass in women with anorexia nervosa.

We hypothesized that IGF-1 and leptin would also be positively associated with estimated bone strength in women with anorexia nervosa.In this cross-sectional study of 38 women (19 with anorexia nervosa and 19 normal-weight controls), we measured serum IGF-1 and leptin and performed finite element analysis of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT images to measure stiffness and failure load of the distal radius and tibia.IGF-1 was strongly correlated with estimated bone strength in the radius (R = 0.52, p = 0.02 for both stiffness and failure load) and tibia (R = 0.55, p = 0.01 for stiffness and R = 0.58, p = 0.01 for failure load) in the women with anorexia nervosa but not in normal-weight controls. In contrast, leptin was not associated with estimated bone strength in the group of women with anorexia nervosa or normal-weight controls.IGF-1 is strongly associated with estimated bone strength in the radius and tibia in women with anorexia nervosa.

Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino acid cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, lipid , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661298>Hepatic IKK epsilon expression is dispensable for high-fat feeding-induced increases in liver lipid content and alterations in glucose tolerance.</a></h2><p>There are endocrine and immunological changes that occur during onset and progression of the overweight and obese states.

To investigate the primary sites of action associated with IKKε during weight gain, we describe the first mouse line with conditional elimination of IKKε in the liver (IKKε ). IKKε  mice and littermate controls gain weight, show similar changes in body composition, and do not display any improvements in insulin sensitivity or whole-body glucose tolerance. These studies were conducted using both breeder chow diets and also matched low-  high-fat diets. While glycogen accumulation in the liver is reduced in IKKε mice, lipid storage in liver is similar IKKε mice and littermate controls. Our results using IKKε mice suggest that the primary action of this kinase to impact insulin sensitivity during weight gain lies predominantly within extrahepatic tissues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661273>Multi-organ systems study reveals Igfbp7 as a suppressor of gluconeogenesis after gastric bypass surgery.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery reduces weight in obese patients. A marked decrease in blood glucose levels occurs before weight loss; however, key molecules that improve glycemic profile remain largely unknown. Using a murine RYGB surgery model, we performed multi-organ proteomics and bioinformatics to monitor the proteins and molecular  that change in this early glycemic response. Multiplexed proteomic kinetics data analysis revealed that the Roux limb, biliopancreatic limb, liver and pancreas each exhibited unique temporal and molecular responses to the RYGB surgery. In addition, protein-protein network analysis indicated that the changes to the microbial environment in the intestine may play a crucial role in the beneficial effects of RYGB surgery. Furthermore, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (Igfbp7) was identified as an early induced protein in the Roux limb. Known secretory properties of Igfbp7 prompted us to further investigate its role as a remote organ regulator of glucose . Igfbp7 overexpression decreased blood glucose levels in diet-induced obese mice, and attenuated gluconeogenic gene expression in the liver. Secreted Igfbp7 appeared to mediate these beneficial effects.

Inverse-probability-of-treatment-and-censoring weighted Poisson regression with robust variances was used to evaluate the association between regimens and switching, adherence and HIV RNA <20 copies/mL.Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimen usage has increased since 2008. Almost 90% of cART initiators started with INSTI-cART in 2016-2017; cART adherence was stable around 90% and 83%-85% suppressed virus (<20 cp/mL). Commonly used regimens in 2014-2017 contained disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) backbone with efavirenz (EFV, n = 1161 person-visits), elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c, n = 551), rilpivirine (RPV, n = 492), darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r, n = 351), or atazanavir (ATV)/r (n = 333). Others were dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (DTG/ABC/3TC, n = 401) and EVG/c/tenofovir alafenamide/FTC (EVG/c/TAF/FTC, n = 309). Compared to EFV/TDF/FTC users, ATV/r+TDF/FTC users switched more (rate ratio [RR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.76), while those on DTG/ABC/3TC (RR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.08-0.31]) or EVG/c/TAF/FTC (RR [95% CI] = 0.12 [0.06-0.27]) switched less. The rate of suppressed HIV RNA was 15% (95% CI, 2%-26%) lower among younger EVG/c/TDF/FTC users and 18% (95% CI, 3%-34%) higher in older DRV/r+TDF/FTC users; adherence did not differ by regimen.Consistent with guidelines, recent cART initiators started with INSTI-cART, which was associated with less switching early after initiation. Factors beyond those studied here, such as need for salvage therapy, unique personal characteristics, drug interactions, and cost may influence treatment decisions.© The Author(s) 2019.

Impaired INSR activities lead to insulin resistance, the key factor in the pathology of  disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mainstream opinion is that insulin resistance begins at a post-receptor level. The role of INSR activities and trafficking in insulin resistance pathogenesis has been largely ignored. Ligand-activated INSR is internalized and trafficked to early endosome (EE), where INSR is dephosphorylated and sorted. INSR can be subsequently conducted to lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The  fate of INSR in cellular events implies the profound influence of INSR on insulin signaling . Disruption of INSR-coupled activities has been identified in a wide range of insulin resistance-related diseases such as T2DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in INSR trafficking may lead to severe insulin resistance. However, there is very little understanding of how altered INSR activities undermine complex signaling  to the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. Here, we focus this review on summarizing previous findings on the molecular  of INSR trafficking in normal and diseased states. Through this review, we provide insights into the mechanistic role of INSR intracellular processes and activities in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657099>Prognostic significance of MTOR expression in HPV positive and negative head and neck cancers treated by chemoradiation.</a></h2><p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) plays a key role in regulating cell growth and  and is commonly overexpressed in head and neck cancer (HNSCC). This study investigated the association of MTOR with clinical outcome in human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and negative HNSCC patients treated by chemoradiation.A tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of cores from 109 HNSCC patients treated by definitive chemoradiation was constructed and stained with antibodies against p16 and MTOR and expression correlated with clinicopathological features and clinical outcome.MTOR varied widely between tumor cores and was not associated with HPV status or clinicopathological features. There was a positive correlation with pre-treatment FDG uptake. (P = .01). In HPV negative patients, MTOR predicted for shorter locoregional control (P = .02), diseases free survival (P = .02), and overall survival (P = .04). MTOR expression was not associated with outcome in HPV positive patients.Prognostic significance of MTOR expression depends on HPV status.© Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661517>'Fat's chances': Loci for phenotypic dispersion in plasma leptin in mouse models of diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Leptin, a critical mediator of feeding,  and diabetes, is expressed on an incidental basis according to satiety. The genetic regulation of leptin should similarly be episodic.Data from three mouse cohorts hosted by the Jackson Laboratory- 402 (174F, 228M) F2 Dilute Brown non-Agouti (DBA/2)×DU6i intercrosses, 142 Non Obese Diabetic (NOD/ShiLtJ×(NOD/ShiLtJ×129S1/SvImJ.H2g7) N2 backcross females, and 204 male Nonobese Nondiabetic (NON)×New Zealand Obese (NZO/HlLtJ) reciprocal backcrosses-were used to test for loci associated with absolute residuals in plasma leptin and arcsin-transformed percent fat ('phenotypic dispersion'; PDpLep and PDAFP). Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and energy regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658209>A Case of Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis With Acute Progressive Nodular Lesions Depicted on High-Resolution Computed Tomography.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657648>Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors Reduce Adipogenesis of Orbital Fibroblasts and Enhance Myofibroblastic Differentiation in Graves' Orbitopathy.</a></h2><p>: Orbital fibroblasts are involved in pathogenesis of Graves' orbitopathy (GO). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) affects fibroblasts of GO. This study aims to investigate the roles of FGF and FGF receptor (FGFR) in GO. : Serum FGF proteins and orbital fibroblast FGFR proteins and mRNAs were measured in GO patients and controls. Orbital fibroblasts of GO were cultured and accessed for changes in proliferation (by nuclei number and MTT), myofibroblastic differentiation (by α-SMA), and adipogenesis (by oil droplets using Oil Red O stain) under FGF1 with or without FGFR inhibitors (FGFRi). : Serum FGF1 and FGF2 were increased in GO patients. FGFR1 was the most abundantly expressed FGFR in GO orbital fibroblasts. FGF1 increased GO fibroblast proliferation/adipogenesis and suppressed myofibroblastic differentiation, while FGFRi reversed these effects. : FGF signaling may be involved in GO pathogenesis. Manipulation of FGF-FGFR pathway for GO treatment is worthy of further investigation. : .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655739>The functional diversity of the prokaryotic sulfur carrier protein TusA.</a></h2><p>Persulfide groups participate in a wide array of biochemical  and are chemically very versatile. The TusA protein has been identified as a central element supplying and transferring sulfur as persulfide to a number of important biosynthetic , like molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis or thiomodifications in nucleosides of tRNAs. In recent years, it has furthermore become obvious that this protein is indispensable for the oxidation of sulfur compounds in the cytoplasm. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that different TusA protein variants exists in certain organisms, that have evolved to pursue specific roles in cellular . The specific TusA-like proteins thereby cannot replace each other in their specific roles and are rather specific to one sulfur transfer pathway or shared between two . While certain bacteria like Escherichia coli contain several copies of TusA-like proteins, in other bacteria like Allochromatium vinosum a single copy of TusA is present with an essential role for this organism. Here, we give an overview on the multiple roles of the various TusA-like proteins in sulfur transfer  in different organisms to shed light on the remaining mysteries of this versatile protein.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To study FOXC2's influence on melanoma progression, we generated a FOXC2-deficient murine melanoma cell line and evaluated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient datasets.We compared tumor growth kinetics and RNA-seq/qRT-PCR gene expression profiles from wild-type versus FOXC2-deficient murine melanomas. We also performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of TCGA data to assess the influence of FOXC2 gene expression on melanoma patients' response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.FOXC2 promotes melanoma progression and regulates the expression of genes associated with multiple oncogenic , including the oxidative stress response, xenobiotic , and interferon responsiveness. FOXC2 expression in melanoma correlates negatively with patient response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.FOXC2 drives a tumor-promoting gene expression program in melanoma and is a prognostic indicator of patient response to multiple cancer therapies.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Cohorts providing individual-participant data (IPD) were also included. Estimates from published summary data and IPD cohorts were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Multivariate Cox-regression models were used to estimate nonvertebral fracture and mortality risk among individuals with T2D and VFs.Across 15 studies comprising 852,705 men and women, individuals with T2D had lower risk of prevalent (odds ratio [OR] 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.95];   = 0.0%;   = 0.54) but increased risk of incident VFs (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.27-1.44];   = 0.6%;   = 0.43). In the IPD cohorts ( = 19,820), risk of nonvertebral fractures was higher in those with both T2D and VFs compared with those without T2D or VFs (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42 [95% CI 1.86-3.15]), with VFs (HR 1.73 [95% CI 1.32-2.27]), or T2D (HR 1.94 [95% CI 1.46-2.59]) alone. Individuals with both T2D and VFs had increased mortality compared with individuals without T2D and VFs (HR 2.11 [95% CI 1.72-2.59]) or with VFs alone (HR 1.84 [95% CI 1.49-2.28]) and borderline increased compared with individuals with T2D alone (HR 1.23 [95% CI 0.99-1.52]).Based on our findings, individuals with T2D should be systematically assessed for presence of VFs, and, as in individuals without T2D, their presence constitutes an indication to start osteoporosis treatment for the prevention of future fractures.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660580>UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-Mediated Attenuations of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Activity: UGT Isoform-Dependent Mechanism of Suppression.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450 (CYP, P450) 3A4 is involved in the  of 50% of drugs, and its catalytic activity in vivo is not explained only by hepatic expression levels. We previously demonstrated that UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 suppressed CYP3A4 activity through an interaction. In the present study, we target UGT1A9 as another candidate modulator of CYP3A4.We prepared coexpressed enzymes using the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, and compared CYP3A4 activity in the presence and absence of UGT1A9. Wistar rats were treated with dexamethasone and liver microsomes were used to elucidate the role of CYP3A-UGT1A interactions.UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 interacted with and suppressed CYP3A4. Kinetic analyses showed that both of the UGTs significantly reduced Vmax of CYP3A4 activity. In addition, C-terminal truncated mutants of UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 still retained the suppressive capacity. Dexamethasone treatment induced hepatic CYP3As and UGT1As at different magnitudes. Turnover of CYP3A was enhanced about two fold by this treatment.The changes of kinetic parameters suggested that UGT1A9 suppressed CYP3A4 activity with almost the same mechanism as UGT2B7. The luminal domain of UGTs contains the suppressive interaction site(s), whereas the C-terminal domain may contribute to modulating suppression in a UGT isoform-specific manner. CYP3A-UGT1A interaction seemed to be disturbed by dexamethasone treatment, and the suppression was partially canceled. CYP3A4-UGT interactions would help to better understand the causes of inter/intra-individual differences in CYP3A4 activity.This article is protected by copyright.

Identifying egg PVF proteins is a critical step towards understanding their functions including their roles in evolutionary transition in habitats.We applied proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to analyse the PVF proteome of the eggs of Pomacea diffusa, an out-of-water ovipositing freshwater snail in the family Ampullariidae. The PVF proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE method, and proteomic analysis was conducted using LTQ Velos Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer coupled with liquid chromatography. Comparison of PVF proteomes and evolution analyses were performed between P. diffusa and other ampullariids.In total, 32 egg PVF proteins were identified from P. diffusa. They were categorized as PV1-like subunits, immune responsive proteins, protein degradation, signaling and binding, transcription and translation, , oxidation-reduction and unknown function. Interestingly, the proteome includes a calcium binding protein important in forming the hard eggshell that enabled the terrestrial transition. However, it does not include PV2, a neurotoxic protein that was assumed to be present in all Pomacea species.The PVF proteome data from P. diffusa can help us better understand the roles of reproductive proteins played during the transition from underwater to terrestrial egg deposition. Moreover, they could be useful in comparative studies of the terrestrialization in several groups of animals that occurred independently during their evolution.This article is protected by copyright.

EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by lipid analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty acids in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657265> Remodeling in the Pressure-Loaded Right Ventricle: Shifts in Glucose and Fatty Acid -A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>Background Right ventricular (RV) failure because of chronic pressure load is an important determinant of outcome in pulmonary hypertension. Progression towards RV failure is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis and  dysregulation.  modulation has been suggested as therapeutic option, yet,  dysregulation may have various faces in different experimental models and disease severity. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify  changes in the pressure loaded RV and formulate recommendations required to optimize translation between animal models and human disease. Methods and Results Medline and EMBASE were searched to identify original studies describing cardiac  variables in the pressure loaded RV. We identified mostly rat-models, inducing pressure load by hypoxia, Sugen-hypoxia, monocrotaline (MCT), pulmonary artery banding (PAB) or strain (fawn hooded rats, FHR), and human studies. Meta-analysis revealed increased Hedges' g (effect size) of the gene expression of GLUT1 and HK1 and glycolytic flux. The expression of MCAD was uniformly decreased. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and fatty acid uptake varied considerably between studies, yet there was a model effect in carbohydrate respiratory capacity in MCT-rats. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis on  remodeling in the pressure-loaded RV showed a consistent increase in glucose uptake and glycolysis, strongly suggest a downregulation of beta-oxidation, and showed divergent and model-specific changes regarding fatty acid uptake and oxidative . To translate  results from animal models to human disease, more extensive characterization, including function, and uniformity in methodology and studied variables, will be required.</p></html>
