Cardioprotection by adenosine A1 receptor activation limits infarct size and improves post-ischaemic mechanical function. The mechanisms responsible are unclear but may involve alterations in myocardial glucose metabolism. 2. Since glycogen is an important source of glucose during ischaemia, we examined the effects of N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), an A1 receptor agonist, on glycogen and glucose metabolism during ischaemia as well as reperfusion. 3. Isolated working rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing dual-labelled 5-3H and 14C glucose and palmitate as energy substrates. Rates of  and glucose oxidation were measured directly from the production of 3H2O and 14CO2. Glycogen turnover was measured from the rate of change of [5-3H and 14C]glucosyl units in total myocardial glycogen. 4. Following low-flow (0.5 ml min-1) ischaemia (60 min) and reperfusion (30 min), left ventricular minute work (LV work) recovered to 22% of pre-ischaemic values. CHA (0.5 microM) improved the recovery of LV work 2 fold. 5. CHA altered glycogen turnover in post-ischaemic hearts by stimulating glycogen synthesis while having no effects on glycogen degradation. CHA also partially inhibited . These changes accelerated the recovery of glycogen in CHA-treated hearts and reduced proton production. 6. During ischaemia, CHA had no measurable effect on glycogen turnover or glucose metabolism. Glycogen phosphorylase activity, which was elevated after ischaemia, was inhibited by CHA, possibly in response to CHA-induced inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase activity. 7. These results indicate that CHA-induced cardioprotection is associated with alterations of glycogen turnover during reperfusion as well as improved metabolic coupling of  to glucose oxidation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11171647>Flux-balance analysis of mitochondrial energy metabolism: consequences of systemic stoichiometric constraints.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial metabolism is a critical component in the functioning and maintenance of cellular organs. The stoichiometry of biochemical reaction networks imposes constraints on mitochondrial function. A modeling framework, flux-balance analysis (FBA), was used to characterize the optimal flux distributions for maximal ATP production in the mitochondrion. The model predicted the expected ATP yields for glucose, lactate, and palmitate. Genetic defects that affect mitochondrial functions have been implicated in several human diseases. FBA can characterize the metabolic behavior due to genetic deletions at the metabolic level, and the effect of mutations in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle on mitochondrial ATP production was simulated. The mitochondrial ATP production is severely affected by TCA-cycle mutations. In addition, the model predicts the secretion of TCA-cycle intermediates, which is observed in clinical studies of mitochondriopathies such as those associated with fumarase deficiency. The model provides a systemic perspective to characterize the effect of stoichiometric constraints and specific metabolic fluxes on mitochondrial function.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19273755>Fat metabolism during exercise in patients with mitochondrial disease.</a></h2><p>To determine whether patients with defects of the respiratory chain have metabolic adaptations that promote a preferential use of fats or carbohydrates, similar to what is observed in metabolic myopathies affecting  or fat oxidation.Causation and case-control study.

In line with the higher relative workload of the patients, glucose mobilization and total carbohydrate oxidation were higher in the patients compared with the healthy subjects.During moderate-intensity exercise, the balance between fat and carbohydrate use in patients with mtDNA mutations matches that seen in healthy subjects, indicating that manipulating dietary fat and carbohydrate content is not a feasible therapeutic option to improve exercise intolerance in these disorders.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7977816>Epinephrine increases ATP production in hearts by preferentially increasing glucose metabolism.</a></h2><p>Although epinephrine is widely used clinically, its effect on myocardial energy substrate preference in the intact heart has yet to be clearly defined. We determined the effects of epinephrine on glucose and fatty  metabolism in isolated working rat hearts perfused with 11 mM glucose, 0.4 mM palmitate, and 100 muU/ml insulin at an 11.5-mmHg left atrial preload and a 60-mmHg aortic afterload.  and glucose oxidation were measured in hearts perfused with [5-3H]glucose and [U-14C]glucose, whereas fatty  oxidation was measured in hearts perfused with [1-14C]palmitate. Addition of 1 microM epinephrine resulted in a 53% increase in the heart rate-developed pressure product.  increased dramatically following addition of epinephrine (a 272% increase), as did glucose oxidation (a 410% increase). In contrast, fatty  oxidation increased by only 10%. Epinephrine treatment did not increase the amount of oxygen required to produce an equivalent amount of ATP; however, epinephrine did increase the uncoupling between  and glucose oxidation in these fatty -perfused hearts, resulting in a significant increase in H+ production from glucose metabolism. Overall ATP production in epinephrine-treated hearts increased 59%. The contribution of glucose ( and glucose oxidation) to ATP production increased from 13 to 36%, which was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in the contribution of fatty  oxidation to ATP production from 83 to 63%. The increase in glucose oxidation was accompanied by a significant increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity in the active form. We conclude that the increase in ATP required for contractile function following epinephrine treatment occurs through a preferential increase in glucose use.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27442489>Metabolic Profiles Reveal Changes in Wild and Cultivated Soybean Seedling Leaves under Salt Stress.</a></h2><p>Clarification of the metabolic mechanisms underlying salt stress responses in plants will allow further optimization of crop breeding and cultivation to obtain high yields in saline-alkali land. Here, we characterized 68 differential metabolites of cultivated soybean (Glycine max) and wild soybean (Glycine soja) under neutral-salt and alkali-salt stresses using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics, to reveal the physiological and molecular differences in salt tolerance. According to comparisons of growth parameters under the two kinds of salt stresses, the level of inhibition in wild soybean was lower than in cultivated soybean, especially under alkali-salt stress. Moreover, wild soybean contained significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine, asparagine, citraconic , citramalic , citric  and α-ketoglutaric  under neutral-salt stress, and higher amounts of , lignoceric , glucose, citric  and α-ketoglutaric  under alkali-salt stress, than cultivated soybean. Further investigations demonstrated that the ability of wild soybean to salt tolerance was mainly based on the synthesis of organic and amino acids, and the more active tricarboxylic  cycle under neutral-salt stress. In addition, the metabolite profiling analysis suggested that the  generation from β-oxidation, glycolysis and the citric  cycle plays important roles under alkali-salt stress. Our results extend the understanding of mechanisms involved in wild soybean salt tolerance and provide an important reference for increasing yields and developing salt-tolerant soybean cultivars.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3177625>Hemin increases aerobic capacity of cultured regenerating skeletal myotubes.</a></h2><p>Regeneration of damaged, mature muscle occurs by differentiation of satellite cells.

Specific activities of enzymes of critical importance in aerobic metabolism or in production of ATP were increased 2- to 3.5-fold during fusion. Addition of 20 microM hemin to regenerating muscle cultures potentiated the aerobic capacity as evidenced by a 23.6% increase in palmitate oxidation rate. Hemin also increased the specific activities of all nonheme enzymes investigated with the exception of phosphofructokinase. This augmentation of aerobic metabolism together with the time frame of active muscle differentiation suggests a complex role for hemin in myogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093212> CsrA regulates a metabolic switch from amino  to glycerolipid metabolism.</a></h2><p> CsrA plays a crucial role in the life-stage-specific expression of virulence phenotypes and metabolic activity. However, its exact role is only partly known. To elucidate how CsrA impacts  metabolism we analysed the CsrA depended regulation of metabolic functions by comparative C-isotopologue profiling and oxygen consumption experiments of a  wild-type (wt) strain and its isogenic  mutant. We show that a  mutant has significantly lower respiration rates when serine, alanine, pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate or palmitate is the sole carbon source. By contrast, when grown in glucose or glycerol, no differences in respiration were detected. Isotopologue profiling uncovered that the transfer of label from [U-C]serine via pyruvate into the citrate cycle and gluconeogenesis was lower in the mutant as judged from the labelling patterns of protein-derived amino acids, cell-wall-derived diaminopimelate, sugars and amino sugars and 3-hydroxybutyrate derived from polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Similarly, the incorporation of [U-C]glucose via the /Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway but not via the pentose phosphate pathway was repressed in the  mutant. On the other hand, fluxes due to [U-C]glycerol utilization were increased in the  mutant. In addition, we showed that exogenous [1,2,3,4-C] is efficiently used for PHB synthesis via C-acetyl-CoA. Taken together, CsrA induces serine catabolism via the tricarboxylic  cycle and glucose degradation via the ED pathway, but represses glycerol metabolism, fatty  degradation and PHB biosynthesis, in particular during exponential growth. Thus, CsrA has a determining role in substrate usage and carbon partitioning during the  life cycle and regulates a switch from amino  usage in replicative phase to glycerolipid usage during transmissive growth.© 2017 The Authors.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369586>Adiponectin induces insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo at a low glucose concentration.</a></h2><p>A decrease in plasma adiponectin levels has been shown to contribute to the development of diabetes. However, it remains uncertain whether adiponectin plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion. In this study, we investigated whether adiponectin may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro.The effect of adiponectin on insulin secretion was measured in vitro and in vivo, along with the effects of adiponectin on ATP generation, membrane potentials, Ca2+ currents, cytosolic calcium concentration and state of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In addition, insulin granule transport was measured by membrane capacitance and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) analysis.Adiponectin significantly stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islets to approximately 2.3-fold the baseline value in the presence of a glucose concentration of 5.6 mmol/l. Although adiponectin had no effect on ATP generation, membrane potentials, Ca2+ currents, cytosolic calcium concentrations or activation status of AMPK, it caused a significant increase of membrane capacitance to approximately 2.3-fold the baseline value. TIRF analysis revealed that adiponectin induced a significant increase in the number of fusion events in mouse pancreatic beta cells under 5.6 mmol/l glucose loading, without affecting the status of previously docked granules. Moreover, intravenous injection of adiponectin significantly increased insulin secretion to approximately 1.6-fold of baseline in C57BL/6 mice.The above results indicate that adiponectin induces insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028518>Multi-omics analysis points to altered platelet functions in severe food-associated respiratory allergy.</a></h2><p>Prevalence and severity of allergic diseases have increased worldwide. To date, respiratory allergy phenotypes are not fully characterized and, along with inflammation progression, treatment is increasingly complex and expensive. Profilin sensitization constitutes a good model to study the progression of allergic inflammation. Our aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms and the associated biomarkers of this progression, focusing on severe phenotypes, using transcriptomics and metabolomics.Twenty-five subjects were included in the study. Plasma samples were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Individuals were classified in four groups-"nonallergic," "mild," "moderate," and "severe"-based on their clinical history, their response to an oral challenge test with profilin, and after a refinement using a mathematical metabolomic model. PBMCs were used for microarray analysis.We found a set of transcripts and metabolites that were specific for the "severe" phenotype. By metabolomics, a decrease in carbohydrates and pyruvate and an increase in lactate were detected, suggesting aerobic . Other metabolites were incremented in "severe" group: lysophospholipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine-1-phosphate, and lauric, myristic, , and oleic fatty acids. On the other hand, carnitines were decreased along severity. Significant transcripts in the "severe" group were found to be downregulated and were associated with platelet functions, protein synthesis, histone modification, and fatty  metabolism.We have found evidence that points to the association of severe allergic inflammation with platelet functions alteration, together with reduced protein synthesis, and switch of immune cells to aerobic .© 2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Isolated working hearts from 6-wk streptozotocin diabetic and control rats perfused with 11 mM glucose were subjected to 25 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of aerobic reperfusion. Four groups were studied: 1) 1.2 mM palmitate present before, during, and after ischemia; 2) 1.2 mM palmitate present before and during ischemia, followed by reperfusion in the absence of palmitate; 3) no palmitate before and during ischemia, followed by 1.2 mM palmitate during reperfusion; and 4) no palmitate before and during ischemia or during reperfusion. In control hearts, palmitate during reperfusion depressed recovery of function regardless of whether palmitate was present or absent during ischemia. In contrast, palmitate present during reperfusion did not depress recovery of mechanical function in the diabetic rat hearts. However, the presence of palmitate during ischemia itself in diabetic rat hearts was detrimental to recovery of mechanical function. The presence of palmitate during ischemia resulted in an accelerated rate of ATP loss and a decreased rate of lactate accumulation during ischemia, although this effect was similar in control and diabetic rat hearts. Our results demonstrate that high concentrations of fatty acids depress functional recovery of control rat hearts during the reperfusion period but depress recovery of function in diabetic rat hearts when present during ischemia itself.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7016921>Epinephrine plasma thresholds for lipolytic effects in man: measurements of fatty  transport with [l-13C].</a></h2><p>To determine the plasma epinephrine thresholds for its lipolytic effect, 60-min epinephrine infusions at nominal rates of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 micrograms/min were performed in each of four normal young adult men while they also received a simultaneous infusion of [1-13C] to estimate inflow transport of plasma free fatty acids. These 20 infusions resulted in steady-state plasma epinephrine concentrations ranging from 12 to 870 pg/ml.

Because >65% of cardiac AMPK activity is associated with the gamma1-subunit of AMPK, we investigated the effects of expression of an AMPK-activating gamma1-subunit mutant (gamma1 R70Q) on regulatory pathways controlling glycogen accumulation and cardiac hypertrophy in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Whereas expression of gamma1 R70Q displayed the expected increase in palmitate oxidation rates, rates of  were significantly depressed. In addition, glycogen synthase activity was increased in cardiac myocytes expressing gamma1 R70Q, due to both increased expression and decreased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. The inhibition of  and increased glycogen synthase activity were correlated with elevated glycogen levels in gamma1 R70Q-expressing myocytes. In association with the reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta protein and mRNA levels were profoundly decreased in the gamma1 R70Q-expressing myocytes. Consistent with GSK-3beta negatively regulating hypertrophy via inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), the dramatic downregulation of GSK-3beta was associated with increased nuclear activity of NFAT.

Spring black stem and leaf spot caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis Malbr. & Roum causes large losses to alfalfa. However, till now, little is known about alfalfa-P. medicagnis interactions and the pathogenicity mechanisms of the pathogen. Here, alfalfa inoculated with P. medicaginis was subjected to GC-MS based metabolic profiling. The metabolic response in P. medicaginis-inoculated and mock-inoculated alfalfa leaves was assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26 and 28 days post inoculation. In total, 101 peaks were detected in the control and inoculated groups, from which 70 metabolites were tentatively identified. Using multivariate analysis, 16 significantly regulated compounds, including amino acids, nitrogen-containing compounds and organic acids, polyols, fatty acids, and sugars were tentatively identified (Variable importance values, VIP>1.0 and p <0.05). Among these metabolites, the levels of malate, 5-oxoproline,  and stearic  were increased significantly in P. medicaginis-infected alfalfa leaves compared to the controls. In contrast, the levels ofγ-aminobutyric  and 2-pyrrolidinone were significantly decreased in infected leaves compared to the controls. Further metabolic pathway analysis of the 16 significantly regulated compounds demonstrated that , the tricarboxylic  cycle, and β-oxidation of fatty acids were significantly induced in the alfalfa leaves at later stages of P. medicaginis infection. The strong induction of tricarboxylic  cycle pathways at later infection stages caused by the pathogen may induce senescence in the alfalfa leaves, leading to plant death. However, intermediate metabolites of these metabolic pathways, and inositol phosphate, glutathione, the metabolic pathways of some amino acids accumulated rapidly and strongly at early stages of infection, which may enhance the ability of alfalfa to resist necrotrophic P. medicaginis disease.

Ischaemia was induced by a left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis (40% flow reduction) for 90 min, dropping systolic wall thickening by 72%. LCFA oxidation was assessed following LAD infusion of (13)C palmitate, i.e. during control or stenosis, by in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance of the sampled myocardium. Stenosis reduced subendocardial blood flow subendocardially, but not subepicardial, yet induced transmural reductions in LCFA oxidation and increased non-oxidative . During stenosis, preconditioned hearts showed normalized contributions of LCFA to oxidative ATP synthesis, despite increased lactate accumulation. SWOP induced a shift towards LCFA oxidation during stenosis, despite increased malonyl-CoA, and marked protection of contractile function with a significant improvement in systolic wall thickening.Thus, the second window of preconditioning normalized oxidative metabolism of LCFA during subsequent ischaemia despite elevated non-oxidative  and malonyl-CoA and was linked to protection of regional contractile function resulting in improved mechanical performance.

Additionally, in HepG2 cells, 50μM benzbromarone for 24h induced mitochondrial uncoupling,and decreased mitochondrial ATP turnover and maximal respiration. This was accompanied by an increased lactate concentration in the cell culture supernatant, reflecting increased  as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cellular ATP. Investigation of the electron transport chain revealed a decreased activity of all relevant enzyme complexes. Furthermore, treatment with benzbromarone was associated with increased cellular ROS production, which could be located specifically to mitochondria. In HepG2 cells and in isolated mouse liver mitochondria, benzbromarone also reduced  metabolism due to an inhibition of the long-chain acyl CoA synthetase. In HepG2 cells, benzbromarone disrupted the mitochondrial network, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and a decreased mitochondrial volume per cell. Cell death occurred by both apoptosis and necrosis. The study demonstrates that benzbromarone not only affects the function of mitochondria in HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes, but is also associated with profound changes in mitochondrial structure which may be associated with apoptosis.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

GSK-3 inhibition limits cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, but mechanisms are not clearly defined. This study tested the hypothesis that acute GSK-3 inhibition stimulates glycogen synthesis, repartitions glucose away from , reduces proton (H+) production from glucose metabolism, and attenuates intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+(i)) overload.In isolated perfused working rat hearts subjected to global ischaemia and reperfusion, the selective GSK-3 inhibitor, SB-216763 (SB, 3 micromol/L), when added either prior to ischaemia or at the onset of reperfusion, improved recovery of left-ventricular (LV) work. SB increased glycogen synthesis during reperfusion while  and H+ production were reduced. Rates of glucose and palmitate oxidation were improved by SB. Measurement of Ca2+(i) concentration by rapid acquisition indo-1 fluorescence imaging showed that SB, when added either prior to ischaemia or at the onset of reperfusion, reduced diastolic Ca2+(i) overload during reperfusion. In aerobic hearts depleted of glycogen by substrate-free perfusion to a level similar to that measured at the onset of reperfusion, SB accelerated glycogen synthesis and reduced  and H+ production independent of changes in LV work.Our study indicates that reduction in H+ production by GSK-3 inhibition is an early and upstream event that lessens Ca2+(i) overload during ischaemia and early reperfusion independent of LV work which enhances the recovery of post-ischaemic LV function and that may ultimately contribute to previously observed reductions in cell death and infarction.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25290061>Roles and regulation of ketogenesis in cultured astroglia and neurons under hypoxia and hypoglycemia.</a></h2><p>Exogenous ketone bodies (KBs), acetoacetate (AA), and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) act as alternative energy substrates in neural cells under starvation. The present study examined the endogenous ketogenic capacity of astroglia under hypoxia with/without glucose and the possible roles of KBs in neuronal energy metabolism. Cultured neurons and astroglia were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats.  (PAL) and l-carnitine (LC) were added to the assay medium. The 4- to 24-hr production of AA and BHB was measured using the cyclic thio-NADH method. (14)C-labeled -soluble products (KBs) and (14)CO2 produced from [1-(14)C]PAL were also measured. l-[U-(14)C]lactic  ([(14)C]LAC), [1-(14)C]pyruvic  ([(14)C]PYR), or β-[1-(14)C]hydroxybutyric  ([(14)C]BHB) was used to compare the oxidative metabolism of the  end products with that of the KBs. Some cells were placed in a hypoxic chamber (1% O2). PAL and LC induced a higher production of KBs in astroglia than in neurons, while the CO2 production from PAL was less than 5% of the KB production in both astroglia and neurons. KB production in astroglia was augmented by the AMP-activated protein kinase activators, AICAR and metformin, as well as hypoxia with/without glucose. Neuronal KB production increased under hypoxia in the absence of PAL and LC. In neurons, [(14)C]LAC and [(14)C]PYR oxidation decreased after 24 hr of hypoxia, while [(14)C]BHB oxidation was preserved. Astroglia responds to ischemia in vitro by enhancing KB production, and astroglia-produced KBs derived from fatty  might serve as a neuronal energy substrate for the tricarboxylic  cycle instead of lactate, as pyruvate dehydrogenase is susceptible to ischemia.© The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8102045>Effects of proglycosyn (LY177507) on fatty  metabolism in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Proglycosyn (LY177507) belongs to a series of powerful agents that stabilize liver glycogen stores by promoting glycogen synthesis from different precursors and inhibiting glycogenolysis and . In the present study we have examined the effects of proglycosyn on fatty  metabolism in isolated hepatocytes. Preincubation of hepatocytes with medium containing proglycosyn led to a marked inhibition of fatty  synthesis de novo and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity without affecting fatty  synthase. Likewise, proglycosyn depressed the synthesis of triacylglycerols and phospholipids from labeled palmitate. Although octanoate oxidation was unaffected by proglycosyn, mitochondrial palmitate oxidation was notably stimulated. This effect may be attributed to the proglycosyn-induced decrease of intracellular malonyl-CoA levels relative to control incubations and the concomitant relieve of the inhibition of the mitochondrial-outer-membrane carnitine palmitoyl-transferase by malonyl-CoA. By contrast, neither peroxisomal palmitate oxidation nor peroxisomal carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity was changed upon hepatocyte incubation with proglycosyn. Results thus indicate that proglycosyn increases the fatty--oxidation efficiency of the liver at the expense of lipogenesis, and this may contribute to the proglycosyn-induced sparing of liver glycogen stores.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15284219>Central role for aldose reductase pathway in myocardial ischemic injury.</a></h2><p>Aldose reductase (AR), a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, has been implicated in the development of vascular and neurological complications of diabetes. Recently, we demonstrated that aldose reductase is a component of myocardial ischemic injury and that inhibitors of this enzyme protect rat hearts from ischemia-reperfusion injury. To rigorously test the effect of aldose reductase on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, we used transgenic mice broadly overexpressing human aldose reductase (ARTg) driven by the major histocompatibility complex I promoter. Hearts from these ARTg or littermate mice (WT) (n=6 in each group) were isolated, perfused under normoxic conditions, then subjected to 50 min of severe low flow ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Creatine kinase (CK) release (a marker of ischemic injury) was measured during reperfusion; left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), end diastolic pressure (EDP), and ATP were measured throughout the protocol. CK release was significantly greater in ARTg mice compared with the WT mice. LVDP recovery was significantly reduced in ARTg mice compared with the WT mice. Furthermore, ATP content was higher in WT mice compared with ARTg mice during ischemia and reperfusion. Infarct size measured by staining techniques and myocardial damage evaluated histologically were also significantly worse in ARTg mice hearts than in controls. Pharmacological inhibition of aldose reductase significantly reduced ischemic injury and improved functional recovery in ARTg mice. These data strongly support key roles for AR in ischemic injury and impairment of functional and metabolic recovery after ischemia. We propose that interventions targeting AR may provide a novel adjunctive approach to protect ischemic myocardium.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528561>Palmitoleic  (n-7) increases white adipocytes GLUT4 content and glucose uptake in association with AMPK activation.</a></h2><p>Palmitoleic  was previously shown to improve glucose homeostasis by reducing hepatic glucose production and by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Herein we tested the hypothesis that palmitoleic  positively modulates glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes.For this, both differentiated 3 T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic  (16:1n7, 200 μM) or  (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg/kg/day) or oleic  (18:1n9, 300 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for glucose uptake, oxidation, conversion to lactate and incorporation into fatty acids and glycerol components of TAG along with the activity and expression of lipogenic enzymes.Treatment of adipocytes with palmitoleic, but not oleic (in vivo) or  (in vitro) acids, increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 mRNA levels and protein content. Along with uptake, palmitoleic  enhanced glucose oxidation (aerobic ), conversion to lactate (anaerobic ) and incorporation into glycerol-TAG, but reduced de novo fatty  synthesis from glucose and acetate and the activity of lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase. Importantly, palmitoleic  induction of adipocyte glucose uptake and metabolism were associated with AMPK activation as evidenced by the increased protein content of phospho(p)Thr172AMPKα, but no changes in pSer473Akt and pThr308Akt. Importantly, such increase in GLUT4 content induced by 16:1n7, was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with compound C.In conclusion, palmitoleic  increases glucose uptake and the GLUT4 content in association with AMPK activation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14323945>THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GLUCOSE AND  OXIDATION IN VITRO BY ASCITES HEPATOMA, AH 130.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20154256>High levels of fatty acids increase contractile function of neonatal rabbit hearts during reperfusion following ischemia.</a></h2><p>In the neonatal heart the transition from using carbohydrates to using fatty acids has not fully matured and oxidative metabolism/ATP generation may be limiting contractile function after ischemia.

Hearts were perfused at a 7.5 mm Hg left atrial preload, a 4.5 mm Hg superior vena cava preload, a 30 mm Hg aortic afterload, and a 4.5 mm Hg pulmonary artery afterload.

Glucose and palmitate generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipocytes, leading to monocyte chemotactic factor gene expression. Docosahexaenoate (DHA) has the opposite effect. In this study, we evaluated the potential sources of ROS in the presence of excess nutrients. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to palmitate and DHA (250 μM) in either 5 or 25 mM glucose to evaluate the relative roles of mitochondrial electron transport and NADPH oxidases (NOX) as sources of ROS. Excess glucose and palmitate did not increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, glucose exposure increased . Of the NOX family members, only NOX4 was expressed in adipocytes. Moreover, its activity was increased by excess glucose and palmitate and decreased by DHA. Silencing NOX4 inhibited palmitate- and glucose-stimulated ROS generation and monocyte chemotactic factor gene expression. NADPH, a substrate for NOX, and pentose phosphate pathway activity increased with glucose but not palmitate and decreased with DHA exposure. Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors and siRNA suppressed ROS generation and monocyte chemotactic factor gene expression induced by both glucose and palmitate. Finally, both high glucose and palmitate induced NOX4 translocation into lipid rafts, effects that were blocked by DHA. Excess glucose and palmitate generate ROS via NOX4 rather than by mitochondrial oxidation in cultured adipocytes. NOX4 is regulated by both NADPH generated in the PPP and translocation of NOX4 into lipid rafts, leading to expression of monocyte chemotactic factors.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347229>Lupin seed hydrolysate promotes G-protein-coupled receptor, intracellular Ca and enhanced glycolytic metabolism-mediated insulin secretion from BRIN-BD11 pancreatic beta cells.</a></h2><p>Lupin seed proteins have been reported to exhibit hypoglycaemic effects in animals and humans following oral administration, however little is known about its mechanism of action. This study investigated the signalling pathway(s) responsible for the insulinotropic effect of the hydrolysate obtained from lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) seed extracts utilizing BRIN-BD11 β-cells.

Those compounds, however, which uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation (2,4-dinitrophenol, amiodarone, ibuprofen) and/or inhibited the mitochondrial respiratory chain (amiodarone, rotenone, KCN) resulted in comparatively higher ATP depletion.

Compartmentation of metabolites in a pseudo-stationary state was calculated, and its implications are discussed, e.g., citrate level may not regulate  because it is mostly mitochondrial.

The response of aconitase to the mitochondrial Mg2+ level is of major importance in setting both the mitochondrial citrate and isocitrate levels. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is about 96% in the inactive phosphorylated form, and the active form is also 15% inhibited by products, severely limiting pyruvate oxidation and causing preferential utilization of palmitate as the metabolic fuel. The simulation is consistent with a creatine phosphate shuttle which delivers high energy phosphate to the site of its utilization for mechanical work.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9278241>Measurements of fatty  and carbohydrate metabolism in the isolated working rat heart.</a></h2><p>The isolated working rat heart is a useful experimental model which allows contractile function to be measured in hearts perfused at physiologically relevant workloads. To maintain these high workloads the heart is required to generate a tremendous amount of energy. In vivo this energy is derived primarily from the oxidation of fatty acids. In many experimental situations it is desirable to perfuse the isolated working heart in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of fatty acids. This is particularly important when studying energy metabolism in the heart, or in determining how fatty acids alter the outcome of myocardial ischemic injury [1, 2]. The other major source of energy for the heart is derived from the oxidation of carbohydrates (glucose and lactate), with a smaller amount of ATP also being derived from . Two byproducts of both fatty  and carbohydrate metabolism are H2O and CO2. By labeling the glucose, lactate, or fatty acids in the perfusate with 3H or 14C the experimenter can quantitatively collect either 3H2O or 14CO2 produced by the heart. By using radioisotopes that are labeled at specific hydrogen or carbon molecules on the various energy substrates, and by knowing the specific activity of the radiolabeled substrate used, it is possible to determine the actual rate of flux through these individual pathways. This paper will describe the experimental protocols for directly measuring fatty  and carbohydrate metabolism in isolated working rat hearts.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3493962>[Planar scintigraphy versus PET in measuring fatty  metabolism of the heart].</a></h2><p>In addition to radionuclide ventriculography and thallium scintigraphy, already well established in nuclear medicine, assessment of myocardial metabolism is also of interest for diagnosis and follow-up observations in heart disease. Under aerobic conditions and in the fasting state, the heart muscle primarily oxidizes fatty acids; during ischemia, in contrast, there is slowing of fatty  turnover and increased anaerobic . With 11C-, in humans, reduced fatty  uptake has been documented in infarcted myocardial regions. The analysis of 11C- in dogs showed a three-phased elimination curve in normal myocardium. In ischemic myocardium, there was diminished utilization of free fatty acids and the glucose utilization was concomitantly increased. After insulin-glucose infusion, as well, there was increased glucose utilization and a reduction in fatty  utilization. Studies with 11C- require the equipment for positron emission tomography (PET); because of the short half-life of 20.3 minutes, the nuclide must be generated by a cyclotron in the immediate vicinity. In the search for well-suited isotopes for use in planar scintigraphy employing a gamma camera, the uptake and elimination of a variety of isotopically-marked fatty acids were measured and compared with the characteristics of 14C-. For 17-123I-heptadecanic  (IHA) the elimination curve was similar to that of 14C-palmitate: disadvantage, however, was the relatively high percentage of water soluble marked catabolites which required dual parameter analysis by means of 99-m-technetium pertechnetate or 123I sodium iodide to quantify the amount of myocardial fatty  utilization through subtraction of the externally measured water soluble catabolite from the externally measured total activity. In studies with the gamma camera in fasting patients in whom 2 to 3 mCi IHA was injected intravenously after symptom limited bicycle ergometry, in healthy subjects the elimination halftime for the first rapid phase was 24.4 +/- 4.7 minutes. Patients with angiographically-documented coronary artery disease, in the afflicted myocardial segments, had diminished fatty  uptake and prolonged elimination halftime as compared with normally perfused segments. In patients with dilated cardiomyopathy there was an inhomogeneous distribution of activity in the myocardium and, in contrast to coronary artery disease, a discordance between local fatty  uptake and turnover rate. After chronic and acute alcohol consumption there were comparable findings which were shown to be reversible after several weeks of abstinence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3028425>Sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) inhibition of glucose catabolism via the glycolytic pathway, and fatty  beta-oxidation in Leishmania mexicana amastigotes.</a></h2><p>The biochemical mechanism of action of antimony (Sb) in pentavalent form complexed to gluconic  (sodium stibogluconate)--the drug of choice for the leishmaniases--has been only slightly investigated. We recently reported that, in stibogluconate-exposed Leishmania mexicana amastigotes, there is a dose-dependent decrease in the ATP/ADP ratio [Berman et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 27, 916 (1985)]. To investigate mechanisms by which ADP phosphorylation to ATP might be inhibited, stibogluconate-exposed amastigotes were incubated with [14C]glucose, fatty , or acetate, and 14CO2 production was determined. In organisms exposed to 500 micrograms Sb/ml, formation of 14CO2 from [6-14C]glucose and [1-14C]palmitate was inhibited 69 and 67% respectively. In comparison, formation of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glucose and [2-14C]acetate was inhibited less than 15%. These results suggest that glucose catabolism via glycolytic enzymes and fatty  beta-oxidation, but not glucose metabolism via the hexosemonophosphate shunt or the citric  cycle, is specifically inhibited in stibogluconate-exposed Leishmania mexicana amastigotes.

In the heart, extracellular ATP modulates ionic processes and contractile function. This study describes a novel, metabolic effect of exogenous ATP in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. In these quiescent (i.e. noncontracting) cells, micromolar concentrations of ATP depressed the rate of basal, catecholamine-stimulated, or insulin-stimulated glucose transport by up to 60% (IC50 for inhibition of insulin-dependent glucose transport, 4 microM). ATP decreased the amount of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT4) in the plasma membrane, with a concomitant increase in intracellular microsomal membranes. A similar glucose transport inhibition was produced by P2 purinergic agonists with the following rank of potencies: ATP approximately ATPgammaS approximately 2-methylthio-ATP (P2Y-selective) > ADP > alpha,betameATP (P2X-selective), whereas the P1 purinoceptor agonist adenosine was ineffective. The effect of ATP was suppressed by the poorly subtype-selective P2 antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2', 4'-disulfonic  but, surprisingly, not by the nonselective antagonist suramin nor by the P2Y-specific Reactive Blue 2. Glucose transport inhibition by ATP was not affected by a drastic reduction of the extracellular concentrations of calcium (down to 10(-9) M) or sodium (down to 0 mM), and it was not mimicked by a potassium-induced depolarization, indicating that purinoceptors of the P2X family (which are nonselective cation channels whose activation leads to a depolarizing sodium and calcium influx) are not involved. Inhibition was specific for the transmembrane transport of glucose because ATP did not inhibit (i) the rate of  under conditions where the transport step is no longer rate-limiting nor (ii) the rate of [1-14C]pyruvate decarboxylation. In conclusion, extracellular ATP markedly inhibits glucose transport in rat cardiomyocytes by promoting a redistribution of glucose transporters from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment. This effect of ATP is mediated by P2 purinoceptors, possibly by a yet unknown subtype of the P2Y purinoceptor family.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332441>Dominant uptake of fatty  over glucose by prostate cells: a potential new diagnostic and therapeutic approach.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer is characterized by a low rate of  and glucose uptake.

The uptake of fatty  by prostate cells is a dynamic, active process mediated by the membrane receptors.Prostate cells are characterized by a dominant uptake of fatty  over glucose, suggesting that future development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in prostatic cancer should focus on fatty  substrate.

Fractionation of the neutral lipids showed greatest incorporation of radiolabel into the triglyceride fraction. Uptake of fatty  in normoxic cultures may be dependent upon the supply of glycerol 3-phosphate from , as 2-deoxyglucose and L-lactate, respectively, inhibited and stimulated incorporation of fatty  into neutral lipid fractions. When previously anoxic cultures were reoxygenated, oxidation of fatty  was depressed and the mitochondrial function of anoxic cultures appeared to be more readily uncoupled by 2,4-dinitrophenol, in comparison with cultures maintained under normoxic conditions. Similar behaviour was seen when oxidation of endogenous lipid or oxidation of glucose was examined. Previously anoxic cultures show a preference for oxidation of endogenous rather than exogenous lipid substrates.

Broilers were placed on a high-nutrient diet for 41 days, and half were given orally DEX-supplemented water at 20 mg/L every other day from 19 to 41 days of age. DEX treatment downregulated superoxide dismutase activity as well as the mRNA expression of CuZn-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase with a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio and an increase in malondialdehyde level in the liver of broilers. DEX treatment aggravated oxidative damage in the liver and, therefore, increased the sensitivity of broilers to ascites syndrome with higher mortality and reduced growth performance. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that DEX treatment significantly increased the levels of glucose, intermediates in protein metabolism (valine, proline, serine, threonine and urea) and lipid metabolism-related products (, stearic  and cholesterol) while decreasing the levels of β-hydroxy butyric , succinic  and malic , demonstrating that DEX treatment inhibited the Krebs cycle and the oxidation of fatty acids, and promoted the de novo synthesis of fatty acids as well as protein decomposition in the liver of broilers. Additionally, detection of metabolism-related enzymes revealed that DEX treatment inhibited  and promoted glycogen decomposition. In summary, DEX treatment resulted in oxidative stress and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in the broilers.© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22116097>Fatty -induced nuclear translocation of heparanase uncouples glucose metabolism in endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that specifically cleaves carbohydrate chains of heparan sulfate.

Chronic exposure to either of the circulating fatty  oleate or palmitate has different effects on the beta-cell. Whereas palmitate causes functional impairment of the beta-cell and apoptosis, oleate has only minor negative effects on beta-cell function and mass. The aim of the present study was to delineate mechanisms by which the fatty acids affect the beta-cell differently. In particular, the aim was to identify beta-cell proteins exclusively regulated by palmitate. INS-1E cells were cultured for 24h in medium supplemented with palmitate or oleate. After culture, cells were lysed and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins specifically regulated by palmitate were excised from the gel and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS. Proteins exclusively regulated by palmitate were classified into proteins of carbohydrate or protein metabolism and Ca(2+) or mRNA binding proteins. The specific palmitate-induced down-regulation of enzymes of , proteins of protein turnover and anti-apoptotic protein may contribute to explain the different effects exerted by palmitate and oleate on beta-cell function and mass.Copyright  2010 Elsevier B.V.

This article is largely concerned with the latter type of regulation of the complex in adipose tissue by insulin (and other hormones) and in heart muscle by lipid fuels. Effectors of the two interconverting enzymes include pyruvate and ADP which inhibit the kinase, acetoin which activates the kinase and Ca2+ and Mg2+ which both activate the phosphatase and inhibit the kinase. Evidence is presented that all components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex including the phosphatase and kinase are located within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Direct measurements of the matrix concentration of substrates and effectors is not possible by techniques presently available. This is the key problem in the identification of the mechansims involved in the alterations in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed in adipose tissue and muscle. A number of indirect approaches have been used and these are reviewed. Most hopeful is the recent finding in this laboratory that in both adipose tissue and heart muscle, differences in activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the intact tissue persist during preparation and subsequent incubation of mitochondria.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7272339>Comparison of the oxidation of glutamine, glucose, ketone bodies and fatty acids by human diploid fibroblasts.</a></h2><p>The contribution of glutamine, glucose, ketone bodies and fatty acids to the oxidative energy metabolism of human diploid fibroblasts ws studied.

Hearts were preperfused for 15 min in the presence of (5-3H)-glucose and (U-14C)-. Half of the hearts were then perfused with 0.08 mM nicotinic  for an additional 15-min period, while the remaining control hearts received unmodified perfusion. Arrest was then induced in all animals for 2 h using hypothermic K+ cardioplegia, followed by 60 min of normothermic reperfusion. In control hearts, there were significantly greater levels of long-chain acyl Co-A and acyl carnitine and lower levels of membrane phospholipids than in the nicotinic  group. While nicotinic  inhibited beta-oxidation during pre-ischemia and reperfusion, it also prevented the degradation of membrane phospholipids. The net result was a reduction of free fatty  accumulation during arrest and reperfusion in the nicotinic  group. , as reflected in 3H2O production, was significantly increased by nicotinic  administration. In the control heart as compared to the nicotinic  group, the incorporation of 14C-label from palmitate into triglyceride and cholesterol during arrest was enhanced, while incorporation into phospholipids was depressed. The cardioprotective effects of nicotinic  were demonstrated by decreased release of creatine kinase and improved coronary blood flow, and cardiac contractility in the reperfused myocardium supplemented with nicotinic  compared to the control group. These results suggest that nicotinic  significantly protects the arrested-reperfused myocardium by a) preventing elevation of myocardial fatty  levels, b) stimulating  by limiting fatty  oxidation, c) inhibiting degradation of membrane phospholipids, and d) preventing accumulation of fatty  metabolites with harmful detergent properties.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16054589>The influence of a novel propolis on mutans streptococci biofilms and caries development in rats.</a></h2><p>A flavonoids-free Brazilian propolis (type 6) showed biological effects against mutans streptococci and inhibited the activity of glucosyltransferases.

The chemical composition of the propolis extracts were examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The effects of EEP and EEH on Streptococcus mutans UA159 and Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 biofilms were analysed by time-kill and glycolytic pH drop assays. Their influence on proton-translocating F-ATPase activity was also tested. In the animal study, the rats were infected with S. sobrinus 6715 and fed with cariogenic diet 2000. The rats were treated topically twice a day with each of the extracts (or control) for 5 weeks. After the experimental period, the microbial composition of their dental plaque and their caries scores were determined. The results showed that fatty acids (oleic, , linoleic and stearic) were the main compounds identified in EEP and EEH. These extracts did not show major effects on the viability of mutans streptococci biofilms. However, EEP and EEH significantly reduced  production by the biofilms and also inhibited the activity of F-ATPase (60-65%). Furthermore, both extracts significantly reduced the incidence of smooth surface caries in vivo without displaying a reduction of the percentage of S. sobriuns in the animals' plaque (P < 0.05). However, only EEH was able to reduce the incidence and severity of sulcal surface caries (P < 0.05).

In the fed state, hSTC-1 decreases the incorporation of C from glucose into lipids in the rat BAT. The data support the hypothesis that the capacity of the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P)-generating pathway (glycolysis) from glucose is regulated by hSTC-1, decreasing the adequate supply of G3P needed for fatty  esterification and triacylglycerol (TG) storage in BAT. The results also suggest the effect of hSTC-1 on de novo fatty  synthesis from pyruvate generated by C-glucose in the glycolysis pathway. In addition, by decreasing lipogenesis, hSTC-1 increased ATP levels and these two factors may decrease BAT thermogenic function. The presence of hSTC-1 in the incubation medium did not alter C-glucose and C-1- oxidation. The uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) expression was not altered by hSTC-1 either. In conclusion, hSTC-1 is one of the hormonal factors that control glucose metabolism in BAT in the fed state. The decrease of TG capacity synthesis from C-glucose by hSTC-1 compromises the BAT thermogenic capacity. Furthermore, the increase in ATP levels would inhibit a futile cycle via UCP-1, which dissipates oxidative  as heat.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

A severe cardiac hypertrophy was induced in 2-mo-old rats by surgical opening of an aortocaval communication. Three months later, during in vitro perfusions with 1.2 mM palmitate, 11 mM glucose, and 10 IU/l insulin, the mechanical performance and overall energy turnover (myocardial O2 consumption) of hypertrophied rat hearts were significantly decreased under conditions of moderate and high workloads. These changes in cardiac energetics paralleled the decrease in total tissue carnitine content and alterations in exogenous palmitate oxidation. The oxidative utilization of glucose was also slightly depressed in volume-overloaded hearts while steady-state  rates increased, especially in hearts subjected to high mechanical loads. This slowing of metabolic pathways involved in acetyl-CoA generation resulted in decreased NADH availability and in an apparent substrate limitation of oxidative phosphorylation suggested by a failure of cytosolic unbound ADP to drive respiration. Long-term administration of propionyl-L-carnitine normalized the degree of reduction of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides and improved the kinetics of mitochondrial ATP production in volume-overloaded hearts. The resulting acceleration of energy turnover was essentially related to improved oxidative utilization of glucose, but steady-state palmitate oxidation rates also increased in severely hypertrophied hearts. This concomitant acceleration of glucose and palmitate oxidation may be related to the particular experimental conditions (high exogenous palmitate concentrations, elevated workloads) used in this study. We assume that the increase in intracellular carnitine, together with a stimulation of acetyl-CoA demands related to high workloads, creates conditions that are compatible with the simultaneous relief of pyruvate dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I. The resulting increase in the rate of steady-state ATP production improves, in turn, the mechanical activity of volume-overloaded hearts.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2970867>Liver composition and lipid metabolism in NZB/W F1 female mice fed dehydroisoandrosterone.</a></h2><p>The beneficial effects obtained with dehydroisoandrosterone (DHA) feeding in the treatment of murine systemic lupus erythematosus are similar to those obtained with caloric restriction or with dietary manipulation of essential fatty  availability.

Significant changes in the activities of malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, similar to those changes which occur with fasting, were observed during the initial adaptation to the DHA diet.

Previously, we have reported that, in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by the cell-permeable activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboximide riboside (AICAR) is associated with an increase in the oxidation of (3)H-palmitate. In the present study, experiments carried out with cultured HUVECs revealed the following: (1) AICAR-induced increases in palmitate oxidation during a 2-hour incubation are associated with a decrease in the concentration of malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) (an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1), which temporally parallels the increase in AMPK activity and a decrease in the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). (2) AICAR does not stimulate either palmitate oxidation when carnitine is omitted from the medium or oxidation of the medium-chain fatty  octanoate. (3) When intracellular lipid pools are prelabeled with (3)H-palmitate, the measured rate of palmitate oxidation is 3-fold higher, and in the presence of AICAR, it accounts for nearly 40% of calculated ATP generation. (4) Incubation of HUVECs in a glucose-free medium for 2 hours causes the same changes in AMPK, ACC, malonyl CoA, and palmitate oxidation as does AICAR. (5) Under all conditions studied, the contribution of glucose oxidation to ATP production is minimal. The results indicate that the AMPK-ACC-malonyl CoA-carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 mechanism plays a key role in the physiological regulation of fatty  oxidation in HUVECs. They also indicate that HUVECs oxidize fatty acids from both intracellular and extracellular sources, and that when this is taken into account, fatty acids can be a major substrate for ATP generation. Finally, they suggest that AMPK is likely to be a major factor in modulating the response of the endothelium to stresses that alter its energy state.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10391132>Effect of palmitate on carbohydrate utilization and Na/K-ATPase activity in aortic vascular smooth muscle from diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Several investigators have reported that carbohydrate metabolism is suppressed in blood vessels from diabetic (Db) rats. However, it is not known if metabolites from the reciprocal increase in oxidation of long-chain fatty acids that accompanies insulin-deficiency exacerbates the suppression of this pathway in the Db blood vessels. Such inhibition may have particularly deleterious consequences in vascular smooth muscle since aerobic  is believed to preferentially fuel the sarcolemmal Na/K ATPase in this tissue. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of physiological (0.4 mM) and elevated (1.2 mM) concentrations of the long-chain fatty  palmitate on both carbohydrate utilization and Na/K-ATPase activity in aorta from insulin-deficient Db rat. Thoracic aorta were removed from 10 week Db (streptozotocin 60 mg/Kg , i.v.) or control (C) rats and intima-media aortic preparations were incubated in the absence or presence of palmitate.  (microM/g dry wt/h) and glucose oxidation (microM/g dry wt/h) were quantified using 3H-glucose and 14C-glucose, respectively. Na/K-ATPase activity was estimated by the measurement of 86rubidium uptake in the absence and presence of 2 mM ouabain. In the absence of exogenous palmitate,  (p < 0.05), glucose oxidation (p < 0.01) and the estimated ATP production from exogenous glucose were decreased in aorta from Db rat. However, despite this diminished rate of , Na/K ATPase activity was similar in Db and C aorta. Palmitate (0.4 mM) inhibited Na/K ATPase activity and glucose oxidation to a similar extent in both Db and C but had no effect on  in either group. Elevation of palmitate to 1.2 mM had no additional inhibitory effect on glucose oxidation, Na/K ATPase activity or  in either the Db or C aorta. The metabolism of exogenous palmitate restored the ATP production in Db to control values. These data demonstrate that, despite the diminished  and glucose oxidation demonstrated in the Db tissue, Na/K ATPase activity was comparable in the C and Db aorta, in the absence or presence of exogenous long-chain fatty . Therefore, the accelerated oxidation of palmitate in diabetic vascular smooth muscle had no additional inhibitory effect on  or Na/K ATPase activity.

Palmitate-induced cell death, assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, was enhanced by carnitine, a cofactor needed for palmitate transport into mitochondria via CPT-1. Carnitine co-incubation with palmitate significantly (P < 0.01) increased the amount of apoptotic cells, assessed by propidium iodine staining and fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis compared with treatment with either palmitate or carnitine alone. The CPT-1 inhibitor oxfenicine significantly (P < 0.05) blocked the cell death induced by the combination of palmitate and carnitine. The short-chain saturated fatty  capric  (100 microM), which is not likely transported by CPT-1, did not significantly affect cell viability, whereas the C18 saturated fatty  stearic (100 microM) significantly (P < 0.01) reduced cell viability and to a similar extent as palmitate.

Previously, we found that a 5/6th nephrectomy model of CKD leads to an upregulation of miR-21-5p in the left ventricle, targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and altering the expression of numerous transcripts involved with fatty  oxidation and . In the present study, we evaluated the potential for knockdown or overexpression of miR-21-5p to regulate lipid content, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial respiration in H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-21-5p (40 nM), pre-miR-21-5p (20 nM), or the appropriate scrambled oligonucleotide controls before lipid treatment in culture or as part of the Agilent Seahorse XF fatty  oxidation assay. Overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuated the lipid-induced increase in cellular lipid content, whereas suppression of miR-21-5p augmented it. The abundance of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased with lipid treatment in control cells but attenuated in pre-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. This suggests that miR-21-5p reduces oxidative stress. The cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was increased in both pre-miR-21-5p- and anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. Levels of intracellular ATP were significantly higher in anti-mR-21-5p-transfected cells. Pre-miR-21-5p blocked additional increases in OCR in response to etomoxir and . Conversely, anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells exhibited reduced OCR with both etomoxir and , and the glycolytic capacity was concomitantly reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuates both lipid content and lipid peroxidation in H9C2 cells. This likely occurs by reducing cellular lipid uptake and utilization, shifting cellular metabolism toward reliance on the glycolytic pathway. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Both overexpression and suppression of miR-21-5p augment basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration. Our data suggest that reliance on glycolytic and fatty  oxidation pathways can be modulated by the abundance of miR-21-5p within the cell. miR-21-5p regulation of mitochondrial respiration can be modulated by extracellular lipids.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4374637>Isolation of intestinal mucosa cells.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9799567>Effects of endoglycoceramidase or D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol on glucose uptake, , and mitochondrial respiration in HL60 cells.</a></h2><p>The glycosphingolipid content of HL60 cells was reduced by endoglycoceramidase, an enzyme which specifically hydrolyzes glycosphingolipids on the cell surface, or by D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor which specifically reduces the activity of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase.

On the other hand, both reagents decreased the level of ATP and CO2 production. The molecule mediating these effects appeared to be ceramide, since both treatments actually increased the intracellular ceramide content, and the cell-permeable short-chain ceramide N-acetylsphingosine, but not sphingosine, sphinganine, or , mimicked the effects of both reagents to comparable extents. Finally, the function of electron transport in isolated mitochondria fractions was found to be reduced by treatment of the cells with N-acetylsphingosine.

Overall fatty  oxidation rates were determined by addition of 1.2 mM [3H]palmitate to the perfusate of hearts in which the endogenous triglyceride pool was prelabeled with [14C]palmitate. Rates of both exogenous and endogenous fatty  oxidation were measured by simultaneous measurement of 3H2O and 14CO2 production, respectively. A second series of hearts were perfused under similar conditions except that [U-14C]glucose was present in the perfusate for measurement of glucose oxidation rates. Addition of dichloroacetate (DCA, 1 mM) to the perfusate resulted in a dramatic stimulation of glucose oxidation (a 411% increase), with a parallel decrease in fatty  oxidation (from 305 +/- 51 to 206 +/- 40 nmol/g dry weight.min.unit work). DCA treatment increased the contribution of glucose oxidation to ATP production from 7.1 to 30.6%, while decreasing the contribution of overall fatty  oxidation from 92.9 to 69.4%. Tissue levels of malonyl-CoA in hearts treated with DCA were higher compared to controls (14.0 +/- 0.6 and 10.0 +/- 0.7 nmol/g dry weight, respectively) and were negatively correlated (r = -0.85) with overall fatty  oxidation rates. Acetyl-CoA levels were also significantly higher in DCA-treated hearts, and a positive correlation (r = 0.88) was seen between myocardial acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA levels. This suggests that DCA treatment increased the supply of acetyl-CoA for ACC. Western blots revealed the presence of both the 280-kDa (ACC-280) and the 265-kDa (ACC-265) isoforms of ACC in cardiac tissue, with a predominance of ACC-280. The activity of ACC extracted from hearts was similar in both groups when assayed under optimal conditions of acetyl-CoA and citrate. However, using affinity purified ACC, it was demonstrated that heart ACC (predominantly ACC-280) had a higher Km for acetyl-CoA than ACC isolated from white adipose tissue (predominantly ACC-265). We conclude that ACC is an important regulator of fatty  oxidation in the heart and that acetyl-CoA supply is a key determinant of heart ACC-280 activity. As acetyl-CoA levels increase, ACC-280 is activated resulting in an increase in malonyl-CoA inhibition of fatty  oxidation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6680274>Computer simulation of metabolism in palmitate-perfused rat heart.

Consequently, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that hearts release lactate from  while simultaneously taking up exogenous lactate. Therefore, we determined the effects of fatty acids and diabetes on the regulation of lactate uptake and release. Hearts from control and 1-wk diabetic animals were perfused with 5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM [3-(13)C]lactate, and 0, 0.1, 0.32, or 1.0 mM palmitate. Parameters measured include perfusate lactate concentrations, fractional enrichment, and coronary flow rates, which enabled the simultaneous, but independent, measurements of the rates of 1) uptake of exogenous [(13)C]lactate and 2) efflux of unlabeled lactate from metabolism of glucose. Although the rates of lactate uptake and efflux were both similarly inhibited by the addition of palmitate, (i.e., the ratio of lactate uptake to efflux remained constant), the ratio of lactate uptake to efflux was significantly higher in the controls compared with the diabetic group (1.00 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.50 +/- 0.07, P < 0.002). These data, combined with heterogeneous (13)C enrichment of tissue lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, suggest that glycolytically derived lactate production and oxidation of exogenous lactate operate as functionally separate metabolic pathways.

It is currently difficult to find a rational way forward on this problem, as there are few data on what fuels cells use in vivo or even in an in vitro physiological situation.

In the present study we used a similar strategy to investigate fuel choices by trout thymocytes, cells with a similar function but from a different phylogenetic group. When these cells were presented with a physiological medium, we found that aerobic  accounted for 9% of total ATP turnover, glucose and glutamine oxidation made a combined contribution of 2.3%, oleate and palmitate oxidation accounted for 15%, and 74% was unaccounted for.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) induces cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in the context of obesity; however, its role in the metabolic consequences of obesity is not totally established. We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in the cardiac metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. In addition, we have explored whether this participation is, at least partially, acting on mitochondrial damage. Gal-3 inhibition in rats that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks with modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100 mg/kg/day) attenuated the increase in cardiac levels of total triglyceride (TG). MCP treatment also prevented the increase in cardiac protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA, mitofusin 1, and mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive oxygen species accumulation and decrease in those of complex V but did not affect the reduction in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake observed in HFD rats. The exposure of cardiac myoblasts (H9c2) to  increased the rate of respiration, mainly due to an increase in the proton leak, , oxidative stress, β-oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Gal-3 activity was unable to affect these changes. Our findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibition attenuates some of the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity induced by a HFD since it reduced TG and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) levels. These reductions were accompanied by amelioration of the mitochondrial damage observed in HFD rats, although no improvement was observed regarding insulin resistance.

Fatty  synthase (FAS) plays a central role in de novo lipogenesis by converting acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into the final end product, palmitate, which can subsequently be esterified into triacylglycerols and then stored in adipose tissue.

When glucose is the only exogenous substrate, they produce lactate over CO2 at a constant rate of 2.7 from this substrate. Increase of oxygen tension does not change this behaviour. Insulin preferentially increases lactate formation, dichloroacetate only CO2 production. The fact that the lactate/CO2 ratio can be varied from 0.5 to 16 indicates that there is no close coupling between glycolytic flux and pyruvate oxidation. Both exogenous lactate and fatty acids are used preferentially over glucose. But increase of fatty  oxidation and inhibition of glucose oxidation are not complementary. Glycolytic flux is only slightly decreased when fatty  oxidation is already saturated. The results indicate that fatty acids interact with glucose oxidation primarily by inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase. Neither insulin nor dichloroacetate in the presence of glucose inhibit fatty  oxidation.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625219>Short-term cigarette smoke exposure leads to metabolic alterations in lung alveolar cells.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced alveolar destruction and energy metabolism changes are known contributors to the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study examines the effect of CS exposure on metabolism in alveolar type II cells. Male A/J mice (8 wk old) were exposed to CS generated from a smoking machine for 4 or 8 weeks, and a recovery group was exposed to CS for 8 weeks and allowed to recover for 2 weeks. Alveolar type II cells were isolated from air- or CS- exposed mice. Acute CS exposure led to a reversible airspace enlargement in A/J mice as measured by the increase in mean linear intercept, indicative of alveolar destruction. The effect of CS exposure on cellular respiration was studied using the XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer. A decrease in respiration while metabolizing glucose was observed in the CS-exposed group, indicating altered  that was compensated by an increase in palmitate utilization; palmitate utilization was accompanied by an increase in the expression of CD36 and carnitine-palmitoyl transferase 1 in type II alveolar cells for the transport of palmitate into the cells and into mitochondria, respectively. The increase in palmitate use for energy production likely affects the surfactant biosynthesis pathway, as evidenced by the decrease in phosphatidylcholine levels and the increase in phospholipase A2 activity after CS exposure. These findings help our understanding of the mechanism underlying the surfactant deficiency observed in smokers and provide a target to delay the onset of COPD.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6098493>Skeletal muscle fibers in suspension: a new approach to the study of oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in differentiated muscle.</a></h2><p>A preparation of suspended fibers from m. flexor digitorum brevis of the rat was characterized with respect to morphological features, and its relevance for the study of muscular metabolism investigated.

We analyzed global metabolic changes induced by latent infection with an oncogenic virus, Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), the most common tumor of AIDS patients. Approximately one-third of the nearly 200 measured metabolites were altered following latent infection of endothelial cells by KSHV, including many metabolites of anabolic pathways common to most cancer cells. KSHV induced pathways that are commonly altered in cancer cells including , the pentose phosphate pathway, amino  production and fatty  synthesis. Interestingly, over half of the detectable long chain fatty acids detected in our screen were significantly increased by latent KSHV infection. KSHV infection leads to the elevation of metabolites involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, not degradation from phospholipids, and leads to increased lipid droplet organelle formation in the infected cells. Fatty  synthesis is required for the survival of latently infected endothelial cells, as inhibition of key enzymes in this pathway led to apoptosis of infected cells. Addition of  to latently infected cells treated with a fatty  synthesis inhibitor protected the cells from death indicating that the products of this pathway are essential. Our metabolomic analysis of KSHV-infected cells provides insight as to how oncogenic viruses can induce metabolic alterations common to cancer cells. Furthermore, this analysis raises the possibility that metabolic pathways may provide novel therapeutic targets for the inhibition of latent KSHV infection and ultimately KS tumors.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1637677>Lipid metabolism in cancer cachexia.</a></h2><p>The effect of cancer cachexia on the oxidative metabolism of lipids has been studied in mice transplanted either with the MAC16 adenocarcinoma, which induces profound loss of body weight and depletion of lipid stores, or the MAC13 adenocarcinoma, which is the same histological type, but which grows without an effect on host body weight or lipid stores. While oxidation of D-[U-14C]glucose did not differ between animals bearing tumours of either type and non-tumour bearing controls, oxidation of [1-14C]triolein administered by intragastric intubation was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in animals bearing the MAC16 tumour than in either non tumour-bearing controls or in animals bearing the MAC13 tumour. Intestinal absorption of [14C]lipid was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced in animals bearing the MAC13 tumour when compared with either non tumour-bearing animals or MAC16 tumour-bearing animals, but was not significantly different in the latter two groups. The level of labelled lipids in heart and adipose tissue after an oral [14C]lipid load was significantly lower in animals bearing the MAC16 tumour compared with the other two groups. The level of tumour lipids was also higher in the MAC16 than in the MAC13 tumour after both an oral [14C]lipid load or by direct injection of [U-14C]palmitate complexed to albumin into epididymal fat pads. Oxidation of [U-14C]palmitate was also significantly enhanced in liver and heart homogenates from animals bearing the MAC16 tumour.

Early changes in DAG formation induced by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol were compared to those caused by the nutrient secretagogue glucose in pancreatic islets. Turnover rates of DAG were investigated in radiolabeling experiments, whereas changes in total mass and fatty  composition of DAG were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. When islet lipids were labeled to steady state in tissue culture with [3H]glycerol, carbachol induced a rapid (10 s) and sustained increase of [3H]DAG generation. In contrast, glucose stimulation failed to increase [3H]glycerol containing DAG, and this was probably due to the isotopic dilution of the label secondary to enhanced . This was substantiated by following the transfer of 14C from glucose into DAG. Within 1 min of acute exposure of islets to D-[U-14C]-glucose at stimulatory concentrations, DAG labeling increased fivefold representing up to 2% of total glucose usage. Similar stimulation of 14C incorporation into other neutral lipids and inositol phospholipids was observed, suggesting the enhanced de novo synthesis of phosphatidic , the common precursor for DAG, and inositol phospholipids from glycolytic intermediates. Transfer of 14C from glucose was not stimulated by agents such as carbachol and exogenous phospholipase C that act primarily on inositol phospholipid breakdown. The total mass of islet DAG was increased by 60% after both carbachol and glucose stimulation. However, analysis of the fatty  composition of carbachol-generated DAG revealed at the early time point (10 s) a prevalent stearoyl-arachidonoyl configuration similar to that reported for inositol phospholipids. This pattern shifted to a DAG enriched in  at a later time point. Glucose-stimulated islets displayed a predominance of  containing DAG, indicating increased de novo synthesis of the putative second messenger rather than its formation by inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Indeed, steady-state labeling of these phospholipids with [3H]inositol confirmed this idea since only carbachol caused detectable inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Thus, although protein kinase C may be activated by both carbachol and glucose, the two secretagogues generate diacylglycerols through different mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4400482>Changes in beta-oxidation and related enzymes during the life cycle of Strongyloides ratti (Nematoda).</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30955643>Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data of early and middle season Hass avocados under heat treatment.</a></h2><p>Ripening heterogeneity of Hass avocados results in inconsistent quality fruit delivered to the triggered and ready to eat markets. This research aimed to understand the effect of a heat shock (HS) prior to controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the reduction of ripening heterogeneity. HS prior to CA storage reduces more drastically the ripening heterogeneity in middle season fruit. Via correlation network analysis we show the different metabolomics networks between HS and CA. High throughput proteomics revealed 135 differentially expressed proteins unique to middle season fruit triggered by HS. Further integration of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that HS reduced the glycolytic throughput and induced protein degradation to deliver energy for the alternative ripening pathways. l-isoleucine, l-valine, l-aspartic and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase involved in protein degradation were positively correlated to HS samples.

Herein, we analyze the consequences of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/metabolism disorder associated with the cell-specific hematopoietic ablation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). AIF-null (AIF ) mice developed pancytopenia that was associated with hypocellular bone marrow (BM) and thymus atrophy. Although myeloid cells were relatively spared, the B-cell and erythroid lineages were altered with increased frequencies of precursor B cells, pro-erythroblasts I, and basophilic erythroblasts II. T-cell populations were dramatically reduced with a thymopoiesis blockade at a double negative (DN) immature state, with DN1 accumulation and delayed DN2/DN3 and DN3/DN4 transitions. In BM cells, the OXPHOS/metabolism dysfunction provoked by the loss of AIF was counterbalanced by the augmentation of the mitochondrial biogenesis and a shift towards anaerobic . Nevertheless, in a caspase-independent process, the resulting excess of reactive oxygen species compromised the viability of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitors. This led to the progressive exhaustion of the HSC pool, a reduced capacity of the BM progenitors to differentiate into colonies in methylcellulose assays, and the absence of cell-autonomous HSC repopulating potential in vivo. In contrast to BM cells, AIF thymocytes compensated for the OXPHOS breakdown by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation. By over-expressing CPT1, ACADL and PDK4, three key enzymes facilitating fatty  β-oxidation (e.g.,  assimilation), the AIF thymocytes retrieved the ATP levels of the AIF  cells. As a consequence, it was possible to significantly reestablish AIF thymopoiesis in vivo by feeding the animals with a high-fat diet complemented with an antioxidant. Overall, our data reveal that the mitochondrial signals regulated by AIF are critical to hematopoietic decision-making. Emerging as a link between mitochondrial metabolism and hematopoietic cell fate, AIF-mediated OXPHOS regulation represents a target for the development of new immunomodulatory therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6458286>Increase in fatty  oxidation in calvaria cells cultured with diphosphonates.</a></h2><p>1.

The objective was to determine the effects of hyperglycaemia, elevated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and their interactions on trophoblast cell metabolism and function. Trophoblasts were isolated from normal term human placentas and established in culture for 16 h prior to experiments. Glucose utilisation, fatty  oxidation and fatty  esterification were determined using radiolabelled metabolic tracer methodology at various glucose and NEFA concentrations. Trophoblast lipid droplet formation including adipophilin mRNA expression, viability, apoptosis, syncytialisation, secretion of hormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines were also assessed. Glucose utilisation via  was near maximal at the low physiological glucose concentration of 4mM; whereas NEFA esterification into triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol increased linearly with increasing NEFA concentrations without evidence of plateau. Culture of trophoblasts in 0.25 mM NEFA for 24h upregulated fatty  esterification processes, inhibited fatty  oxidation, inhibited glycerol release (a marker of lipolysis) and promoted adipophilin and lipid droplet formation, all consistent with upregulation of fatty  storage and buffering capacity. NEFA also promoted trophoblast syncytialisation and TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10 production without effects on cell viability, apoptosis or hormone secretion. Hyperglycaemia caused intracellular glycogen accumulation and reduced lipid droplet formation, but had no other effects on trophoblast metabolism or function.

At 100 Torr, lactate production was 26 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1; the decrease of the PO2 to 0.1 Torr resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in lactate production.

The imported glucose is either stored or broken down, as insulin stimulates glycogenesis and ATP synthesis. The mechanism by which ATP production is increased is incompletely understood at present and, generally, relatively little functional information is available on the effect of insulin on mitochondrial function. In this paper we have exploited extracellular flux technology to investigate insulin effects on the bioenergetics of rat (L6) and human skeletal muscle myoblasts and myotubes. We demonstrate that a 20-min insulin exposure significantly increases (i) the cell respiratory control ratio, (ii) the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and (iii) the glucose sensitivity of anaerobic . The improvement of mitochondrial function is explained by an insulin-induced immediate decrease of mitochondrial proton leak. Palmitate exposure annuls the beneficial mitochondrial effects of insulin.

Molecular mechanisms responsible for these alterations in metabolism are not fully understood. Mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzes the first committed step in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. In the current study, an in vivo rat model of myocardial ischemia was utilized to determine whether specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenases exhibit ischemia-induced alterations in activity, identify mechanisms responsible for changes in enzyme function, and assess the effects on mitochondrial respiration. Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) activity declined 34% during 30 min of ischemia. Loss in activity appeared specific to VLCAD as medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity remained constant. Loss in VLCAD activity during ischemia was not due to loss in protein content. In addition, activity was restored in the presence of the detergent Triton X-100, suggesting that changes in the interaction between the protein and inner mitochondrial membrane are responsible for ischemia-induced loss in activity. Palmitoyl-carnitine supported ADP-dependent state 3 respiration declined as a result of ischemia. When octanoyl-carnitine was utilized state 3 respiration remained unchanged. State 4 respiration increased during ischemia, an increase that appears specific to fatty  utilization. Thus, VLCAD represents a likely site for the modulation of substrate utilization during myocardial ischemia. However, the dramatic increase in mitochondrial state 4 respiration would be predicted to accentuate the imbalance between energy production and utilization.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29317502>Macrophages with a deletion of the  () gene have a more proinflammatory phenotype.</a></h2><p>Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) is a metabolic enzyme that is integral to the gluconeogenic and glyceroneogenic pathways.

The rate of  from exogenous glucose in diabetic hearts was 48% of control, whereas glucose oxidation was depressed to only 16% of control. In contrast, palmitate oxidation was increased twofold in db/db hearts. The hypothesis that altered metabolism plays a causative role in diabetes-induced contractile dysfunction was tested using perfused hearts from transgenic db/db mice that overexpress GLUT-4 glucose transporters. Both glucose metabolism and palmitate metabolism were normalized in hearts from db/db-human insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (hGLUT-4) hearts, as was contractile function. These findings strongly support a causative role of impaired metabolism in the cardiomyopathy observed in db/db diabetic hearts.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17404155>Recruitment of compensatory pathways to sustain oxidative flux with reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity characterizes inefficiency in energy metabolism in hypertrophied hearts.</a></h2><p>Transport rates of long-chain free fatty acids into mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferase I relative to overall oxidative rates in hypertrophied hearts remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the extent of glucose oxidation, despite increased  in hypertrophy, remains controversial. The present study explores potential compensatory mechanisms to sustain tricarboxylic  cycle flux that resolve the apparent discrepancy of reduced fatty  oxidation without increased glucose oxidation through pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the energy-poor, hypertrophied heart.We studied flux through the oxidative metabolism of intact adult rat hearts subjected to 10 weeks of pressure overload (hypertrophied; n=9) or sham operation (sham; n=8) using dynamic 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance. Isolated hearts were perfused with [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16-(13)C8] palmitate (0.4 mmol/L) plus glucose (5 mmol/L) in a 14.1-T nuclear magnetic resonance magnet. At similar tricarboxylic  cycle rates, flux through carnitine palmitoyltransferase I was 23% lower in hypertrophied (P<0.04) compared with sham hearts and corresponded to a shift toward increased expression of the L-carnitine palmitoyltransferase I isoform. Glucose oxidation via pyruvate dehydrogenase complex did not compensate for reduced palmitate oxidation rates. However, hypertrophied rats displayed an 83% increase in anaplerotic flux into the tricarboxylic  cycle (P<0.03) that was supported by glycolytic pyruvate, coincident with increased mRNA transcript levels for malic enzyme.In cardiac hypertrophy, fatty  oxidation rates are reduced, whereas compensatory increases in anaplerosis maintain tricarboxylic  cycle flux and account for a greater portion of glucose oxidation than previously recognized. The shift away from acetyl coenzyme A production toward carbon influx via anaplerosis bypasses energy, yielding reactions contributing to a less energy-efficient heart.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18408129>Role of glucose metabolism in the recovery of postischemic LV mechanical function: effects of insulin and other metabolic modulators.</a></h2><p>The role of proton (H+) production from glucose metabolism in the recovery of myocardial function during postischemic reperfusion and its alteration by insulin and other metabolic modulators were examined. Rat hearts were perfused in vitro with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing palmitate (1.2 mmol/l) and glucose (11 mmol/l) under nonischemic conditions or during reperfusion following no-flow ischemia. Perfusate contained normal insulin (n-Ins, 50 mU/l), zero insulin (0-Ins), or supplemental insulin (s-Ins, 1,000 mU/l) or other metabolic modulators [dichloroacetate (DCA) at 3 mmol/l, oxfenicine at 1 mmol/l, and N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) at 0.5 micromol/l]. Relative to n-Ins, 0-Ins depressed rates of  and glucose oxidation in nonischemic hearts and impaired recovery of postischemic function. Relative to n-Ins, s-Ins did not affect aerobic glucose metabolism and did not improve recovery when present during reperfusion. When present during ischemia and reperfusion, s-Ins impaired recovery. Combinations of metabolic modulators with s-Ins stimulated glucose oxidation approximately 2.5-fold in nonischemic hearts and reduced H+ production. DCA and CHA, in combination with s-Ins, improved recovery of function, but addition of oxfenicine to this combination provided no further benefit. Although DCA and CHA were each partially protective in hearts perfused with n-Ins, optimal protection was achieved with DCA + CHA; recovery of function was inversely proportional to H+ production during reperfusion. Although supplemental insulin is not beneficial, elimination of H+ production from glucose metabolism by simultaneous inhibition of  and stimulation of glucose oxidation optimizes recovery of postischemic mechanical function.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21258134>Reversible high affinity inhibition of phosphofructokinase-1 by acyl-CoA: a mechanism integrating glycolytic flux with lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>The enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) catalyzes the first committed step of  and is regulated by a complex array of allosteric effectors that integrate glycolytic flux with cellular bioenergetics.

In sharp contrast, short chain acyl-CoAs, palmitoylcarnitine, and  in the presence of CoASH were without effect. Remarkably, MgAMP and MgADP but not MgATP protected PFK-1 against inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA indicating that acyl-CoAs regulate PFK-1 activity in concert with cellular high energy phosphate status. Furthermore, incubation of PFK-1 with [1-(14)C]palmitoyl-CoA resulted in robust acylation of the enzyme that was reversible by incubation with acyl-protein thioesterase-1 (APT1). Importantly, APT1 reversed palmitoyl-CoA-mediated inhibition of PFK-1 activity. Mass spectrometric analyses of palmitoylated PFK-1 revealed four sites of acylation, including Cys-114, Cys-170, Cys-351, and Cys-577. PFK-1 in both skeletal muscle extracts and in purified form was inhibited by S-hexadecyl-CoA, a nonhydrolyzable palmitoyl-CoA analog, demonstrating that covalent acylation of PFK-1 was not required for inhibition. Tryptic footprinting suggested that S-hexadecyl-CoA induced a conformational change in PFK-1. Both palmitoyl-CoA and S-hexadecyl-CoA increased the association of PFK-1 with Ca2+/calmodulin, which attenuated the binding of palmitoylated PFK-1 to membrane vesicles. Collectively, these results demonstrate that fatty acyl-CoA modulates phosphofructokinase activity through both covalent and noncovalent interactions to regulate glycolytic flux and enzyme membrane localization via the branch point metabolic node that mediates lipid flux through anabolic and catabolic pathways.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9374661> inhibition by palmitate in renal cells cultured in a two-chamber system.</a></h2><p>A major shortcoming of renal proximal tubular cells (RPTC) in culture is the gradual modification of their energy metabolism from the oxidative type to the glycolytic type.

Twenty-four hours of contact with palmitate decreased  by 38% provided that carnitine was present; lactate production was decreased by 38%, and the decrease in  resulted from a similar decrease of basolateral and apical net uptake of glucose. In contrast to the previously described effect of the nonphysiological oxidative substrate heptanoate, palmitate promoted a long-term decrease in lactate production and sustained excellent cellular growth. After 4 days of contact, decreased  was maintained even in the absence of carnitine and resulted from a decrease of basolateral uptake only, suggestive of long-term regulation different from the earlier effects. Thus, although cultured RPTC lost their oxidative phenotype, they exhibited a type of regulation (Randle effect) that is found in the oxidative-type but not in the glycolytic-type tissues, therefore unmasking a regulative capacity barely detectable in fresh RPTC.

Hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 11 mM glucose, 100 microU/mL insulin, and either 1.25 or 2.5 mM Ca2+, in the presence or absence of 1.2 mM palmitate. Rates of  and glucose oxidation or palmitate oxidation were measured in the hearts using [5-3H,14C(U)]glucose or [1-14C]palmitate, respectively. In the absence of fatty acids,  and glucose oxidation rates were similar, regardless of whether [Ca2+ was 1.25 or 2.5 mM.

When hearts were subjected to low-flow ischemia (by reducing coronary flow to 0.5 mL.min-1) oxidative metabolism was essentially abolished. Under these conditions, glycolytic rates were not dependent on either [Ca2+] or the presence or absence of fatty acids.

The extractions of glucose, lactate, pyruvate and free fatty acids by dog heart in vivo were calculated from measurements of their arterial and coronary sinus blood concentration. Elevation of plasma free fatty  concentrations by infusion of intralipid and heparin resulted in increased extraction of free fatty acids and diminished extractions of glucose, lactate and pyruvate by the heart. It is suggested that metabolism of free fatty acids by the heart in vivo, as in vitro, may impair utilization of these substrates. These effects of elevated plasma free fatty  concentrations on extractions by the heart in vivo were reversed by injection of dichloroacetate, which also improved extraction of lactate and pyruvate by the heart in vivo in alloxan diabetes. 2. Sodium dichloroacetate increased glucose oxidation and pyruvate oxidation in hearts from fed normal or alloxan-diabetic rats perfused with glucose and insulin. Dichloroacetate inhibited oxidation of acetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate and partially reversed inhibitory effects of these substrates on the oxidation of glucose. In rat diaphragm muscle dichloroacetate inhibited oxidation of acetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and palmitate and increased glucose oxidation and pyruvate oxidation in diaphragms from alloxan-diabetic rats. Dichloroacetate increased the rate of  in hearts perfused with glucose, insulin and acetate and evidence is given that this results from a lowering of the citrate concentration within the cell, with a consequent activation of phosphofructokinase. 3. In hearts from normal rats perfused with glucose and insulin, dichloroacetate increased cell concentrations of acetyl-CoA, acetylcarnitine and glutamate and lowered those of aspartate and malate. In perfusions with glucose, insulin and acetate, dichloroacetate lowered the cell citrate concentration without lowering the acetyl-CoA or acetylcarnitine concentrations. Measurements of specific radioactivities of acetyl-CoA, acetylcarnitine and citrate in perfusions with [1-(14)C]acetate indicated that dichloroacetate lowered the specific radio-activity of these substrates in the perfused heart. Evidence is given that dichloroacetate may not be metabolized by the heart to dichloroacetyl-CoA or dichloroacetylcarnitine or citrate or CO(2). 4. We suggest that dichloroacetate may activate pyruvate dehydrogenase, thus increasing the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and acetylcarnitine and the conversion of acetyl-CoA into glutamate, with consumption of aspartate and malate.

Here, we used an acute inflammation model in which pigs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that hepatic  and fatty  oxidation are both promoted. Acetyl-proteome profiling of LPS-infected pigs liver showed that inflammatory stress exacerbates the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Both mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were acetylated, and the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity was stimulated to maintain . With the use of C-carbon tracing in vitro, acetyl-CoA was found to be mainly supplied by lipid-derived fatty  oxidation rather than glucose-derived pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, while glucose was mainly used for lactate production in response to inflammatory stress. The results of the mitochondrial experiment showed that acetyl-CoA directly increases MDH2 and, in turn, the GOT2 acetylation level affects MAS activity. Treatment with palmitate in primary hepatocytes from LPS-injected pigs increased the hepatic production of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and lactate; MAS activity; and hepatic MDH2 and GOT2 hyperacetylation, while the deficiency of long-chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase resulted in the stabilization of these parameters. These observations suggest that acetyl-CoA produced by fatty  oxidation promotes MAS activity and  via nonenzymatic acetylation during the inflammatory stress response.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234676>Effects of exposure to a simulated altitude of 5500 m on energy metabolic pathways in rats.</a></h2><p>We examined the effect of exposure to 5500 m on three closely related metabolic pathways: anaerobic , the pentose phosphate shunt (PPS), and fatty  metabolism.

Acute and chronic hypoxia did not affect most of the measurements of anaerobic , but depressed lactate production in liver and kidney. Chronic hypoxia enhanced all aspects of lipid metabolism in liver and enhanced the uptake and oxidation to CO2 of palmitate in skeletal muscle. Chronic hypoxia did not alter the activity of the G-6-PD in any tissue studied, but the activity of 6-PGD was depressed in heart, kidney, thymus and adrenal gland. The lack of major changes in the capacities of anaerobic glycolytic pathways and the activities of the PPS dehydrogenases is consistent with the maintenance of normal aerobic metabolism in rats at 5500 m. We found no evidence that anaerobic metabolic processes were upregulated to sustain energy consumption during chronic hypoxia.

This decrease in cardiac efficiency was accompanied by a substantial production of H+ from glucose metabolism DCA caused a 2.2-fold increase in glucose oxidation, a 46 +/- 17% decrease in H+ production, a 1.6-fold increase in cardiac efficiency, and a 2.0-fold increase in cardiac work during reperfusion (n = 17).

Alternative energy substrates such as ketone bodies and monounsaturated oleic  supported the growth of the Tsc2-/- cells in vitro, whereas saturated  was toxic. Correspondingly, tumors in the high-fat, "Carb-free" group showed greater necrosis and liquefaction that contributed to their larger sizes. In contrast, 2-DG treatment significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation, increased metabolic stress (i.e., ketonemia) and AMPK activity, whereas rapamycin primarily reduced cell size.Our data support the concept of glycolytic inhibition as a therapeutic approach in TSC whereas dietary withdrawal of carbohydrates was not effective.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9144318>Influence of vanadate on , intracellular sodium, and pH in perfused rat hearts.</a></h2><p>Vanadium compounds have been shown to cause a variety of biological and metabolic effects including inhibition of certain enzymes, alteration of contractile function, and as an insulin like regulator of glucose metabolism. However, the influence of vanadium on metabolic and ionic changes in hearts remains to be understood. In this study we have examined the influence of vanadate on glucose metabolism and sodium transport in isolated perfused rat hearts. Hearts were perfused with 10 mM glucose and varying vanadate concentrations (0.7-100 microM) while changes in high energy phosphates (ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr)), intracellular pH, and intracellular sodium were monitored using 31P and 23Na NMR spectroscopy. Tissue lactate, glycogen, and (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity were also measured using biochemical assays. Under baseline conditions, vanadate increased tissue glycogen levels two fold and reduced (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity. Significant decreases in ATP and PCr were observed in the presence of vanadate, with little change in intracellular pH. These changes under baseline conditions were less severe when the hearts were perfused with glucose, palmitate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. During ischemia vanadate did not limit the rise in intracellular sodium, but slowed sodium recovery on reperfusion. The presence of vanadate during ischemia resulted in attenuation of acidosis, and reduced lactate accumulation. Reperfusion in the presence of vanadate resulted in a slower ATP recovery, while intracellular pH and PCr recovery was not affected. These results indicate that vanadate alters glucose utilization and (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity and thereby influences the response of the myocardium to an ischemic insult.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10548499>The effect of AMP-activated protein kinase and its activator AICAR on the metabolism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>In several non-vascular tissues in which it has been studied, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) appears to modulate the cellular response to stresses such as ischemia. In liver and muscle, it phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), leading to an increase in fatty  oxidation; and in muscle, its activation is associated with an increase in glucose transport. Here we report the presence of both AMPK and ACC in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Incubation of HUVEC with 2 mM AICAR, an AMPK activator, caused a 5-fold activation of AMPK, which was accompanied by a 70% decrease in ACC activity and a 2-fold increase in fatty  oxidation. Surprisingly, glucose uptake and , the dominant energy-producing pathway in HUVEC, were diminished by 40-60%. Despite this, cellular ATP levels were increased by 35%. Thus activation of AMPK by AICAR is associated with major alterations in endothelial cell energy balance. Whether these alterations protect the endothelium during ischemia or other stresses remains to be determined.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1559617>Reversible and irreversible oxidant injury to PC12 cells by hydrogen peroxide.</a></h2><p>A simple and reproducible model to identify biochemical changes associated with the transition from reversible to irreversible oxidant injury and cell death was established using rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Cells were subjected to a transient oxidative stress induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Reversible loss of high-energy phosphates, induced by exposing cells to 0.2 mM H2O2, was preceded by transient increases in cytosolic calcium with no loss of plasma membrane integrity, as indexed by release of cytosolic enzymes. In contrast, permanent loss of high-energy phosphates, induced by treating cells with 0.5 mH H2O2, was associated with sustained rises in cytosolic-free calcium and increased oxidation of pyruvate and palmitate, two mitochondrial substrates. Initial production of pyruvate and lactate was inhibited by exposure to 0.5 mM H2O2 but returned to values comparable to control values at one hour after treatment with H2O2. Compromise of the plasma membrane was a late event, occurring between 1 and 2 hours after exposure to 0.5 mM H2O2. Collectively, these data indicate that irreversible loss of high-energy phosphates and cell death caused by oxidative stress is more closely associated with altered mitochondrial function than with impaired .</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101433>Reductive glutamine metabolism by IDH1 mediates lipogenesis under hypoxia.</a></h2><p>Acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) is the central biosynthetic precursor for fatty- synthesis and protein acetylation. In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol. However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic  and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic  cycle and fatty- synthesis. Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis, the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of α-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-ketoglutarate for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18456722>Cardiac phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase increases , hypertrophy, and myocyte resistance to hypoxia.</a></h2><p>During ischemia and heart failure, there is an increase in cardiac .

However, the transgene did not change insulin sensitivity.

The B2-1 cells grown in 5.5 mM galactose in the absence of glucose produced very low levels of alkyldiacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, lactic , and dihydroxyacetone-P. Increasing concentrations of glucose caused a progressive increase in lactic , dihydroxyacetone-P, and up to a ten-fold increase in alkyldiacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. Glucose supplements also caused an increased incorporation of [9,10-3H] into alkyldiacylglycerols and triacylglycerols. These metabolic changes appeared to be independent of altered growth rates of the cells. The addition of hexadecanol along with glucose to the cultures resulted in a shorter lag and a more rapid rate of accumulation of alkyldiacylglycerols; hexadecanol supplements alone had no effect. The extent of uptake and oxidation of hexadecanol was similar in both the glucose and galactose-grown cells. These results indicate that the levels of alkyldiacylglycerols in neoplastic cells can be regulated by the extent their precursors are formed from glucose.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1750528> is predominant source of myocardial ATP production immediately after birth.</a></h2><p>Glycolytic flux, as well as glucose, fatty , and lactate oxidation, was determined in isolated working hearts obtained from 1- and 7-day-old rabbits.

Hearts were perfused with buffer containing 100 microU/ml insulin and either 1) 11 mM [U-14C/2-3H]glucose, 0.4 mM palmitate, 2 mM lactate; 2) 11 mM glucose, 0.4 mM [1-14C]palmitate, 2 mM lactate; or 3) 11 mM glucose, 0.4 mM palmitate, 2 mM [U-14C]lactate.

The objectives of this study were: (i) to verify that dobutamine stimulation produces DII in isolated rat hearts having, like failing hearts, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and hence reduced CFR and (ii) to study the effects of stimulation of glucose oxidation and of inhibition of fatty  oxidation in this new model of DII. Isolated rat hearts perfused with 11 mM glucose and 0.6 mM palmitate (or no palmitate) were studied. Stepwise increments in the volume of a balloon placed in LV resulted in reciprocal impairment of CFR, supporting the role of the extravascular compressive forces in determining CFR. CFR was 1.82+/-0.1 and 1.32+/-0.1 (p<0.05) in the hearts with LVEDP set to 5 mmHg (controls) and 40 mmHg (expanded), respectively. In controls, dobutamine increased coronary flow, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)), LVDP, mechanical efficiency, and the rates of palmitate and glucose oxidation, however, the effluent lactate concentration remained unchanged. In the expanded hearts vs. controls, dobutamine-induced increases in coronary flow and MVO(2) were reduced by approximately 50%, the increases in LVDP, efficiency, and rates of glucose and fatty  oxidation were completely prevented, and lactate production greatly increased with dobutamine, indicating DII. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activator, dichloroacetate (DCA 1 mM) and a putative inhibitor of fatty  beta-oxidation, trimetazidine (5 microM), both increased the rate of glucose oxidation and attenuated myocardial lactate production during DII, however they did not improve myocardial function during DII. Likewise, palmitate-free perfusion had no beneficial effect during DII although it attenuated lactate production. In the hearts subjected to palmitate-free perfusion plus DCA, lactate overproduction during DII was completely abolished, however, the deterioration of LVDP and mechanical efficiency was only partially prevented. Thus, greater demand for O(2) induces DII in the expanded hearts with reduced CFR. Lactate overproduction secondary to an imbalance between  and glucose oxidation is not a primary factor adversely affecting cardiac mechanical function during DII. Interventions shifting this balance toward glucose oxidation are not beneficial in the setting of DII in our model although they are known to effectively mitigate contractile dysfunction in the post-ischemic myocardium.</p><p>Keyword: glycolysis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26236101>Metabolomics changes in a rat model of obstructive jaundice: mapping to metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids as well as oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>The study examined the global metabolic and some biochemical changes in rats with cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL).

We analyzed and compared the results of studies that support and that deny the involvement of uncoupling protein-2 in this impairment. We observed that this impairment could occur in multiple stages. We provide a model in which palmitate-induced impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is proposed to occur in two stages, early stage and late stage, depending on the integrity of electron supply ( and Krebs cycle) and transport system through electron transport chain after palmitate treatment. Prolonged exposure of β-cells to palmitate can impair this system. Early-stage impairment occurs due to uncoupling by uncoupling protein-2 when this system is still intact. When this system becomes impaired, late-stage impairment occurs mainly due to reduced glucose-stimulated adenosine triphosphate production independent of uncoupling by uncoupling protein-2. The change in glucose-stimulated oxygen uptake after palmitate treatment reflects the integrity of this system and can be used to differentiate between the two stages. Some β-cells lines and islets appear to be more resistant to palmitate-induced impairment of electron supply and transport system than others, and therefore early stage is prominent in the more resistant cell lines and less prominent or absent in the less resistant cell lines.

Isolated working rat hearts were perfused with 5.5 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate and were subjected to 30 min of no-flow ischemia. , glucose oxidation, and palmitate oxidation were measured during aerobic reperfusion by adding [5-3H]glucose, [U-14C]glucose, or [9,10-3H]palmitate to the perfusate, respectively. During reperfusion, cardiac work in untreated hearts recovered to a lesser extent than myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2), resulting in a decreased recovery of cardiac efficiency, which recovered to only 25% of preischemic values. Treatment of hearts with T3 (10 nM) before ischemia increased glucose oxidation during reperfusion, which was associated with a significant increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, the rate-limiting enzyme for glucose oxidation. In contrast, T3 had no effect on MVO2, , or palmitate oxidation. This resulted in a significant decrease in H+ production from  uncoupled from glucose oxidation (2.7 +/- 0.3 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 micromol . g dry wt-1 . min-1 in control and T3-treated hearts, respectively, P < 0.05), as well as a 3.2-fold improvement in cardiac work and a 2.3-fold increase in cardiac efficiency compared with untreated postischemic hearts (P < 0.05).

We examined the mechanism in islets cultured for 24 h with 0.25 mmol/l palmitate. As expected, insulin secretion at 2.8 and 8.3 mmol/l glucose was increased in the palmitate-treated islets as opposed to no change at 27.7 mmol/l glucose.

Glucokinase Km and Vmax measured in islet extracts were unaffected by the palmitate. In contrast, hexokinase Vmax was increased by 25-35% in both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial-bound pools.

To gain insights into the mechanisms that govern oil synthesis and fatty  (FA) composition in the oil palm fruit, we used a multilevel approach combining gene coexpression analysis, quantification of allele-specific expression and joint multivariate analysis of transcriptomic and lipid data, in an interspecific backcross population between the African oil palm, Elaeis guineensis, and the American oil palm, Elaeis oleifera, which display contrasting oil contents and FA compositions. The gene coexpression network produced revealed tight transcriptional coordination of fatty  synthesis (FAS) in the plastid with sugar sensing, plastidial glycolysis, transient starch storage and carbon recapture pathways. It also revealed a concerted regulation, along with FAS, of both the transfer of nascent FA to the endoplasmic reticulum, where triacylglycerol assembly occurs, and of the production of glycerol-3-phosphate, which provides the backbone of triacylglycerols. Plastid biogenesis and auxin transport were the two other biological processes most tightly connected to FAS in the network. In addition to WRINKLED1, a transcription factor (TF) known to activate FAS genes, two novel TFs, termed NF-YB-1 and ZFP-1, were found at the core of the FAS module. The saturated FA content of palm oil appeared to vary above all in relation to the level of transcripts of the gene coding for β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II.

For hypoxia and tachycardia, the oxygen supply-demand ratio was comparable ( approximately 1 nmol O(2)/mm Hg/g(dry)). During baseline, the left ventricular peak systolic pressure (PSP) averaged 126 +/- 6 mm Hg, the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) 5 mm Hg, and the relaxation time constant (Tau) 34 +/- 2 ms; the coronary flow was 36 +/- 2 ml/min/g(dry).

During tachycardia, the PSP decreased to 88 +/- 1 mm Hg, and the EDP increased to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg, while Tau and coronary flow did not change significantly; palmitate oxidation and oxygen consumption increased above baseline. For both stressors, the predicted lactate release underestimated the measured values by a factor of approximately 2, but were comparable during baseline and recovery. Upon recovery, PSP returned to approximately 80% of baseline, while EDP remained elevated, for both stressors. Glucose oxidation returned to baseline, but palmitate oxidation became accelerated. We conclude for neonatal pig hearts subjected to oxygen insufficiency: (1) that PSP decreases and (2) that EDP and Tau increase with hypoxia, whereas EDP increases, while Tau remains unchanged with tachycardia.
