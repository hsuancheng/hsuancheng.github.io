We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2  and obesity or inflammatory bowel disease. These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466091>Irisin Ameliorates Glucolipotoxicity-Associated β-Cell Dysfunction and Apoptosis via AMPK Signaling and Anti-Inflammatory Actions.</a></h2><p>Islet metabolic disorder and inflammation contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of type 2  (T2DM). Irisin is a recently identified adipomyokine with protective effects on metabolic homeostasis and inflammation-suppressing effects in hepatic and vascular cells. The present study examined the effects of irisin on lipid metabolism and inflammation in β cells under glucolipotoxic conditions.Rat INS-1E β cells and islets isolated from C57BL/6 mice were incubated in glucolipotoxic conditions with or without irisin. Intracellular lipid contents and lipogenic gene expression were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays and real-time PCR, respectively. Inflammatory status was evidenced by Western blot analysis for the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and real-time PCR analysis for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes.Irisin reversed glucolipotoxicity-induced intracellular non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and triglyceride accumulation, suppressed associated elevations in lipogenic gene expression, and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) in INS-1E cells. These demonstrated effects were dependent on irisin-activated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Meanwhile, AMPK signaling mediated the protective effects of irisin on INS-1E cell insulin secretory ability and survival as well. Additionally, irisin inhibited phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 while decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Moreover, irisin also improved insulin secretion, inhibited apoptosis, and restored β-cell function-related gene expression in isolated mouse islets under glucolipotoxic conditions.Irisin attenuated excessive lipogenesis in INS-1E cells under glucolipotoxic state through activation of AMPK. Irisin also suppressed overnutrition-induced inflammation in INS-1E cells. Our findings implicate irisin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of islet lipid metabolic disorder and islet inflammation in T2DM.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Among these compounds, a 12-aa Bim-BH3 core sequence peptide conjugated to  (SM-6) displayed good PTP1B binding affinity (K = 8.38 nmol/L), inhibitory activity (IC = 1.20 μmol/L) and selectivity against other PTPs (TCPTP, LAR, SHP-1 and SHP-2). Furthermore, SM-6 promoted HepG2 cell glucose uptake and inhibited the expression of PTP1B, indicating that SM-6 could improve the insulin resistance effect in the insulin-resistant HepG2 cell model. These results may indicate a new direction for the application of BH3 peptide mimetics and promising PTP1B peptide inhibitors could be designed and developed based on SM-6.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to evaluate the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of  leaves extracts, and to identify the metabolites responsible for the bioactivity.Crude extract obtained from the dried leaves using 80% methanolic solution was further partitioned using different polarity solvents. The resultant extracts were investigated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential followed by metabolites profiling using the gas chromatography tandem with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).Multivariate data analysis was developed by correlating the bioactivity, and GC-MS data generated a suitable partial least square (PLS) model resulting in 11 bioactive compounds, namely, , phytol, hexadecanoic  (methyl ester), 1-monopalmitin, stigmast-5-ene, pentadecanoic , heptadecanoic , 1-linolenoylglycerol, glycerol monostearate, alpha-tocospiro B, and stigmasterol.

Impairment in the functions of ER occurs in a variety of nutritive disorders including obesity and type 2 . Here, we hypothesize that (scopoletin) SPL, a coumarin, has the potential to alleviate ER stress induced in vitro and in vivo models by lipotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, the ability of SPL to restore the levels of proteins of ER stress was analyzed. Rat insulinoma 5f (RIN5f) cells and Sprague Dawley rats were the models used for this study. Groups of control and high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD)-fed rats were treated with either SPL or 4-phenylbutyric . Status of ER stress was enumerated by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies. Proximal proteins of ER stress inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), protein kinase like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) were reduced in the β-cells by SPL. The subsequent signaling proteins X-box binding protein 1, eukaryotic initiation factor2α, activating transcription factor 4, and C/EBP homologous protein were also suppressed in their expression levels when treated with SPL. IRE1, PERK signaling leads to c-Jun-N-terminal kinases phosphorylation, a kinase that interrupts insulin signaling, which was also reverted upon scopoletin treatment. Finally, we confirm that SPL has the ability to suppress the stress proteins and limit pancreatic ER stress which might help in delaying the progression of insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816667>The Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant MitoQ Modulates Mitochondrial Function and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pancreatic β Cells Exposed to Hyperglycaemia.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants such as mitoquinone (MitoQ) have demonstrated protective effects against oxidative damage in several diseases. The increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during glucose metabolism in β cells can be exacerbated under hyperglycaemic conditions such as type 2  (T2D), thus contributing to β cell function impairment. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the effect of MitoQ on insulin secretion, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signalling in a pancreatic β cell line under normoglycaemic (NG, 11.1 mM glucose), hyperglycaemic (HG, 25 mM glucose) and lipidic ( (PA), 0.5mM) conditions.We incubated the pancreatic β cell line INS-1E with or without MitoQ (0.5µM) under NG, HG and PA conditions. We then assessed the following parameters: glucose-induced insulin secretion, O₂ consumption (with a Clark-type electrode); mitochondrial function, oxidative stress parameters and calcium levels (by fluorescence microscopy); ER stress markers and NFκB-p65 protein levels (by western blotting).MitoQ increased insulin secretion and prevented the enhancement of ROS production and O₂ consumption and decrease in GSH levels that are characteristic under HG conditions. MitoQ also reduced protein levels of ER stress markers (GRP78 and P-eIF2α) and the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor NFκB-p65, both of which increased under HG. MitoQ did not significantly alter ER stress markers under lipidic conditions.Our findings suggest that treatment with MitoQ modulates mitochondrial function, which in turn ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress and NFκB activation, thereby representing potential benefits for pancreatic β cell function.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Measures of mitochondrial metabolism, as reflected by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and cytochrome c reduction, calcium signaling, and ISR by rat islets were used to evaluate processes stimulated by acute exposure to  (PA). The contribution of mitochondrial oxidation of PA was determined in the presence and absence of a blocker of mitochondrial transport of fatty acids (etomoxir) at different glucose concentrations. Subsequent to increasing glucose from 3 to 20 mM, PA caused small increases in OCR and cytosolic calcium (about 20% of the effect of glucose). In contrast, the effect of PA on ISR was almost 3 times that by glucose, suggesting that the metabolism of PA is not the dominant mechanism mediating PA's effect on ISR. This was further supported by lack of inhibition of PA-stimulated OCR and ISR when blocking entry of PA into mitochondria (with etomoxir), and PA's lack of stimulation of reduced cytochrome c in the presence of high glucose. Consistent with the lack of metabolic stimulation by PA, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but not a blocker of L-type calcium channels, abolished the PA-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium. Notably, ISR was unaffected by thapsigargin showing the dissociation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and second phase insulin secretion. In conclusion, stimulation of ISR by PA was mediated by mechanisms largely independent of the oxidation of the fuel.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381726>Docosahexaenoic  Reduces -Induced Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pancreatic Β Cells.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to peripheral insulin resistance and the progression of pancreatic beta cell failure in type 2 . Although ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of , it is indispensable for cellular activity. Therefore, when assessing the pathological significance of ER stress, it is important to monitor and quantify ER stress levels. Here, we have established a novel system to monitor ER stress levels quickly and sensitively, and using this method, we have clarified the effect of differences in glucose concentration and various fatty acids on the ER of pancreatic β cells. First, we developed a cell system that secretes Gaussia luciferase in culture medium depending on the activation of the GRP78 promoter. This system could sensitively monitor ER stress levels that could not be detected with real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. This system revealed that hyperglycemia does not induce unfolded protein response (UPR) in a short period of time in MIN6 cells, a mouse pancreatic β cell line. Physiological concentrations of , a saturated fatty , induced ER stress quickly, while physiological concentrations of oleic , an unsaturated fatty , did not. Docosahexaenoic , an n-3 unsaturated fatty , inhibited -induced ER stress. In this study, we have established a system that can sensitively detect ER stress levels of living cells in a short period of time. This system can be used to monitor the state of the ER in living cells and lead to the investigation of the significance of physiological or pathological ER stress levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202710>The protective role of the MKP-5-JNK/P38 pathway in glucolipotoxicity-induced islet β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (glycolipotoxicity)-triggered islet β-cell dysfunction is known to drive the progression of obesity-related type 2 , however the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and  (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP-5 is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence highlights the importance of directly elucidating T-cell activation under the obesity-induced metabolic stress condition, as T cells primed under such conditions were found to acquire a unique phenotype and function. Herein, we found a significant upregulation of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 3 (SLAMF3) expression on T cells from T2D patients compared to those of healthy controls. Importantly, SLAMF3 upregulation was associated with an increased ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly increased SLAMF3 expression was seen in T2D patient T cells that produce IFN-γ or IL-17 upon short (4-h) stimulation, compared to non-cytokine-producing T cells. In line with this finding, SLAMF3 T cells were significantly more sensitive than SLAMF3 T cells to TCR stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Furthermore, treatment with  (PA) led to significant upregulation of SLAMF3 on human T cells primed by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and on Jurkat cells, a human T-cell line. RNA sequencing revealed strong activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in T cells that were primed with PA. Further mechanistic studies showed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, or its upstream mediator STAT5 can prevent PA-induced SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells. These results indicate that SLAMF3 upregulation is associated with T-cell activation and cytokine production in T2D patients, and suggest that elevated saturated fatty acids in T2D patients may induce SLAMF3 upregulation on T cells via activation of the STAT5-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873823>A Novel Role for Somatostatin in the Survival of Mouse Pancreatic Beta Cells.</a></h2><p>Cross-talk between different pancreatic islet cell types regulates islet function and somatostatin (SST) released from pancreatic delta cells inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. In other tissues SST exhibits both protective and pro-apoptotic properties in a tissue-specific manner, but little is known about the impact of the peptide on beta cell survival. Here we investigate the specific role of SST in the regulation of beta cell survival in response to physiologically relevant inducers of cellular stress including palmitate, cytokines and glucose.Pancreatic MIN6 beta cells and primary mouse islet cells were pre-treated with SST with or without the G signalling inhibitor, pertussis toxin, and exposed to different cellular stress factors. Apoptosis and proliferation were assessed by measurement of caspase 3/7 activity, TUNEL and BrdU incorporation, respectively, and expression of target genes was measured by qPCR.SST partly alleviated upregulation of cellular stress markers (Hspa1a and Ddit3) and beta cell apoptosis in response to factors such as lipotoxicity (palmitate), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1β and TNFα) and low glucose levels. This effect was mediated via a G protein-dependent pathway, but did not modify transcriptional upregulation of the specific NFκB-dependent genes, Nos2 and Ccl2, nor was it associated with transcriptional changes in SST receptor expression.Our results suggest an underlying protective effect of SST which modulates the beta cell response to ER stress and apoptosis induced by a range of cellular stressors associated with type 2 .© Copyright by the Author(s).

Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

Liraglutide's protracted action highly depends on its capacity to bind to albumin via its  part. However, in , albumin can undergo glycation, resulting in impaired drug binding. Our objective in this study was to assess the impact of human serum albumin (HSA) glycation on liraglutide affinity. Using fluorine labeling of the drug and F NMR, we determined HSA affinity for liraglutide in two glycated albumin models. We either glycated HSA  by incubation with glucose (G25- or G100-HSA) or methylglyoxal (MGO-HSA) or purified  glycated HSA from the plasma of diabetic patients with poor glycemic control. Nonglycated commercial HSA (G0-HSA) and HSA purified from plasma of healthy individuals served as controls. We found that glycation decreases affinity for liraglutide by 7-fold for G100-HSA and by 5-fold for MGO-HSA compared with G0-HSA. A similarly reduced affinity was observed for HSA purified from diabetic individuals compared with HSA from healthy individuals. Our results reveal that glycation significantly impairs HSA affinity to liraglutide and confirm that glycation contributes to liraglutide's variable therapeutic efficiency, depending on  stage.

Our previous studies found that mangiferin could decrease serum FFA levels in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet. Our research was to determine the effects and mechanism of mangiferin on improving IR by regulating FFA metabolism in HepG2 and C2C12 cells. The model was used to quantify PA-induced lipid accumulation in the two cell lines treated with various concentrations of mangiferin simultaneously for 24 h.

Mangiferin significantly increased FFA uptake and decreased intracellular FFA and triglyceride (TG) accumulations. The activity of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) protein and its downstream proteins involved in fatty  translocase (CD36) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and the fatty  -oxidation rate corresponding to FFA metabolism were also markedly increased by mangiferin in HepG2 and C2C12 cells.

In cultured renal mesanglial and tubular cells, UTX overexpression promoted  induced elevation of inflammation and DNA damage, whereas UTX knockdown or GSK-J4 treatment showed the opposite effects. Mechanistically, we found that UTX demethylase activity-dependently regulated the transcription of inflammatory genes; moreover, UTX bound with p53 and p53-dependently exacerbated DNA damage. Collectively, our results suggest UTX as a potential therapeutic target for DKD.© 2018 The Authors.

Endocarp.</a></h2><p>Drugs with post-prandial action constitute one of the main courses of treatments for .In the present investigation, we have explored the α-amylase inhibitory potential of ethanolic extract of Cocos nucifera endocarp.DNS based assay was done to assess the α-amylase inhibition potential of ethanolic extract. Phytochemical screening and GC-MS analysis were done in order to assess the chemical profiling of extract. In silico docking studies were done using VLife MDS 4.6 software and the probable molecules, predicted after GC-MS analysis, were docked with the co-crystallized (acarbose) tracked active site and rest all cavities of porcine pancreatic α-amylase (1OSE). ADMET analysis was done using StarDrop 6.4, Derek Nexus and P450 Modules from Optibrium Ltd. and LHASA Ltd.DNS based α-amylase assay indicated that the IC50 value of extract lies in the range of 63- 126 µg/ml and at higher doses, i.e. above 250 µg/ml, it has better α-amylase inhibition than the standard drug, acarbose. Phytochemical screening indicated that ethanolic extract is rich in alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, triterpenes, glycosides, carbohydrates, terpenoids, quinones and lactones. Further, GC-MS analysis (where Similarity Index was > 90) predicted that the probable phytoconstituents present in the ethanolic extract are myristic , syringaldehyde, eugenol, vanillin, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, lauric ,  methyl ester and γ-sitosterol. γ-Sitosterol showed the strong affinity towards the active site which was tracked by a co-crystallized ligand along with cavity 1 and 2 while significant interactions were observed in case of co-crystallized tracked active site as well as cavity 4 of 1OSE. Ethanolic extract of C. nucifera has no hemolytic effect.Its ability to effectively inhibit α-amylase may be attributed to the presence of the above probable molecules, which will be explored further.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990837>Vascular endothelial growth factor over-expressed mesenchymal stem cells-conditioned media ameliorate palmitate-induced diabetic endothelial dysfunction through PI-3K/AKT/m-TOR/eNOS and p38/MAPK signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>In the pathogenesis of  (DM), islet microvasculares are severely damaged due to glucolipotoxicity and other reasons. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an indispensable and specific angiogenic factor in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic islet microvascular disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are regarded as a promising treatment of  because of their immunosuppressive effect and multipotential differentiation potency. In this study, we tested whether MSCs over-expressing VEGF conditioned medium (MSC-VEGF-CM) could ameliorate pancreatic islet endothelial cells (MS-1) dysfunction induced by a common diabetic inducer palmitate (PA). We found that cell survival and migration were restrained by PA and partly repaired by the pro-protected of MSC-VEGF-CM. Meanwhile, PI-3K/AKT/m-TOR/eNOS and p38/MAPK signaling pathways were also up-regulated. Though apoptosis-related proteins, caspase-3 and caspase-9, had no significantly suppressed between MSC-VEGF-CM and MSC-CM alone, the expression levels of vascular surface factors such as CD31, VE-cadherin, occludin and ICAM-1, were remarkably up-regulated by the pro-protected of MSC-VEGF-CM. Our data suggested that MSC-VEGF-CM had therapeutic effect on the PA-induced dysfunction through the re-activation of PI-3K/AKT/m-TOR/eNOS and p38/MAPK signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We aimed at systematically synthesising the association of palm oil consumption with cardiovascular disease risk and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality.We systematically searched Central, Medline and Embase databases up to June 2017 without restriction on setting or language. We performed separate searches based on the outcomes: coronary heart disease and stroke, using keywords related to these outcomes and palm oil. We searched for published interventional and observational studies in adults (Age: >18 years old). Two investigators extracted data and a consensus was reached with involvement of a third. Only narrative synthesis was performed for all of the studies, as the data could not be pooled.Our search retrieved 2,738 citations for stroke with one included study and 1,777 citations for coronary heart disease (CHD) with four included studies.  was reported to be associated with risk of myocardial infarction (MI) (OR 2.76; 95%CI = 1.39-5.47). Total SFA intake was reported to be not significant for risk of MI. Varying intake of fried foods, highest contributor to total SFA with 36% of households using palm oil for frying, showed no significant associations to risk of MI. Odds of developing first non-fatal acute MI was higher in palm oil compared to soybean oil with 5% trans-fat (OR = 1.33; 95%CI = 1.09-1.62) than palm oil compared to soybean oil with 22% trans-fat (OR = 1.16; 95%CI = 0.86-1.56). Nevertheless, these risk estimates were non-significant and imprecise. The trend amongst those taking staple pattern diet (characterised by higher palm oil, red meat and added sugar consumption) was inconsistent across the factor score quintiles. During the years of 1980 and 1997, for every additional kilogram of palm oil consumed per-capita annually, CHD mortality risk was 68 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI = 21-115) in developing countries and 17 deaths per 100,000 (95%CI = 5.3-29) in high-income countries, whereas stroke was associated with 19 deaths per 100,000 (95%CI = -12-49) and 5.1 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI: -1.2-11) respectively. The evidence for the outcomes of this review were all graded as very low. The findings of this review should be interpreted with some caution, owing to the lack of a pooled effect estimate of the association, significant bias in selection criteria and confounding factors, inclusion of other food items together with palm oil, and the possible out-dated trend in the ecological study.In view of the abundance of palm oil in the market, quantifying its true association with CVD outcomes is challenging. The present review could not establish strong evidence for or against palm oil consumption relating to cardiovascular disease risk and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality. Further studies are needed to establish the association of palm oil with CVD. A healthy overall diet should still be prioritised for good cardiometabolic health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666198>High Glucose Concentration Impairs 5-PAHSA Activity by Inhibiting AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Activation and Promoting Nuclear Factor-Kappa-B-Mediated Inflammation.</a></h2><p>Recently, the endogenous fatty  -5-hydroxystearic  (5-PAHSA) was found to increase insulin sensitivity and have anti-inflammatory effects in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced . However, it is unknown if 5-PAHSA affects glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice, which are characterized by extreme hyperglycemia. Here, we aim to determine the effect of continued 5-PAHSA administration on glucose and lipid metabolism in db/db mice. We also used 3T3-L1 cells and HepG2 cells to investigate the mechanism behind this effect. HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells were induced to become models of insulin resistance. The models were used to test the effect of 5-PAHSA on insulin signaling. 5-PAHSA was administered orally to db/db mice for 1 month to assess its effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. We also exposed HepG2 cells to high glucose concentrations to investigate the influence on 5-PAHSA's effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. 5-PAHSA improved glucose uptake and insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. However, after 1 month of treatment, 5-PAHSA did not reduce blood glucose levels, but increased inflammation and promoted fatty liver in db/db mice. In HepG2 cells under normal glucose conditions, 5-PAHSA treatment reduced lipogenesis and increased lipid oxidation. Notably, a high glucose concentration in cell media abolished the positive effects of 5-PAHSA treatment. These changes were associated with: decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC); upregulation of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), and fatty  synthase (FAS); and downregulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Besides, the anti-inflammatory effect of 5-PAHSA was also impaired by high glucose conditions. Thus, high glucose concentrations impaired 5-PAHSA action by inhibiting the AMPK signaling pathway and promoting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) mediated inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277329>Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as an in vitro model to study cardiac insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Patients with type 2  (T2D) and/or insulin resistance (IR) have an increased risk for the development of heart failure (HF). Evidence indicates that this increased risk is linked to an altered cardiac substrate preference of the insulin resistant heart, which shifts from a balanced utilization of glucose and long-chain fatty acids (FAs) towards an almost complete reliance on FAs as main fuel source. This shift leads to a loss of endosomal proton pump activity and increased cardiac fat accumulation, which eventually triggers cardiac dysfunction. In this review, we describe the advantages and disadvantages of currently used in vitro models to study the underlying mechanism of IR-induced HF and provide insight into a human in vitro model: human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs). Using functional metabolic assays we demonstrate that, similar to rodent studies, hESC-CMs subjected to 16h of high palmitate (HP) treatment develop the main features of IR, i.e., decreased insulin-stimulated glucose and FA uptake, as well as loss of endosomal acidification and insulin signaling. Taken together, these data propose that HP-treated hESC-CMs are a promising in vitro model of lipid overload-induced IR for further research into the underlying mechanism of cardiac IR and for identifying new pharmacological agents and therapeutic strategies.

However, the mechanism of dysfunction remains unknown. In this study, we examined mitochondrial function in the mechanistic study in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to establish the DIO model for GLP-1 reduction. The mice were then treated with berberine (BBR) (100 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks to test the impact on GLP-1 expression. Mitochondrial activities of the colon enterocytes were compared among three groups of mice (lean, DIO, and DIO + BBR) at the end of treatment. Gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were examined to understand the mitochondrial responses. A cellular model treated with  (PA) was used in the mechanism study.A reduction in GLP-1 expression was observed in DIO mice with mitochondrial stress responses in the colon enterocytes. The mitochondria exhibited cristae loss, membrane rupture, and mitochondrial swelling, which was observed with an increase in ATP abundance, complex I activity, and deficiency in the activities of complexes II and IV. Those changes were associated with dysbiosis and a reduction in SCFAs in the colon of DIO mice. In the cellular model, an increase in ATP abundance, loss of mitochondrial potential, and elevation of apoptosis were induced by PA. All of the alterations in DIO mice and the cellular model were attenuated by BBR.The mitochondrial stress responses were observed in the colon enterocytes of DIO mice for GLP-1 reduction. The stress was prevented by BBR in the restoration of GLP-1 expression, in which BBR may act through direct and indirect mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717198>Aspalathin-Enriched Green Rooibos Extract Reduces Hepatic Insulin Resistance by Modulating PI3K/AKT and AMPK Pathways.</a></h2><p>We previously demonstrated that an aspalathin-enriched green rooibos extract (GRE) reversed palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle and 3T3-L1 fat cells by modulating key effectors of insulin signalling such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, the effect of GRE on hepatic insulin resistance is unknown. The effects of GRE on lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance using palmitate-exposed C3A liver cells and obese insulin resistant (OBIR) rats were explored. GRE attenuated the palmitate-induced impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in treated C3A cells and improved insulin sensitivity in OBIR rats. Mechanistically, GRE treatment significantly increased PI3K/AKT and AMPK phosphorylation while concurrently enhancing glucose transporter 2 expression. These findings were further supported by marked stimulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as insulin receptor () and insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 ( and ), as well as those involved in lipid metabolism, including Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) following GRE treatment. GRE showed a strong potential to ameliorate hepatic insulin resistance by improving insulin sensitivity through the regulation of PI3K/AKT, FOXO1 and AMPK-mediated pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408822>Identifying Signalling Pathways Regulated by GPRC5B in β-Cells by CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing.</a></h2><p>CRISPR-Cas9, a RNA-guided targeted genome editing tool, has revolutionized genetic engineering by offering the ability to precisely modify DNA. GPRC5B is an orphan receptor belonging to the group C family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, we analysed the functional roles of the Gprc5b receptor in MIN6 β-cells using CRISPR-Cas9 and transient over-expression of Gprc5b.The optimal transfection reagent for use in MIN6 β-cells was determined by analysing efficiency of GFP plasmid delivery by cell sorting. A MIN6 β-cell line in which Gprc5b expression was knocked down (Gprc5b KD) was generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Gprc5b receptor mRNA expression, proliferation, apoptosis, Cignal 45-Pathway Reporter Array signalling and western blot assays were carried out using Gpcr5b KD MIN6 β-cells that had been transiently transfected with different concentrations of mouse Gprc5b plasmid to over-express Gprc5b.JetPRIME® was the best candidate for MIN6 β-cell transfection, providing approximately 30% transfection efficiency. CRISPR-Cas9 technology targeting Gprc5b led to stable knock-down of this receptor in MIN6 β-cells and its re-expression induced proliferation and potentiated cytokine- and palmitate-induced apoptosis. The Cignal 45 Reporter analysis indicated Gprc5b-dependent regulation of apoptotic and proliferative pathways, and western blotting confirmed activation of signalling via TGF-β and IFNγ.This study provides evidence of CRISPR-Cas9 technology being used to down-regulate Gprc5b expression in MIN6 β-cells. This strategy allowed us to identify signalling pathways linking GPRC5B receptor expression to β-cell proliferation and apoptosis.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

It has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of obesity and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high lipid (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of insulin secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of . In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM ) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an obesity rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662. In conclusion, the protective effect of telmisartan was mediated by an anti-ER stress-induced apoptotic and anti-oxidative pathway. SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY: Type 2  (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder worldwide pathologically characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of . In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high lipid-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the insulin secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29572383>CTRP3 attenuates high-fat diet-induced male reproductive dysfunction in mice.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have suggested a role for abdominal obesity in male infertility. Previous studies have found that cell apoptosis exerts an important role in obesity-related male infertility. C1q/TNF-related protein 3 (CTRP3), a paralog of adiponectin, has been proposed to exert anti-apoptotic effects and to attenuate -related cardiac injuries. However, the role of CTRP3 in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced spermatogenic impairment remains unclear. In the present study, we fed male mice an HFD for 24 weeks to induce obesity. The expression of CTRP3 was decreased by HFD feeding. Supplementation with the recombinant human globular domain of CTRP3 (0.25 μg/g/day) for 4 weeks beginning at 20 weeks of the HFD improved spermatogenic function in the HFD-fed mice, which were characterized by improved testis morphology, increased testis weight/body weight ratio, and increased sperm count, sperm viability, and sperm motility. We also found that CTRP3 infusion resulted in the attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the activation of silence information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in the testes of obese mice. Our  study also suggested that CTRP3 attenuated the  (PA)-induced reductions in sperm viability and motility via the inhibition of ER stress. Moreover, germ cell-specific  knockout abolished the protective effects of CTRP3  and  studies of human sperm showed that the protective effects of CTRP3 on sperm viability and motility were abrogated by a specific inhibitor of SIRT1. Thus, our results demonstrated that CTRP3 expression protected against HFD-induced spermatogenic deficiency through the SIRT1/ER stress pathway.© 2018 The Author(s).

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient oleic variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient  variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I , 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II , and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and obesity. We believe that the food of herbivores should contain  in the amounts that hepatocytes can esterify into oleic very low density lipoproteins and cells can internalize as ligand oleic by apoЕ/В-100 endocytosis without formation of low density lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30109329>Microfluidic-enabled quantitative measurements of insulin release dynamics from single islets of Langerhans in response to 5- hydroxy stearic .</a></h2><p>Proper release of insulin from pancreatic islets of Langerhans is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis. For full efficacy, both the pattern and the amount of hormone release are critical. It is therefore important to understand how insulin levels are secreted from single islets in both a quantitative fashion and in a manner that resolves temporal dynamics. In this study, we describe a microfluidic analytical system that can both quantitatively monitor insulin secretion from single islets while simultaneously maintaining high temporal sampling to resolve dynamics of release. We have applied this system to determine the acute and chronic effects of a recently-identified lipid, 5- hydroxy stearic  (5-PAHSA), which is a member of the fatty  hydroxy fatty  class of lipids that are upregulated in healthy individuals. Chronic incubation (48 h) with 5-PAHSA significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in murine islets compared to chronic incubation without the lipid or in the presence of  (PA). The studies were continued in human islets from both healthy donors and donors diagnosed with type 2  (T2DM). Total amounts of GSIS were not only augmented in islets that were chronically incubated with 5-PAHSA, but the dynamic insulin release profiles also improved as noted by more pronounced insulin oscillations. With this quantitative microfluidic system, we have corroborated the anti-diabetic effects of 5-PAHSA by demonstrating improved islet function after chronic incubation with this lipid via improved oscillatory dynamics along with higher basal and peak release rates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100480>Antioxidant and antidiabetic activity of blackberry after gastrointestinal digestion and human gut microbiota fermentation.</a></h2><p>Blackberry fruit contains high levels of polyphenols particularly anthocyanins which contribute to its biological activities. Bioavailability of polyphenols especially anthocyanins is generally low, it has been proposed that metabolites from polyphenol biotransformation under colonic fermentation are components that exert health benefits. In this study, blackberry was subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and gut microbiota fermentation at different time intervals (0-48 h) to study the changes in bioactive components, its antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Phenolic compounds, during digestion and fermentation were also analysed. Gut metabolites of blackberry significantly increased the glucose consumption and glycogen content in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, gut metabolites ameliorated high glucose plus -induced ROS overproduction, mitochondrial membrane collapse, and glutathione depletion in HepG2 cells. The mechanism of antidiabetic activity of blackberry was via its potent antioxidant activity. Therefore, our results suggest that blackberry could be recommended as a functional food due to potential antioxidant and antidiabetic activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Quercetin or crude extract's effect on insulin secretion was investigated. ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 were detected by Western blot analysis, and fluo-3 AM was used to detect intracellular Ca. The anti-apoptosis effect of quercetin or crude extract on MIN-6 cells was investigated by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis. Activation of caspases and expression of Bcl-2 and BAX were tested by Western blot analysis. In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by JC-1 probe. Moreover, in vivo activity was also tested in db/db mice.A quercetin level of >10 μmol/L could induce insulin secretion. Intracellular Ca and ERK1/2 were involved in the signaling pathway of quercetin-induced insulin secretion. We also observed that quercetin could inhibit -induced cell apoptosis via suppressing the activation of caspase-3, -9, -12; increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/BAX and reversing the impaired mitochondrial membrane potential. Crude extract's effect on insulin secretion was similar to that of pure extracted quercetin, while it possessed higher anti-apoptosis activity. Additionally, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, plasma insulin level, hepatic triglyceride, hepatic glycogen and the pathological histology of both pancreatic islet and liver in db/db mice were significantly improved by the administration of the extracted quercetin.Our study indicated that quercetin extracted from the flowers of  exerted excellent properties in islet protection and amelioration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123414>Downregulation of MALAT1 alleviates saturated fatty -induced myocardial inflammatory injury via the miR-26a/HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB axis.</a></h2><p> The increased level of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) is found in patients with , obesity, and other metabolic disorders. SFAs can induce lipotoxic damage to cardiomyocytes, but the mechanism is unclear. The long noncoding RNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) acts as a key regulator in  (PA)-induced hepatic steatosis, but its role in PA-induced myocardial lipotoxic injury is still unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the role and underlying mechanism of MALAT1 in PA-induced myocardial lipotoxic injury.  MALAT1 expression in PA-treated human cardiomyocytes (AC16 cells) was detected by RT-qPCR. The effect of MALAT1 on PA-induced myocardial injury was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) assays. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The activities of cytokines and nuclear factor (NF)-κB were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The interaction between MALAT1 and miR-26a was evaluated by a luciferase reporter assay and RT-qPCR. The regulatory effects of MALAT1 on high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blotting.  MALAT1 was significantly upregulated in cardiomyocytes after PA treatment. Knockdown of MALAT1 increased the viability of PA-treated cardiomyocytes, decreased apoptosis, and reduced the levels of LDH, CK-MB, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Moreover, we found that MALAT1 specifically binds to miR-26a and observed a reciprocal negative regulatory relationship between these factors. We further found that the downregulation of MALAT1 represses HMGB1 expression, thereby inhibiting the activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response. These repressive effects were rescued by an miR-26a inhibitor.  We demonstrate that MALAT1 is induced by SFAs and its downregulation alleviates SFA-induced myocardial inflammatory injury via the miR-26a/HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB axis. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism underlying myocardial lipotoxic injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149020>High-density lipoprotein ameliorates -induced lipotoxicity and oxidative dysfunction in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells via ROS suppression.</a></h2><p>High levels circulating saturated fatty acids are associated with , obesity and hyperlipidemia. In heart, the accumulation of saturated fatty acids has been determined to play a role in the development of heart failure and diabetic cardiomyopathy. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been reported to possess key atheroprotective biological properties, including cellular cholesterol efflux capacity, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to test whether HDL could protect  (PA)-induced cardiomyocyte injury and explore the possible mechanisms.H9c2 cells were pretreated with HDL (50-100 μg/ml) for 2 h followed by PA (0.5 mM) for indicated time period. Our results showed that HDL inhibited PA-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, HDL rescued PA-induced ROS generation and the phosphorylation of JNK which in turn activated NF-κB-mediated inflammatory proteins expressions. We also found that PA impaired the balance of BCL family proteins, destabilized mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered subsequent cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase 3. These detrimental effects were ameliorated by HDL treatment.PA-induced ROS accumulation and results in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation.

Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

Nutrient excess, through overconsumption of a Western or high-fat diet, exposes the hypothalamus to high levels of free fatty acids, which induces neuroinflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and dysregulation of neuropeptide synthesis. Furthermore, exposure to a high-fat diet also disrupts normal circadian rhythms, and conversely, clock gene knockout models have symptoms of metabolic disorders. While whole brain/animal studies have provided phenotypic end points and important clues to the genes involved, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the intracellular pathways and neuron-specific components that ultimately control circadian rhythms and energy homeostasis. Because of its complexity and heterogeneous nature, containing a diverse mix cell types, it is difficult to dissect the critical hypothalamic components involved in these processes. Of significance, we have the capacity to study these individual components using an extensive collection of both embryonic- and adult-derived, immortalized hypothalamic neuronal cell lines from rodents. These defined neuronal cell lines have been used to examine the impact of nutrient excess, such as palmitate, on circadian rhythms and neuroendocrine signaling pathways, as well as changes in vital neuropeptides, leading to the development of neuronal inflammation; the role of proinflammatory molecules in this process; and ultimately, restoration of normal signaling, clock gene expression, and neuropeptide synthesis in disrupted states by beneficial anti-inflammatory compounds in defined hypothalamic neurons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463517>Neuroprotective effects of vitamin D on high fat diet- and -induced enteric neuronal loss in mice.</a></h2><p>The role of vitamin D in obesity and  is debated. Obese and/or diabetic patients have elevated levels of free fatty acids, increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal symptoms and are suggested to have altered vitamin D balance. The enteric nervous system is pivotal in regulating gastrointestinal activity and high fat diet (HFD) has been shown to cause loss of enteric neurons in ileum and colon. This study investigates the effect of vitamin D on HFD- and -induced enteric neuronal loss in vivo and in vitro.Mice were fed either a normal diet (ND) or HFD supplemented with varying levels of vitamin D (from 0x to 20x normal vitamin D level) for 19 weeks. Ileum and colon were analyzed for neuronal numbers and remodeling. Primary cultures of myenteric neurons from mouse small intestine were treated with  (4x10M) and/or 1α,25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (VD, 10- 10M) with or without modulators of lipid metabolism and VD pathways. Cultures were analyzed by immunocyto- and histochemical methods.Vitamin D supplementation had no effect on enteric neuronal survival in the ND group. HFD caused substantial loss of myenteric neurons in ileum and colon. Vitamin D supplementation between 0-2x normal had no effect on HFD-induced neuronal loss. Supplementation with 20x normal, prevented the HFD-induced neuronal loss. In vitro supplementation of VD prevented the -induced neuronal loss. The VD receptor (VDR) was not identified in enteric neurons. Enteric glia expressed the alternative VD receptor, protein disulphide isomerase family A member 3 (PDIA3), but PDIA3 was not found to mediate the VD response in vitro. Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and immune neutralization of isocitrate lyase prevented the VD mediated neuroprotection to  exposure.Results show that VD protect enteric neurons against HFD and  induced neuronal loss. The mechanism behind is suggested to be through activation of PPARγ leading to improved neuronal peroxisome function and metabolism of neuronal lipid intermediates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197979>Protective potential of klotho protein on diabetic retinopathy: Evidence from clinical and in vitro studies.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to observe the relationship between serum α-klotho (KL) protein level and diabetic retinopathy (DR), and to further examine the effects of KL protein on apoptosis induced by  (PA) in human retinal endothelial cells.A total of 17 healthy people and 60 type 2  patients were included. According to the results from fundus fluorescein angiography, the  patients were divided into three subgroups: without DR, non-proliferative DR and proliferative DR. Serum KL level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro, human retinal endothelial cells were exposed to PA with or without KL protein. Apoptosis rates were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. Apoptotic-related protein expressions were detected by western blotting analysis.Serum KL level was lower in  patients than that in healthy participants (P = 0.007), and was gradually decreased among the without DR, non-proliferative DR and proliferative DR subgroups (P = 0.045). A logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for the other confounding factors, serum KL level was independently and negatively related with DR (P = 0.049). Furthermore, the increased apoptosis rates induced by PA were inhibited with the addition of KL protein. Consistently, KL protein reversed the expression levels of the increased pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the decreased anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 induced by PA. However, the anti-apoptotic effect of KL protein was attenuated by LY294002 through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-serine∕threonine kinase pathway.The data suggested that KL protein was probably a potential protective factor against retinopathy in type 2  patients.© 2019 The Authors.

The present study was aimed to determine whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) by surplus free fatty acids (FA) in hyperlipidemic condition, has a positive feedback regulation over FAO and ketogenic enzymes controlling lipotoxicity and cardiac apoptosis.8 weeks old C57BL/6 wild type (WT) or PPAR-γ-/- mice were challenged with 16 weeks 60% HFD to induce obesity mediated type 2  (T2DM) and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Treatment course was followed by echocardiographic measurements, glycemic and lipid profiling, immunoblot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of PPAR-γ and following mitochondrial metabolic enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), mitochondrial β- hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4). In vivo model was translated in vitro, with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) treated with PPAR-γ agonist/antagonist and PPAR-γ overexpression adenovirus in presence of  (PA). Apoptosis was determined in vivo from left ventricular heart by TUNEL assay and immunoblot analysis.We found exaggerated circulating ketone bodies production and expressions of the related mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4 in HFD-induced diabetic hearts and in PA-treated NRCM. As a mechanistic approach we found HFD mediated activation of PPAR-γ is associated with the above-mentioned mitochondrial enzymes. HFD-fed PPAR-γ-/-mice display decreased hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia associated with increased insulin responsiveness as compared to HFD-fed WT mice PPAR-γ-/-HFD mice demonstrated a more robust functional recovery after  induction, as well as significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function.PPAR-γ has been described previously to regulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. The present study suggests for the first time that increased PPAR-γ expression by HFD is responsible for cardiac dysfunction via upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4.

This study investigated the signalling pathway(s) responsible for the insulinotropic effect of the hydrolysate obtained from lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) seed extracts utilizing BRIN-BD11 β-cells. The extract was treated with digestive enzymes to give a hydrolysate rich in biomolecules ≤7 kDa. Cells exhibited hydrolysate induced dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and enhanced intracellular Ca and glucose metabolism. The stimulatory effect of the hydrolysate was potentiated by depolarizing concentrations of KCl and was blocked by inhibitors of the ATP sensitive K channel, Gα protein, phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC). These findings reveal a novel mechanism for lupin hydrolysate stimulated insulin secretion via Gα mediated signal transduction (Gα/PLC/PKC) in the β-cells.

Hypothetically, impaired MetFlex-lip in skeletal muscle induces accumulation of lipid metabolites that interfere with insulin signaling. Our aim was to compare MetFlex-lip during exercise in subjects with low (Low_IS) vs. high (High_IS) insulin sensitivity. Twenty healthy men were designated as Low_IS or High_IS on the basis of the median of the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index. Groups had similar age, body mass index, and maximum oxygen uptake (V̇o). Subjects cycled at 50% V̇o until expending 650 kcal. Adaptation in lipid oxidation was calculated as the drop in respiratory quotient (RQ) at the end of exercise vs. the maximum RQ (ΔRQ). Lipid availability was calculated as the increase in circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) at the end of exercise vs. the minimum NEFA (ΔNEFA). ΔRQ as a function of ΔNEFA was used to determine MetFlex-lip. On average, RQ and circulating NEFA changed similarly in both groups. However, ΔRQ correlated with ΔNEFA in High_IS ( r = -0.83, P < 0.01) but not in Low_IS ( r = -0.25, P = 0.48) subjects. Thus the slope of the ΔRQ vs. ΔNEFA relationship was steeper in High_IS vs. Low_IS subjects (-0.139 ± 0.03 vs. -0.025 ± 0.03 RQ·mmol·l, respectively; P < 0.05), with similar intercepts. We conclude that in subjects with High_IS lipid-to-carbohydrate oxidation ratio adapts to the increased circulating NEFA availability during exercise. Such MetFlex-lip appears impaired in subjects with Low_IS. Whether a cause-effect relationship exists between impaired MetFlex-lip and low insulin sensitivity remains to be determined.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30523046>GPR120 protects lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction through regulation of PDX1 expression and inhibition of islet inflammation.</a></h2><p>G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) has been shown to act as an omega-3 unsaturated fatty  sensor and is involved in insulin secretion. However, the underlying mechanism in pancreatic β cells remains unclear. To explore the potential link between GPR120 and β-cell function, its agonists docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and GSK137647A were used in  (PA)-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, coupled with GPR120 knockdown (KD) in MIN6 cells and GPR120 knockout (KO) mice to identify the underlying signaling pathways.  and  treatments of MIN6 cells and islets isolated from wild-type (WT) mice with DHA and GSK137647A restored pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) expression levels and β-cell function via inhibiting PA-induced elevation of proinflammatory chemokines and activation of nuclear factor κB, c-Jun amino (N)-terminal kinases1/2 and p38MAPK signaling pathways. On the contrary, these GPR120 agonism-mediated protective effects were abolished in GPR120 KD cells and islets isolated from GPR120 KO mice. Furthermore, GPR120 KO mice displayed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance relative to WT littermates, and β-cell functional related genes were decreased while inflammation was exacerbated in islets with increased macrophages in pancreas from GPR120 KO mice. DHA and GSK137647A supplementation ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as improved  expression and islet inflammation in diet-induced obese WT mice, but not in GPR120 KO mice.

This study was aimed to investigate whether  would stimulate EV release from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Human and rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2 and NRK-52E, were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA-conjugated  (PA), and BSA-conjugated oleic  (OA) for 24-48 h. The EVs released into conditioned media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA). According to NTA, the size distribution of EVs was 30-150 nm with similar mode sizes in all experimental groups. Moreover, BSA-induced EV release was significantly enhanced in the presence of PA, whereas EV release was not altered by the addition of OA. In NRK-52E cells, PA-enhanced EV release was associated with an induction of cell apoptosis reflected by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein by Western blot and Annexin V positive cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of lipid-induced EVs by recipient renal proximal tubular cells. Collectively, our results indicate that PA stimulates EV release from cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, extended characterization of lipid-induced EVs may constitute new signaling paradigms contributing to chronic kidney disease pathology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301829>Invited review: Sphingolipid biology in the dairy cow: The emerging role of ceramide.</a></h2><p>The physiological control of lactation through coordinated adaptations is of fundamental importance for mammalian neonatal life. The putative actions of reduced insulin sensitivity and responsiveness and enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis spare glucose for the mammary synthesis of milk. However, severe insulin antagonism and body fat mobilization may jeopardize hepatic health and lactation in dairy cattle. Interestingly, lipolysis- and dietary-derived fatty acids may impair insulin sensitivity in cows. The mechanisms are undefined yet have major implications for the development of postpartum fatty liver disease. In nonruminants, the sphingolipid ceramide is a potent mediator of saturated fat-induced insulin resistance that defines in part the mechanisms of type 2  and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In ruminants including the lactating dairy cow, the functions of ceramide had remained virtually undescribed. Through a series of hypothesis-centered studies, ceramide has emerged as a potential antagonist of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization by adipose and skeletal muscle tissues in dairy cattle. Importantly, bovine data suggest that the ability of ceramide to inhibit insulin action likely depends on the lipolysis-dependent hepatic synthesis and secretion of ceramide during early lactation. Although these mechanisms appear to fade as lactation advances beyond peak milk production, early evidence suggests that  feeding is a means to augment ceramide supply. Herein, we review a body of work that focuses on sphingolipid biology and the role of ceramide in the dairy cow within the framework of hepatic and fatty  metabolism, insulin function, and lactation. The potential involvement of ceramide within the endocrine control of lactation is also considered.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Alprostadil (Prostaglandin E1, PGE1) had protective effects on renal function. However, it is unknown whether PGE1 inhibited insulin resistance in renal tubule epithelial cells via autophagy, which plays a protective role in DN against insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was induced by  (PA) in human HK-2 cells, shown as the decrease of insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), glucose uptake and enhanced phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1(IRS-1) at site serine 307 (pIRS-1ser307) and downregulated expression of IRS-1. Along with less abundance of p62, autophagy markers LC3B and Beclin-1 significantly increased in HK-2 cells exposed to PA. Such abnormal changes were significantly reversed by PGE1, which mimicked the role of autophagy gene 7 small interfering RNA (ATG7 siRNA). Furthermore, PGE1 promoted the protein expression of autophagy-related fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21), which alleviated insulin resistance. Results from western blotting and immunohistochemistry indicated that PGE1 remarkably restored autophagy, insulin resistance and the FGF21 expression in rat kidney of type 2  (T2DM).

In addition to regulating glucose metabolism, they also alter lipid metabolism. Due to the clear association between  and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-oleic  and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA.

We have reported that  (PA), a saturated fatty , robustly amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling to upregulate proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages. We also reported that the increased production of ceramide (CER) via sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis and CER de novo synthesis plays a key role in the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on proinflammatory gene expression. However, it remains unclear if n-3 PUFAs are capable of antagonizing the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on gene expression and CER production. In this study, we employed the above macrophage culture system and lipidomical analysis to assess the effect of n-3 PUFAs on proinflammatory gene expression and CER production stimulated by LPS and PA. Results showed that DHA strongly inhibited the synergistic effect of LPS and PA on proinflammatory gene expression by targeting nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB)-dependent gene transcription. Results also showed that DHA inhibited the cooperative effect of LPS and PA on CER production by targeting CER de novo synthesis, but not SM hydrolysis. Furthermore, results showed that myriocin, a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, strongly inhibited both LPS-PA-stimulated CER synthesis and proinflammatory gene expression, indicating that CER synthesis is associated with proinflammatory gene expression and that inhibition of CER synthesis contributes to DHA-inhibited proinflammatory gene expression. Taken together, this study demonstrates that DHA antagonizes the boosting effect of PA on LPS signaling on proinflammatory gene expression by targeting both NFκB-dependent transcription and CER de novo synthesis in macrophages.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31118974>Salvianolic  B Attenuates Apoptosis of HUVEC Cells Treated with High Glucose or High Fat via Sirt1 Activation.</a></h2><p>High glucose and high fat are important inducements for the development and progression of diabetic cardiopathy.

However, the effect of SAB on diabetic cardiopathy is not clear. The aim of study was to investigate the effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of SAB on diabetic cardiopathy in vitro model. The human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells were treated with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) or high fat (, PA, 0.75 mM) in the presence or absence of SAB (100, 200, and 400 mg/L) and incubated for 24 h. We found that HG or PA induced apoptosis of HUVEC cells, while treatment with SAB inhibited the apoptosis. We also found that SAB reversed HG- or PA-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis cell cytokines production, and expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). Moreover, SAB increased HG- or PA-induced expression of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- (NAD-) dependent histone deacetylase. Exposure of HUVEC cells to Ex527 (Sirt1 inhibitor) suppressed the effect of SAB on acetyl-p53 and procaspase-3 expressions.

We assessed associations between diabetogenic groups and plasma FAs in multivariate multinomial regressions (with Group 3 as the reference).Overall, 7.0% of study participants were in Group 1; 33.3% were in Group 2. Plasma concentrations of several individual FAs, including even-chain saturated FAs (SFAs; myristic, , stearic acids) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs; cis-vaccenic, oleic acids), were respectively associated with greater odds of Groups 1 and 2 status, adjusting for covariates. Higher concentrations of SFA and MUFA subgroups (highest compared with lowest quartile) were associated with increased odds of Group 2 status [SFAs adjusted OR (aOR): 1.51 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.18); MUFAs aOR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.85)].

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse  (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty  analogue.

Delta-6-, delta-9-, and stearoyl-CoA-desaturase activities were associated with decreased GT, and delta-5-desaturase activities with increased GT. In a subgroup of women at high risk of , low LA and high  levels were seen in those that developed T2D, with no differences in other FAs or metabolic measurements. Results suggest that proportions of LA and  are of particular interest in the transition from GDM to T2D. Interconversions between individual FAs regulated by desaturases appear to be relevant to glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709706>Argirein alleviates vascular endothelial insulin resistance through suppressing the activation of Nox4-dependent O production in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance in endothelial cells contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease in type 2  (T2DM). Therefore, there are great potential clinical implications in developing pharmacological interventions targeting endothelial insulin resistance. Our previous studies indicated that argirein which was developed by combining rhein with L-arginine by a hydrogen bond, could substantially relieved stress related exacerbation of cardiac failure and alleviated cardiac dysfunction in T2DM, which was associated with suppressing NADPH oxidase activity. However, it is unclear whether argirein treatment attenuates the vascular lesion and dysfunction in T2DM and its underlying mechanisms.The rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were used to treat with  (PA), a most common saturated free fatty , which could induce insulin resistance. It was showed that argirein increased glucose uptake and glucose transporter-4 (Glut4) expression and reversed the phosphorylation of IRS-1-ser307 and AKT-ser473, consequently resulting in the increase of the production of eNOS and NO in PA-induced RAECs. We further found that argirein blocked the Nox4-dependent superoxide (O) generation, which regulated glucose metabolism in RAECs during PA stimulation. In vitro, argirein increased the release of endothelial NO to relieve the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and insulin, and restored the expression of Nox4 and pIRS-1-ser307 in the aorta endothelium of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats following an injection of streptozocin (STZ).These results suggested that argirein could improve endothelial insulin resistance which was attributed to inhibiting Nox4-dependent redox signaling in RAECs. These studies thus revealed the novel effect of argirein to prevent the vascular complication in T2DM.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We undertook metabolomic and lipidomic phenotyping of a cohort of heart failure (HF) patients and utilized Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) to identify associations to CPET and HFBio test performance (peak oxygen consumption (Peak VO2), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), exercise duration, and minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO2 slope), as well as the established HF biomarkers of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-galactoside-binding protein (galectin-3), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)). A cohort of 49 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, predominantly males African American, presenting a high frequency of , hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were used in the study. MRA revealed that metabolic models for VE/VCO2 and Peak VO2 were the most fitted models, and the highest predictors' coefficients were from Acylcarnitine C18:2, , citric , asparagine, and 3-hydroxybutiric . Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) used predictors to identify the most relevant metabolic pathways associated to the study, aminoacyl-tRNA and amino  biosynthesis, amino  metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) found associations of our findings with pre-existing biological knowledge from studies of human plasma metabolism as brain dysfunction and enzyme deficiencies associated with lactic acidosis. Our results indicate a profile of oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and metabolic syndrome coupled with mitochondria dysfunction in patients with HF tests poor performance. The insights resulting from this study coincides with what has previously been discussed in existing literature thereby supporting the validity of our findings while at the same time characterizing the metabolic underpinning of CPET and HFBio.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496314>Increased triacylglycerol - Fatty  substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells exposed to eicosapentaenoic .</a></h2><p>It has previously been shown that pretreatment of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) promoted increased uptake of fatty acids and increased triacylglycerol accumulation, compared to pretreatment with oleic  (OA) and  (PA). The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty  metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled oleic  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral lipid metabolic process" and "Regulation of lipid storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556735>Blood Fatty  Profiles: New Biomarkers for Cardiometabolic Disease Risk.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) profiles in different blood compartments are reflections of both diet and metabolism, and some FA levels are related to disease risk.Perhaps the most studied FA-disease relationship is between long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite null results from recent large omega-3 FA supplementation trials, new research continues to support past studies showing that blood levels of EPA + DHA are inversely related to risk for total mortality and fatal CVD events. But blood levels of other FAs may also be useful markers of risk for a variety of diseases. The essential omega-6 FA linoleic  is inversely associated with risk for developing type 2  (T2D), whereas risk for T2D is directly related to biomarkers of de novo lipogenesis ( and palmitoleic acids). Levels of industrially produced trans FAs have been linked to higher risk for CVD. Thus, blood levels of several individual FAs are emerging as modifiable biomarkers for risk of major chronic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930005>-Induced Long Noncoding RNA Dnm3os Regulates Macrophage Functions and Inflammation via Nuclear Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Objective- Macrophages play key roles in inflammation and diabetic vascular complications. Emerging evidence implicates long noncoding RNAs in inflammation, but their role in macrophage dysfunction associated with inflammatory diabetic complications is unclear and was therefore investigated in this study. Approach and Results- RNA-sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that a long noncoding RNA Dnm3os (dynamin 3 opposite strand) is upregulated in bone marrow-derived macrophages from type 2 diabetic db/db mice, diet-induced insulin-resistant mice, and diabetic ApoE mice, as well as in monocytes from type 2 diabetic patients relative to controls. Diabetic conditions (high glucose and ) induced Dnm3os in mouse and human macrophages. Promoter reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that diabetic conditions induce Dnm3os via NF-κB activation. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative PCRs of subcellular fractions demonstrated nuclear localization and chromatin enrichment of Dnm3os in macrophages. Stable overexpression of Dnm3os in macrophages altered global histone modifications and upregulated inflammation and immune response genes and phagocytosis. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dnm3os attenuated these responses. RNA pull-down assays with macrophage nuclear lysates identified nucleolin and ILF-2 (interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2) as protein binding partners of Dnm3os, which was further confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization immunofluorescence. Furthermore, nucleolin levels were decreased in diabetic conditions, and its knockdown enhanced Dnm3os-induced inflammatory gene expression and histone H3K9-acetylation at their promoters. Conclusions- These results demonstrate novel mechanisms involving upregulation of long noncoding RNA Dnm3os, disruption of its interaction with nucleolin, and epigenetic modifications at target genes that promote macrophage inflammatory phenotype in . The data could lead to long noncoding RNA-based therapies for inflammatory  complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30261289>Involvement of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in the development of non-alcoholic steatosis and steatohepatitis in mice and humans.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity are important risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is involved in the development of IR and obesity in vivo. However, its possible contribution to NAFLD and/or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of its role on IR or fat mass accretion has not been explored. Here, we used wild-type (WT) or GRK2 hemizygous (GRK2±) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) as a model of NASH independent of adiposity and IR. GRK2± mice were protected from HFD-induced NAFLD. Moreover, MCD feeding caused an increased in triglyceride content and liver-to-body weight ratio in WT mice, features that were attenuated in GRK2± mice. According to their NAFLD activity score, MCD-fed GRK2± mice were diagnosed with simple steatosis and not overt NASH. They also showed reduced expression of lipogenic and lipid-uptake markers and less signs of inflammation in the liver. GRK2± mice preserved hepatic protective mechanisms as enhanced autophagy and mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis, together with reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. GRK2 protein was increased in MCD-fed WT but not in GRK2± mice, and enhanced GRK2 expression potentiated -triggered lipid accumulation in human hepatocytes directly relating GRK2 levels to steatosis. GRK2 protein and mRNA levels were increased in human liver biopsies from simple steatosis or NASH patients in two different human cohorts. Our results describe a functional relationship between GRK2 levels and hepatic lipid accumulation and implicate GRK2 in the establishment and/or development of NASH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with  type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in .

This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-320 (miR-320) in the development of ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The adipose tissue expression levels of miR-320 and ERs markers (GRP78, GRP94, Derlin-1 and CHOP) and the serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, NF-κB and IL-6) in obese patients were evaluated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The correlation of miR-320 with genes involved in ERs and inflammation was analyzed. The effects of miR-320 on ERs and inflammation were explored using mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were pretreated with  (PA).ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were all upregulated in obese patients. Adipose tissue miR-320 expression was also increased in obese patients, and had positive correlations with the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines. After PA treatment, the levels of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines were elevated significantly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, miR-320 expression was increased in the cells under ERs status. The upregulation of miR-320 could enhance the expression of ERs markers and inflammatory cytokines, but the downregulation of miR-320 resulted in the opposite results.The data of this study indicate that miR-320 expression is upregulated in ERs status, and the downregulation of miR-320 ameliorates ERs and the inflammatory response in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We consider that the approaches to decrease miR-320 expression may be novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768267>Type 2  Promotes Cell Centrosome Amplification via AKT-ROS-Dependent Signalling of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ.</a></h2><p>Type 2  is associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage which can cause centrosome amplification. Thus, the study investigated centrosome amplification in type 2  and the underlying mechanisms.Centrosome numbers in human peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects and patients with type 2  were compared to access the association between type 2  and centrosome amplification. Colon cancer cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the centrosome amplification triggered by high glucose, insulin and . Western blot analysis was used to quantify the level of protein and protein phosphorylation. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to detect centrosomes. ROS was quantified using flow cytometry technique. Transcriptpmic profiling was performed using Illumina HiSeqTM500 platform.We found that centrosome amplification was increased PBMC from the type 2 diabetic patients, which correlated with the levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c. High glucose, insulin and , alone or in combinations, induced ROS production and centrosome amplification. Together, they increased AKT activation as well as the expression, binding and centrosome translation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ. Results from further analyses showed that AKT-ROS-dependent upregulations of expression, binding and centrosome translocation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ was the molecular pathway underlying the centrosome amplification in vitro triggered by high glucose, insulin and . Moreover, the key in vitro molecular signalling events activated by high glucose, insulin and  were verified in PBMC from the patients with type 2 .Our results show that type 2  promotes cell centrosome amplification, and suggest that the diabetic pathophysiological factors-activated AKT-ROS-dependent signalling of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ is the underlying molecular mechanism.© 2018 The Author(s).

It is expressed by endothelial cells, but surprisingly shows negligible glutamine-synthesizing activity in these cells at physiological glutamine levels. Here we show in mice that genetic deletion of Glul in endothelial cells impairs vessel sprouting during vascular development, whereas pharmacological blockade of glutamine synthetase suppresses angiogenesis in ocular and inflammatory skin disease while only minimally affecting healthy adult quiescent endothelial cells. This relies on the inhibition of endothelial cell migration but not proliferation. Mechanistically we show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells GLUL knockdown reduces membrane localization and activation of the GTPase RHOJ while activating other Rho GTPases and Rho kinase, thereby inducing actin stress fibres and impeding endothelial cell motility. Inhibition of Rho kinase rescues the defect in endothelial cell migration that is induced by GLUL knockdown. Notably, glutamine synthetase palmitoylates itself and interacts with RHOJ to sustain RHOJ palmitoylation, membrane localization and activation. These findings reveal that, in addition to the known formation of glutamine, the enzyme glutamine synthetase shows unknown activity in endothelial cell migration during pathological angiogenesis through RHOJ palmitoylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005715>Rare ginsenosides ameliorate lipid overload-induced myocardial insulin resistance via modulating metabolic flexibility.</a></h2><p>Rare ginsenosides are found in ginseng and notoginseng, two medicinal plants widely used in China for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 . However, their pharmacological studies regarding myocardial fuel metabolism and insulin signaling are not clear.To explore the effect of a rare ginsenoside-standardized extract (RGSE), derived from steamed notoginseng, on cardiac fuel metabolism and insulin signaling.We used  (PA) to treat H9c2 cells in vitro and high fat diet (HFD) to mice to induce insulin resistance in vivo.In vitro, differentiated H9c2 cells were pretreated with RGSE, metformin, mildronate or dichloroacetate (DCA) and stimulated with PA. In vivo, mice were fed with HFD and received RGSE, metformin or DCA for 6 weeks. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), glucose uptake and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured by fluorescence labeling. Other assessments including oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were also performed.RGSE prevented PA-induced decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) expression, and ameliorated insulin-mediated glucose uptake and utilization in H9c2 cells. Metformin and mildronate exhibited similar effects. In vivo, RGSE counteracted HFD-induced increase in myocardial expression of p-PDH and CPT1 and ameliorated cardiac insulin signaling. Metformin and DCA also showed beneficial effects. Further study showed that RGSE decreased OCR and mitochondrial complex I activity in PA-treated H9c2 cells, reduced ROS production and relieved mitochondrial oxidative stress, thus decreased serine phosphorylation in IRS-1.RGSE ameliorated myocardial insulin sensitivity under conditions of lipid overload, which was tightly associated with the decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress via modulating glucose and fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2018.

It is widely accepted that apoptosis of the pancreatic beta cell is an important cause for the induction of hyperglycemia and high levels of free fatty acids (FFAs), also called lipotoxicity associated with pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Lipotoxicity has been proven to be an important pathogenic factor of . However, until now, the mechanism of FFA-induced lipotoxicity in INS-1 cells has not been fully understood. Current anti-diabetic drugs that protect islet cells are often toxic to healthy cells, resulting in negative side effects. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify more effective and safer anti-diabetic agents to protect pancreatic islet cells. Rubusoside (RUB) is a major ingredient in the leaves of Rubus suavissimus S. Lee, which decreases blood glucose levels by protecting pancreatic islet cells. However, the exact mechanism of this effect is unknown. In this study, metabolomics experiments based on UPLC-Q/TOF MS characterized a total of 15 metabolites as potential biomarkers associated with lipotoxicity induced by  in INS-1 cells. According to the metabolic pathway analysis, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and glycerophospholipid metabolism were recognized as the most influenced metabolic pathways associated with lipotoxicity. Unexpectedly, deviations of 14 metabolites in lipotoxic INS-1 cells were regulated by RUB, suggesting synergistic mediation of the abnormal metabolic pathways. The metabolomics strategy based on UPLC/Q-TOF MS analysis provides a new insight into the mechanisms of lipotoxicity induced by  and the anti-lipotoxic activity of RUB in INS-1 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29792849>The role and mechanism of K3.1 channels in human monocyte migration induced by .</a></h2><p>Monocyte migration into diseased tissues contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases. Intermediate-conductance Ca-activated K (K3.1) channels play an important role in cell migration. However, the role of K3.1 channels in mediating monocyte migration induced by  (PA) is still unclear. Using cultured THP-1 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects, we investigated the role and signaling mechanisms of K3.1 channels in mediating the migration induced by PA. Using methods of Western blotting analysis, RNA interference, cell migration assay and ELISA, we found that PA-treated monocytes exhibited increment of the protein levels of K3.1 channel and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the effects were reversed by co-incubation of PA with anti-TLR2/4 antibodies or by specific inhibitors of p38-MAPK, or NF-κB. In addition, PA increased monocyte migration, which was abolished by a specific K3.1 channel blocker, TRAM-34, or K3.1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The expression and secretion of MCP-1 induced by PA was also similarly prevented by TRAM-34 and K3.1 siRNA. These results demonstrate for the first time that PA upregulates K3.1 channels through TLR2/4, p38-MAPK and NF-κB pathway to promote the expression of MCP-1, and then induce the trans-endothelial migration of monocytes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is not known if insecticide exposure can contribute to NAFLD. Thus, the goal of the current study was to determine if insecticide exposures can exacerbate the physiological conditions of NAFLD by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The effects of 12 insecticides on triglycerides (TG) accumulation were tested using  (PA)-induced HepG2 hepatoma steatosis model. Results showed that among tested insecticides, permethrin and ivermectin significant interacted with  to potentiate (permethrin) or decrease (ivermectin) TG accumulation. Further study showed that permethrin significantly promoted fatty  synthesis, while suppressed lipid oxidation-related genes only under steatosis conditions. In comparison, ivermectin inhibited lipogenesis-related genes and promoted farnesoid X receptor, which upregulates fatty  oxidation. Results in this study suggested that hepatic lipid metabolism may be more susceptible to insecticide exposure in the presence of excessive fatty acids, which can be associated with the development of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Monolayer cultures of early diabetic MDSCs were incubated 4 days in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum + or - aged OZ or lean Zucker serum from non-diabetic lean Zucker rats (0.5-5%) or with soluble  (PA) (0.5-2 mM), cholesterol (CHOL) (50-400 mg/dL), or glucose (10-25 mM).Fat infiltration was estimated by Oil red O, apoptosis by TUNEL, protein expression by Western blots, and gene-GTS and microRNA (miR)-GTS were determined in these stem cells' RNA.Aged OZ serum caused fat infiltration, apoptosis, myostatin overexpression, and impaired differentiation. Some of these changes, and also a proliferation decrease occurred with PA and CHOL. The gene-GTS changes by OZ serum did not resemble the in vivo changes, but some occurred with PA and CHOL. The miR-GTS changes by OZ serum, PA, and CHOL resembled most of the in vivo changes. Hyperglycemia did not replicate most alterations.MDSCs may be damaged in long-term UC-T2D/obese patients and be ineffective in autologous human stem cell therapy, which may be prevented by excluding the damaged MDSCs.The in vitro test of MDSCs is innovative and fast to define dyslipidemic factors inducing stem cell damage, its mechanism, prevention, and counteraction. Confirmation is required in other T2D/obesity rat models and stem cells (including human), as well as miR-GTS biomarker validation as a stem cell damage biomarker.Serum from long-term UC-T2D/obese rats or dyslipidemic factors induces a noxious phenotype and miR-GTS on normal MDSCs, which may lead in vivo to the repair inefficacy of late diabetic MDSCs. This suggests that autograft therapy with MDSCs in long-term UT-T2D obese patients may be ineffective, albeit this may be predictable by prior stem cell miR-GTS tests.

Such data are lacking among pregnant women.We prospectively investigated objectively measured individual and subclasses of plasma phospholipid SFAs throughout pregnancy in relation to cardiometabolic markers and gestational  (GDM) risk.Within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort of 2802 singleton pregnancies, 107 GDM cases were ascertained via medical record review and matched to 214 non-GDM controls on age, race/ethnicity, and gestational week (GW) at blood collection. Individual plasma phospholipid SFA concentrations were repeatedly measured throughout pregnancy at GWs 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 and also grouped into subclasses of even- or odd-chain SFAs.From GW 10, even-chain SFA concentrations were significantly higher among women who later developed GDM, whereas odd-chain SFAs were significantly lower among GDM cases compared with controls. At GWs 10-14, the SFA  (16:0) was positively associated with impaired insulin resistance and cardiometabolic markers and the risk of GDM [adjusted OR comparing the highest with the lowest quartile (aORQ4-Q1): 4.76; 95% CI: 1.72, 13.10; P-trend = 0.001].

Similar results were observed at GWs 15-26.The study provided one of the first lines of evidence suggesting that circulating concentrations of SFAs varying by SFA chain length, as early as GWs 10-14, were significantly and differentially associated with subsequent risk of GDM. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing objectively measured, individual, and subclasses of SFAs to investigate their distinct biological and pathophysiologic roles in glucose homeostasis and cardiometabolic outcomes.

Ablation of SIRT5 enhances the systemic succinylation and malonylation of mitochondrial proteins, including various metabolic enzymes; however, its function in pancreatic β cells has not yet been clarified. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SIRT5 overexpression on glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in β cell lines. Full-length SIRT5, which preferentially targeted to mitochondria and partially to the nucleus and cytoplasm, was overexpressed in NIT-1 cells. Chronic exposure to excess palmitate and glucose (High-PA-G) induced apoptosis and suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells. SIRT5 overexpression significantly alleviated apoptosis under the High-PA-G condition, accompanied by suppressed Caspase 3 activity and reduced malondialdehyde levels. SIRT5 overexpression also improved β cell secretory capacity in response to glucose under the High-PA-G condition, suggesting its protective role in β cell function. Furthermore, SIRT5 overexpression reversed the decreasing trend of anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression under High-PA-G condition.

This study aims to investigate whether a common pathway exists in the ERS induced by various chemicals, including high levels of glucose and palmitate in INS-1-3 cells.ERS in INS-1-3 cells was induced by exposure cells to thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM) or  (PA) +high glucose (HG). Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling technique was used to detect differentially expressed genes. The profile of gene expression was detected by gene oncology (GO) function and pathway enrichment analysis. Nkx6.1 over-expression was established in INS-1-3 cell lines by lentivirus infection to revert the inhibition of Nkx6.1 expression found in the situation of ERS. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the expression changes of key genes. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. INS-1-3 cell function was measured by glucose stimulated insulin secretion test(GSIS).As compared to control, DGE demonstrated that there were 135, 57 and 74 differentially expressed genes in TM, TG and HG+PA groups, respectively. Those differentially expressed genes were enriched to ERS, antigen processing and presentation, protein export pathways, and interestingly, the maturity onset  of the young (MODY) pathway. Nkx6.1 is one of common down-regulated gene in MODY signaling pathway among TM, TG and HG+PA groups. Over-expression of Nkx6.1 ameliorated glucolipotoxicity induced apoptosis rate by 45.4%, and increased proliferation by 40.9%. At the same time, GSIS increased by 1.82 folds.MODY pathway genes expression was changed in the state of ERS.

Both dimerization and lipidation effectively prolong the half-life of peptides in vivo by increasing hydrodynamic size and facilitating physical interactions with serum albumin. Here, we report a novel method to discover long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogues by rational design based on Xenopus GLP-1 through a combined dimerization and lipidization strategy. On the basis of our previous structure analysis of Xenopus GLP-1,  and a C-terminal Cys were firstly introduced into two Xenopus GLP-1 analogues (1 and 2), and the afforded 3 and 4 were further reacted with bis-maleimide amine to afford two dimeric lipidated Xenopus GLP-1 analogues (5 and 6). The in vitro and in vivo biological activities of 5 and 6 were significantly improved as compared with their monomers. Moreover, the selected compound 6 showed greater hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activities than liraglutide even when the dose of 6 was reduced to half in db/db mice. Pharmacokinetic test revealed that 6 had a ∼ 3-fold longer half-life than liraglutide in Kunming mice and SD rats, and the longer half-life of 6 led to excellent long-acting hypoglycemic effects as confirmed by two different pharmacological methods conducted on db/db mice. Finally, a 7 weeks chronic study conducted on db/db mice demonstrated the better therapeutic efficacies of 6 on glucose tolerance normalization, HbA1c reduction and pancreas islets protection than liraglutide. The present research showed that combined dimerization and lipidization is effective when applied to Xenopus GLP-1 analogue to develop novel GLP-1 analogue for the treatment of type 2 . In addition, the promising preclinical data of 6 suggested the therapeutic potential of 6 as a novel anti-diabetic agent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Researchers have demonstrated the importance of impaired cardiac insulin signaling in this process. Insulin resistance (IR) is an important predictor of DCM. Previous studies examining the dynamic changes in autophagy during IR have yielded inconsistent results. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes in autophagy and apoptosis in the rat H9c2 cardiomyocyte IR model. H9c2 cells were treated with 500 M  (PA) for 24 hours, resulting in the induction of IR. To examine autophagy, monodansylcadaverine staining, GFP-LC3 puncta confocal observation, and Western blot analysis of LC3I-to-LC3II conversion were used. Results of these studies showed that autophagic  vesicles increased in numbers during the first 24 hours and then decreased by 36 hours after PA treatment. Western blot analysis showed that treatment of H9c2 cells with 500 M PA for 24 hours decreased the expression of Atg12-Atg5, Atg16L1, Atg3, and PI3Kp85. Annexin V/PI flow cytometry revealed that PA exposure for 24 hours increased the rate of apoptosis. Together, this study demonstrates that PA induces IR in H9c2 cells and that this process is accompanied by excessive activation of autophagy and increases in apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384366>Shengmai San Alleviates Diabetic Cardiomyopathy Through Improvement of Mitochondrial Lipid Metabolic Disorder.</a></h2><p>Shengmai San (SMS), prepared from Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Schisandra chinensisin, has been widely used to treat ischemic disease. In this study, we investigated whether SMS may exert a beneficial effect in diabetic cardiomyopathy through improvement of mitochondrial lipid metabolism.A leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model was utilized, and lean age-matched C57BLKS mice served as non-diabetic controls. Glucose and lipid profiles, myocardial structure, dimension, and function, and heart weight to tibial length ratio were determined. Myocardial ultrastructural morphology was observed with transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex were assessed using western blotting and microplate assay kits. We also observed cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, OXPHOS complex activity, and cellular ATP level in -stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Changes in the sirtuin (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) pathway and mitochondrial uncoupling signaling were assessed using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR.Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by distinct myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS at a dose of 3 g/kg body weight contributed to a recovery of -induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS administration led to an effective restoration of mitochondrial structure and function both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, SMS markedly enhanced SIRT1 and p-AMPKα protein levels and decreased the expression of acetylated-PGC-1α and uncoupling protein 2 protein. SMS also restored the depletion of NRF1 and TFAM levels in diabetic hearts and H9C2 cardiomyocytes.The results indicate that SMS may alleviate -induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction by improving mitochondrial lipid metabolism.© 2018 The Author(s).

Clarification of the molecular mechanism of metabolic disorder and exploration of drug targets are crucial for the treatment of T2DM.  We examined miR-125a-5p levels in -induced AML12 cells and the livers of type 2 diabetic rats and mice, and then validated its target gene. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, the effects of miR-125a-5p via targeting of STAT3 on regulating glycolipid metabolism were further illustrated  and .  We found that miR-125a-5p was significantly decreased in the livers of diabetic mice and rats, and STAT3 was identified as the target gene of miR-125a-5p. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p in C57BL/6 mice decreased STAT3 level and downregulated the expression levels of p-STAT3 and SOCS3. Consequently, SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis pathway was inhibited, and PI3K/AKT pathway was activated. Moreover, silencing of miR-125a-5p significantly increased the expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3 and SOCS3, thus activating SREBP-1c pathway and suppressing PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and decreased liver glycogen appeared in C57BL/6 mice. In -induced AML12 cells, miR-125a-5p mimic markedly increased glucose consumption and uptake and decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets by regulating STAT3 signaling pathway. Consistently, miR-125a-5p overexpression obviously inhibited STAT3 expression in diabetic KK-Ay mice, thereby decreasing blood glucose and lipid levels, increasing hepatic glycogen content, and decreasing accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets in diabetic mice. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-125a-5p in KK-Ay mice aggravated glycolipid metabolism dysfunction through regulating STAT3.  Our results confirmed that miR-125a-5p should be considered as a regulator of glycolipid metabolism in T2DM, which can inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis and elevate glycogen synthesis by targeting STAT3.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621707>Plasma lipidomic signatures of spontaneous obese rhesus monkeys.</a></h2><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2  (T2D). The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to metabolic diseases are still less understandable.Previously, we screened a group of spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys. Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and arachidonic  (C20:4), FFA especially  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys. Conversely, the levels of most PE species were obviously reduced in the obese monkeys.Collectively, our work suggests that lipids such as FFA C16:0 and 16:0-LPA may be potential candidates for the diagnosis and study of obesity-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396212>Impact of Brain Fatty  Signaling on Peripheral Insulin Action in Mice.</a></h2><p>Glucose homeostasis and energy balance are under control by peripheral and brain processes. Especially insulin signaling in the brain seems to impact whole body glucose homeostasis and interacts with fatty  signaling. In humans circulating saturated fatty acids are negatively associated with brain insulin action while animal studies suggest both positive and negative interactions of fatty acids and insulin brain action. This apparent discrepancy might reflect a difference between acute and chronic fatty  signaling. To address this question we investigated the acute effect of an intracerebroventricular  administration on peripheral glucose homeostasis. We developed and implemented a method for simultaneous monitoring of brain activity and peripheral insulin action in freely moving mice by combining radiotelemetry electrocorticography (ECoG) and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps. This method allowed gaining insight in the early kinetics of brain fatty  signaling and its contemporaneous effect on liver function , which, to our knowledge, has not been assessed so far in mice.Insulin-induced brain activity in the theta and beta band was decreased by acute intracerebroventricular application of . Peripherally it amplified insulin action as demonstrated by a significant inhibition of endogenous glucose production and increased glucose infusion rate. Moreover, our results further revealed that the brain effect of peripheral insulin is modulated by  load in the brain.These findings suggest that insulin action is amplified in the periphery and attenuated in the brain by acute  application. Thus, our results indicate that acute  signaling in the brain may be different from chronic effects.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31186419>Sonodynamic therapy inhibits palmitate-induced beta cell dysfunction via PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy.</a></h2><p>In type 2  (T2DM), the overload of glucose and lipids can promote oxidative stress and inflammatory responses and contribute to the failure of beta cells. However, therapies that can modulate the function of beta cells and thus prevent their failure have not been well explored. In this study, beta cell injury model was established with  (PA) to simulate the lipotoxicity (high-fat diet) found in T2DM. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a novel physicochemical treatment, was applied to treat injured beta cells. We found that SDT had specific effects on mitochondria and induced transient large amount of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in beta cells. SDT also improved the morphology and function of abnormal mitochondria, inhibited inflammatory response and reduced beta cell dysfunction. The improvement of mitochondria was mediated by PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Additionally, SDT rescued the transcription of PINK1 mRNA which was blocked by PA treatment, thus providing abundant PINK1 for mitophagy. Moreover, SDT also increased insulin secretion from beta cells. The protective effects of SDT were abrogated when mitophagy was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). In summary, SDT potently inhibits lipotoxicity-induced beta cell failure via PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, providing theoretical guidance for T2DM treatment in aspects of islet protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572687>Theaflavins Improve Insulin Sensitivity through Regulating Mitochondrial Biosynthesis in -Induced HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Theaflavins, the characteristic and bioactive polyphenols in black tea, possess the potential improving effects on insulin resistance-associated metabolic abnormalities, including obesity and type 2 . However, the related molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this research, we investigated the protective effects of theaflavins against insulin resistance in HepG2 cells induced by . Theaflavins significantly increased glucose uptake of insulin-resistant cells at noncytotoxic doses. This activity was mediated by upregulating the total and membrane bound glucose transporter 4 protein expressions, increasing the phosphor-Akt (Ser473) level, and decreasing the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307. Moreover, theaflavins were found to enhance the mitochondrial DNA copy number, down-regulate the PGC-1β mRNA level and increase the PRC mRNA expression. Mdivi-1, a selective mitochondrial division inhibitor, could attenuate TFs-induced promotion of glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Taken together, these results suggested that theaflavins could improve hepatocellular insulin resistance induced by free fatty acids, at least partly through promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. Theaflavins are promising functional food ingredients and medicines for improving insulin resistance-related disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30411491>Nutritionally Derived Metabolic Cues Typical of the Obese Microenvironment Increase Cholesterol Efflux Capacity of Adipose Tissue Macrophages.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol retention within plasma membranes of macrophages is associated with increased inflammatory signaling. Cholesterol efflux via the transporters ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles is a critical mechanism to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Little is known about the impact of the obese microenvironment on cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of macrophages. In this study, the CEC of obese-derived primary adipose-tissue macrophages (ATM) is evaluated and the in vivo microenvironment is modeled in vitro to determine mechanisms underlying modulated CEC.F4/80 ATM are labeled with  H-cholesterol ex vivo, and CEC and ABCA1/ABCG1 protein levels are determined. Total, ABCA1-dependent, and ABCA1-independent CECs are determined in J774 macrophages polarized to M1 (LPS&IFNγ), M2 (IL-4&IL-13), or metabolic phenotypes (glucose, insulin, and ).Obese ATM exhibit enhanced CEC and ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression compared to lean ATM. In contrast, ABCA1-CEC is suppressed from M1 polarized macrophages compared to untreated in vitro, by activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Incubation of macrophages in vitro in high glucose augments cAMP-induced ABCA1 protein expression and ABCA1-CEC.These novel findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity of macrophages to respond to their environment with specific modulation of ABCA1 depending on whether classical pro-inflammatory or metabolic cues predominate.© 2018 The Authors.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational  (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, , stearic, arachidonic, dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect insulin resistance and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response. Modifying the composition of FFAs may help in reducing the risk of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30998947>Lipotoxicity reduces β cell survival through islet stellate cell activation regulated by lipid metabolism-related molecules.</a></h2><p>Islet stellate cells (ISCs) activation is mainly associated with islet fibrosis, which contributes to the progression of type 2 . However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood.In order to investigate this process the current study examined ectopic fat accumulation in rats with high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Levels of lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation and islet function were assessed via intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests, and immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipid metabolism- and ISC activation-related markers was evaluated in cultured ISCs treated with  (PA) using quantitative PCR and western blotting. We also overexpressed sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c in ISCs by lentiviral transduction, and assessed the effects on insulin release in co-cultures with isolated rat islets.HFD increased body weight and ectopic fat accumulation in pancreatic islets. Lipotoxicity caused progressive glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, upregulated α-smooth muscle actin, and stimulated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Lipotoxicity reduced the expression of lipid metabolism-related molecules in ISCs treated with PA, especially SREBP-1c. Overexpression of SREBP-1c in ISCs improved islet viability and insulin secretion in co-cultures.These results indicate that lipotoxicity-induced ISC activation alters islet function via regulation of lipid metabolism, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting activated ISC may be an effective treatment for prevention of ISC activation-associated islet dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary management and caloric restriction are beneficial in reducing the complications of diabesity. Studies have suggested that increased availability of energy metabolites like glucose and saturated fatty acids induces metabolic, oxidative, and mitochondrial stress, accompanied by inflammation that may lead to chronic complications in . In the present study, we used human hepatoma HepG2 cells to investigate the effects of high glucose (25 mM) and high  (up to 0.3 mM) on metabolic-, inflammatory-, and redox-stress-associated alterations in these cells. Our results showed increased lipid, protein, and DNA damage, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Glucolipotoxicity increased ROS production and redox stress appeared to alter mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetics. Our results also demonstrate the enhanced ability of cytochrome P450s-dependent drug metabolism and antioxidant adaptation in HepG2 cells treated with , which was further augmented with high glucose. Altered NF-kB/AMPK/mTOR-dependent cell signaling and inflammatory (IL6/TNF-α) responses were also observed.

The present study investigated the effect of miR‑29a on  (PA)‑induced lipid metabolism dysfunction and insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes via overexpressing or silencing of miR‑29a expression. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were cultured, differentiated and transfected with miR‑29a or miR‑29a inhibitor lentiviral with or without subsequent  (PA) treatment. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis were performed to assess the mRNA and protein levels of related genes, respectively. PA treatment increased the expression of miR‑29a in a time‑ and dose‑ dependent manner. miR‑29a silencing improved insulin‑induced glucose uptake and increased glucose transporter‑4 (GLUT4) transportation to the plasma membrane by upregulating its target peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Furthermore, it was observed that miR‑29a regulated the expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform, mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)2, UCP3, long chain specific acyl‑CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial and fatty  transport protein 2. The results confirmed that silencing miR‑29a induced a decrease in glucose transport and affected lipid metabolism in PA‑treated C2C12 cells, and therefore may be involved in insulin resistance by targeting PPARδ in skeletal muscle. Therefore, the inhibition of miR‑29a may be a potential novel strategy for treating insulin resistance and type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103897>HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture system ameliorates osteogenesis and angiogenesis against glucolipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Osteoporosis and vascular lesions induced by glucolipotoxicity are common complications of  (DM). In order to deal with these complications, we designed a new therapeutic strategy, i.e. coculture system containing human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). Two in vitro coculture models, transwell and mixed cocultures, were proposed for 7 days with variable HAMSCs: HBMSCs ratios. Then, supernatant from each coculture was used to reverse the deficiency of HBMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired by high glucose and  (GP). We found that glucolipotoxicity caused by GP remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as induced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in HBMSCs. Meanwhile, glucolipotoxicity suppressed cell proliferation, tube formation capacity and angiogenic potential of HUVECs. Though, HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture system reduced HBMSCs dysfunction by antioxidant properties and promoted angiogenesis in HUVECs. The mixed HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture at the optimal ratio of 3/1 showed significantly greater cell proliferation, antioxidant properties, osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation than HBMSCs or HUVECs alone. In conclusion, the current coculture system of HAMSCs/HBMSCs can be a potential therapeutic material for advancing bone and vascular regeneration against DM-induced glucolipotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral fat cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food.

The BRICHOS domain of integral membrane protein 2B (Bri2), a transmembrane protein expressed in several peripheral tissues and in the brain, has recently been shown to prevent fibril formation and toxicity of Aβ42, an amyloid-forming peptide in Alzheimer disease. In this study, we demonstrate expression of Bri2 in human islets and in the human beta-cell line EndoC-βH1. Bri2 colocalizes with IAPP intracellularly and is present in amyloid deposits in patients with type 2 . The BRICHOS domain of Bri2 effectively inhibits fibril formation in vitro and instead redirects IAPP into formation of amorphous aggregates. Reduction of endogenous Bri2 in EndoC-βH1 cells with siRNA increases sensitivity to metabolic stress leading to cell death while a concomitant overexpression of Bri2 BRICHOS is protective. Also, coexpression of IAPP and Bri2 BRICHOS in lateral ventral neurons of  results in an increased cell survival. IAPP is considered to be the most amyloidogenic peptide known, and described findings identify Bri2, or in particular its BRICHOS domain, as an important potential endogenous inhibitor of IAPP aggregation and toxicity, with the potential to be a possible target for the treatment of type 2 .Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

It not only affects the attachment of connective tissue but also causes loss of alveolar bone. Hence, there is an urgent need to find an effective treatment for DM-induced bone deficiency. This study aimed to investigate the effects of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of DM-induced human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). High glucose and  (GP) were used to mimic DM-induced glucolipotoxicity. The proliferation levels were measured using flow cytometry. Alkaline phosphatase activity substrate assays, Alizarin red S staining, and western blotting were used to investigate osteogenic differentiation. Oxidative stress was measured by assaying the levels of reactive oxygen species. This study found that glucolipotoxicity caused by GP remarkably inhibited cell proliferation and osteogenesis, and upregulated the oxidative stress level in HBMSCs. However, HAMSCs attenuated HBMSC dysfunction through antioxidant activity by influencing p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion.

Previous studies indicate that PA accumulates in the hypothalamus following consumption of HFDs; in addition, HFDs consumption inhibits autophagy and reduces insulin sensitivity. Whether malfunction of autophagy specifically in hypothalamic neurons decreases insulin sensitivity remains unknown. PA does activate the Free Fatty  Receptor 1 (FFAR1), also known as G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40); however, whether FFAR1 mediates the effects of PA on hypothalamic autophagy and insulin sensitivity has not been shown. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to PA inhibits the autophagic flux and reduces insulin sensitivity in a cellular model of hypothalamic neurons (N43/5 cells). Furthermore, we show that inhibition of autophagy and the autophagic flux reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. Interestingly, the inhibition of the autophagic flux, and the reduction in insulin sensitivity are prevented by pharmacological inhibition of FFAR1. Our findings show that dysregulation of autophagy reduces insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. In addition, our data suggest FFAR1 mediates the ability of PA to inhibit autophagic flux and reduce insulin sensitivity in hypothalamic neuronal cells. These results reveal a novel cellular mechanism linking PA-rich diets to decreased insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and suggest that hypothalamic autophagy might represent a target for future T2DM therapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30879166>Activator protein-1 and caspase 8 mediate p38α MAPK-dependent cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by .</a></h2><p>Lipoapoptosis of cardiomyocytes may underlie diabetic cardiomyopathy. Numerous forms of cardiomyopathies share a common end-pathway in which apoptotic loss of cardiomyocytes is mediated by p38α mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). Although we have previously shown that  (PA), a saturated fatty  (SFA) elevated in plasma of type 2  and morbid obesity, induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via p38α MAPK-dependent signaling, the downstream cascade events that cause cell death remain unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms involved in -induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte line (AC16 cells) exposed to high physiological levels of PA for 16 h showed enhanced transcription and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun subunits of AP-1 and transcription of caspase 8. When AC16 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA specific against p38α MAPK (si-p38α) for 24 or 48 h, the amplified phosphorylation of c-fos was dose-dependently attenuated, and procaspase 8 was dose-dependently reduced. With translational knockdown of c-fos, PA-induced apoptosis was diminished. Inhibition of caspase 8 for 24 h reduced apoptosis in PA-treated cardiomyocytes. These findings provide evidence for induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to high SFA by a novel pathway requiring activation of c-fos/AP-1 and caspase 8. These results demonstrate how elevated plasma SFA may lead to continual and cumulative loss of cardiomyocytes and potentially contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121855>Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Stimulates Pancreatic Islet Autophagy via Inhibition of AMPK-mTOR Signaling.</a></h2><p>Islet autophagy plays a role in glucose/lipid metabolism in type 2 . Meanwhile, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has been found to regulate insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Whether FGF21 induces islet autophagy, remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to explore the physiological roles and signaling pathways involved in FGF21-stimulated islet autophagy under glucolipotoxic conditions.C57/BL6J mice were fed a standard diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, and islets were isolated from normal and  knockout (KO) mice. Isolated islets and INS-1E cells were exposed to normal and high-concentration glucose and  with/without FGF21 or AMPK inhibitor compound C. Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry/transmission electron microscopy were performed for the expression of targeted genes/proteins.HFD-treated mice showed increases in fasting plasma glucose, body weight and impaired glucose tolerance; islet protein expression of FGF21 was induced after HFD treatment. Protein expression levels of FGF21 and LC3-II (autophagy marker) were induced in mouse islets treated with high concentrations of  and glucose, while phosphorylation of AMPK was reduced, compared with controls. In addition, induction of LC3-II protein expression was reduced in islets isolated from  KO mice. Furthermore, exogenous administration of FGF21 diminished phosphorylation of AMPK and stimulated protein expression of LC3-II. Consistently, compound C significantly induced increased expression of LC3-II protein.Our data indicate that glucolipotoxicity-induced FGF21 activation mediates islet autophagy via AMPK inhibition, and further consolidate the evidence for the FGF21/analog being a pharmacotherapeutic target for obesity and its related T2DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980919>Myristic  specifically stabilizes diacylglycerol kinase δ protein in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Decreased levels of the δ isozyme of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) in skeletal muscle attenuate glucose uptake and, consequently, are critical for the pathogenesis of type 2 . We recently found that free myristic  (14:0), but not free  (16:0), increased the DGKδ protein levels and enhanced glucose uptake in C2C12 myotube cells. However, it has been unclear how myristic  regulates the level of DGKδ2 protein. In the present study, we characterized the myristic -dependent increase of DGKδ protein. A cycloheximide chase assay demonstrated that myristic , but not , markedly stabilized DGKδ protein. Moreover, other DGK isozymes, DGKη and ζ, as well as glucose uptake-related proteins, such as protein kinase C (PKC) α, PKCζ, Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, failed to be stabilized by myristic . Furthermore, DGKδ was not stabilized in cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells, pancreas carcinoma cells or neuroblastoma cells, and only a moderate stabilizing effect was observed in embryonic kidney cells. A proteasome inhibitor and a lysosome inhibitor, MG132 and chloroquine, respectively, partly inhibited DGKδ degradation, suggesting that myristic  prevents, at least in part, the degradation of DGKδ by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Overall, these results strongly suggest that myristic  attenuates DGKδ protein degradation in skeletal muscle cells and that this attenuation is fatty -, protein- and cell line-specific. These new findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of type 2 .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Meteorin-like protein (METRNL), a novel secreted protein homologous to the neurotrophin Metrn, is induced after exercise in the skeletal muscle. Herein, we investigated the effects of METRNL on lipid-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Treatment with METRNL suppressed inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation, inhibitory κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and MCP-1). METRNL treatment also attenuated the impaired insulin response both in palmitate-treated differentiated C2C12 cells and the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, METRNL administration rescued glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced body weight gain in mice; however, METRNL did not affect calorie intake. METRNL treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and PPARδ expression both in differentiated C2C12 cells and mouse skeletal muscle. siRNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and PPARδ abrogated the suppressive effects of METRNL on palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Moreover, METRNL augmented the mRNA expression of fatty  oxidation-associated genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3). siRNAs for AMPK and PPARδ reversed these changes.

Using a combination of lipidomics in WAT, quantitative trait locus mapping, and correlation analyses in rat BXH/HXB recombinant inbred strains, as well as response to oxidative stress in murine models, we elucidated the potential pathway of biosynthesis of several FAHFAs. Comprehensive analysis of WAT samples identified ∼160 regioisomers, documenting the complexity of this lipid class. The linkage analysis highlighted several members of the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 ()-mediated antioxidant defense system (), lipid-handling proteins (), and the family of flavin containing monooxygenases () as the positional candidate genes. Transgenic expression of  and deletion of  genes resulted in reduction of  ester of 9-hydroxystearic  (9-PAHSA) and 11-PAHSA levels, while oxidative stress induced by an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis increased PAHSA levels nonspecifically. Our results indicate that the synthesis of FAHFAs via carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein-driven de novo lipogenesis depends on the adaptive antioxidant system and suggest that FAHFAs may link activity of this system with insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.© 2018 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29378126>Multiplex Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging-Based Biosensor for Human Pancreatic Islets Hormones Quantification.</a></h2><p> arises from secretory defects in vascularized micro-organs known as the islets of Langerhans. Recent studies indicated that furthering our understanding of the paracrine effect of somatostatin on glucose-induced insulin secretion could represent a novel therapeutic avenue for . While many research groups are interested in insulin and glucagon secretion, few are particularly focused on studying the paracrine interaction in islets' cells, and none on monitoring a secretory fingerprint that contemplates more than two hormones. Surface plasmon resonance imaging can achieve high-throughput and multiplexed biomolecule quantification, making it an ideal candidate for detection of multiple islet's secretion products if arrays of hormones can be properly implemented on the sensing surface. In this study, we introduced a multiplex surface plasmon resonance imaging-based biosensor for simultaneous quantification of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Performing this multiplex biosensing of hormones was mainly the result of the design of an antifouling sensing surface comprised by a mixed self-assembly monolayer of CHO-PEG-SH and 16-mercaptohexadecanoic , which allowed it to operate in a complex matrix such as an islet secretome. The limit of detection in multiplex mode was 1 nM for insulin, 4 nM for glucagon, and 246 nM for somatostatin with a total analysis time of 21 min per point, making our approach the first reporting a label-free and multiplex measurement of such a combination of human hormones.

Previous studies demonstrated that GLP-1 activates SAD-A, a member of the AMPK family, to regulate glucose-stimulated secretion (GSIS), but the underlying mechanisms of SAD-A regulation of β-cell functions remain poorly understood. Here, we propose that activation of SAD-A by GLP-1 promotes the phosphorylation of Bad S155, which in turn positively affects GSIS and β-cell survival. Bad therefore appears to be a downstream molecule of a SAD-A pathway that mediates the GLP-1-triggered reduction in β-cell failure. Knockdown of endogenous SAD-A expression significantly exacerbated in vitro β-cell dysfunction under lipotoxic conditions and promoted lipotoxicity-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of SAD-A inhibited β-cell apoptosis. SAD-A silencing increased ER stress and inhibited the autophagic flux, which contributed to β-cell apoptosis. Thus, SAD-A appears to function as a downstream molecule of GLP-1 signaling that results in Bad S155 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation might therefore be involved in the GLP-1-linked protection against β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It is a major threat to patients with . Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has aroused considerable interest as a novel therapeutic target for  because it stimulates insulin secretion. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of the GLP-1 analog exendin-4 and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin on cardiac lipid metabolism in diabetic mice (DM). The increased myocardial lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cardiac remodeling and dysfunction induced in DM by low streptozotocin doses and high-fat diets were significantly reversed by exendin-4 and saxagliptin treatments for 8 weeks. We found that exendin-4 inhibited abnormal activation of the (PPARα)-CD36 pathway by stimulating protein kinase A (PKA) but suppressing the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway in DM hearts,  (PA)-treated rat h9c2 cardiomyocytes (CMs), and isolated adult mouse CMs. Cardioprotection in DM mediated by exendin-4 was abolished by combination therapy with the PPARα agonist wy-14643 but mimicked by PPARα gene deficiency. Therefore, the PPARα pathway accounted for the effects of exendin-4. This conclusion was confirmed in cardiac-restricted overexpression of PPARα mediated by adeno-associated virus serotype-9 containing a cardiac troponin T promoter. Our results provide the first direct evidence that GLP-1 protects cardiac function by inhibiting the ROCK/PPARα pathway, thereby ameliorating lipotoxicity in diabetic cardiomyopathy.© 2018 The Authors.

An increase in urinary albumin and albumin-bound fatty acids (FA) presents a proinflammatory environment to the proximal tubules in proteinuric kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy. This study was designed to examine if FA overload could stimulate OPN expression and cleavage in renal tubule epithelial cells. OPN gene and protein expression was examined in the kidney of Zucker diabetic (ZD) rats and cultured proximal tubular cells exposed to either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or BSA conjugated with  (PA), the most abundant saturated plasma FA. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed an upregulation of renal cortical OPN gene correlated with albuminuria and nephropathy progression in ZD rats at the age of 7-20 weeks. Immunofluorescence staining of kidney sections revealed a massive induction of OPN protein in albumin-overloaded proximal tubules of ZD rats. A significant increase in both intact and cleaved OPN proteins was further demonstrated in the diabetic kidney and urine samples, which was attenuated by antiproteinuric treatment with losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. When exposed to fatty -free BSA, NRK-52E cells exhibited an increase in protein levels of full-length and cleaved OPN. Moreover, the increase in OPN fragments was greatly enhanced in the presence of PA (250-500 µM). Together, our results support a stimulatory effect of albumin and conjugated FA on OPN expression and cleavage in renal tubule epithelial cells. Thus, besides lowering albuminuria/proteinuria, mitigating circulating FAs may be an effective intervention for preventing and slowing down the progression of nephropathy associated with obesity and type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29772372>Palmitate induces nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokine expression in zebrafish.</a></h2><p>Inflammation markers in zebrafish embryos reflect a toxic response that is common to other animal models and humans.

The expression and activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and 9 microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-7, -34a, -96, -113, -126, -145, -150, -223 and -370) were detected before and after celastrol treatment using the PA-induced HepG2 IR model.The results showed that 250 µM PA for ≥2 days was optimal for inducing IR in HepG2 cells; 600 nM celastrol significantly attenuated the PA-induced IR in HepG2 cells. The PA-induced GLUT4 and IRS1 downregulation and Ser307 phosphorylation on IRS1 was reversed by subsequent treatment with 600 nM celastrol for 6 h. We next investigated which IR-related miRNAs were possible upstream regulators of celastrol-mediated reversal of PA-induced HepG2 IR. Two miRNAs, miR-150 and -223, were significantly downregulated by PA and were re-raised by subsequent celastrol treatment; and miR-223 was upstream of miR-150. Moreover, knocking down miR-223 abolished celastrol's anti-IR effects in the PA-induced model.Collectively, our results demonstrated that celastrol reverses PA-induced IR-related alterations, in part via miR-223 in HepG2 cells.

PAHSA levels are reduced in serum and adipose tissue of insulin-resistant people and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Here, we investigated whether chronic PAHSA treatment enhances insulin sensitivity and which receptors mediate PAHSA effects. Chronic PAHSA administration in chow- and HFD-fed mice raises serum and tissue PAHSA levels ∼1.4- to 3-fold. This improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance without altering body weight. PAHSA administration in chow-fed, but not HFD-fed, mice augments insulin and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion. PAHSAs are selective agonists for GPR40, increasing Ca flux, but not intracellular cyclic AMP. Blocking GPR40 reverses improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in PAHSA-treated chow- and HFD-fed mice and directly inhibits PAHSA augmentation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets. In contrast, GLP-1 receptor blockade in PAHSA-treated chow-fed mice reduces PAHSA effects on glucose tolerance, but not on insulin sensitivity.

The p-HDAC4 level decreased with the increase in HDAC4 in the nucleus and the decrease in HDAC4 in the cytoplasm in the PA group. Treatment with Rev 20 µM suppressed gluconeogenesis and promoted HDAC4 shuttling into the cytoplasm from the nucleus. However, 100 and Rev 50 µM exerted the opposite effects. Finally, after HDAC4 knockdown, the expression levels of the key gluconeogenesis molecules, G6PC, PCK1, and FOXO1, were increased, and p-FOXO1 was decreased, indicating that gluconeogenesis was enhanced.A low concentration of Rev inhibited gluconeogenesis under insulin-resistance conditions via translocation of HDAC4 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30361530>Adipose tissue dysfunction is associated with low levels of the novel  Hydroxystearic Acids.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue dysfunction is considered an important contributor to systemic insulin resistance and Type 2  (T2D).

PAHSAs may also act locally in the adipose tissue to improve adipogenesis through a mechanism bypassing direct activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ).

Moreover, CCE inhibited the phosphorylation of Ikappa B kinase  , nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-  B), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular regulated protein kinases, p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequently suppressed the release of tumor necrosis factor-  , interleukin-1  (IL-1  ) and IL-6. CCE also inhibited IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and ameliorated insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Moreover, CCE restored serine/threonine kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and thus increased insulin-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in PA-treated HUVECs. This led to reverse insulin mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation, eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in PA-treated rat thoracic aortas. These results suggest that CCE can significantly inhibit the inflammatory response and alleviate impaired insulin signaling in the vascular endothelium by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-  B and MAPK pathways. Therefore, CCE can be considered as a potential therapeutic candidate for endothelial dysfunction associated with IR and .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29373526>The Dynamic Effects of Isosteviol on Insulin Secretion and Its Inability to Counteract the Impaired β-Cell Function during Gluco-, Lipo-, and Aminoacidotoxicity: Studies In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Isosteviol (ISV), a diterpene molecule, is an isomer of the backbone structure of a group of substances with proven antidiabetic capabilities. The aim of this study was to investigate if ISV elicits dynamic insulin release from pancreatic islets and concomitantly is able to ameliorate gluco-, lipo-, and aminoacidotoxicity in clonal β-cell line (INS-1E) in relation to cell viability and insulin secretion. Isolated mice islets placed into perifusion chambers were perifused with 3.3 mM and 16.7 mM glucose with/without 10 M ISV. INS-1E cells were incubated for 72 h with either 30 mM glucose, 1 mM palmitate or 10 mM leucine with or without 10 M ISV. Cell viability was evaluated with a Cytotoxic Fluoro-test and insulin secretion was measured in Krebs-Ringer Buffer at 3.3 mM and 16.7 mM glucose. In the presence of 3.3 mM glucose, 10 M ISV did not change basal insulin secretion from perifused islets. However, at a high glucose level of 16.7 mM, 10 M ISV elicited a 2.5-fold increase (-ISV: 109.92 ± 18.64 ng/mL vs. +ISV: 280.15 ± 34.97 ng/mL;  < 0.01). After 72 h gluco-, lipo-, or aminoacidotoxicity in INS-1E cells, ISV treatment did not significantly affect cell viability (glucotoxicity, -ISV: 19.23 ± 0.83%, +ISV: 18.41 ± 0.90%; lipotoxicity, -ISV: 70.46 ± 3.15%, +ISV: 65.38 ± 2.81%; aminoacidotoxicity: -ISV: 8.12 ± 0.63%; +ISV: 7.75 ± 0.38%, all nonsignificant). ISV did not improve impaired insulin secretion (glucotoxicity, -ISV: 52.22 ± 2.90 ng/mL, +ISV: 47.24 ± 3.61 ng/mL; lipotoxicity, -ISV: 19.94 ± 4.10 ng/mL, +ISV: 22.12 ± 3.94 ng/mL; aminoacidotoxicity: -ISV: 32.13 ± 1.00 ng/mL; +ISV: 30.61 ± 1.54 ng/mL, all nonsignificant). In conclusion, ISV acutely stimulates insulin secretion at high but not at low glucose concentrations. However, ISV did not counteract cell viability or cell dysfunction during gluco-, lipo-, or aminoacidotoxicity in INS-1E cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276628>Primary defects in lipid handling and resistance to exercise in myotubes from obese donors with and without type 2 .</a></h2><p>Several studies have shown that human primary myotubes retain the metabolic characteristic of their donors in vitro. Others and we have demonstrated a reduced lipid turnover and fat oxidation rate in myotubes derived from obese donors without and with type 2  (T2D). Because exercise is known to increase fat oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, we investigated if in vitro exercise could restore primary defects in lipid handling in myotubes of obese without and with T2D compared to lean non-diabetic donors. Primary myotubes cultures were derived from biopsies of lean, obese and T2D subjects. One single bout of long-duration exercise was mimicked in vitro by electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) for 24 h. Lipid handling was measured using radiolabeled palmitate, Metabolic gene expression by real-time qPCR, and proteins by western blot. We first show that myotubes from obese and T2D donors had increased uptake and incomplete oxidation of palmitate. This was associated with reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II, III and IV protein expression in myotubes from obese and T2D subjects. EPS stimulated palmitate oxidation in lean donors, while myotubes from obese and T2D donors were refractory to this effect. Interestingly, EPS increased total palmitate uptake in myotubes from lean donors while myotubes from T2D donors had a reduced rate of palmitate uptake into complex lipids and triacylglycerols. Novelty: • Myotubes from obese and T2D donors are characterized by primary defects in  handling. • Both obese and T2D myotubes are partially refractory to the beneficial effect of exercise on lipid handling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409165>Antagonistic interaction between Nodal and insulin modulates pancreatic β-cell proliferation and survival.</a></h2><p>Insulin signaling pathway in β-cell is essential to promote β-cells proliferation and survival, while Nodal-ALK7-Smad3 signaling involves β-cells apoptosis. We attempted to address inter-relationship between Nodal and insulin in modulating β-cell proliferation and apoptosis.Using INS-1 β-cells and isolated rat islets, we examined the effects of Nodal, insulin, or the two combined on β-cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.The β-cells under high-glucose or palmitate conditions showed significant up-regulation of Nodal expression and activation of its downstream signaling pathway resulted in increased cleaved caspase-3. Insulin treatment led to significantly attenuated Nodal-induced cell apoptotic pathway. Similar results were found in directly Nodal-treated β-cell that insulin could partially block Nodal-induced up-regulation of ALK7-Smad3-caspase-3 signaling pathways with significantly attenuated β-cell apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that insulin-induced Akt activation and downstream molecules including GSK-3β, β-catenin and ERK1/2 was significantly attenuated by the co-treatment with Nodal, resulted in decreased cell proliferation. Furthermore, Nodal decreased glucose-evoked calcium influx and played a negative role during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the β-cells. Immunocytochemistry studies showed that Nodal treatment translocated Smad3 from cytosol mostly to the nucleus; however, co-treatment with insulin significantly decreased Smad3 nuclear localization. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed a directly interaction between Smad3 and Akt, and this interaction was enhanced by co-treatment with insulin.Our data suggest that the antagonistic interaction between Nodal and insulin has a role in the regulation of β-cell mass and secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30129056>Nuciferine ameliorates hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet/streptozocin-induced diabetic mice through a PPARα/PPARγ coactivator-1α pathway.</a></h2><p>Nuciferine, an alkaloid found in Nelumbo nucifera leaves, alleviates dyslipidemia in vivo. However, whether it improves liver injury in diabetic conditions and the underlying mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of nuciferine on lipid and glucose metabolism in a murine model of Type 2  (T2DM) and to determine the underlying mechanisms of these effects.A murine model of T2DM was induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding combined with streptozocin (STZ) injections, and the diabetic mice were treated with nuciferine in their food. The underlying mechanism of the anti-steatotic effect of nuciferine was further explored in HepG2 hepatocytes cultured with . Major signalling profiles involved in fatty  oxidation were then evaluated, using Western blot, RT-qPCR and si-RNA techniques, along with immunohistochemistry.Nuciferine restored impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice. Hepatic levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL were decreased, as were the number of lipid droplets, by nuciferine treatment. Furthermore, nuciferine up-regulated β-oxidation related genes in livers of diabetic mice. Luciferase reporter cell assay showed that nuciferine directly reversed -induced inhibition of PPARα transcriptional activity. Silencing PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) expression in HepG2 cells abolished the effects of nuciferine in accelerating β-oxidation.Nuciferine improved lipid profile and attenuated hepatic steatosis in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice by activating the PPARα/PGC1α pathway. Nuciferine may be a potentially important candidate in improving hepatic steatosis and the management of T2DM.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447962>Low molecular weight fucoidan attenuates liver injury via SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α axis in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD), caused by elevated hepatic lipids, inflammation and oxidative stress, is the most common liver disease globally. Low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF), a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds, has shown strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which has not been explored in -induced NAFLD. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether LMWF protects obese diabetic db/db mice against NAFLD. Results showed LMWF administration decreased plasma level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride, as well as alleviated hepatic accumulation of triglyceride and total cholesterol in db/db mice. LMWF also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress by suppressing superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, and increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in the liver of db/db mice. Furthermore, LMWF down-regulated several pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factor, and up-regulated the anti-inflammatory adiponectin. These changes were accompanied by the activation of hepatic SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling with LMWF treatment. In addition, blocking SIRT1 or AMPK by inhibitor notably abolished LMWF-elicited protection against -induced oxidative stress and inflammation in hepatocytes. These results suggest LMWF prevents NAFLD in db/db mice by activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway, which prevents lipotoxicity-related oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, LMWF provides a potential supplementary treatment for obesity/-induced NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds that have been studied in the case of metabolic disorders treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain whether enterolactone (ENL), a commonly known phytoestrogen, may affect sphingolipid metabolism and decrease hepatic insulin resistance development in a lipid overload state.The study was conducted on HepG2 cells incubated with ENL and/or  (PA) for 16 h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of sphingolipid pathway enzymes, apoptosis and insulin signaling pathway proteins and glucose metabolism regulators were evaluated by Western Blot.In HepG2 cells, a considerable augmentation of intracellular ceramide and sphingosine concentration in ENL with PA group were indicated with simultaneous increase in extracellular ceramide concentration. The ENL treatment increased expression of selected enzymes from de novo ceramide synthesis pathway with lower expression of ceramide transfer protein. We also observed a decreased expression of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and AMPK after exposure to ENL with PA. Our research demonstrated that ENL with PA resulted in an increased expression of caspase-3.Enterolactone, in a higher fatty acids availability, led to the development of hepatic IR in HepG2 cells. This phenomenon may be the result of elevated intracellular ceramide accumulation caused by increased de novo synthesis pathway what led to enhanced apoptosis of HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains unknown if ASM regulates insulin resistance in vascular endothelial cells in type 2 . ASM down-regulation with gene silencing and selective inhibitor amitriptyline was used in the rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) treated with  (PA), a common saturated free fatty , which is thought to be the major cause of insulin resistance. It was shown that ASM down-regulation increased glucose uptake and glucose transporter-4 (Glut4) expression and reversed the phosphorylation of pIRS-1-ser307 and AKT-ser473 via ceramide, consequently resulting in the decrease of the production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and nitric oxide in PA-induced RAECs. We further found that ASM down-regulation blocked the Nox2- and Nox4-dependent superoxide (O  ) generation, which regulated glucose metabolism in RAECs during PA stimulation. In vivo, amitriptyline relieved the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and restored the level of ceramide, Nox2 and Nox4 in the aorta endothelium of high-fat diet-fed rats following an injection of streptozotocin. Taken together, these results suggest that ASM down-regulation can improve endothelial insulin resistance which is attributed to inhibiting redox signalling in RAECs. Thus, these data support the idea that ASM is a promising clinical biomarker and potential therapeutic target for diabetic vascular complication.© 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989851>Saturated fatty  combined with lipopolysaccharide stimulates a strong inflammatory response in hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) is a risk factor for NAFLD. The HFD not only increases intake of saturated fatty  (SFA) but also induces metabolic endotoxemia, an HFD-associated increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although it is known that SFA or LPS promote hepatic inflammation, a hallmark of NAFLD, it remains unclear how SFA in combination with LPS stimulates host inflammatory response in hepatocytes. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effect of SFA in combination with LPS on proinflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes. Our animal study showed that feeding low-density lipoprotein-deficient mice HFD enriched with SFA and injection of low-dose LPS cooperatively stimulated IL-6 expression in livers. To understand how SFA and LPS interact to promote IL-6 expression, our in vitro studies showed that  (PA), a major SFA, and LPS exerted synergistic effect on the expression of IL-6 in hepatocytes. Furthermore, coculture of hepatocytes with macrophages resulted in a greater IL-6 expression than culture of hepatocytes without macrophages in response to the combination of PA and LPS. Finally, we observed that LPS and PA increased ceramide production by cooperatively stimulating ceramide de novo synthesis, which played an essential role in the synergistic stimulation of proinflammatory gene expression by LPS and PA.

In contrast, insulin secretion from the islets was reduced after 7 days culture in the presence of the fatty . This study aims at identifying islet-related biological events potentially linked with the observed insulin hypersecretion and later secretory decline in these obese children and adolescents using the islet model. We analyzed protein expression data obtained from human islets exposed to elevated palmitate levels for 2 and 7 days by an improved methodology for statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins. Protein profiling of islet samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 115 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Several DEPs including sorcin were associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets after 2 days of exposure to palmitate. Similarly, several metabolic pathways including altered protein degradation, increased autophagy, altered redox condition, and hampered insulin processing were coupled to the functional impairment of islets after 7 days of culture in the presence of palmitate. Such biological events, once validated in the islets, may give rise to novel treatment strategies aiming at normalizing insulin levels in obese children with high palmitate levels, which may reduce or even prevent obesity-related type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30688006>Hsp74/14-3-3σ Complex Mediates Centrosome Amplification by High Glucose, Insulin, and .</a></h2><p>It has been reported recently that type 2  promotes centrosome amplification via 14-3-3σ/ROCK1 complex.

Co-immunoprecipitation in combination with MS analysis identified 134 proteins that interact with 14-3-3σ, which include heat shock 70 kDa protein 4 (Hsp74). Gene ontology analyses reveal that many of them are enriched in binding activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis shows that the top three enriched pathways are ribosome, carbon metabolism, and biosynthesis of amino acids. Molecular and functional investigations show that the high glucose, insulin, and  increase the expression and binding of 14-3-3σ and Hsp74 as well as centrosome amplification, all of which are inhibited by knockdown of 14-3-3σ or Hsp74. Moreover, molecular docking analysis shows that the interaction between the 14-3-3σ and the Hsp74 is mainly through hydrophobic contacts and a lesser degree ionic interactions and hydrogen bond by different amino acids residues. In conclusion, the results suggest that the experimental treatment triggers centrosome amplification via upregulations of expression and binding of 14-3-3σ and Hsp74.© 2019 The Authors.

Heart-type fatty  binding protein (H-FABP) was reported to be associated with lipid metabolism. The present study investigated whether H-FABP contributes to podocyte homeostasis. Podocytes were transfected by lentiviral vector to construct a cell line which stably overexpressed H-FABP. Small interfering RNA capable of effectively silencing H-FABP was introduced into podocytes to construct a cell line with H-FABP knockdown. Certain groups were treated with  (PA) and the fat metabolism, as well as inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were measured. PA accelerated lipid metabolism derangement, inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress in podocytes. Overexpression of H-FABP enhanced the PA-induced disequilibrium in podocytes. The mRNA and protein expression levels of acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 3 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and the protein expression levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxynonenal were upregulated in the H-FABP overexpression group, while the mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α was downregulated. Knockdown of H-FABP inhibited the PA-induced injury and lipid metabolism derangement, as well as the inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress in podocytes. These results indicated that overexpression of H-FABP enhances fatty -induced podocyte injury, while H-FABP inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of lipid metabolism-associated podocyte injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30909920>Lipopolysaccharide and  synergistically induced MCP-1 production via MAPK-meditated TLR4 signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells.</a></h2><p>Obesity increases the risk of developing . Clinical studies suggest that risk factors like  (PA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exist simultaneously in  with obesity. Combination of PA and LPS even at low concentration can induce strong inflammatory reaction. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is an important inflammatory chemokine related to insulin resistance and type II . Our previous study using PCR array revealed that LPS and PA synergistically induce MCP-1 mRNA expression in macrophage cells RAW264.7, while the protein expression of MCP-1 in this case was not investigated. Moreover, the underling mechanism in the synergistic effect of MCP-1 expression or production induced by treatment of LPS and PA combination remains unclear.Protein secretion of MCP-1 was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mRNA levels of MCP-1 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were measured by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software.LPS could increase MCP-1 transcription as well as secretion in RAW264.7, and PA amplified this effect obviously. Meanwhile, combination of LPS with PA increased TLR4 mRNA expression while LPS alone or PA alone could not, TLR4 knockdown inhibited MCP-1 transcription/secretion induced by LPS plus PA. Moreover, not NF-κB inhibitor but inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 MAPK were found to block MCP-1 generation stimulated by LPS plus PA.LPS and PA synergistically induced MCP-1 secretion in RAW264.7 macrophage cells, in which MCP-1 transcription mediated by MAPK/TLR4 signaling pathways was involved.

Using an animal model of diet-induced obesity/pre-, we evaluated the impact of a diet high in saturated fat (HFD) on O-GlcNAcylation of retinal proteins, as dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to diabetic complications and evidence supports a role in DR. Protein O-GlcNAcylation was increased in the retina of mice fed a HFD as compared to littermates receiving control chow. Similarly, O-GlcNAcylation was elevated in retinal Müller cells in culture exposed to the saturated fatty  palmitate or the ceramide analog Cer6. One potential mechanism responsible for elevated O-GlcNAcylation is increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Indeed, inhibition of the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) prevented Cer6-induced O-GlcNAcylation. Importantly, expression of the mRNA encoding GFAT2, but not GFAT1 was elevated in both the retina of mice fed a HFD and in retinal cells in culture exposed to palmitate or Cer6. Notably, expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) was increased in the retina of mice fed a HFD and NR4A1 expression was sufficient to promote GFAT2 mRNA expression and O-GlcNAcylation in retinal cells in culture. Whereas palmitate or Cer6 addition to culture medium enhanced NR4A1 and GFAT2 expression, chemical inhibition of NR4A1 transactivation repressed Cer6-induced GFAT2 mRNA expression. Overall, the results support a model wherein HFD increases retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation by promoting NR4A1-dependent GFAT2 expression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have shown that Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 3 (PAQR3) suppresses the activity of PI3K/Akt, which is an upstream pathway of FoxO1, and additionally promotes the pathological process of diabetic renal inflammatory fibrosis via activating NF-κB pathway. On this basis, it has caused us great concern whether NF-κB is involved in PAQR3 regulation of FoxO1 under insulin resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PAQR3 regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 via NF-κB pathway in  (PA)-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, thereby causing glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. We found that PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of glucokinase (GCK) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), in addition, promoted the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway increased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR which were downregulated by PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression. Taken together, in PA-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, PAQR3 might regulate the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR through NF-κB pathway, thereby regulating the glucose and lipid metabolism disorders induced by insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Once activated, it promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, increased levels of FFAs lead to lipotoxicity, inducing loss of β-cell function. FFAR1 plays a key role in the development of type 2  (T2D), and previous studies have indicated the importance of developing anti-diabetic therapies against FFAR1, although its role in the regulation of β-cell function remains unclear. The present study investigated the role of FFAR1 under lipotoxic conditions using  (PA). The rat insulinoma 1 clone 832/13 (INS-1 832/13) cell line was used as a model as it physiologically resembles native pancreatic β-cells. Key players of the insulin signaling pathway, such as mTOR, Akt, IRS-1, and the insulin receptor (INSR1β), were selected as candidates to be analyzed under lipotoxic conditions.We revealed that PA-induced lipotoxicity affected GSIS in INS-1 cells and negatively modulated the activity of both IRS-1 and Akt. Reduced phosphorylation of both IRS-1 S636/639 and Akt S473 was observed, in addition to decreased expression of both INSR1β and FFAR1. Moreover, transient knockdown of FFAR1 led to a reduction in IRS-1 mRNA expression and an increase in INSR1β mRNA. Finally, PA affected localization of FFAR1 from the cytoplasm to the perinucleus.In conclusion, our study suggests a novel regulatory involvement of FFAR1 in crosstalk with mTOR-Akt and IRS-1 signaling in β-cells under lipotoxic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384536>Regulation of microbiota-GLP1 axis by sennoside A in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h2><p>Sennoside A (SA) is a bioactive component of Chinese herbal medicines with an activity of irritant laxative, which is often used in the treatment of constipation and obesity. However, its activity remains unknown in the regulation of insulin sensitivity. In this study, the impact of SA on insulin sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved insulin sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and glucose tolerance test (GTT). SA restored plasma level of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) by 90% and mRNA expression of  by 80% in the large intestine of HFD mice. In the mechanism, SA restored the gut microbiota profile, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucosal structure in the colon. A mitochondrial stress was observed in the enterocytes of HFD mice with ATP elevation, structural damage, and complex dysfunction. The mitochondrial response was induced in enterocytes by the dietary fat as the same responses were induced by  in the cell culture. The mitochondrial response was inhibited in HFD mice by SA treatment. These data suggest that SA may restore the function of microbiota-GLP1 axis to improve glucose metabolism in the obese mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315213>Nutraceutical Potential of  in Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p> L. is a well-known fruit worldwide, and its highest production occurs in tropical and subtropical regions.

Gas chromatography was used to measure erythrocyte fatty acids at baseline. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During 13,508 person years of follow-up, 216 T2D cases were identified. Compared with the first quartile, multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of the fourth quartile were 1.20 (0.82⁻1.76;  = 0.242) for myristic  (14-carbon tail, zero double bonds; 14:0), 0.69 (0.48⁻0.99;  = 0.080) for  (16:0), 1.49 (1.02⁻2.19;  = 0.047) for stearic  (18:0), 1.46 (1.00⁻2.12;  = 0.035) for arachidic  (20:0), 1.48 (0.99⁻2.22;  = 0.061) for behenic  (22:0), and 1.08 (0.74⁻1.56;  = 0.913) for lignoceric  (24:0).

Previous clinical trials have shown that these inhibitors can alleviate endothelial dysfunction, but the mechanism of action remains unknown. How SGLT inhibitor influences the release of NO in PA-induced HUVECs has never been reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS To explore the potential effects of the endothelial-protective mechanism of phlorizin and its impact on nitric oxide (NO), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with  (PA) and then treated with phlorizin. Western blotting was performed to assess the phosphorylation of AKT, eNOS, and IRS-1. To further explore potential targets, siRNA transfection was used to demonstrate the role of SGLT1 and SGLT2. RESULTS Phlorizin suppressed the expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2, activated the PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway, increased the output of NO, and promoted the consumption of glucose in PA-induced HUVECs. Through demonstrating siRNA suppression of the expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 in PA-induced HUVECs, this study provides a new understanding of the mechanism behind SGLT1 and SGLT2. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that phlorizin ameliorates the endothelial dysfunction link with the activation of the PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway and augmentation of the release of NO, partially through suppressing the expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 in PA-induced HUVECS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618077>Secreted Wnt6 mediates -associated centrosome amplification via its receptor FZD4.</a></h2><p>We have recently published that type 2  promotes cell centrosome amplification via up-regulation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ. The study further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the -associated centrosome amplification. We found that treatment of cells with high glucose, insulin and  increased the intracellular and the extracellular protein levels of Wnt6 as well as the cellular level of β-catenin. The treatment also activated β-catenin and promoted its nuclear translocation. Treatment of cells with siRNA species for Wnt6, FZD4 or β-catenin as well as introduction of antibodies against Wnt6 or FZD4 to the cell culture medium could all attenuate the treatment-triggered centrosome amplification. Moreover, we showed that secreted Wnt6-FZD4-β-catenin was the signaling pathway which was upstream of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ. We also found that AGEs were also able to increase the cellular and extracellular levels of Wnt6, the cellular protein level of β-catenin, and centrosome amplification. Treatment of the cells with siRNA species for Wnt6 or FZD4 as well as introduction of antibodies against Wnt6 or FZD4 to the cell culture could all inhibit the AGEs-elicited centrosome amplification. In colon tissues from diabetic mice model, the protein levels of Wnt6 and 14-3-3σ were increased. In conclusion, our results showed that the pathophysiological factors in type 2 , including AGEs, were able to induce centrosome amplification. It is suggested that secreted Wnt6 binds to FZD4 to activate the canonical Wnt6 signaling pathway which is upstream of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ, which is the cell signaling pathway underlying the -associated centrosome amplification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543975>Risk of  associated with fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway is independent of insulin sensitivity and response: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS).</a></h2><p>To examine the associations of fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, specifically myristic  (14:0),  (16:0), palmitoleic  (c16:1 n-7), myristoleic  (c14:1n5), stearic  (18:0) and oleic  (c18:1 n-9), with 5-year risk of type 2 .

We studied the long-term diabetic risk in GDM offspring and evaluated the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention. Healthy offspring rats were fed standard diet (soybean oil) after weaning. GDM offspring were divided into three groups: GDM offspring (soybean oil), n-3 PUFA adequate offspring (fish oil), and n-3 PUFA deficient offspring (safflower oil), fed up to 11 months old. The diabetic risk of GDM offspring gradually increased from no change at weaning to obvious impaired glucose and insulin tolerance at 11 months old. N-3 PUFA decreased oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver of older GDM offspring. There was a differential effect of n-3 PUFA and n-6 PUFA on hepatic telomere length in GDM offspring. Non-targeted metabolomics showed that n-3 PUFA played a modulating role in the liver, in which numerous metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered when GDM offspring grew to old age. Many metabolites were related to  risk, such as α-linolenic , , ceramide, oxaloacetic , tocotrienol, tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol, andniacinamide. In summary, GDM offspring exhibited obvious  risk at old age, whereas n-3 PUFA decreased this risk.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428423>Dietary saturated fatty  type impacts obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and plasma lipidomic signatures in mice.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty  (SFA) intake is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, but scant work examines the impact of SFA type upon these outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric -derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily . Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) arachidonic  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA.

Many genetic and immunological insights into autoimmune disease pathogenesis were initially uncovered in the context of T1D and facilitated by preclinical studies using the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Recently, the study of T1D has led to the discovery of fatty  esters of hydroxyl fatty acids (FAHFAs), which are naturally occurring hybrid peptides that modulate inflammation and  pathogenesis, and a hybrid lymphocyte that expresses both B and T cell receptors.  esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs) are the most extensively studied FAHFA. In this issue of the JCI, Syed et al. have shown that PAHSAs both attenuate autoimmune responses and promote β cell survival in NOD mice.

In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms of the centrosome amplification in colon cancer HCT116 cells. Treatment of the cells with high glucose, , and insulin increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) as well as the spindle and kinetochore associated protein 1 (SKA1), knockdown of each of which resulted in the inhibition of the treatment-triggered centrosome amplification. Knockdown of PPARγ inhibited the treatment-evoked increase in the SKA1 level, whereas knockdown of SKA1 did not modify the treatment-increased PPARγ level. We found a predicted binding site for PPARγ in the promoter region of the SKA1 gene from the JASPAR database. Experimental results showed that the treatment increased the messenger RNA level of SKA1, which could be inhibited by PPARγ chemical inhibitor or small interfering RNA. Moreover, we were able to show that PPARγ could bind to the binding site in the SKA1 gene promoter, which was increased by the experimental treatment. In conclusion, it is suggested that the pathophysiological factors in type 2 , high glucose, , and insulin, induce the cell centrosome amplification through the PPARγ-SKA1 pathway, in which PPARγ increases the expression of SKA1 via directly enhancing the SKA1 gene transcription.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30132841>Peroxidase expression is decreased by palmitate in cultured podocytes but increased in podocytes of advanced diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>High levels of serum free fatty acids (FFAs) are associated with lipotoxicity and type 2 .  (PA) is the predominant circulating saturated FFA. PA induces mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H O  ) generation in cultured podocytes. To elucidate the role of PA in antioxidant defense systems in diabetic nephropathy (DN), cultured podocytes were exposed to 250 μM PA for 1-24 hr, and protein expressions of catalase, peroxiredoxins (Prxs), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were examined by western blot analysis. PA induced an early transient increase in the Prx1, Prx2, and GPx1 levels in podocytes, but not catalase. Long-term exposure of PA to podocytes significantly decreased the protein levels of Prx1, Prx2, GPx1, and catalase. Coincubation of PA-treated cells with oleic , however, restored the expression of these proteins. In advanced human diabetic glomeruli, H O generation was elevated as shown by increased fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein. Strong immunostaining for Prx1, Prx2, GPx1, and catalase was observed in the podocytes of advanced human DN, wherein transforming growth factor-β1 staining was also positive. These results suggest that podocytes are susceptible to PA-induced oxidative damage with impaired peroxidase activity and that peroxidases have futile antioxidant effects in the podocytes in the late stages of DN. Given this, PA-induced podocyte injury via inadequate peroxidase response to H O appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216387>Lipid profile changes in erythrocyte membranes of women with diagnosed GDM.</a></h2><p>Gestational  (GDM) is a glucose intolerance that begins or is first recognized during pregnancy. It is currently a growing health problem worldwide affecting from 1% to 14% of all pregnant women depending on racial and ethnic group as well as the diagnostic and screening criteria. Our preliminary study aimed at investigating the erythrocyte membrane fatty  profiles of pregnant women, in particular with diagnosed with gestational  (GDM), and with normal glucose tolerant (NGT) pregnant women as a control group. The study group comprised 43 pregnant women, 32 of whom were diagnosed with GDM according to the WHO criteria, and 11 with normal glucose tolerance. The erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were obtained according to the Folch extraction procedure. Fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) as the corresponding fatty  methyl esters (FAME). A cluster of 14 fatty acids identified contained >98% of the recognized peaks in the GC analysis. The analysis of fatty acids from erythrocytes revealed important differences between GDM and NGT women in the third trimester, and the results were correlated with biochemical data. Among the 14 measured FA representing the membrane lipidomic profile, the levels of three saturated FA (myristic, , stearic acids) tended to decrease in GDM patients, with the percentage content of stearic  significantly changed. The relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) tended to increase, in particular the oleic  and vaccenic  contents were significantly increased in erythrocyte membranes of the GDM group in comparison with the NGT group. The GDM group demonstrated higher sapienic  levels (+29%) but this change was not statistically significant. This study revealed association between an impaired cis-vaccenic  concentration in erythrocytes membrane and GDM development. No significant changes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were observed in GDM and NGT erythrocytes. We postulate, basing on the differences between the GDM and NGT lipidomic profiles, that stearic and cis-vaccenic acids can be considered as dual biomarkers of specific SFA-MUFA conversion pathway, involving the coupling of delta-9 desaturase and elongase enzymes. Our results indicate that the SFA-MUFA families may be involved in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as GDM, but the further studies are needed to confirm our hypothesis. In conclusion, the erythrocyte membranes of GDM women undergo remodeling resulting in abnormal fatty  profiles, which are reflection of the long-term status of organism and can have great impact on both the mother and her offspring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29864922>Vernonia amygdalina Delile extract inhibits the hepatic gluconeogenesis through the activation of adenosine-5'monophosph kinase.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that Vernonia amygdalina Delile(VA) presents an anti-diabetic effect, and the effect of VA on lowering glucose is formulated via suppressing the expression of the key hepatic gluconeogenesis enzyme. Therefore, we further explored the probable mechanism of VA on dismissing hepatic gluconeogenesis through the activation of adenosine-5' monophosphate kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro.We developed type 2 diabetic mice with STZ and oral administration with VA (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) once a day for 6 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted. The expression levels of AMPK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) proteins in live were evaluated by western blot. Then, we further explored the mechanism of VA on hepatic gluconeogenesis in vitro experiments. Glucose production and the expression of AMPK, PEPCK and G6Pase proteins were detected after VA treatment with the presence of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.VA reduced FBG and caused a significant improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in STZ-induced mice. VA inhibited the elevated expression of gluconeogenesis key enzymes (PEPCK and G6Pase) and up-regulated AMPK activity in liver. In  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells, VA decreased glucose production and the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase proteins, also activated AMPK pathway. The effects of VA on gluconeogenesis could be reversed by Compound C.These results reveal that VA suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis at least partially through activating the AMPK.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can significantly improve the outcome of ischemic conditions in IDDM patients and reduce vascular complications. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of HBOT on plasma fatty  (FA) composition, and expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in IDDM patients.Our study included 24 adult IDDM patients diagnosed with peripheral vascular complications. The patients were exposed to 10 sessions of 100% oxygen inhalation at 2.4 atmosphere absolute for 1 hour. Blood samples were collected at admission and after HBOT for measurement of metabolic parameters, FA composition and IGFBP-1. Measurement of plasma FA composition was determined by gas chromatography. Expression of IGFBP-1 in the serum was estimated by Western blot analysis.HBOT decreased blood levels of total cholesterol (p<0.05), triglycerides (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (p<0.05). HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs:  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05), alpha linolenic  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian  Association.

PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high-fat diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice. Moreover, chronic PAHSA treatment augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle and heart in HFD-fed mice. The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and liver. PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free fatty acids during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors. Thus, this study advances our understanding of PAHSA biology and the physiologic mechanisms by which PAHSAs exert beneficial metabolic effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389499>GCN2 deficiency ameliorates cardiac dysfunction in diabetic mice by reducing lipotoxicity and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Excessive myocardial lipid accumulation is a major feature of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Although general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) has been identified as a sensor of amino  availability, it also functions as an important regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Our previous studies have reported that GCN2 promotes pressure overload or doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction by increasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial oxidative stress. However, the impact of GCN2 on the development of DCM remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of GCN2 on DCM in type 1 and type 2  animal models. After streptozotocin (STZ) or high-fat diet (HFD) plus low-dose STZ treatments, GCN2 mice developed less cardiac dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In diabetic hearts, GCN2 deficiency attenuated the upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induction of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as the reduction of Bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of GCN2 attenuated, whereas overexpression of GCN2 exacerbated, high glucose or -induced cell death, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress and lipid accumulation in H9C2 cells. Collectively, our data provide evidence that GCN2 deficiency protects cardiac function by reducing lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and cell death. Our findings suggest that strategies to inhibit GCN2 activity in the heart may be novel approaches for DCM therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Several natural products have been reported as Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonists, functioning as lead compounds towards developing new anti-diabetic drugs due to adverse side effects of existing PPAR drugs. We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic  (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic  (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis, pharmacological characterization, and biological evaluations of these naturally occurring oxo-fatty acids (oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficient material for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciable dose-dependent activation of PPARα and -γ, with EC values in the micromolar range, and an ability to regulate important PPAR target genes in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Moreover, both 1 and 2 are able to drive adipogenesis when evaluated in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell model, but with lowered expression of adipocyte markers and reduced lipid accumulation compared to the drug rosiglitazone. This seems to be caused by a transient upregulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression.

The levels of insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were determined by commercial kits. The pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were determined by ELISA. The levels of the ROCK/NF-κB pathway were determined by Western blotting.The contents of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α were inhibited by ALK, metformin or fasudil in diabetic db/db mice. Further, Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of Rho, ROCK1, ROCK2, p-NF-κBp65, and p-IκBα was significantly reversed by ALK treatment. In human hepatic HepG2 cells, the hepatoprotective effects of ALK were further characterized. With response to -challenge, increased amounts of insulin, ALT, AST, TG, and TC were observed, whereas ALK pretreatment significantly inhibited their leakage in HepG2 cells without appreciable cytotoxic effects. The inflammation condition was recovered with ALK treatment as shown by changes of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Further, Western blotting analysis also suggested that ALK improves hepatic inflammation in a Rho-kinase pathway.The present study successfully investigated the role of Rho-kinase signalling in diabetic liver injury. ALK exhibited hepatoprotective effects in diabetic db/db mice, and it might act through improving hepatic inflammation through the Rho-kinase pathway.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Free fatty acids (FFAs)-associated lipotoxicity contributes to injury of proximal renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells in .  (PA) which is the most abundant saturated fatty  in FFAs is closely associated with the gradual decline of renal function. Astragalosides IV (AS-IV) has a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of AS-IV on PA-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that AS-IV (10, 20, 40 μmol/L) could alleviate PA-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells. We found that AS-IV reduced the expression of Bax and cleaved-caspase3, but increased the expression of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated Nrf2 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, AS-IV reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. Our study suggests that AS-IV could protect against PA-induced apoptosis in HK-2 cells by inhibiting ROS generation and apoptotic protein expression. This study may provide a new theoretical option for the patients with type 2 .Copyright © 2018.

In the present study, we revealed a critical role of NPM in liver insulin resistance. NPM is markedly upregulated in insulin-resistant liver tissues and  (PA)-exposed HepG2 cells both at mRNA and protein levels. Ectopic expression of NPM in hepatocytes aggravated PA-induced insulin resistance, lipid droplet accumulation, glucose intake impairment as well as the expression of gluconeogenic genes. Coinciding with these results, interference of NPM using small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos ameliorated PA-induced insulin resistance, as revealed by increased phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β following insulin treatment. As predicted, PA-triggered alterations in glucose intake and the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes were attenuated following NPM depletion. Finally, we showed that NPM plays an indispensible role in PA-induced activation of NF-κB pathway. Both of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were impeded by NPM interference in PA-treated HepG2 cells. Taken together, these findings explicitly demonstrate that NPM participates in the development of liver insulin resistance, suggesting that NPM may serve as a potential therapeutic target of type 2 .Copyright © 2019.

Serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is linked to insulin resistance and a number of serine/threonine kinases including JNK, mTOR and p70 S6K have been implicated in this process. Activation of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases muscle glucose uptake, and in recent years AMPK has been viewed as an important target to counteract insulin resistance. We reported recently that rosemary extract (RE) increased muscle cell glucose uptake and activated AMPK. However, the effect of RE on FFA-induced muscle insulin resistance has never been examined. In the current study, we investigated the effect of RE in palmitate-induced insulin resistant L6 myotubes. Exposure of myotubes to palmitate reduced the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and decreased the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Importantly, exposure to RE abolished these effects and the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was restored. Treatment with palmitate increased the phosphorylation/activation of JNK, mTOR and p70 S6K whereas RE completely abolished these effects. RE increased the phosphorylation of AMPK even in the presence of palmitate. Our data indicate that rosemary extract has the potential to counteract the palmitate-induced muscle cell insulin resistance and further studies are required to explore its antidiabetic properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31380811>PAHSAs attenuate immune responses and promote β cell survival in autoimmune diabetic mice.</a></h2><p> esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs) are endogenous antidiabetic and antiinflammatory lipids. Here, we show that PAHSAs protect against type 1  (T1D) and promote β cell survival and function. Daily oral PAHSA administration to nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice delayed the onset of T1D and markedly reduced the incidence of T1D, whether PAHSAs were started before or after insulitis was established. PAHSAs reduced T and B cell infiltration and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, while increasing Treg activation in pancreata of NOD mice. PAHSAs promoted β cell proliferation in both NOD mice and MIN6 cells and increased the number of β cells in NOD mice. PAHSAs attenuated cytokine-induced apoptotic and necrotic β cell death and increased β cell viability. The mechanism appears to involve a reduction of ER stress and MAPK signaling, since PAHSAs lowered ER stress in NOD mice, suppressed thapsigargin-induced PARP cleavage in human islets, and attenuated ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation in MIN6 cells. This appeared to be mediated in part by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and not the G protein-coupled receptor GPR40. PAHSAs also prevented impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance in NOD mice. Thus, PAHSAs delayed the onset of T1D and reduced its incidence by attenuating immune responses and exerting direct protective effects on β cell survival and function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30478982>PCNA and JNK1-Stat3 pathways respectively promotes and inhibits -associated centrosome amplification by targeting at the ROCK1/14-3-3σ complex in human colon cancer HCT116 cells.</a></h2><p>We have recently reported that type 2  promotes centrosome amplification via enhancing the expression, biding, and centrosome translocation of rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1)/14-3-3σ complex in HCT116 cells. In the functional proteomic study, we further investigated the molecular pathways underlying the centrosome amplification using HCT116 cells. We found that treatment of HCT116 cells with high glucose, insulin, and  triggered the centrosome amplification and increased the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), nucleophosmin (NPM), and 14-3-3σ. Individual knockdown of PCNA, NPM, or 14-3-3σ inhibited the centrosome amplification. Knockdown of PCNA inhibited the treatment-increased expression of ROCK1, whereas knockdown of ROCK1 did not affect the PCNA expression. High glucose, insulin, and  also increased the expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), individual knockdown of which upregulated the treatment-increased expression of 14-3-3σ and promoted the centrosome amplification. In contrast, overexpression of JNK1 inhibited the centrosome amplification. Knockdown of Stat3 enhanced the centrosome translocation of 14-3-3σ. Moreover, we showed that knockdown of JNK1 inhibited the treatment-increased expression of Stat3. Knockdown of PCNA, JNK1, or Stat3 did not have an effect on NPM and vice versa. In conclusion, our results suggest that PCNA and JNK1-Stat3 pathways respectively promotes and feedback inhibits the centrosome amplification by targeting at the ROCK1/14-3-3σ complex, and NPM serves as an independent signal for the centrosome amplification.© 2018 The Authors.

However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty  metabolism and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty  desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572061>Cellular toxicity of dietary trans fatty acids and its correlation with ceramide and diglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>High fatty  (FA) levels are deleterious to pancreatic β-cells, largely due to the accumulation of biosynthetic lipid intermediates, such as ceramides and diglycerides, which induce ER stress and apoptosis. Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of lipid intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important metabolic characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

Within isolated human islets, C3 expression correlates with type 2  (T2D) donor status, HbA1c, and inflammation. Islet C3 expression is also upregulated in several rodent  models. C3 interacts with ATG16L1, which is essential for autophagy. Autophagy relieves cellular stresses faced by β cells during T2D and maintains cellular homeostasis. C3 knockout in clonal β cells impaired autophagy and led to increased apoptosis after exposure of cells to  and IAPP. In the absence of C3, autophagosomes do not undergo fusion with lysosomes. Thus, C3 may be upregulated in islets during T2D as a cytoprotective factor against β cell dysfunction caused by impaired autophagy. Therefore, we revealed a previously undescribed intracellular function for C3, connecting the complement system directly to autophagy, with a broad potential importance in other diseases and cell types.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study is to explore whether liraglutide improves high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice through inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome in the liver. After daily intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide (0.6 mg/kg body weight) for four weeks, the liver, liver/body weight, serum levels of ALT, AST, total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL were significantly decreased in a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mouse model. The hepatic steatosis among sections of H&E and Oil Red O staining was also markedly reduced after treatment with liraglutide. The expressions of NLRP3 inflammasome components (including NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1) in the liver of mice after treatment with liraglutide were decreased substantially. In vitro studies found that the mitochondrial dysfunction in Kupffer cells induced by  was attenuated, and the protein levels of NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 were also decrease markedly. These results demonstrate that liraglutide was able to alleviate high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that liraglutide is a potent drug that can reverse the pathological hallmarks of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In DIO mice fed with differentially composed low- or high-fat diets, acute and subchronic treatment with 5-PAHSA and 9-PAHSA alone, or in combination, did not significantly improve the deranged metabolic status. Neither racemic 5- or 9-PAHSA, nor the enantiomers were able to: (1) increase basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vitro, (2) stimulate GLP-1 release from GLUTag cells, or (3) induce GSIS in rat, mouse, or human islets or in a human pancreatic β cell line.

Recently, autophagy has been reported to play a major role in lipid metabolism in various cell types, but its role in pancreatic β-cell's lipid metabolism is rarely reported. Here, we investigated the role of kaempferol-induced autophagy in inhibition of lipid stores, ER stress and β-cell dysfunction in -challenged RIN-5F cells and isolated pancreatic islets. The lipid-lowering effect of kaempferol was determined by Oil Red O staining, triglyceride assay, BODIPY labeling, RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis of PLIN2 (the lipid droplet coat protein) expression. Further, the involvement of AMPK/mTOR-mediated lipophagy was established by pharmacological and genetic inhibitors of autophagy and AMPK. The co-localization studies of lipid droplets with autophagosomes/lysosomes by BODIPY-MDC-LysoTracker co-staining, LC3/BODIPY labeling and LC3/PLIN2 double immunolabeling further strengthened the findings. Kaempferol treatment exhibited decreased lipid stores and increased co-localization of lipid droplets with autophagosomes and lysosomes in -challenged β-cells. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy led to decreased co-localization and increased lipid droplets accumulation. Kaempferol-induced alleviation of ER stress and β-cell dysfunctions was established by immunoblot analysis of CHOP-10 (a key mediator of cell death in response to ER stress) and insulin content/secretion analysis respectively. Together, these findings suggest that kaempferol prevents ectopic lipid accumulation and ER stress, thus restoring β-cell function through AMPK-mediated lipophagy. The current data implies that kaempferol may be a potential therapeutic candidate to prevent obesity-linked diabetic complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Interest in these lipids is due to their unique biological activites and the observation that insulin-resistant people have lower  esters of hydroxystearic  (PAHSA) levels, suggesting that a FAHFA deficiency may contribute to metabolic disease. Rigorous testing of this hypothesis will require the measurement of many clinical samples; however, current analytical workflows are too slow to enable samples to be analyzed quickly. Here we describe the development of a significantly faster workflow to measure FAHFAs that optimizes the fractionation and chromatography of these lipids. We can measure FAHFAs in 30 min with this new protocol versus 90 min using the older protocol with comparable performance in regioisomer detection and quantitation. We also discovered through this optimization that oleic  esters of hydroxystearic acids (OAHSAs), another family of FAHFAs, have a much lower background signal than PAHSAs, which makes them easier to measure. Our faster workflow was able to quantify changes in PAHSAs and OAHSAs in mouse tissues and human plasma, highlighting the potential of this protocol for basic and clinical applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29298863>Dual regulation of HMGB1 by combined JNK1/2-ATF2 axis with miR-200 family in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>In the context of , obesity, and metabolic syndrome, the inflammatory signaling has critical roles in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly delineated. Herein, early and persistently elevated, proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1 expression was detected in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model in C57BL/6 mice. The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated  in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and liver function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429 liver conditional knockout mice (miR-429), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe liver inflammation and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4-JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which HMGB1 expression was regulated by both the JNK1/2-ATF2 axis and the miR-200 family, which provides a potential new approach for the treatment of NAFLD.-Chen, X., Ling, Y., Wei, Y., Tang, J., Ren, Y., Zhang, B., Jiang, F., Li, H., Wang, R., Wen, W., Lv, G., Wu, M., Chen, L., Li, L., Wang, H.

We recently generated a novel fusion peptide INSR-IgG4Fc, Yiminsu (YMS), to facilitate the high-affinity binding and transportation of insulin. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the novel recombinant peptide, YMS, could contribute to restoring insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in insulin resistance models and revealing its underlying mechanism.  (PA)-treated LO2 cells and high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were treated with YMS. Therapeutic effects of YMS were measured using Western blotting, ELISA, qPCR, Histology and transmission electron microscopy. We observed that YMS treatment effectively improved insulin signaling in PA-treated LO2 cells and HFD-fed mice. Notably, YMS could significantly reduce serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol without affecting the serum insulin levels. Moreover, our data demonstrated that YMS could restore glucose and lipid homeostasis via facilitating insulin transportation and reactivating PI3K/Akt signaling in both PA-treated cells and liver, gastrocnemius and brown fat of HFD-fed mice. Additionally, we noticed that the therapeutic effects of YMS was similar as rosiglitazone, a well-recognized insulin sensitizer.

Postprandial changes in gut hormones, glucose homeostasis, satiety, lipid and inflammatory parameters after meals were analysed. Some of the solid fractions of the IPO were removed and thus the fatty  composition of the PO and IPO was not entirely equal (PO vs IPO: palmitate 39.8 vs 38.7; oleate 43.6 vs 45.1). PO, IPO and HOS contained 9.7, 38.9 and 0.2 g/100 g total fatty acids of  at the sn-2 position, respectively. At 37 °C, IPO contained 4.2% SFC whereas PO and HOS were completely melted.Our novel observation shows that the incremental area under curve (iAUC) 0-6 h of plasma GIP concentration was on average 16% lower following IPO meal compared with PO and HOS (P < 0.05) meals.

In addition, little is known regarding their potential dietary and lifestyle predictors.We aimed to examine the association of plasma and erythrocyte concentrations of VLCSFAs with incident T2D risk.We used existing measurements of fatty  concentrations in plasma and erythrocytes among 2854 and 2831 participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS), respectively. VLCSFAs were measured using GLC, and individual fatty  concentrations were expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids. Incident T2D cases were identified by self-reports and confirmed by a validated supplementary questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association between VLCSFAs and T2D, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and dietary variables.During 39,941 person-years of follow-up, we documented 243 cases of T2D. Intakes of peanuts, peanut butter, vegetable fat, dairy fat, and /stearic (16:0-18:0) fatty acids were significantly, albeit weakly, correlated with plasma and erythrocyte VLCSFA concentrations (|rs| ≤ 0.19).

Toxicity after a 2-day incubation with the different FFAs was analysed by the caspase-3 assay and confirmed by the propidium iodide and annexin V staining tests. The long-chain saturated PA (C16:0) and the monounsaturated OA (C18:1) were both toxic to human EndoC-βH1 beta cells and pseudoislets, as well as to rat islets, and, as confirmed in a pilot experiment, also to human islets. Furthermore, OA provided no protection against the toxicity of PA. Likewise, elaidic  (EA, the trans isomer of OA; trans-OA) was significantly toxic, in contrast to the non-metabolisable analogues methylated PA (MePA) and methylated OA (MeOA). Fatty acids with a chain length  < C16 were not toxic in EndoC-βH1 beta cells. Caspase-3 was also activated by linoleic  (LA)(C18:2) but not by γ-linolenic  (γ-LNA)(C18:3). Overall, only long-chain FFAs with chain lengths  > C14, which generate hydrogen peroxide in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation, were toxic. This conclusion is also supported by the toxicity of the branched-chain FFA pristanic , which is exclusively metabolised in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation. The lack of a protective effect of the monounsaturated fatty  OA has important consequences for a beta-cell protective lipid composition of a diet. A cardioprotective diet with a high OA content does not fulfil this requirement.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622986>Exogenous Hydrogen Sulfide Alleviates-Induced Intracellular Inflammation in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids induced hepatic inflammation plays an important role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Hydrogen sulfide (HS), an endogenous gasotransmitter, has been established to possess potent anti-inflammation in various human organs. However, the anti-inflammation property of HS in the fatty liver is still needed to further elucidate. Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether exogenous HS can protect hepatocytes against inﬂammation induced by  (PA). HepG2 hepatocytes were exposed to PA for 24 h to induce free fatty acids-induced inflammation. The cells were pretreated with NaHS (a donor of H2S) before exposure to PA. Cell viability, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β), NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB were measured by a combination of MTT assay, ELISA, Western blot and Immunofluorescence. Here, we found that exogenous HS dose-dependently inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of NF-κB signaling in PA-induced HepG2 cells. Thus, HS might be a candidate therapeutic agent against NAFLD.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29330456>20-HETE promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in an autocrine manner through FFAR1.</a></h2><p>The long-chain fatty  receptor FFAR1 is highly expressed in pancreatic β-cells. Synthetic FFAR1 agonists can be used as antidiabetic drugs to promote glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, the physiological role of FFAR1 in β-cells remains poorly understood. Here we show that 20-HETE activates FFAR1 and promotes GSIS via FFAR1 with higher potency and efficacy than dietary fatty acids such as , linoleic, and α-linolenic . Murine and human β-cells produce 20-HETE, and the ω-hydroxylase-mediated formation and release of 20-HETE is strongly stimulated by glucose. Pharmacological inhibition of 20-HETE formation and blockade of FFAR1 in islets inhibits GSIS. In islets from type-2 diabetic humans and mice, glucose-stimulated 20-HETE formation and 20-HETE-dependent stimulation of GSIS are strongly reduced. We show that 20-HETE is an FFAR1 agonist, which functions as an autocrine positive feed-forward regulator of GSIS, and that a reduced glucose-induced 20-HETE formation contributes to inefficient GSIS in type-2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29607540>Melatonin improves insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis through attenuation of alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Melatonin plays an important role in regulating circadian rhythms. It also acts as a potent antioxidant and regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, although the exact action mechanism is not clear. The α2-HS-glycoprotein gene (AHSG) and its protein, fetuin-A (FETUA), are one of the hepatokines and are known to be associated with insulin resistance and type 2 . The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin improves hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in a FETUA-dependent manner. In HepG2 cells treated with 300 μmol/L of , phosphorylated AKT expression decreased, and FETUA expression increased, but this effect was inhibited by treatment with 10 μmol/L of melatonin. However, melatonin did not improve insulin resistance in FETUA-overexpressing cells, indicating that improvement in insulin resistance by melatonin was dependent on downregulation of FETUA. Moreover, melatonin decreased -induced ER stress markers, CHOP, Bip, ATF-6, XBP-1, ATF-4, and PERK. In addition, in the high-fat diet (HFD) mice, oral treatment with 100 mg/kg/day melatonin for 10 weeks reduced body weight gain to one-third of that of the HFD group and hepatic steatosis. Insulin sensitivity and glucose intolerance improved with the upregulation of muscle p-AKT protein expression. FETUA expression and ER stress markers in the liver and serum of HFD mice were decreased by melatonin treatment. In conclusion, melatonin can improve hepatic insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis through reduction in ER stress and the resultant AHSG expression.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, it is presently unknown whether BACE1 and the product of its activity, soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), contribute to lipid-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells.Studies were conducted in mouse C2C12 myotubes, skeletal muscle from Bace1mice and mice treated with sAPPβ and adipose tissue and plasma from obese and type 2 diabetic patients.We show that BACE1 inhibition or knockdown attenuates palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance and prevents the reduction in Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and fatty  oxidation caused by palmitate in myotubes. The effects of palmitate on ER stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, PGC-1α down-regulation, and fatty  oxidation were mimicked by soluble APPβ in vitro. BACE1 expression was increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and type 2 diabetic patients and this was accompanied by a decrease in PGC-1α mRNA levels and by an increase in sAPPβ plasma levels of obese type 2 diabetic patients compared to obese non-diabetic subjects. Acute sAPPβ administration to mice reduced PGC-1α levels and increased inflammation in skeletal muscle and decreased insulin sensitivity.Collectively, these findings indicate that the BACE1 product sAPPβ is a key determinant in ER stress, inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and gluconeogenesis in liver.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

An overload of free fatty acids contributes to pancreatic β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction. Insulin secretion involves sequential ionic events upon glucose stimulation. ATP sensitive potassium (K) channels serve as glucose sensors and effectively initiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This study investigated the effects of lipotoxicity on the trafficking of K channels in pancreatic β cells using chronic  -injected mice and treated insulinoma cells. The chronic  -injected mice displayed type II diabetic characteristics. The pancreatic sections of these mice exhibited a decrease in the expression of K channels. We then tested the time and dose effects of  on the cell viability of INS-1 cells. We observed a significant decrease in the surface expression of K channels after 72 h of treatment with 0.4 mM . In addition, this treatment induced pancreatic β-cell apoptosis by increasing cleaved caspase 3 protein level. Our results demonstrated cotreatment with glibenclamide, the sulfonylurea compounds for type II , in  -treated cells reduces cell death and recovers the glucose stimulated insulin secretion through increasing the surface expression of K channels. Importantly, glibenclamide also improved glucose tolerance, triglyceride concentration, and insulin sensitivity in the -injected mice. In conclusion, an increase in the surface expression of K channels restores insulin secretion, reduces pancreatic β-cell's apoptosis, highlighting correct trafficking of K channels is important in survival of β-cells during lipotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to investigate whether the protective effects of DJC by oral administration on high-fat diet (HFD) and -induced damages of endothelial cells are related to oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into standard chow diet (SCD), HFD, HFD plus DJC-low dose (HFD + DJCL) and HFD plus DJC-high dose treatment groups (HFD + DJCH). The latter three groups were given HFD feeding for three months, then the HFD + DJCL and HFD + DJCH rats were treated with DJC (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) via gavage for another two months respectively. Endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by acetylcholine were observed in isolated rat thoracic aortic ring preparation. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total-antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), free fatty acids (FFA), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in serum were assayed. The pathological changes, protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) and ER stress-related genes in the thoracic aorta were measured. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with serum-medicated DJC and then with  to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) distribution, expression of p-eNOS and ER stress-related genes. DJC therapy exhibited a potent antioxidant activity and effectively prevented the endothelial dysfunction (ED) manifested by promoting p-eNOS expression and enhancing NO release, decreasing lipid deposition (Oil-red O staining, CPT1b and ACC) and inflammation (IL-1β, TNFα, CD68 and p-JNK), alleviating oxidative and ER stress, and decreasing the apoptosis of endothelial cells (TUNEL, BCL-2 and BAX) induced by HFD and  respectively.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a principle intracellular energy sensor exerting protective effect against T2D. Strikingly, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, considerably inhibited the secretion of IL-1β when THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS plus  (PA). The underlying mechanism was examined with respect to the effect of compound C on NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex which controls the processing and production of IL-1β. Interestingly, compound C significantly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This phenomenon was reproduced in AMPK siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells, indicating that compound C exerts this function despite AMPK knockdown. Also, it significantly suppresses the mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, compound C was shown to significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown, rendering it as the novel target of compound C. Potentially, compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome through the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production. These findings offer initial evidence into compound C as a novel pharmacological agent with significant therapeutic potential in NLRP3 inflammasome-related disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D. Thus, further studies are essential to identify the effect of compound C on these diseases in vitro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481892>Metabolomics Study of Metabolic Changes in Renal Cells in Response to High-Glucose Exposure Based on Liquid or Gas Chromatography Coupled With Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious microvascular complications and the leading causes of death in  (DM).

Lipid accumulation within the liver is considered as one of the risk factors for insulin resistance. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is used to treat liver dysfunction; however, the effect and mechanism of HGF on hepatic lipid metabolism are still not fully understood.Male C57BL/6 mice were induced with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week treatment of HGF or vehicle saline. The levels of fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance were calculated for insulin sensitivity. Biochemical plasma parameters were also measured to assess the effect of HGF on lipid accumulation. Additionally, genes in the lipid metabolism pathway were evaluated in -treated HepG2 cells and high-fat diet mice.HGF treatment significantly decreased the levels of fasting blood glucose, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents. Additionally, HGF-regulated expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c/fatty  synthase, peroxidase proliferator-activated receptor-α, and upstream nuclear receptors, such as farnesoid X receptor and small heterodimer partner. Furthermore, c-Met inhibitor could partially reverse the effects of HGF.HGF treatment can ameliorate hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis through regulation of lipid metabolism. These effects might occur through farnesoid X receptor-small heterodimer partner axis-dependent transcriptional activity.© 2018 The Authors.

It has been demonstrated that resveratrol (RSV) may prevent T2DM by targeting Sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1), indicating that SIRT1 may be a novel therapeutic target for T2DM prevention. In the present study, a T2DM rat model was established by administering a high fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Measurements of blood glucose and insulin confirmed successful establishment of the T2DM model. RSV was used to treat rats with STZ-induced T2DM and the results indicated that RSV reversed the STZ-induced downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, SIRT1 and forkhead box protein O 3a. Furthermore, RSV modulated the activity of superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, which are associated with oxidative stress. , cells from the insulinoma cell line clone 1E were pretreated with  (PA) to simulate a high fat environment. The results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that PA suppressed the expression of SIRT1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA modulated the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-associated, lipid metabolism-associated and β-cell-associated genes, whereas RSV treatment ameliorated the PA-induced changes in the expression of these genes via SIRT1. The results of the present study suggest that RSV participates in the prevention of T2DM by regulating the expression of mitochondrial genes associated with biogenesis, lipid metabolism and β-cells via SIRT1. The results of the current study provide an insight into the mechanisms by which SIRT1 inhibits T2DM and may be used as a basis for future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31183735>Attenuating effect of silibinin on -induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic β-cells is mediated by estrogen receptor alpha.</a></h2><p>High levels of circulating free fatty acids often trigger pancreatic β cell dysfunction during the development of type 2 . Silibinin, the main component of Silybum marianum fruit extract (silymarin), is reported to have anti-diabetic effect. This study is designed to determine the protective effect of silibinin on -induced damage in a rat pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1 cells. Our results demonstrate that silibinin improves cell viability, enhances insulin synthesis and secretion, and resumes normal mitochondrial function in -treated INS-1 cells. An accumulating body of evidence has shown that the estrogen receptors are key molecules involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results suggest that silibinin upregulates ERα signaling pathway from the finding that ERα-specific inhibitors abolish the anti-lipotoxic effect of silibinin. In conclusion, these findings suggest that silibinin protects INS-1 cells against apoptosis and mitochondrial damage through upregulation of ERα pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30431065>lncRNA MEG3 promotes hepatic insulin resistance by serving as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-214 to regulate ATF4 expression.</a></h2><p>MicroRNA (miR)‑214 has been demonstrated to suppress gluconeogenesis by targeting activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which regulates gluconeogenesis by affecting the transcriptional activity of forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). Our previous study revealed that the upregulation of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a long noncoding RNA, enhanced hepatic insulin resistance via increased FoxO1 expression. The present study aimed to explore whether miR‑214 and ATF4 were involved in the MEG3‑mediated increase of FoxO1 expression. MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 expression were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The interaction among MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 was analysed using the luciferase reporter assay. MEG3‑targeting small interference RNAs were injected into high‑fat diet (HFD)‑fed mice to verify the role of MEG3 in hepatic insulin resistance in vivo. MEG‑3 and ATF4 were demonstrated to be upregulated and miR‑214 was indicated to be downregulated in the livers of HFD‑fed and ob/ob mice. In mouse primary hepatocytes, palmitate time‑dependently increased MEG3 and ATF4 but decreased miR‑214 expression levels. Furthermore, MEG3 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression, while miR‑214 inhibition and ATF4 overexpression reversed the MEG3 knockdown‑mediated decrease in the expression of FoxO1 and FoxO1‑downstream targets phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose‑6‑phosphatase catalytic subunit. In HFD‑fed mice, MEG3 knockdown substantially improved impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, while downregulating HFD‑induced ATF4 expression and upregulating HFD‑suppressed miR‑214 expression. In conclusion, MEG3 promoted hepatic insulin resistance by serving as a ceRNA of miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression. These data provide insight into the molecular mechanism of MEG3 involvement in the development of type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30207798>Iron overload by transferrin receptor protein 1 regulation plays an important role in palmitate-induced insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle cells.</a></h2><p>Free fatty  is considered to be one of the major pathogenic factors of inducing insulin resistance. The association between iron disturbances and insulin resistance has recently begun to receive a lot of attention. Although skeletal muscles are a major tissue for iron utilization and storage, the role of iron in palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance is unknown. We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying iron dysregulation in PA-induced insulin resistance. Interestingly, we found that PA simultaneously increased intracellular iron and induced insulin resistance. The iron chelator deferoxamine dramatically inhibited PA-induced insulin resistance, and iron donors impaired insulin sensitivity by activating JNK. PA up-regulated transferrin receptor 1 (tfR1), an iron uptake protein, which was modulated by iron-responsive element-binding proteins 2. Knockdown of tfR1 and iron-responsive element-binding proteins 2 prevented PA-induced iron uptake and insulin resistance. PA also translocated the tfR1 by stimulating calcium influx, but the calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM, dramatically reduced iron overload by inhibiting tfR1 translocation and ultimately increased insulin sensitivity. Iron overload may play a critical role in PA-induced insulin resistance. Blocking iron overload may thus be a useful strategy for preventing insulin resistance and .-Cui, R., Choi, S.-E., Kim, T.

Fasting plasma glucose was measured in blood samples collected at baseline and follow-up (mean 5.5 years after baseline).The average age of study participants was 38 years; 41% were men. Ceramide, sphingomyelin, and glucosylceramide species levels were higher in older participants; lactosyl-ceramide levels were higher in participants with lower BMIs. In adjusted analyses, greater concentrations of most ceramide species and lower lactosyl-ceramide with  (LC-16) were associated with higher glucose levels at baseline. We did not observe associations of sphingomyelin species or glucosyl-ceramide species with glucose levels. Associations of sphingolipid levels with fasting glucose levels at follow-up were similar but had greater uncertainty than associations with baseline glucose. Although no statistically significant associations of sphingolipids with incident impaired fasting glucose were present, results were similar to glucose analyses.We identified several ceramide species associated with higher fasting glucose levels and one sphingolipid, LC-16, that was associated with lower fasting glucose levels. These findings compliment previous research, which linked these sphingolipids with fasting insulin levels, and suggest that higher levels of these ceramides and lower LC-16 may be an early marker of impaired glucose metabolism.

Fatty acids (FAs) have been discussed as exogenous secretagogues of insulin for decades, especially after the FA receptor GPR40 (G-protein-coupled receptor 40) was discovered. However, the role of FAs as endogenous signaling factors has not been investigated until now. In the present work, we demonstrate that lowering endogenous FA levels in β-cell medium by stringent washing or by the application of FA-free (FAF) BSA immediately reduced glucose-induced oscillations of cytosolic Ca ([Ca] oscillations) in MIN6 cells and mouse primary β-cells, as well as insulin secretion. Mass spectrometry confirmed BSA-mediated removal of FAs, with , stearic, oleic, and elaidic  being the most abundant species. [Ca] oscillations in MIN6 cells recovered when BSA was replaced by buffer or as FA levels in the supernatant were restored. This was achieved by recombinant lipase-mediated FA liberation from membrane lipids, by the addition of FA-preloaded FAF-BSA, or by the photolysis of cell-impermeant caged FAs. Our combined data support the hypothesis of FAs as essential endogenous signaling factors for β-cell activity and insulin secretion.© 2018 by the American  Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816669>MIP-1α Induction by Palmitate in the Human Monocytic Cells Implicates TLR4 Signaling Mechanism.</a></h2><p>MIP-1α (macrophage inflammatory protein 1α)/CCL3 chemokine is associated with the adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. Both MIP-1α and free fatty acids are elevated in obesity/T2D. We asked if free fatty  palmitate could modulate MIP1α expression in the human monocytic cells.Human monocytic THP-1 cells and macrophages were stimulated with palmitate and TNF-α (positive control). MIP-1α expression was measured with real time RT-PCR, Flow Cytometry and ELISA. Signaling pathways were identified by using THP-1-XBlue™ cells, THP-1-XBlue™-defMyD cells, anti-TLR4 mAb and TLR4 siRNA.Our data show that palmitate induced significant increase in MIP1α production in monocytic THP-1 cells/macrophages. MIP-1α induction was significantly suppressed when cells were treated with anti-TLR4 antibody prior stimulation with palmitate. Using TLR4 siRNA, we further demonstrate that palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression in monocytic cells requires TLR4. Moreover, THP1 cells defective in MyD88, a major adaptor protein involved in TLR4 signaling, were unable to induce MIP-1α production in response to palmitate. Palmitate-induced MIP-1α expression was suppressed by inhibition of MAPK, NFkB and PI3K signaling pathways. In addition, palmitate-induced NF-κB/AP-1 activation was observed while production of MIP-1α. However, this activation of NF-κB/AP-1 was abrogated in MyD88 deficient cells.Overall, these results show that palmitate induces TLR4dependent MIP-1α expression requiring the MyD88 recruitment and activation of MAPK, NF-κB/AP-1 and PI3K signaling. It implies that the increased systemic levels of free fatty  palmitate in obesity/T2D may contribute to metabolic inflammation through excessive production of MIP-1a.© Copyright by the Author(s).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the effects of PA metabolism on the function of SIRT1 and the upregulation of BACE1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. PA reduced the total amount of NAD in neurons that caused an increase in p65 K310 acetylation due to inhibition of SIRT1 activity and low protein content.

Furthermore, elevated glucose, a gold standard for cell culture treatments, yields little to no response from many primary human retinal cells. Thus, the goal of this project was to demonstrate the effectiveness of the free fatty ,  and compare its use alone and in combination with elevated glucose as a stimulus for human Müller cells, a retinal glial cell type that is activated early in DR pathogenesis and uniquely responsive to fatty acids. Using RNA sequencing, we identified a variety of DR-relevant pathways, including NFκB signaling and inflammation, intracellular lipid signaling, angiogenesis, and MAPK signaling, that were stimulated by , while elevated glucose alone did not significantly alter any -relevant pathways. Co-treatment of high glucose with  potentiated the expression of several DR-relevant angiogenic and inflammatory targets, including PTGS2 (COX-2) and CXCL8 (IL-8).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121645>Crucial Roles of 5-HT and 5-HT2 Receptor in -Related Lipid Accumulation and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Generation in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Previously, we confirmed that liver-synthesized 5-HT rather than non-liver 5-HT, acting on the 5-HT2 receptor (5-HT2R), modulates lipid-induced excessive lipid synthesis (ELS). Here, we further revealed the effects of the hepatocellular 5-HT system in -related disorders.Studies were conducted in male ICR mice, human HepG2 cells, and primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) under gene or chemical inhibition of the 5-HT system, key lipid metabolism, and inflammation-related factors. Protein and messenger RNA expression and levels of the factors were determined via western blotting, reverse transcription PCR, and quantitative assay kits, respectively. Hepatic steatosis with inflammation and fibrosis, intracellular lipid droplet accumulation (LDA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) location were determined via hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, Oil red O, and fluorescent-specific staining, respectively. induced the activation of the 5-HT system: the activation of 5-HT2R, primarily 5-HT2AR, in addition to upregulating monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) expression and 5-HT synthesis, by activating the G protein/ phospholipase C pathway modulated PKCε activation, resulting in ELS with LDA; the activation of NF-κB, which mediates the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, was primarily due to ROS generation in the mitochondria induced by MAO-A-catalyzed 5-HT degradation, and secondarily due to the activation of PKCε. These effects of the 5-HT system were also detected in - or high glucose-treated PMHs and regulated multiple inflammatory signaling pathways. In diabetic mice, co-treatment with antagonists of both 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT2R significantly abolished hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.Activation of the hepatocellular 5-HT system plays a crucial role in inducing -related hepatic dysfunction and is a potential therapeutic target.© 2018 The Author(s).

Whereas mechanisms of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in FFA-treated beta-cells have been intensively studied, biological events preceding the secretory failure, when GSIS is accentuated, are poorly investigated. To identify these early events, we performed genome-wide analysis of gene expression in isolated human islets exposed to fatty  palmitate for different time periods.Palmitate-treated human islets showed decline in beta-cell function starting from day two. Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 identified 903 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Mapping of the genes onto pathways using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis predicted four islet biology-related pathways enriched prior but not after the decline of islet function and three pathways enriched both prior and after the decline of islet function. DEGs from these pathways were analyzed at the transcript level. The results propose that in palmitate-treated human islets, at early time points, protective events, including up-regulation of metallothioneins, tRNA synthetases and fatty -metabolising proteins, dominate over deleterious events, including inhibition of fatty  detoxification enzymes, which contributes to the enhanced GSIS. After prolonged exposure of islets to palmitate, the protective events are outweighed by the deleterious events, which leads to impaired GSIS.The study identifies temporal order between different cellular events, which either promote or protect from beta-cell failure. The sequence of these events should be considered when developing strategies for prevention and treatment of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415760>Oxidative stress induced by  modulates K2.3 channels in vascular endothelium.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma free fatty acids level has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated the effect of  (PA), the most abundant saturated fatty  in the human body, on small-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (K2.3)-mediated relaxation in rodent resistance arteries and the underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of PA on K2.3 in endothelium was evaluated using real-time PCR, Western blotting, whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, wire and pressure myograph system, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by using dihydroethidium and 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. K2.3-mediated vasodilatation responses to acetylcholine and NS309 (agonist of K2.3 and K3.1) were impaired by incubation of normal mesenteric arteries with 100 μM PA for 24 h. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PA decreased K2.3 current and expression at mRNA and protein levels. Incubation with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor dibenziodolium (DPI) partly inhibited the PA-induced ROS production and restored K2.3 expression. Inhibition of either p38-MAPK or NF-κB using specific inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190 or Bay11-7082, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) attenuated PA-induced downregulation of K2.3 and inhibition of p38-MAPK also attenuated PA-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, DPI reversed the increment of phospho-p38-MAPK by PA. These results demonstrated that PA downregulated K2.3 expressions via Nox/ROS/p38-MAPK/NF-κB signaling leading to endothelial vasodilatory dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, cell culture media typically contain supraphysiological levels of glucose to stimulate cellular growth, which also desensitizes cells to elevated glucose levels. Moreover, creating hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro requires specialized carriers because unbound lipids form micelles when introduced to liquid media. This study sought to develop a novel method for simulating DM conditions in vitro.We acclimated the CC mouse myoblasts to culture medium with 5.6 mM glucose, which mimics physiological levels, and created a bovine serum albumin- conjugate for lipid transport to explore the effects of hyperlipidemia. We simulated diabetic conditions in vitro by using both hyper-glycemic and -lipidemic conditions and compared the results to that of only hyperglycemic or hyperlipidemic conditions.Acclimated cells exposed to these hyper-glycemic (15 mM glucose) and/or -lipidemic (0.25 mM palmitate) conditions for 2 h showed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and membrane potential as well as elevated reactive oxygen species production compared to control cells. These findings suggest altered mitochondrial morphology and function, which have been confirmed using isolated rat flexor digitorum brevis myofibers. Hyper-glycemic and/or -lipidemic stimulations for 24 h significantly increased mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK 1/2 protein expression, upregulated the early pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and induced apoptosis.Our results further support and confirm the utility of this method which will allow for subsequent investigations studying the effects of hyper-glycemia and/or -lipidemia in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To co-relate the in vivo results we used the human liver carcinoma HepG2 cells, subjected to knockdown with small siRNAs of AdipoR1/R2 and PPARα genes and treated with osmotin and  (P.A.). MTT assay, Western blotting, immunohistofluorescence assays, and plasma biochemical analyses were applied.Osmotin stimulated AdipoR1/R2 and its downstream APPL1/PPAR-α/AMPK/SIRT1 pathways in ob/ob and db/db mice, and HepG2 cells exposed to P.A. Mechanistically, we confirmed that knockdown of AdipoR1/R2 and PPARα by their respective siRNAs abolished the osmotin activity in HepG2 cells exposed to P.A. Overall, the in vivo and in vitro results suggested that osmotin protected against NAFLD through activation of AdipoR1/R2 and its downstream APPL1/PPAR-α/AMPK/SIRT1 pathways as shown by the reduced body weight, blood glucose level and glycated hemoglobin, improved glucose tolerance, attenuated insulin resistance and hepatic glucogenesis, regulated serum lipid parameters, and increased fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial functions.Our findings strongly suggest that novel osmotin might be a potential novel therapeutic tool against obesity/-induced NAFLD and other metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this work was twofold: 1) to investigate the structural and functional alterations of the tight junction (TJ)-mediated intestinal epithelial barrier of ileum and colon, that concentrate most of the microbiota, after exposure to a HFD for 15, 30 and 60 days, and 2) to assess the effect of in vitro exposure to free fatty acids (FFAs), one of the components of HFD, on paracellular barrier of colon-derived Caco-2 cells.HFD exposure induced progressive metabolic changes in male mice that culminated in prediabetes after 60d. Morphological analysis of ileum and colon mucosa showed no signs of epithelial rupture or local inflammation but changes in the junctional content/distribution and/or cellular content of TJ-associated proteins (claudins-1, -2, -3, and occludin) in intestinal epithelia were seen mainly after a prediabetes state has been established. This impairment in TJ structure was not associated with significant changes in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran. Exposure of Caco-2 monolayers to  or linoleic acids seems to induce a reinforcement of TJ structure while treatment with oleic  had a more diverse effect on TJ protein distribution.TJ structure in distal intestinal epithelia can be specifically impaired by HFD intake at early stage of T2DM, but not by FFAs in vitro. Since the TJ change in ileum/colon was marginal, probably it does not contribute to the disease onset.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of EGCG in alleviating IR in HepG2 cells.HepG2 cells were treated with 25 mM glucose, 0.25 mM  (PA), or 50 μM EGCG for 24 h.EGCG increased glucose uptake and decreased glucose content. EGCG markedly decreased the levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress factors including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and p53 protein, and markedly increased superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and SOD2 protein. EGCG significantly downregulated the levels of FFAs, triacylglycerol and cholesterol in HepG2 cells. The glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein and its downstream proteins peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1β were significantly increased, and sterol regulatory element-binding-1c (SREBP-1c) protein, and fatty  synthase (FAS) were significantly decreased by EGCG in HepG2. Moreover, the foregoing effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GLUT2.Our data demonstrated that EGCG improved IR, possibly through ameliorating glucose (25 mM) and PA (0.25 mM)-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and FFAs via the GLUT2/PGC-1β/SREBP-1c/FAS pathway in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Propane-2-sulfonic  octadec-9-enyl-amide (N15) is a novel PPARα/γ dual agonist synthesized in our laboratory. The present study investigates the efficacy and safety of N15 on insulin resistance regulation in high fat diet (HFD)-and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and in  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. Our results showed that N15 remarkably ameliorated insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in vivo, as well as rectified the glucose consumption and gluconeogenesis in vitro. Moreover, the glucose-lowering effect of N15 was associated with PPARγ mediated up-regulation of hepatic glucose consumption and down-regulation of gluconeogenesis. Meanwhile, N15 exerted advantageous effects on glucose and lipid metabolism without triggering weight gain and hepatotoxicity in mice. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that by alleviating glucose and lipid abnormalities, N15 could be used as a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent against type 2  and related metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The increase of intracellular Ca triggers insulin granule release, therefore several mechanisms regulate Ca efflux within the β-cells, among others, the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA). In this work, we describe that lipotoxicity mediated mainly by the saturated  (PA) (16C) is associated with loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and potentially cell viability, a phenomenon that was induced to a lesser extent by stearic (18C), myristic (14C) and lauric (12C) acids. PA was localized on endoplasmic reticulum, activating arms of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as also promoted by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxins. In particular, our findings demonstrate an alteration in PMCA1/4 expression caused by PA and LPS which trigger the UPR, affecting not only insulin release and contributing to β-cell mass reduction, but also increasing reactive nitrogen species. Nonetheless, stearic  (SA) did not show these effects. Remarkably, the proteolytic degradation of PMCA1/4 prompted by PA and LPS was avoided by the action of monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic and palmitoleic . Oleic  recovered cell viability after treatment with PA/LPS and, more interestingly, relieved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. While palmitoleic  improved the insulin release, this fatty  seems to have more relevant effects upon the expression of regulatory pumps of intracellular Ca. Therefore, chain length and unsaturation of fatty acids are determinant cues in proteostasis of β-cells and, consequently, on the regulation of calcium and insulin secretion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30604460>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated pathway to preserve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Previous works indicated that the stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) affected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is no clear evident on the effect of the regulation of ER stress by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the prevention of NAFLD.HepG2 cells were treated with thapsigargin (Tg) or  (PA). We analysed ACE2 expression using Western-blotting analyses. ER stress-related proteins were detected in ACE2 knockout mice and Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice by immunofluorescence or Western-blotting analyses. In ACE2-overexpression HepG2 cells, the triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and glycogen content were detected by assay kits. Meanwhile, the expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins (ACCα, SREBP-1c, FAS, and LXRα), enzymes for gluconeogenesis (PEPCK, G6Pase, and IRS2), and IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway were analysed by Western-blotting analyses.ACE2 was significantly increased in Tg/PA-induced cultured hepatocytes. Additionally, ACE2 knockout mice displayed elevated levels of ER stress, while Ad-ACE2-treated db/db mice showed reduced ER stress in liver. Furthermore, activation of ACE2 can ameliorate ER stress, accompanied by decreased TG content, increased intracellular glycogen, and downregulated expression of hepatic lipogenic proteins and enzymes for gluconeogenesis in Tg/PA-induced hepatocytes. As a consequence of anti-ER stress, the activation of ACE2 led to improved glucose and lipid metabolism through the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt pathway.This is the first time documented that ACE2 had a notable alleviating role in ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism via the IKKβ/NFκB/IRS1/Akt-mediated pathway.

The effects of fatty acids on myocellular protein balance remain controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the direct effects of a mixed-species fatty  environment on myocellular protein synthesis and degradation.C2C12 myotubes were cultured in media containing equimolar (250 μM)  and oleate (PO) or bovine serum albumin control for ≤72 h. Myocellular protein balance was determined via incorporation (synthesis) or release (degradation) of H-tyrosine after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment. Expression of major proteolytic genes was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.PO significantly increased myocellular protein content at 24, 48, and 72 h. Basal myocellular protein synthesis was unchanged by PO. However, PO significantly decreased basal rate of protein degradation at 24 h and this effect persisted throughout 72 h of treatment. Expression of the proteolytic genes Atrogin-1 (MAFbx), MuRF-1, LC3, and ATG4 B, was reduced during the 72 h PO.A mixed-species fatty  environment increases myocellular protein content by decreasing the rate of protein degradation, which may be regulated at the level of gene transcription.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study was designed to investigate precise effects of antioxidant N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) in alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Echocardiography and histologic studies were performed 12 weeks after streptozocin injection. Protein levels involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting in diabetic hearts or high-glucose (HG, 30 mM)- and  (PA, 300 μM)-cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). ROS generation and structural alterations of mitochondria were also assessed. We report that NAC alleviated -induced cardiac abnormality, including restored ejection fraction (EF %), fraction shortening (FS %), peak E to peak A ratio (E/A) and reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. These effects were concomitant with blocked ERS and apoptosis, as evidenced by inactivation of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α)/spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), phosphorylated protein kinase-like kinase (PERK)/phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)/activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6α)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathways, as well as suppressed Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase 3 expressions. Mechanistically, PA mediated excessive mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress, which were antagonized by NAC and Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS inhibitor. No effects were noted by addition of apocynin, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX 4) and NOX 2 expressions were not altered, indicating that PA-induced ROS generation is independent of NADPH oxidases. Most intriguingly, HG failed to promote ROS production despite its ability to promote ERS and apoptosis in NRCMs. Collectively, these findings indicate that NAC primarily abrogates PA-mediated mitochondrial ROS through ERS and therefore alleviates myocardial apoptosis but has little effect on HG-induced cardiac injury. This uncovers a potential role for NAC in formulating novel cardioprotective strategies in DCM patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30265686>The novel NADPH oxidase 4 selective inhibitor GLX7013114 counteracts human islet cell death in vitro.</a></h2><p>It has been proposed that pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in type 2  is promoted by oxidative stress caused by NADPH oxidase (Nox) over-activity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of novel Nox inhibitors as protective agents against cytokine- or high glucose + palmitate-induced human beta-cell death. The Nox2 protein was present mainly in the cytoplasm and was induced by cytokines. Nox4 protein immunoreactivity, with some nuclear accumulation, was observed in human islet cells, and was not affected by islet culture in the presence of cytokines or high glucose + palmitate. Nox inhibitors with partial or no isoform selectivity (DPI, dapsone, GLX351322, and GLX481372) all reduced ROS production of human islet cells exposed to high glucose + palmitate. This was paralleled by improved viability and reduced caspase 3 activation. The Nox1 selective inhibitor ML171 failed to reduce human islet cell death in response to both cytokines and high glucose + palmitate. The selective Nox2 inhibitor Phox-I2 also failed to protect against cytokines, but protected partially against high glucose + palmitate-induced cellular death. The highly selective Nox4 inhibitor GLX7013114 protected islet cells against both cytokines and high glucose + palmitate. However, as no osmotic control for high glucose was used, we cannot exclude the possibility that the high glucose effect was due to osmosis. It is concluded that Nox4 may participate in stress-induced islet cell death in human islets in vitro. We propose that Nox4 mediates pro-apoptotic effects in intact islets under stressful conditions and that selective Nox4-inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy in type 2 .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713651>Novel Mechanisms Modulating Palmitate-Induced Inflammatory Factors in Hypertrophied 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by AMPK.</a></h2><p>A growing body of evidence indicates that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contributes to not only energy metabolic homeostasis but also the inhibition of inflammatory responses. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To elucidate the role of AMPK, in this study, we observed the effects of AMPK activation on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) release in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes.We observed signal transduction pathways regulating MCP-1, which increased in obese adipocytes, in an  model of hypertrophied 3T3-L1 adipocytes preloaded with palmitate.Palmitate-preloaded cells exhibited significant increase in MCP-1 release and triglyceride (TG) deposition. Increased MCP-1 release and TG deposition were significantly decreased by an AMPK activator. In addition, the AMPK activator not only markedly diminished MCP-1 secretion but also augmented phosphorylation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In contrast, MCP-1 release suppression was abolished by the AMPK inhibitor compound C and the MEK inhibitor U0126.MCP-1 release from hypertrophied adipocytes is suppressed by AMPK activation through the NF-B and ERK pathways. These findings provide evidence that AMPK plays a crucial role in ameliorating obesity-induced inflammation.</p></html>
