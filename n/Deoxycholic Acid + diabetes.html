Here, we summarize the effect of obesity on NASH and how it has a cascading effect on cardiovascular dysfunction. We also review the current and emerging treatment options for NASH.The link between NASH and cardiac dysfunction has been further delineated in recent studies demonstrating endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and increased coronary artery calcification in patients with known NASH. Standard treatment of obesity with lifestyle interventions including diet, exercise, and behavioral modification has been shown to improve NASH as well as reduce cardiovascular dysfunction. In addition to FDA-approved drugs like vitamin E and pioglitazone, several agents including NGM282, obeticholic , elafibranor, and liraglutide are currently being investigated for their therapeutic potential in NASH. Recent studies show that bariatric surgery results in significant improvement or resolution of NASH.Obesity is a major factor in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to steatohepatitis. Patients with NAFLD have a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk. For biopsy-proven NASH, vitamin E and pioglitazone are the recommended medical treatments in addition to lifestyle modification.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26212118>The role of the bile  chenodeoxycholic  in the targeted oral delivery of the anti-diabetic drug gliclazide, and its applications in type 1 .</a></h2><p>Gliclazide (G) is used to treat type 2  (T2D), and also has anti-platelet, anti-radical, and anti-inflammatory effects. G has poor water solubility and high inter-individual variations in absorption, limiting its application in type 1  (T1D). The bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), has permeation-enhancing effects. Sodium alginate (SA) was used to microencapsulate G and CDCA to produce control (G-SA) and test (G-CDCA-SA) microcapsules. Both microcapsules showed uniform structure, morphology, and good stability profiles. CDCA reduced G-release at pH 7.8, while G-release was negligible at lower pH values in both microcapsules. CDCA incorporation resulted in less swelling and stronger microcapsules, suggesting improved stability.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26782298>Beneficial effect of farnesoid X receptor activation on metabolism in a diabetic rat model.</a></h2><p>Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an important regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis. However, the exact role of FXR in  remains to be fully elucidated. The present study examined the effects of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an agonist of FXR, on metabolism profile in a rat model of type 2  (T2DM). Male Wistar rats (8‑week‑old; n=40) were randomized into the following four groups (n=10): Untreated control, CDCA‑treated, T2DM, and CDCA‑treated T2DM. To establish the T2DM model, the rats were fed a high‑fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks and received a single low‑dose intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg), followed by an additional 4 weeks of HFD feeding. CDCA was administrated (10 mg/kg/d) intraperitoneally for 10 days. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays were performed to determine the RNA and protein expression of FXR, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, G6Pase, proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1 and short heterodimer partner in rat liver tissue. The results revealed that FXR activation by CDCA did not reduce body weight, but it lowered the plasma levels of fasting glucose, insulin and triglycerides in the T2DM rats. CDCA administration reversed the downregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of FXR in the T2DM rat liver tissue samples. Furthermore, treatment with CDCA reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose 6‑phosphatase and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor‑γ coactivator‑1 in the liver tissue samples of the T2DM rats. By contrast, CDCA treatment increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of short heterodimer partner in the liver tissue samples of the T2DM rats. In conclusion, FXR agonist treatment induces beneficial effects on metabolism in the rat T2DM model. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the FXR agonist may be useful for the treatment of T2DM and hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27824743>Managing Recurring Obstetric Cholestasis With Metformin.</a></h2><p>Obstetric cholestasis is a pregnancy-related disorder associated with an adverse pregnancy outcome.

Serum BAs were assayed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.At 24 weeks, HbA1c was significantly reduced in both groups, but the HbA1c levels were lower in the OW/OB than NW group. Moreover, significant decreases were seen at 24 weeks in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, waist circumference, and systolic blood pressure in the OW/OB group. Interestingly, cholic , glycocholic , glycochenodeoxycholic , glycodeoxycholic  (GDCA), and glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) were increased in both groups after treatment, whereas chenodeoxycholic  and  (DCA) were specifically increased in the OW/OB group. Increased DCA and GDCA concentrations were significantly associated with decreased HbA1c or fasting blood glucose and CRP levels, whereas increased GDCA and GUDCA concentrations were associated with decreased waist circumference in the OW/OB group during treatment. In the NW group, increased GUDCA concentrations were significantly associated with a decrease in HbA1c.Type 2  patients with OW/OB exhibited greater improvement in glycemic control and additional metabolic benefits after saxagliptin treatment.

This is a life-threatening infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Primary cutaneous disease may occur following traumatic implantation of spores, or use of contaminated bandages, or as a complication of extensive burns, diabetic acidosis and other specific immunocompromised conditions. The clinical spectrum is highly non-specific and is often triggered by seemingly innocuous trauma. The superficial vesicles or patchy erythema rapidly degrade to haemorrhagic necrosis and rapidly progressive gangrenous lesion. The problem with diagnosing mucormycosis remains, therefore, that the condition has poor clinical indicators and requires reliance on microscopy and fungal culture. Management starts with a clinical suspicion, taking into account the risk factors and lack of response to first-line agents, as well as an aggressive clinical course. Treatment is multimodal, with medical correction of the risk factors and optimisation of limiting factors, such as , neutropenia and immunosuppressants. Treatment generally involves radical and repetitive surgical debridement, intravenous amphotericin B with monitoring of the nephrotoxicity, along with adjuvant modalities, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, colony stimulating factor, interferons gamma and white blood cell transfusion. Successful courses of therapy typically last 4-6 weeks and require cumulative doses that are equivalent to >2g of amphotericin B deoxycholate.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589195>Outcome of Rhino-Sinus Mucormycosis in Children with Type 1 .</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007849>NOD1 and NOD2 signalling links ER stress with inflammation.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major contributor to inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn disease and type 2 . ER stress induces the unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. Inflammation is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear which PRRs have a major role in inducing inflammation during ER stress. Here we show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are important mediators of ER-stress-induced inflammation in mouse and human cells. The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion. Inflammation and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor. The association of NOD1 and NOD2 with pro-inflammatory responses induced by the IRE1α/TRAF2 signalling pathway provides a novel link between innate immunity and ER-stress-induced inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846919>Intestinal bile  receptors are key regulators of glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>In addition to their well-known function as dietary lipid detergents, bile acids have emerged as important signalling molecules that regulate energy homeostasis. Recent studies have highlighted that disrupted bile  metabolism is associated with metabolism disorders such as dyslipidaemia, intestinal chronic inflammatory diseases and obesity. In particular, type 2  (T2D) is associated with quantitative and qualitative modifications in bile  metabolism. Bile acids bind and modulate the activity of transmembrane and nuclear receptors (NR). Among these receptors, the G-protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5) and the NR farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are implicated in the regulation of bile , lipid, glucose and energy homeostasis. The role of these receptors in the intestine in energy metabolism regulation has been recently highlighted. More precisely, recent studies have shown that FXR is important for glucose homeostasis in particular in metabolic disorders such as T2D and obesity.

Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying obesity was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of obesity, as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation of receptor sensitivity, obesity may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883669>Metformin treatment prevents gallstone formation but mimics porcelain gallbladder in C57Bl/6 mice.</a></h2><p>Gallstone disease (GD) is highly correlated with  and its related illnesses including type II diabetes (DMII) and polycystic ovary  (PCOS). While previous studies claimed that metformin decreases the chance of developing GD in PCOS patients, this phenomenon has not been investigated in animal models to date. Here we fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 2% of cholesterol and 1% of cholic  to ten-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice for 105 days. The groups were as follows: Low fat diet; HFD; HFD + Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) (day 1-105); HFD + Metformin (day 1-105); HFD + Metformin (Met) (day 64-105). All drugs were administered by oral gavage (Met = 300 mg/kg & UDCA = 750 mg/kg). Serum lipid profile and gross organ examination were performed after euthanasia. A microscopic evaluation of the paraffin-embedded gallbladders was done after hematoxylin & eosin and Von Kossa staining. HFD successfully induces gallstone (4 out of 4 of the HFD members). While both UDCA and metformin (d 1-105) prevented gallstone formation and cholecystitis, Metformin (d 64-105) group had a few small stones. Additionally, metformin induces mucosal calcification in gallbladder (porcelain GB) of more than 80% of the HFD + Met (day 1-105) and HFD + Met (day 64-105) groups, collectively, which can be a potential problem by itself. While metformin shows a noticeable benefit towards GB health by reducing the chance for gallstone formation, if it induces porcelain gallbladder in humans as well, it might inflict patients with preventable medical charges.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Cholesterol gallstone disease is one of the most prevalent digestive diseases, leading to considerable financial and social burden worldwide. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the only bile  drug approved by FDA for the non-surgical treatment of gallstones. However, the molecular link between UDCA and CGD is unclear. Previous data suggest that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile  nuclear receptor, may protect against the development of CGD. In studies aimed at identifying the role of FXR, we recently identify a novel chemical tool, 6EUDCA (6-αethyl-ursodeoxycholic ), a synthetic derivative of UDCA, for studying FXR. We found that 6EUDCA binds FXR stronger than UDCA in a TR-FRET binding assay. This result was supported by computational docking models that suggest 6EUDCA forms a more extensive hydrogen bound network with FXR. Interestingly, neither compound could activate FXR target genes in human nor mouse liver cells, suggesting UDCA and 6EUDCA activate non-genomic signals in an FXR-dependent manner. Overall these studies may lead to the identification of a novel mechanism by which bile acids regulate cell function, and 6EUDCA may be an effective targeted CGD therapeutic.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

Clinical presentation varies, but typically includes infant-onset chronic diarrhea, juvenile-onset bilateral cataracts, and later-onset tendinous xanthomas and progressive neurological dysfunction. CYP27A1 plays an essential role in side-chain oxidation of cholesterol necessary for the synthesis of the bile , chenodeoxycholic , and perturbations in this gene that reduce enzyme activity result in elevations of cholestanol. It is commonly held that CTX is exceedingly rare, but epidemiological studies are lacking. In order to provide an accurate incidence estimate of CTX, we studied the ExAC cohort of ~60,000 unrelated adults from global populations to determine the allele frequency of the 57 variants in CYP27A1 reported pathogenic for CTX. In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analyses on these CTX-causing variants and determined a bioinformatics profile to predict variants that may be pathogenic but have not yet been reported in the CTX patient literature. An additional 29 variants were identified that met bioinformatics criteria for being potentially pathogenic. Incidence was estimated based allele frequencies of pathogenic CTX variants plus those determined to be potentially pathogenic. One variant, p.P384L, previously reported in three unrelated CTX families had an allele frequency ≥ 1% in European, Latino and Asian populations. Three additional mutations had a frequency of ≥ 0.1% in Asian populations. CTX disease incidence was calculated excluding the high frequency p.P384L and separately using a genetic paradigm where this high frequency variant only causes classic CTX when paired in trans with a null variant. These calculations place CTX incidence ranging from 1:134,970 to 1:461,358 in Europeans, 1:263,222 to 1:468,624 in Africans, 1:71,677 to 1:148,914 in Americans, 1:64,267 to 1:64,712 in East Asians and 1:36,072 to 1:75,601 in South Asians. This work indicates CTX is under-diagnosed and improved patient screening is needed as early intervention prevents disease progression.Copyright © 2015.

Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for , CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut microbiota is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and  health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut microbiota is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in  health. Similarly, the gut microbiota renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce  disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate  health through the gut microbiota and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29313296>The biological effects of the hypolipidaemic drug probucol microcapsules fed daily for 4 weeks, to an insulin-resistant mouse model: potential hypoglycaemic and anti-inflammatory effects.</a></h2><p>Probucol (PB) is an hypolipidaemic drug with potential antidiabetic effects. We showed recently using in vitro studies that when PB was incorporated with stabilising lipophilic bile acids and microencapsulated using the polymer sodium alginate, the microcapsules showed good stability but poor and irregular PB release. This suggests that PB microcapsules may exhibit better release profile and hence better absorption, if more hydrophilic bile acids were used, such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). Accordingly, this study aimed to produce PB-UDCA microcapsules and examine PB absorption and antidiabetic effects in our mouse-model of insulin-resistance and  (fed high-fat diet; HFD). The study also aimed to examine the effects of the microcapsules on the bile  profile. Healthy mice (fed low-fat diet; LFD) were used as control. Seventy mice were randomly allocated into seven equal groups: LFD, HFD given empty microcapsules, HFD given metformin (M), HFD given standard-dose probucol (PB-SD), HFD given high-dose probucol (PB-H), HFD given UDCA microcapsules and HFD given PB-UDCA microcapsules. Blood glucose (BG), inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-17), plasma cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids and triglycerides were analysed together with plasma bile  and probucol concentrations. PB-UDCA microcapsules reduced BG in HFD mice, but did not reduce inflammation or improve lipid profile, compared with positive control (HFD) group. Although PB-UDCA microcapsules did not exert hypolipidaemic or antiinflammatory effects, they resulted in significant hypoglycaemic effects in a mouse model of insulin resistance, which suggests potential applications in insulin-resistance and glucose haemostasis.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26999661>Ursodeoxycholic  and 4-phenylbutyrate prevent endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced podocyte apoptosis in diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting from the accumulation of misfolded and/or unfolded proteins in ER membranes, is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ER stress inhibitors ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) in the treatment of DN in db/db mice. Findings have revealed that diabetic db/db mice were more hyperglycemic than their non-diabetic controls, and exhibited a marked increase in body weight, water intake, urine volume, fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, glucose and insulin tolerance. UDCA (40 mg/kg/day) or 4-PBA (100 mg/kg/day) treatment for 12 weeks resulted in an improvement in these biochemical and physical parameters. Moreover, UDCA or 4-PBA intervention markedly decreased urinary albuminuria and attenuated mesangial expansion in diabetic db/db mice, compared with db/db mice treated with vehicle. These beneficial effects of UDCA or 4-PBA on DN were associated with the inhibition of ER stress, as evidenced by the decreased expression of BiP, phospho-IRE1α, phospho-eIF2α, CHOP, ATF-6 and spliced X-box binding protein-1 in vitro and in vivo. UDCA or 4-PBA prevented hyperglycemia-induced or high glucose (HG)-induced apoptosis in podocytes in vivo and in vitro via the inhibition of caspase-3 and caspase-12 activation. Autophagy deficiency was also seen in glomeruli in diabetic mice and HG-incubated podocytes, exhibiting decreased expression of LC3B and Beclin-1, which could be restored by UDCA or 4-PBA treatment. Taken together, our results have revealed an important role of ER stress in the development of DN, and UDCA or 4-PBA treatment may be a potential novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of DN.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29941869>Magnesium lithospermate B improves the gut microbiome and bile  metabolic profiles in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) is a new drug marketed in China to treat angina, but its low oral bioavailability limits its clinical application to the intravenous route. Paradoxically, orally administered low-dose MLB was found to alleviate kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In recent years, the kidney-gut axis has been suspected to be involved in kidney damage pathogenesis, potentially representing a non-classical pathway for pharmacologic intervention. To ascertain whether MLB targets the kidney-gut axis, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were prepared as a mouse model of DN. The STZ mice were treated with MLB (50 mg kg d, p.o.) for 8 weeks. Twenty-four-hour urinary albumin was detected to mirror kidney function. At week 4, 6, 8, feces were collected; bile acids (BAs) were quantified to examine the alterations in the BA metabolic profiles, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced to identify alterations in gut microbial composition. In STZ mice, 24-h urinary albumin levels and total fecal BAs, especially cholic acids (CAs) and  acids (DCAs) were greatly increased, and the gut microbiome was dramatically shifted compared with control mice. Oral administration of MLB significantly decreased 24-h urinary albumin levels and total BAs, CAs and DCAs, and reversed CA:TCA (taurocholic ) and DCA:CA ratios. It also changed the microbiome composition in STZ mice based on operational units. Thus the therapeutic effect of MLB on kidney injury might be attributed (at least partially) to its ability to modulate the disordered gut microbiome and BA metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26425885>Chenodeoxycholic  as a Potential Prognostic Marker for Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Chinese Obese Patients.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) have been suggested as key mediators of the improvements in glucose metabolism after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).The objective of the study was to test whether the individual or a group of BAs have potential value to predict  remission after RYGB.A retrospective cohort of 38 Chinese obese patients with type 2  (T2DM) who had undergone RYGB and a cross-sectional cohort of 327 subjects from the Shanghai Obesity Study were involved in the study.We applied a targeted metabolomics approach to quantitatively measure 26 serum BAs. The relative proportion of each BA in total BAs was calculated.In the metabolic surgery study, RYGB was effective in the reduction of body weight in both remission and nonremission groups. The reductions of body mass index (BMI) in both groups were 7.34 ± 2.10 kg/m(2) and 6.31 ± 2.38 kg/m(2), respectively (P = .14). Patients in the remission group had a shorter duration of , lower glycated hemoglobin, and higher C-peptide and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) proportion at baseline compared with the nonremission group.

Bile acids (BAs) bind to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and energy expenditure. The present study aimed to determine associations between the circulating BAs and the skeletal muscle volume (SMV), and lipid and glucose metabolism in patients with NAFLD. Methods Serum BAs and metabolic parameters were measured in 55 patients with NAFLD (median age, 55 years). The changes (Δ) in serum BA (ΔBA) and metabolic parameters were determined in 17 patients (male, n=10; female, n=7) who received nutritional counseling for 12 months. Results Spearman's test revealed that the levels of 12α-hydroxysterol (12α-OH) BAs, including  (DCA), were inversely correlated with the SMV of the upper and lower limbs and the total SMV. A multivariate analysis revealed that the level of DCA was correlated with a reduced total SMV, whereas non-12α-OH BAs, including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), were correlated with an increased SMV of the lower limbs. Changes in CDCA were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs, and inversely correlated with the Δwaist-hip ratio and Δtotal cholesterol. Changes in the total non-12α-OH BA level were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs. Conclusion Circulating BAs were associated with SMV. The 12α-OH BAs, including DCA were associated with reduced SMV levels, whereas non-12α-OH BAs including CDCA were associated with increased SMV levels.

Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2  (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established obesity.

The chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) ameliorates maladaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling and experimental dNP. Additionally, TUDCA activates the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is highly expressed in tubular cells.

FXR inhibition with Z-guggulsterone or vivo-morpholino targeting of FXR diminished the ER-stabilizing and renoprotective effects of TUDCA. Notably, these  approaches abolished tubular but not glomerular protection by TUDCA. Combined intervention with TUDCA and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in 16-week-old db/db mice reduced albuminuria more efficiently than did either treatment alone. Although both therapies reduced glomerular damage, only TUDCA ameliorated tubular damage. Thus, interventions that specifically protect the tubular compartment in dNP, such as FXR agonism, may provide renoprotective effects on top of those achieved by inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045272>Stimulation of apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter expands the bile  pool and generates bile acids with positive feedback properties.</a></h2><p>Bile  synthesis has been considered a prototype for how a physiological process is controlled by end product feedback inhibition. By this feedback inhibition, bile  concentrations are kept within safe ranges. However, careful examination of published rodent data strongly suggests that bile  synthesis is also under potent positive feedback control by hydrophilic bile acids.Current concepts on the regulation of bile  synthesis are derived from mouse models. Recent data have shown that mice have farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic bile acids capable of quenching responses elicited by FXR agonistic bile acids. This is important to recognize to understand the regulation of bile  synthesis in the mouse, and in particular to clarify if mouse model findings are valid also in the human situation.In addition to classic end product feedback inhibition, regulation of bile  synthesis in the mouse largely appears also to be driven by changes in hepatic levels of murine bile acids such as α- and β-muricholic acids. This has not been previously recognized. Stimulated bile  synthesis or induction of the apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter in the intestine, increase the availability of chenodeoxycholic  in the liver, thereby promoting hepatic conversion of this bile  into muricholic acids. Recognition of these mechanisms is essential for understanding the regulation of bile  synthesis in the mouse, and for our awareness of important species differences in the regulation of bile  synthesis in mice and humans.2015 S.

Limited evidence show that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has some anti-hypertensive effects. However, the potential effect of UDCA on hypertension induced by type-2 diabetic insulin resistance has not been reported. In C57Bl6 wild-type mice, insulin resistance was induced by the chronic ingestion of diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFF). HFF mice were randomized to treatment with UDCA or candersartan incorporated into the diet to achieve an ingested dose of approximately 70 mg/kg/day of UDCA or 3 mg/kg/day respectively. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured with tail-cuff method. At 4 weeks of dietary treatment systolic and diastolic blood pressure were comparable in HFF and low-fat (LF) control mice. Co-administration of candesartan at 4 weeks significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, UDCA showed no anti-hypertensive effect at 4 weeks. At 24 weeks of dietary intervention, HFF fed mice had substantially elevated systolic blood pressure compared to LF controls. The provision of UDCA substantially attenuated the dietary HFF induced increase in systolic blood pressure concomitant with significantly lower plasma angiotensin II. The anti-hypertensive effect of UDCA in HFF mice was comparable to candesartan. The data suggests that long term supplementation of UDCA effectively lowers hypertension in a dietary induced model of type-2 diabetic insulin resistance.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30337151>Altered bile  profile associates with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease-An emerging role for gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and a specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing.In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic  [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, , and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of :CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut-liver-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to weight and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty  oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224065>ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress and aggravates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of , and the dysfunction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in its pathogenesis. ERp44, an ER resident chaperone protein, has been implicated in the modulation of ER stress, however, its role and mechanism in DN are not determined. Here, we show that ERp44 expression is upregulated in the glomeruli of db/db mice, a rodent model of type 2 . When ERp44 is depleted by in vivo shRNA-mediated knockdown, the features associated with DN including albuminuria level and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness are aggravated, therefore suggesting a detrimental role of ERp44 depletion in DN progression. We further show that ERp44 depletion exacerbates ER stress in DN in db/db mice, and that attenuating ER stress with the chemical chaperone TUDCA remarkably diminishes the aggravated DN features caused by ERp44 depletion. These results suggest that the exacerbated ER stress is a critical factor for the detrimental effect of ERp44 depletion on DN progression in db/db mice. Thus, our study links the role of ERp44 in DN with ER stress regulation and may offer a potential therapeutic strategy to interfere DN progression.Copyright © 2018.

The primary endpoint was the effect of supplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were insulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver fat content, body composition, body fat distribution, faecal microbiota composition and serum bile acids.Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12 weeks did not affect HbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or microbiota composition. Participants who received the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile   (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in the between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who responded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher microbial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after supplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with improvement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12 weeks did not affect HbA1c in people with type 2  on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved insulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high diversity of the gut microbiota at baseline may be important.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27758768>Farnesoid X Receptor and Its Ligands Inhibit the Function of Platelets.</a></h2><p>Although initially seemingly paradoxical because of the lack of nucleus, platelets possess many transcription factors that regulate their function through DNA-independent mechanisms. These include the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a member of the superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, that has been identified as a bile  receptor. In this study, we show that FXR is present in human platelets and FXR ligands, GW4064 and 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic , modulate platelet activation nongenomically.FXR ligands inhibited the activation of platelets in response to stimulation of collagen or thrombin receptors, resulting in diminished intracellular calcium mobilization, secretion, fibrinogen binding, and aggregation. Exposure to FXR ligands also reduced integrin αβ outside-in signaling and thereby reduced the ability of platelets to spread and to stimulate clot retraction. FXR function in platelets was found to be associated with the modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in platelets and associated downstream inhibitory signaling. Platelets from FXR-deficient mice were refractory to the actions of FXR agonists on platelet function and cyclic nucleotide signaling, firmly linking the nongenomic actions of these ligands to the FXR.This study provides support for the ability of FXR ligands to modulate platelet activation. The atheroprotective effects of GW4064, with its novel antiplatelet effects, indicate FXR as a potential target for the prevention of atherothrombotic disease.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485902>Vasonatrin peptide attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and underlying mechanisms.</a></h2><p> increases morbidity/mortality of ischemic heart disease. Although atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide reduce the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion damage in nondiabetic rats, whether vasonatrin peptide (VNP), the artificial synthetic chimera of atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide, confers cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, especially in diabetic patients, is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of VNP on ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and to further elucidate its mechanisms. The high-fat diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion operation. VNP treatment (100 μg/kg iv, 10 min before reperfusion) significantly improved the instantaneous first derivation of left ventricle pressure (±LV dP/dtmax) and LV systolic pressure and reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, apoptosis index, caspase-3 activity, plasma creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Moreover, VNP inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by suppressing glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). These effects were mimicked by 8-bromine-cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a cGMP analog, whereas they were inhibited by KT-5823, the selective inhibitor of PKG. In addition, pretreatment with tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a specific inhibitor of ER stress, could not further promote the VNP's cardioprotective effect in diabetic rats. In vitro H9c2 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and incubated with or without VNP (10(-8) mol/l). Gene knockdown of PKG1α with siRNA blunted VNP inhibition of ER stress and apoptosis, while overexpression of PKG1α resulted in significant decreased ER stress and apoptosis. VNP protects the diabetic heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting ER stress via the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. These results suggest that VNP may have potential therapeutic value for the diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30409782>TGR5 Activation Promotes Stimulus-Secretion Coupling of Pancreatic β-Cells via a PKA-Dependent Pathway.</a></h2><p>The Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) mediates physiological actions of bile acids. Since it was shown that TGR5 is expressed in pancreatic tissue, a direct TGR5 activation in β-cells is currently postulated and discussed. The current study reveals that oleanolic  (OLA) affects murine β-cell function by TGR5 activation. Both a G inhibitor and an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase (AC) prevented stimulating effects of OLA. Accordingly, OLA augmented the intracellular cAMP concentration. OLA and two well-established TGR5 agonists, RG239 and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), acutely promoted stimulus-secretion coupling (SSC). OLA reduced K current and elevated current through Ca channels. Accordingly, in mouse and human β-cells, TGR5 ligands increased the cytosolic Ca concentration by stimulating Ca influx. Higher OLA concentrations evoked a dual reaction, probably due to activation of a counterregulating pathway. Protein kinase A (PKA) was identified as a downstream target of TGR5 activation. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase did not prevent stimulating effects of OLA. Involvement of exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2) or farnesoid X receptor (FXR2) was ruled out by experiments with knockout mice. The proposed pathway was not influenced by local glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion from α-cells, shown by experiments with MIN6 cells, and a GLP-1 receptor antagonist. In summary, these data clearly demonstrate that activation of TGR5 in β-cells stimulates insulin secretion via an AC/cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway, which is supposed to interfere with SSC by affecting K and Ca currents and thus membrane potential.© 2018 by the American  Association.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859856>Takeda G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5-Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Signaling Contributes to the Increment of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Production after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.</a></h2><p>The mechanism by which Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) increases the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) remains incompletely defined. Here we investigated whether TGR5-mTORC1 signaling mediates the RYGB-induced alteration in GLP-1 production in mice and human beings.Circulating bile acids, TGR5-mTORC1 signaling, GLP-1 synthesis and secretion were determined in lean or obese male C57BL/6 mice with or without RYGB operation, as well as in normal glycemic subjects, obese patients with type 2  before and after RYGB.Positive relationships were observed among circulating bile acids, ileal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and GLP-1 during changes in energy status in the present study. RYGB increased circulating bile acids, ileal Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and mTORC1 signaling activity, as well as GLP-1 production in both mice and human subjects. Inhibition of ileal mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the stimulation of bile  secretion, TGR5 expression and GLP-1 synthesis induced by RYGB in lean and diet-induced obese mice. GLP-1 production and ileal TGR5-mTORC1 signaling were positively correlated with plasma  (DCA) in mice. Treatment of STC-1 cells with DCA stimulated the production of GLP-1. This effect was associated with a significant enhancement of TGR5-mTORC1 signaling. siRNA knockdown of mTORC1 or TGR5 abolished the enhancement of GLP-1 synthesis induced by DCA. DCA increased interaction between mTOR-regulatory-associated protein of mechanistic target of rapamycin (Raptor) and TGR5 in STC-1 cells.-TGR5-mTORC1 signaling contributes to the up-regulation of GLP-1 production after RYGB.Copyright © 2018.

Both bile acids and steroid hormones, especially glucocorticoids, play important roles in regulating body metabolism and energy expenditure. Currently, our understanding on AKR1D1 regulation and its roles in  diseases is limited. We found that AKR1D1 expression was markedly repressed in diabetic patients. Consistent with repressed AKR1D1 expression, hepatic bile acids were significantly reduced in diabetic patients. Mechanistic studies showed that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) transcriptionally down-regulated AKR1D1 expression in vitro in HepG2 cells and in vivo in mice. Consistently, PPARα signaling was enhanced in diabetic patients. In summary, dysregulation of AKR1D1 disrupted bile  and steroid hormone homeostasis, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes.

However, the detailed action mechanisms of UDCA in atherosclerosis are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated whether UDCA exerts anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting ER stress and "receptor for advanced glycation endproduct" (RAGE) signaling. UDCA markedly reduced ER stress, RAGE expression, and pro-inflammatory responses [including NF-κB activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production] induced in endothelial cells (ECs) by high glucose (HG). In particular, UDCA inhibited HG-induced ROS production by increasing the Nrf2 level. In macrophages, UDCA also blocked HG-induced RAGE and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibited foam cell formation via upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. In the diabetic mouse model, UDCA inhibited atheromatous plaque formation by decreasing ER stress, and the levels of RAGE and adhesion molecules. In conclusion, UDCA exerts an anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting both ER stress and RAGE signaling.

NAFLD has such an epidemic prevalence as to make it impossible to screen general population looking for NAFLD cases. Conversely, focusing on those cohorts of individuals exposed to the highest risk of NAFLD could be a more rational approach. NAFLD, which can be diagnosed with either non-invasive strategies or through liver biopsy, is a pathogenically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. The existence of  as opposed to genetic-associated disease, notably including "lean NAFLD" has recently been recognized. Moreover, NAFLD is a systemic condition, featuring , cardiovascular and (hepatic/extra-hepatic) cancer risk. Among the clinico-laboratory features of NAFLD we discuss hyperuricemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, gallstones, psoriasis and selected endocrine derangements. NAFLD is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and  and progressive liver disease develops in T2D patients in whom the course of disease is worsened by NAFLD. Finally, lifestyle changes and drug treatment options to be implemented in the individual patient are also critically discussed. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the new concepts on clinical and pathogenic heterogeneity of NAFLD, a systemic disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis and protean clinical manifestations. It is highly prevalent in certain cohorts of individuals who are thus potentially amenable to selective screening strategies, intensive follow-up schedules for early identification of liver-related and extrahepatic complications and in whom earlier and more aggressive treatment schedules should be carried out whenever possible.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171596>Effect of 4-Phenylbutyric  and Tauroursodeoxycholic  on Magnesium and Calcium Metabolism in Streptozocin-Induced Type 1 Diabetic Mice.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence has identified a role of micronutrients, such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca), in glycemic control. 4-Phenylbutyric  (PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) are molecular chaperones that can improve protein folding and alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

OCA limited Wt adipose expansion, altered morphometry in favor of small adipocytes, enhanced expression of genes indicating adipose browning, and reduced crown-like structure number in visceral adipose tissue. foz/foz mice showed more crown-like structures in all compartments; OCA failed to alter adipose morphometry, browning, inflammation, or improve NASH severity, even at 10 mg/kg.OCA improved adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and steatosis in a milder metabolic phenotype but failed to improve these factors in morbidly obese diabetic mice. These results help explain OCA's limited efficacy to reverse human NASH.© 2016 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts  and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Anthropometric, hormonal, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp data were also examined to identify physiological parameters associated with bile  changes.Fasting total plasma bile acids increased after RYGB; however, increases were bimodal and were observed only at 1 (P < .05) and 24 months (P < .01). One-month increases were secondary to surges in ursodeoxycholic  and its glycine and taurine conjugates, bacterially derived bile acids with putative insulin-sensitizing effects. Increases at 24 months were due to gradual rises in primary unconjugated bile acids as well as  and its glycine conjugate. Plasma bile  changes were not significantly associated with any anthropometric or hormonal measures, although hepatic insulin sensitivity was significantly improved at 1 month.Overall findings suggest that bacterially derived bile acids may mediate the early improvements at 1 month after RYGB.

We have shown that FXR and TGR5 have renoprotective roles in - and obesity-related kidney disease. Here, we determined whether these effects are mediated through differential or synergistic signaling pathways. We administered the FXR/TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 to DBA/2J mice with streptozotocin-induced , db/db mice with type 2 , and C57BL/6J mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity. We also examined the individual effects of the selective FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 in diabetic mice. The FXR agonist OCA and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 modulated distinct renal signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment of diabetic DBA/2J and db/db mice with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 improved proteinuria and prevented podocyte injury, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. INT-767 exerted coordinated effects on multiple pathways, including stimulation of a signaling cascade involving AMP-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, PGC-1, sirtuin 3, estrogen-related receptor-, and Nrf-1; inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress; and inhibition of enhanced renal fatty  and cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, in mice with diet-induced obesity, INT-767 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and kidney fibrosis determined by second harmonic imaging microscopy. These results identify the renal signaling pathways regulated by FXR and TGR5, which may be promising targets for the treatment of nephropathy in  and obesity.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120081>Bile  metabolites in early pregnancy and risk of gestational  in Chinese women: A nested case-control study.</a></h2><p>Bile  metabolism plays an important role in metabolism but it is uncertain whether bile  metabolites in early pregnancy are associated with risk of gestational  (GDM).We organized a 1:1 case-control study nested in a prospective cohort of 22,302 pregnant women recruited from 2010 to 2012 in China: 243 women with GDM were matched with 243 non-GDM controls on age (±1 year).

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth weight, glucose intolerance, obesity, and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high-fat diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and microbiota composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced obesity in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting insulin, and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal microbiota correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with resistance to the weight-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation.

Klb mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed (increased) bile  (BA) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, fed a chow diet focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived , classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity through direct action (mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms (mediating FGF15 signaling that maintains BA level and composition).</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28624576>Agreement Between Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction Measurements and Pathologist-Assigned Steatosis Grades of Liver Biopsies From Adults With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>We assessed the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) proton density fat fraction (PDFF) in grading hepatic steatosis and change in hepatic steatosis in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a multi-center study, using central histology as reference.We collected data from 113 adults with NASH participating in a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial to compare the efficacy cross-sectionally and longitudinally of obeticholic  vs placebo. Hepatic steatosis was assessed at baseline and after 72 weeks of obeticholic  or placebo by liver biopsy and MRI (scanners from different manufacturers, at 1.5T or 3T). We compared steatosis estimates by PDFF vs histology. Histologic steatosis grade was scored in consensus by a pathology committee. Cross-validated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed.At baseline, 34% of subjects had steatosis grade 0 or 1, 39% had steatosis grade 2, and 27% had steatosis grade 3; corresponding mean PDFF values were 9.8%±3.7%, 18.1%±4.3%, and 30.1%±8.1%. PDFF classified steatosis grade 0-1 vs 2-3 with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98), and grade 0-2 vs grade 3 steatosis with an AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). PDFF cut-off values at 90% specificity were 16.3% for grades 2-3 and 21.7% for grade 3, with corresponding sensitivities of 83% and 84%. After 72 weeks' of obeticholic vs placebo, 42% of subjects had a reduced steatosis grade (mean reduction in PDFF from baseline of 7.4%±8.7%), 49% had no change in steatosis grade (mean increase in PDFF from baseline of 0.3%±6.3%), and 9% had an increased steatosis grade (mean increase in PDFF from baseline of 7.7%±6.0%). PDFF change identified subjects with reduced steatosis grade with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.91) and increased steatosis grade with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.63-0.99). A PDFF reduction of 5.15% identified subjects with reduced steatosis grade with 90% specificity and 58% sensitivity, whereas a PDFF increase of 5.6% identified those with increased steatosis grade with 90% specificity and 57% sensitivity.Based on data from a phase 2 randomized controlled trial of adults with NASH, PDFF estimated by MRI scanners of different field strength and at different sites, accurately classifies grades and changes in hepatic steatosis when histologic analysis of biopsies is used as a reference.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

However, the effects of once-daily intake of RS on postprandial hypertriglyceridemia remain poorly characterized. In this study, the effects of a single administration of cornstarch-derived RS on postprandial increases in blood triglyceride levels were investigated in rats using oral fat tolerance/loading tests. Following the administration of lipid meals, increases in serum triglycerides levels were significantly reduced in rats fed corn oil containing 500mg/mL RS. Moreover, fecal lipid volumes and wet weights following lipid meals were significantly greater in rats fed corn oil containing 500mg/mL RS than in the corn oil only group, confirming the inhibition of dietary fat absorption. Finally, a significant positive correlation was observed between fecal lipid contents and wet weights in rats administered RS.

In rat beta cells, cytokine-induced ER stress involves NO production and consequent inhibition of the ER Ca(2+) transporting ATPase sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump 2 (SERCA2B). However, the mechanisms by which cytokines induce ER stress and apoptosis in mouse and human pancreatic beta cells remain unclear. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of ER stress on cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis in these three species and thus solve ongoing controversies in the field.Rat and mouse insulin-producing cells, human pancreatic islets and human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed to the cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, with or without NO inhibition. A global comparison of cytokine-modulated gene expression in human, mouse and rat beta cells was also performed. The chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and suppression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were used to assess the role of ER stress in cytokine-induced apoptosis of human beta cells.NO plays a key role in cytokine-induced ER stress in rat islets, but not in mouse or human islets. Bioinformatics analysis indicated greater similarity between human and mouse than between human and rat global gene expression after cytokine exposure. The chemical chaperone TUDCA and suppression of CHOP or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protected human beta cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis.These observations clarify previous results that were discrepant owing to the use of islets from different species, and confirm that cytokine-induced ER stress contributes to human beta cell death, at least in part via JNK activation.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29055774>Functional nanoparticles exploit the bile  pathway to overcome multiple barriers of the intestinal epithelium for oral insulin delivery.</a></h2><p>Oral absorption of protein/peptide-loaded nanoparticles is often limited by multiple barriers of the intestinal epithelium. In addition to mucus translocation and apical endocytosis, highly efficient transepithelial absorption of nanoparticles requires successful intracellular trafficking, especially to avoid lysosomal degradation, and basolateral release. Here, the functional material, -conjugated chitosan, is synthesized and loaded with the model protein drug insulin into -modified nanoparticles (DNPs). The DNPs designed in this study are demonstrated to overcome multiple barriers of the intestinal epithelium by exploiting the bile  pathway. In Caco-2 cell monolayers, DNPs are internalized via apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter (ASBT)-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, insulin degradation in the epithelium is significantly prevented due to endolysosomal escape of DNPs. Additionally, DNPs can interact with a cytosolic ileal bile -binding protein that facilitates the intracellular trafficking and basolateral release of insulin. In rats, intravital two-photon microscopy also reveals that the transport of DNPs into the intestinal villi is mediated by ASBT. Further pharmacokinetic studies disclose an oral bioavailability of 15.9% in type I diabetic rats after loading freeze-dried DNPs into enteric-coated capsules. Thus, -modified chitosan nanoparticles can overcome multiple barriers of the intestinal epithelium for oral delivery of insulin.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The bile--activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile , lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses, barrier function and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 . In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in physiology of the digestive system and the related diseases.

In this study, we investigated if translation of this formulation to microencapsulation of primary β-cells harvested from mature double-transgenic healthy mice would also generate stable microcapsules with good cell viability.Islets of Langerhans were isolated from Ngn3-GFP/RIP-DsRED mice by intraductal collagenase P digestion and density gradient centrifugation, dissociated into single cells and the β-cell population purified by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting. β-cells were microencapsulated using either alginate-poly-l-ornithine (F1; control) or alginate-poly-l-ornithine-UDCA (F2; test) formulations. Microcapsules were microscopically examined and microencapsulated cells were analyzed for viability, insulin and cytokine release, 2 days post-microencapsulation.Microcapsules showed good uniformity and morphological characteristics and even cell distribution within microcapsules with or without UDCA. Two days post microencapsulation cell viability, mitochondrial ATP and insulin production were shown to be optimized in the presence of UDCA whilst production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β was reduced. Contradictory to our previous studies, UDCA did not reduce production of any other pro-inflammatory biomarkers.These results suggest that UDCA incorporation improves microcapsules' physical and morphological characteristics and improves the viability and function of encapsulated mature primary pancreatic β-cells.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30273669>Chemical chaperone-conjugated exendin-4 as a cytoprotective agent for pancreatic β-cells.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress has been considered a major cause of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis leading to . Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor activation and chemical chaperones have been known to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve β-cell function and survival. The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic -conjugated exendin-4 as a protective agent for pancreatic β-cells. Mono-tauroursodeoxycholic -Lys-exendin-4 conjugate (TUM1-Ex4) showed better receptor binding affinity than other conjugates with strong in vitro insulinotropic activity in rat pancreatic β-cells and in vivo hypoglycemic activity in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In INS-1 cells under endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by thapsigargin, TUM1-Ex4 promoted cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. In western blot analysis, TUM1-Ex4 reduced the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker GRP78 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. These results reveal that TUM1-Ex4 accelerates translational recovery and contributes to β-cell protection and survival.

In this study, we investigated the role of TGR5 in renal water handling and the underlying molecular mechanisms.We used tubule suspensions of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells from rat kidneys to investigate the effect of TGR5 signaling on aquaporin-2 (AQP2) expression, and examined the  effects of TGR5 in mice with lithium-induced nephrogenic  (NDI) and  knockout ( ) mice.Activation of TGR5 by lithocholic  (LCA), an endogenous TGR5 ligand, or INT-777, a synthetic TGR5-specific agonist, induced AQP2 expression and intracellular trafficking in rat IMCD cells  a cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway. In mice with NDI, dietary supplementation with LCA markedly decreased urine output and increased urine osmolality, which was associated with significantly upregulated AQP2 expression in the kidney inner medulla. Supplementation with endogenous FXR agonist had no effect. In primary IMCD suspensions from lithium-treated rats, treatment with INT-767 (FXR and TGR5 dual agonist) or INT-777, but not INT-747 (FXR agonist), increased AQP2 expression.   mice exhibited an attenuated ability to concentrate urine in response to dehydration, which was associated with decreased AQP2 expression in the kidney inner medulla.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in  disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters.

Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice.

Experiments in rodents with trained exercise have shown that exercise improves vascular function and reduces vascular inflammation by modulating the balance between nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. However, the upstream regulator of exercise-induced vascular benefits is unclear. We aimed to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in exercise-induced vascular functional improvement. We show that PPARδ is a crucial mediator for exercise to exert a beneficial effect on the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. In db/db mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas and flow-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries, whereas genetic ablation of Ppard abolished such improvements. Exercise induces AMPK activation and subsequent PPARδ activation, which help to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, thus increasing NO bioavailability in endothelial cells and vascular tissues. Chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric  and tauroursodeoxycholic  decrease ER stress and protect against endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. The results demonstrate that PPARδ-mediated inhibition of ER stress contributes to the vascular benefits of exercise and provides potentially effective targets for treating diabetic vasculopathy.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26818840>The Influence of Stabilized Deconjugated Ursodeoxycholic  on Polymer-Hydrogel System of Transplantable NIT-1 Cells.</a></h2><p>The encapsulation of pancreatic β-cells in biocompatible matrix has generated great interest in  treatment.

The diabetic model (DM) was induced through the administration of 10% fructose in drinking water for 2 weeks followed by streptozotocin injection (intraperitoneal). One week later, hyperglycemia was assisted and diabetic animals were treated with UDCA either as local eye drops (0.5% solution, four times/day) or orally (100 mg/kg b.w.). Cataract formation was monitored biweekly and scored into four stages. After 12 weeks of treatment, rats were subjected to ophthalmological examination, and then, their blood and lenses were prepared for biochemical analysis of glucose, insulin, reduced glutathione, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, caspase-12, and lenticular total proteins. In addition, tertiary structure and conformational changes of lenticular soluble proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and UV absorption while changes in lenticular α-crystallin structure were investigated using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Results demonstrated that both local and oral UDCA restored the normal levels of lens T-AOC, MDA, H O , and caspase-12 and improved noticeably the levels of the lens GSH and total proteins. In addition, conformational and tertiary structure changes of soluble lens proteins were significantly reduced in UDCA-treated groups. Morphological examination of lenses revealed decreased score of cataract progression in UDCA-treated groups compared to DM animals. It was concluded that UDCA decreased the incidence of diabetic cataract by maintaining the antioxidant status, reducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress, and suppressing the structural changes of soluble lens proteins.© 2018 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238527>Interferon alpha impairs insulin production in human beta cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>Despite substantial advances in the research exploring the pathogenesis of Type 1  (T1D), the pathophysiological mechanisms involved remain unknown. We hypothesized in this study that interferon alpha (IFNα) participates in the early stages of T1D development by triggering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To verify our hypothesis, human islets and human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed to IFNα and tested for ER stress markers, glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and insulin content. IFNα treatment induced upregulation of ER stress markers including Binding immunoglobulin Protein, phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, spliced- X-box binding protein-1, C/EBP homologous protein and activating transcription factor 4. Intriguingly, IFNα treatment did not impair GSIS but significantly decreased insulin production in both human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells. Furthermore, IFNα decreased the expression of both proinsulin convertase 1 and proinsulin convertase 2, suggesting an altered functional state of the beta cells characterized by a slower proinsulin-insulin conversion. Pretreatment of both human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells with chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric  and tauroursodeoxycholic  completely prevented IFNα effects, indicating an ER stress-mediated impairment of insulin production. We demonstrated for the first time that IFNα elicits ER stress in human beta cells providing a novel mechanistic role for this virus-induced cytokine in the development of T1D. Compounds targeting molecular processes altered in ER-stressed beta cells could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent IFNα-induced beta cell dysfunction in the early onset of T1D.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the efficacy of obeticholic  in adult patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.We did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomised clinical trial at medical centres in the USA in patients with non-cirrhotic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to assess treatment with obeticholic  given orally (25 mg daily) or placebo for 72 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a computer-generated, centrally administered procedure, stratified by clinical centre and  status. The primary outcome measure was improvement in centrally scored liver histology defined as a decrease in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score by at least 2 points without worsening of fibrosis from baseline to the end of treatment. A planned interim analysis of change in alanine aminotransferase at 24 weeks undertaken before end-of-treatment (72 weeks) biopsies supported the decision to continue the trial (relative change in alanine aminotransferase -24%, 95% CI -45 to -3). A planned interim analysis of the primary outcome showed improved efficacy of obeticholic  (p=0·0024) and supported a decision not to do end-of-treatment biopsies and end treatment early in 64 patients, but to continue the trial to obtain the 24-week post-treatment measures.

In the present study, we determined the in vivo contribution of EGFRtk and ER stress in acute myocardial infarction induced by acute ischemia (40 min)-reperfusion (24 h) (I/R) injury in T2D (db/db) mice. We treated db/db mice with EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Mice were then subjected to myocardial I/R injury. The db/db mice developed a significant infarct after I/R injury. The inhibition of EGFRtk significantly reduced the infarct size and ER stress induction. We also determined that the inhibition of ER stress (tauroursodeoxycholic , TUDCA, 150 mg/kg per day) in db/db significantly decrease the infarct size indicating that ER stress is a downstream mechanism to EGFRtk. Moreover, AG1478 and TUDCA reduced myocardium p38 and ERK1/2 MAP-kinases activity, and increased the activity of the pro-survival signaling cascade Akt. Additionally, the inhibition of EGFRtk and ER stress reduced cell apoptosis and the inflammation as indicated by the reduction in macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. We determined for the first time that the inhibition of EGFRtk protects T2D heart against I/R injury through ER stress-dependent mechanism. The cardioprotective effect of EGFRtk and ER stress inhibition involves the activation of survival pathway, and inhibition of apoptosis, and inflammation. Thus, targeting EGFRtk and ER stress has the potential for therapy to overcome myocardial infarction in T2D.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646933>Current and upcoming pharmacotherapy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Given the high prevalence and rising incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the absence of approved therapies is striking. Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The steroidal core of BAs constitutes a saturated cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene skeleton, consisting of three six-membered (A, B, and C) and one five-membered ring (D). Primary BAs are produced in the hepatocytes, while secondary BAs are formed by modifying the primary BAs in the intestinal lumen, i.e., by the reactions of 7α-dehydroxylation and deconjugation of cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The most important secondary BAs are  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA). The BAs realize their effects through nuclear farnesoid X receptors (FXRs) and membrane TGR5 receptors. It has been found that BAs are also associated with other receptors such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR), from which the most significant ligand is calcitriol, as well as with pregnane X receptor (PXR) and potentially with the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), whose ligands are numerous, structurally different xenobiotics that show greater affinity to BAs. The BAs as therapeutic agents (drugs) have the potential to produce beneficial effects in cases of sexually transmitted diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis, gallstones, digestive tract diseases, cystic fibrosis, and cancer. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PBC. In this paper, the different pathways of bile  biosynthesis are explained as well as chemical modifications and the synthesis of different keto derivatives of BAs.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in diabetic nephropathy. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is an effective inhibitor of ER stress. Here, we investigated the role of TUDCA in the progression of tubular injury in DN. For eight weeks, being treated with TUDCA at 250 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) twice a day, diabetic db/db mice had significantly reduced blood glucose, albuminuria and attenuated renal histopathology. These changes were associated with a significant decreased expression of ER stress markers. At the same time, diabetic db/db mice had more TUNEL-positive nuclei in the renal tubule, which were attenuated by TUDCA treatment, along with decreases in ER stress-associated apoptotic markers in the kidneys. In summary, the effect of TUDCA on tubular injury, in part, is associated with inhibition of ER stress in the kidneys of diabetic db/db mice.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in the onset of diabetic nephropathy. We hypothesize that ER stress inhibition could protect against kidney injury through anti-oxidative effects. To test whether block ER stress could attenuate oxidative stress and improve diabetic nephropathy in vivo and in vitro, the effect of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, on spontaneous diabetic nephropathy db/db mice, ER stress inducer or high glucose-triggered podocytes were studied. Mice were assigned to 3 groups (n=6 per group): control group (treated with vehicle), db/db group (treated with vehicle), and UDCA group (db/db mice treated with 40 mg/kg/d UDCA). After 8 weeks treatment, mice were sacrificed. Blood and kidneys were collected for the assessment of albumin/creatinine ratio, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), oxidized LDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA), the expressions of SOD isoforms and glutathione peroxidase 1, as well as histopathological examination. In addition, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by 2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence. The results showed that UDCA alleviated renal ER stress-evoked cell death, oxidative stress, renal dysfunction, ROS production, upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and suppressed Bax in vivo and in vitro.

In this study, we investigated the effects of the conjugated bile  TUDCA on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic β-cells.Pancreatic islets were isolated from 90-day-old male mice. Insulin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay, protein phosphorylation by western blot, Ca(2+) signals by fluorescence microscopy and ATP-dependent K(+) (KATP) channels by electrophysiology.TUDCA dose-dependently increased GSIS in fresh islets at stimulatory glucose concentrations but remained without effect at low glucose levels. This effect was not associated with changes in glucose metabolism, Ca(2+) signals or KATP channel activity; however, it was lost in the presence of a cAMP competitor or a PKA inhibitor. Additionally, PKA and CREB phosphorylation were observed after 1-hour incubation with TUDCA. The potentiation of GSIS was blunted by the Gα stimulatory, G protein subunit-specific inhibitor NF449 and mimicked by the specific TGR5 agonist INT-777, pointing to the involvement of the bile  G protein-coupled receptor TGR5.Our data indicate that TUDCA potentiates GSIS through the cAMP/PKA pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations.

The mechanism of action of AngII was further investigated using isolated murine islets and clonal β cells. We show that AngII triggers ER stress, an increase in the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and promotes β-cell dysfunction in murine islets of Langerhans both in vivo and ex vivo. These effects were significantly attenuated by TUDCA, an inhibitor of ER stress.

DR rats' model was established by an administration of high-glucose-fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30mg/kg). The cell supernatant and rats' serum were collected for the assays of NO content by ELISA kits. Retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe pathological changes. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in rat retinas. Furthermore, western blot analysis was carried out to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in high glucose-induced HRMECs.After treating with TUDCA, high glucose-induced HRMECs proliferation could be significantly inhibited. TUDCA (5.0μM, 25.0μM and 125.0μM) could decrease NO content in high glucose-induced HRMECs. Furthermore, TUDCA (500mg/kg/d and 250mg/kg/d) also decrease NO content in serum of DR rats. Additionally, both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that the over-expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF were significantly decreased by TUDCA.The data indicated that TUDCA could ameliorate DR by decreasing NO content and down-regulating the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF.

However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression.

However, as a result, patients at the highest risk can wait the longest for effective treatment. We determined whether UDCA response can be accurately predicted using pretreatment clinical parameters.We did logistic regression analysis of pretreatment variables in a discovery cohort of patients in the UK with primary biliary cholangitis to derive the best-fitting model of UDCA response, defined as alkaline phosphatase less than 1·67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), measured after 12 months of treatment with UDCA. We validated the model in an external cohort of patients with primary biliary cholangitis and treated with UDCA in Italy. Additionally, we assessed correlations between model predictions and key histological features, such as biliary injury and fibrosis, on liver biopsy samples.2703 participants diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis between Jan 1, 1998, and May 31, 2015, were included in the UK-PBC cohort for derivation of the model. The following pretreatment parameters were associated with lower probability of UDCA response: higher alkaline phosphatase concentration (p<0·0001), higher total bilirubin concentration (p=0·0003), lower aminotransferase concentration (p=0·0012), younger age (p<0·0001), longer interval from diagnosis to the start of UDCA treatment (treatment time lag, p<0·0001), and worsening of alkaline phosphatase concentration from diagnosis (p<0·0001). Based on these variables, we derived a predictive score of UDCA response. In the external validation cohort, 460 patients diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis were treated with UDCA, with follow-up data until May 31, 2016. In this validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the score was 0·83 (95% CI 0·79-0·87). In 20 liver biopsy samples from patients with primary biliary cholangitis, the UDCA response score was associated with ductular reaction (r=-0·556, p=0·0130) and intermediate hepatocytes (probability of response was 0·90 if intermediate hepatocytes were absent vs 0·51 if present).We have derived and externally validated a model based on pretreatment variables that accurately predicts UDCA response. Association with histological features provides face validity. This model provides a basis to explore alternative approaches to treatment stratification in patients with primary biliary cholangitis.UK Medical Research Council and University of Milan-Bicocca.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic  (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714405>Emerging Targets to Relieve Fat Stress-Induced Liver Diseases: UDCA, Tocotrienol, ω-3 PUFAs, and IgY Targeted NPC1L1 Cholesterol Transporter.</a></h2><p>Fat stress-induced liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome initiated by excess fat accumulation and encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a precursor lesion progressing to more aggressive liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the incidence of these fat stress-induced liver diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide in parallel with the growing epidemics of obesity and metabolic diseases, its exact pathogenesis is not well defined. Although obesity, sedentary life-style, altered dietary pattern, insulin resistance, altered intestinal barrier function, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been acknowledged as contributing factors because of the indefinite pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, the only reliable treatment is lifestyle intervention composed of restrictive diet and exercise. Additionally, some existing medications such as pioglitazone and antioxidants such as vitamin E were reported to be effective; in this review, several novel agents especifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis under clinical trial will be introduced. These include an NPC1L1 blocker (ezetimibe), which significantly improved histological and symptomatic scores associated with steatohepatitis and fibrosis; clofibrate, phentoxyfylline, ursodeoxycholic , and tocopherol, all of which are prescribed to relieve fat stress; and additional IgY targeted NPC1L1, tocotrienol, ursodeoxycholic , and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are actively under investigation to confirm the safety of long-term use.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28420334>Mucormycosis in renal transplant recipients: review of 174 reported cases.</a></h2><p>Mucormycosis is a highly lethal fungal infection especially in immunocompromised individuals.In order to review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of mucormycosis in renal transplant recipients we searched publications of mucormycosis cases in renal transplant recipients in PUBMED database up to December 2015.A total of 174 cases in renal transplant recipients were included in this review. Most of the cases (76%) were male. Major underlying diseases were  (43.1%). Rhinocerebral was the most common site of infection (33.3%). Rhizopus species was the most frequent fungus (59.1%) in patients with pathogen identified to species level. The mortality rates of disseminated mucormycosis (76.0%) and graft renal (55.6%) were higher than infection in other sites. The overall survival in patients received surgical debridement combined with amphotericin B/posaconazole (70.2%) was higher than those who received antifungal therapy alone (32.4%), surgery alone (36.4%) or without therapy (0%) (p < 0.001). The overall survivals in patients receiving posaconazole and lipid amphoterincin B were higher than that receiving deoxycholate formulation (92.3% and 73.4% vs 47.4%).Mucormycosis is a severe infection in renal transplant recipients. Surgical debridement combined with antifungals, especially liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole, can significantly improve patient's overall survival.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634226>Reduction of Hypothalamic Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Activates Browning of White Fat and Ameliorates Obesity.</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American  Association.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28145001>Treatment with the natural FXR agonist chenodeoxycholic  reduces clearance of plasma LDL whilst decreasing circulating PCSK9, lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein C-III.</a></h2><p>The natural farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) suppresses hepatic cholesterol and bile  synthesis and reduces biliary cholesterol secretion and triglyceride production. Animal studies have shown that bile acids downregulate hepatic LDL receptors (LDLRs); however, information on LDL metabolism in humans is limited.Kinetics of autologous  I-LDL were determined in 12 male subjects at baseline and during treatment with CDCA (15 mg kg day ). In seven patients with gallstones treated with CDCA for 3 weeks before cholecystectomy, liver biopsies were collected and analysed for enzyme activities and for specific LDLR binding. Serum samples obtained before treatment and at surgery were analysed for markers of lipid metabolism, lipoproteins and the LDLR modulator proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).Chenodeoxycholic  treatment increased plasma LDL cholesterol by ~10% as a result of reduced clearance of plasma LDL-apolipoprotein (apo)B; LDL production was somewhat reduced. The reduction in LDL clearance occurred within 1 day after initiation of treatment. In CDCA-treated patients with gallstones, hepatic microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase activities were reduced by 83% and 54%, respectively, and specific LDLR binding was reduced by 20%. During treatment, serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 and total and LDL cholesterol increased, whereas levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, lathosterol, PCSK9, apoA-I, apoC-III, lipoprotein(a), triglycerides and insulin were reduced.Chenodeoxycholic  has a broad influence on lipid metabolism, including reducing plasma clearance of LDL. The reduction in circulating PCSK9 may dampen its effect on hepatic LDLRs and plasma LDL cholesterol. Further studies of the effects of other FXR agonists on cholesterol metabolism in humans seem warranted, considering the renewed interest for such therapy in liver disease and .© 2017 The Authors.
