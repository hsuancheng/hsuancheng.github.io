<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15678755>Fatty  composition of serum, adipose tissue, and liver in rats fed diets containing corn oil or cottonseed oil.</a></h2><p>There have been few studies on the effect of cottonseed oil (CSO), one of the most commonly used vegetable oils in the United States, on indices of  status either in the rat or in any other species. Previous studies with rats have focused on the effect of CSO, versus that of other vegetable oils, on the concentration of cholesterol in serum and liver or on a limited number of fatty  in serum, adipose tissue, or liver. The present study was designed to compare more fully than in previous studies the effect of CSO to that of corn oil (CO) on the fatty  composition of serum, adipose tissue, and liver. Two groups of male rats (n = 10 each) were used, each fed one of two purified diets containing 100 g/kg of either CO or CSO. Between-group differences included higher values (mol% total fatty ) in adipose tissue for palmitic  and stearic , but lower values in serum, adipose tissue, and liver for cis-vaccenic  and oleic  (C18:1n-9) for the CSO group than the CO. In addition, values in serum, adipose tissue, and liver for alpha-linolenic  (C18:3n-3) and its metabolite, docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3), were lower for the CSO group than the CO. There was no effect of diet on serum or tissue levels of n-6 fatty  (linoleic , dihomo- , and arachidonic ). Differences in fatty  compositions noted, e.g., those for C18:ln-9 and C22:6n-3, mainly reflected compositional differences between the two oils. Thus, use of CSO rather than CO affected serum and tissue concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) but had no effect on n-6 PUFA status.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12608744>Arachidonic -induced channel- and carrier-type ion transport across planar bilayer  membranes.</a></h2><p>Transmembrane ion transport by arachidonic  (AA) through bilayer  membranes (BLMs) was investigated by means of electrochemical measurements to provide a basis for designing a sensor membrane. We found that AA induces a channel-type current, in addition to a carrier-type current, across planar BLMs. A linear relation between the logarithmic value of the AA concentration and the current responses (given as integrated currents) was observed for a carrier-type current, while a sigmoid relation was found for a channel-type current. Although AA transports Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and exhibits ion selectivity between Na+ and Mg2+ for the carrier-type current, ion transport for the channel-type current was non-selective. It was found that ion transport via the channel mechanism occurs frequently for AA, while channel-type currents were only occasionally observed for   and prostaglandin D2. No channel-type currents were induced by other fatty  (oleic, linoleic, stearic, myristic, eicosapentanoic and docosahexanoic ) and metabolites of AA (12-HETE and 5-HETE). The carrier-type ion transport occurs selectively to these compounds if the concentration is below 1.0 microM. These results suggest that AA selectively facilitates an ion flux through the BLMs, generating channel-type and/or carrier-type currents, which can be used as a measure of the AA concentration.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24701948>The effects of salinity on the growth and biochemical properties of Chlamydomonas mexicana GU732420 cultivated in municipal wastewater.</a></h2><p>A freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas mexicana was grown on municipal wastewater with different levels of salinity up to 400 mmol/L NaCl, and the biochemical properties were characterized after 10 days of cultivation. C. mexicana showed the higher specific growth rates for 100 and 200mmol/L NaCl. Nitrogen was completely removed within 10 days as a result of algal growth promoted by the addition of 200-400 mmol/L NaCl. Phosphorus removal increased from 77-84% as the concentration of NaCI increased from 100 to 400 mmol/L. The highest removal of total inorganic carbon (66%) was obtained with the addition of 200 mmol/L NaCl. The  content increased from 17% to 38% as the concentration of NaCl increased from 0 to 400mmol/L. The total fatty  content and glycerol yield of C. mexicana increased 1.8- and 4-fold in wastewater amended with NaCl, respectively. Fatty  accumulated in the algal biomass were mainly composed of palmitic (27-29%),  (27-30%), and linolelaidic  (16-18%). The optimal condition for fatty  production in C. mexicana was observed when the municipal wastewater was amended with 100-200 mmol/L NaCl with a simultaneous removal of nutrients.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14571796>Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of a diet supplemented with sesamin on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.</a></h2><p>The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of sesamin (a non-fat constituent of sesame oil) have been attributed to an increased accumulation of dihomo- , a precursor of 1-series prostaglandins, and the decreasing production of proinflammatory 2-series prostaglandins and 4-series leukotrienes by inhibiting the delta-5 desaturase activity. We investigated the effects of a diet containing sesamin on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.After feeding rats either a basal diet (control group) or a diet supplemented with sesamin (sesamin group) for 14 days, the rats underwent 60 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion. The phospholipid   composition of both  and lung tissue specimens were then analyzed. The plasma levels of leukotriene B4 and PCOOH (phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide) were also determined.The consumption of the dietary sesamin resulted in a significant increase in the dihomo-  content in the tissue phospholipids of the  and lung specimens. The amounts of polyunsaturated   in the lungs subjected to the ischemia-reperfusion injury were well preserved in the animals from the sesamin group. Despite a lack of differences in the levels of arachidonic , the plasma levels of leukotriene B4 in the rats fed dietary sesamin (88 +/- 15 pg) tended to be lower (P = 0.07) than those fed the control diet (110 +/- 20 pg). Furthermore, the plasma concentrations of PCOOH in the sesamin group (130 +/- 62 pmol) were also significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those in the control group (223 +/- 33 pmol).These findings indicate that a diet containing sesamin may thus reduce hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by inducing both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15678755>  composition of serum, adipose tissue, and  in rats fed diets containing corn oil or cottonseed oil.</a></h2><p>There have been few studies on the effect of cottonseed oil (CSO), one of the most commonly used vegetable oils in the United States, on indices of lipid status either in the rat or in any other species.
