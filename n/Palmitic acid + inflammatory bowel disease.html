We hypothesized that unsaturated FA could alleviate saturated FA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurring in intestinal secretory goblet cells, and consequently the reduced synthesis and secretion of mucins that form the protective mucus barrier. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated well-differentiated human colonic LS174T goblet cells with  (PAL)-the most commonly used inducer of lipotoxicity in in vitro systems-or -9, -6, or -3 unsaturated fatty acids alone or in co-treatment with PAL, and measured the impact of such treatments on ER stress and Muc2 production. Our results showed that only eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids protect goblet cells against ER stress-mediated altered Muc2 secretion induced by PAL, whereas neither linolenic  nor -9 and -6 FA are able to provide such protection. We conclude that EPA and DHA could represent potential therapeutic nutrients against the detrimental lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids, associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity or . These in vitro data remain to be explored in vivo in a context of dietary obesity.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19222903>Novel formulation of solid lipid microparticles of curcumin for anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activity for optimization of therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>This project was undertaken with a view to optimize the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease through a novel drug delivery approach for localized treatment in the colon. Curcumin has poor aqueous solubility, poor stability in the gastrointestinal tract and poor bioavailability. The purpose of the study was to prepare and evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) of curcumin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in a -induced rat model by a colon-specific delivery approach.We have developed a novel formulation approach for treating experimental  in the rat model. SLMs of curcumin were prepared with various lipids, such as , stearic  and soya lecithin, with an optimized percentage of poloxamer 188. The SLMs of curcumin were characterized for particle size, drug content, drug entrapment, in-vitro release, surface morphology and infrared, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray studies. The colonic delivery system of SLM formulations of curcumin were further investigated for their anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activity using chick embryo and rat  models.Particle size, drug content, drug entrapment and in-vitro release studies showed that formulation F4 containing one part stearic  and 0.5% surfactant had the smallest diameter of 108 microm, 79.24% entrapment and exhibited excellent in-vitro release characteristics when compared with other formulations and pure curcumin. SLMs of curcumin (F4) proved to be a potent angio-inhibitory compound, as demonstrated by inhibition of angiogenesis in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Rats treated with curcumin and its SLM complex showed a faster weight gain compared with dextran sulfate solution (DSS) control rats. The increase in whole colon length appeared to be significantly greater in SLM-treated rats when compared with pure curcumin and DSS control rats. An additional finding in the DSS-treated rats was chronic cell infiltration with predominance of eosinophils. Decreased mast cell numbers in the mucosa of the colon of SLMs of curcumin and pure curcumin-treated rats was observed.The degree of  caused by administration of DSS was significantly attenuated by colonic delivery of SLMs of curcumin. Being a nontoxic natural dietary product, curcumin could be useful in the therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease patients.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153718>HADHA, the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, is involved in long-chain fatty -induced autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Genome-wide association studies have identified autophagy-related susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, whether autophagy regulators can be utilized as therapeutic targets remains unclear. To identify novel microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-interacting proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), we isolated primary IECs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 mice. We performed immunoprecipitation with a GFP antibody and then analyzed co-immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry. HADHA was identified as an LC3-interacting protein from primary IECs. The HADHA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Given that HADHA catalyzes the last three steps of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, we investigated whether long-chain fatty acids induce autophagy in IECs. We found that  induced autophagy in DLD-1, HT29, and HCT116 cells. HADHA was expressed in not only the mitochondria but also the cytosol. LC3 puncta co-localized with HADHA, which were enhanced by  stimulation. However, LC3 puncta did not co-localize with Tom20, suggesting that HADHA was induced to associate with LC3 puncta at sites other than the mitochondria. Thus, HADHA may have extra-mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, we found that  induced cell death in IECs, which was accelerated by bafilomycin A and chloroquine. These findings suggested that -induced autophagy supports the survival of IECs. Taken together, these results suggested that HADHA is involved in long-chain fatty -induced autophagy in IECs, thus providing new insights into the pathology of IBD and revealing novel therapeutic targets of IBD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the effect of PEA in a mouse model of functional accelerated transit which persists after the resolution of colonic inflammation (post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome).Intestinal inflammation was induced by intracolonic administration of oil of mustard (OM). Mice were tested for motility and biochemical and molecular biology changes 4 weeks later. PEA, oleoylethanolamide and endocannabinoid levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and receptor and enzyme mRNA expression by qRT-PCR.OM induced transient  and a functional post-inflammatory increase in upper gastrointestinal transit, associated with increased intestinal anandamide (but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol, PEA or oleoylethanolamide) levels and down-regulation of mRNA for TRPV1 channels. Exogenous PEA inhibited the OM-induced increase in transit and tended to increase anandamide levels.  had a weaker effect on transit. Inhibition of transit by PEA was blocked by rimonabant (CB1 receptor antagonist), further increased by 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (TRPV1 antagonist) and not significantly modified by the PPARα antagonist GW6471.Intestinal endocannabinoids and TRPV1 channel were dysregulated in a functional model of accelerated transit exhibiting aspects of post-inflammatory irritable bowel syndrome. PEA counteracted the accelerated transit, the effect being mediated by CB1 receptors (possibly via increased anandamide levels) and modulated by TRPV1 channels.© 2014 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27766756>Lactobacillus johnsonii glycolipids, their structure and immunoreactivity with sera from inflammatory bowel disease patients.</a></h2><p>Structural studies of the major glycolipids produced by two Lactobacillus johnsonii (LJ) strains, LJ 151 isolated from intestinal tract of healthy mice and LJ 142 isolated from mice with experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), were performed. Two major glycolipids, GL1 and GL2, were present in lipid extracts from L. johnsonii 142 and 151 strains. Glycolipid GL1 has been identified as β-D-Glcp-(1→6)-α-D-Galp-(1→2)-α-D-Glcp-diglyceride and GL2 as α-D-Galp-(1→2)-α-D-Glcp-diglyceride. The main fatty  residues identified by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were , stearic and lactobacillic acids. Besides structural elucidation of the major glycolipids, the aim of this study was to determine the immunochemical properties of these glycolipids and to compare their immunoreactivity to that of polysaccharides obtained from the same strains. Sera from rabbits immunized with bacterial cells possessed much higher serological reactivity with polysaccharides than with glycolipids. Inversely, reactivity of the glycolipids with human sera from patients with IBD was much higher than that determined for the polysaccharides, while reactivity of glycolipids with human sera from healthy individuals was much lower than one measured for the polysaccharides. Results indicate that glycoconjugates from Lactobacillus cell wall act as antigens and may represent new IBD diagnostic biomarkers.© 2016 The Authors.

Palmatine is a herb derived isoquinoline alkaloid with potent anti-inflammatory and anti-bacteria activities. In present study, we evaluated the effect of palmatine on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice  and examined whether its effect is exerted by promoting mitophagy-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation. The result showed that palmatine (40, 100 mg/kg) significantly prevented bodyweight loss and colonic shortening in DSS mice, and reduced the disease activity index and histopathologic score. The levels of MPO, IL-1β, TNF-α and the number of F4/80+ cells in colon of DSS mice were remarkably decreased by palmatine. Moreover, palmatine suppressed NLRP3 inflammasomes activation, but enhanced the expression of the mitophagy-related proteins involving LC3, PINK1 and Parkin in colonic tissue of DSS mice. These effects was consistent with the in vitro data revealing that palmatine inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, while promoted the expression and mitochondrial recruitment of PINK1 and Parkin in THP-1 cell differentiated macrophages. Furthermore, the effect of palmatine on THP-1 cells was neutralized by a mitophagy inhibitor Cyclosporin A (CsA) and PINK1-siRNA. In parallel, CsA significantly attenuated the therapeutic effect of palmatine in DSS mice, illustrating that the anti- effect of palmatine is closely related to mitophagy. Taken together, the current results demonstrated that palmatine protected mice against DSS-induced  by facilitating PINK1/Parkin-driven mitophagy and thus inactivating NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of the current study was to explore the effects of adelmidrol, an analog of the anti-inflammatory fatty  amide signaling molecule palmitoylethanolamide, in mice subjected to experimental . Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of  induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic . Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic  administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression. This study clearly demonstrates that adelmidrol exerts important anti-inflammatory effects that are partly dependent on PPARγ, suggesting that this molecule may represent a new pharmacologic approach for inflammatory bowel disease treatment.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19285259>Role of acylethanolamides in the gastrointestinal tract with special reference to food intake and energy balance.</a></h2><p>Acylethanolamides (AEs) are a group of lipids occurring in both plants and animals. The best-studied AEs are the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), the anti-inflammatory compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and the potent anorexigenic molecule oleoylethanolamide (OEA). AEs are biosynthesized in the gastrointestinal tract, and their levels may change in response to noxious stimuli, food deprivation or diet-induced obesity. The biological actions of AEs within the gut are not limited to the modulation of food intake and energy balance. For example, AEs exert potential beneficial effects in the regulation of intestinal motility, secretion, inflammation and cellular proliferation. Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA). Modulation of AE levels in the gut may provide new pharmacological strategies not only for the treatment of feeding disorders but also for the prevention or cure of widespread intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7775867>Modulation in delta 9, delta 6, and delta 5 fatty  desaturase activity in the human intestinal CaCo-2 cell line.</a></h2><p>We report the influence of media lipids, growth in lipid-poor medium, and cell differentiation on delta 9, delta 6, and delta 5 desaturase activity in the human CaCo-2 enterocyte cell line. We also describe the level of incorporation of  (16:0), linoleic (18:2n-6), and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids (20:5n-3) and their higher homologues into cytosolic and membrane lipids during long-term (10 days) medium supplementation in fully differentiated 16- to 18-day-old cultures. CaCo-2 monolayers reached confluency by day 6 with subsequent development of microvilli and maximal expression of microvillus membrane sucrose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransaminase occurring between days 16 and 23 after plating. There was evidence of the presence and modulation of delta 9, delta 6, and delta 5 desaturase activity (delta 9 > delta 6 > delta 5). delta 6 Desaturase activity decreased approximately 2-fold between days 6 and 24 of culture and when the fetal bovine serum concentration was increased from 0.5% to 25%; in contrast, when cells were starved for 72 h, activity increased 5.4-fold. When the media was supplemented with either linoleic  and/or EPA, both delta 6 and delta 5 desaturase activities were inhibited, the greatest reduction of delta 5 desaturase activity occurring with EPA. Incorporation of media fatty acids plus their desaturase and elongase products was highly dependent on medium composition with the homologues of delta 9 > delta 6 > delta 5. Supplementation of cellular media with 100 microM EPA for 10 days decreased membrane phosphatidylethanolamine arachidonic  level from 13.2 to 8.9%.

The clinical relevance of these observations on lipid dietary modification for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease is still uncertain but these observations suggest that the beneficial effects of EPA supplements on human ulcerative  may be due to a reduction in enterocyte arachidonic  content by down-regulation of delta 6 and delta 5 desaturase activity.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8186338>Short report: zinc sulphate supplementation corrects abnormal erythrocyte membrane long-chain fatty  composition in patients with Crohn's .</a></h2><p>Patients with Crohn's  may become zinc-deficient and, in such patients, an altered metabolism of radiolabelled long-chain fatty acids has been reported.

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and oleic  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified.

This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the -related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti-inflammatory effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411504>High-fat diet promotes experimental  by inducing oxidative stress in the colon.</a></h2><p>Diets high in animal fats are associated with increased risks of inflammatory bowel disease, but the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental  in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental  model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe  compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) tight junction regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture,  or  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger.

The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation.
