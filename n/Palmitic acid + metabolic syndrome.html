Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the  such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of  (C16:0) or oleic  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with oleic  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic  and oleic  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on  susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Most of the cases are due to mutations in the ERCC6 gene, which encodes the protein CSB. CSB is involved in several functions including DNA repair and transcription. Here we describe two Danish brothers with CS. Both patients carried a novel splice site mutation (c.2382+2T>G), and a previously described nonsense mutation (c.3259C>T, p.Arg1087X) in a biallelic state. Both patients presented the cardinal features of the disease including microcephaly, congenital cataract and postnatal growth failure. In addition, their fibroblasts were hypersensitive to UV irradiation and exhibited increased superoxide levels in comparison to fibroblasts from healthy age and gender matched individuals. Metabolomic analysis revealed a distinctive  profile in cells from the CS patients compared to control cells. Among others, α-ketoglutarate, hydroxyglutarate and certain amino acids (ornithine, proline and glycine) were reduced in the CS patient fibroblasts, whereas glycolytic intermediates (glucose-6-phosphate and pyruvic ) and fatty acids (, stearic and myristic ) were increased. Our data not only provide additional information to the database of CS mutations, but also point towards targets for potential treatment of this devastating disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Previous data demonstrated that low circulating levels of tumour necrosis factor weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) were associated with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, all traits associated with an increased risk of NALFD. Circulating sTWEAK levels are expected to be reduced in the presence of NAFLD.We aimed to explore the relationship between NAFLD and circulating sTWEAK levels in obese patients, and to evaluate the effect of sTWEAK on hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation.Design setting and patients:This is an observational case-control study performed in n=112 severely obese patients evaluated for NAFLD by abdominal ultrasound and n=32 non-obese patients without steatosis. Serum sTWEAK concentrations were measured by ELISA. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine the independent predictors of NAFLD. We analysed TWEAK and Fn14 protein expression in liver biopsies by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. An immortalized primary human hepatocyte cell line (HHL) was used to evaluate the effect of sTWEAK on triglyceride accumulation.We observed a reduction in serum circulating sTWEAK concentrations with the presence of liver steatosis. On multivariable analysis, lower sTWEAK concentrations were independently associated with the presence of NAFLD (odds ratio (OR)=0.023; 95% confidence interval: 0.001-0.579; P<0.022). In human hepatocytes, sTWEAK administration reduced fat accumulation as demonstrated by the reduction in -induced accumulation of triglyceride and the decreased expression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and perilipin 1 and 2 (PLIN1 and PLIN2) genes.Decreased sTWEAK concentrations are independently associated with the presence of NAFLD. This is concordant with the observation that TWEAK reduces lipid accumulation in human liver cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18073214>ICER-1gamma overexpression drives palmitate-mediated connexin36 down-regulation in insulin-secreting cells.</a></h2><p>Channels formed by the gap junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) contribute to the proper control of insulin secretion. We investigated the impact of chronic hyperlipidemia on Cx36 expression in pancreatic beta-cells. Prolonged exposure to the saturated free fatty  palmitate reduced the expression of Cx36 in several insulin-secreting cell lines and isolated mouse islets. The effect of palmitate was fully blocked upon protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition by H89 and (Rp)-cAMP, indicating that the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in the control of Cx36 expression. Palmitate treatment led to overexpression of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER-1gamma), which bound to a functional cAMP-response element located in the promoter of the CX36 gene. Inhibition of ICER-1gamma overexpression prevented the Cx36 decrease, as well as the palmitate-induced beta-cell secretory dysfunction. Finally, freshly isolated islets from mice undergoing a long term high fat diet expressed reduced Cx36 levels and increased ICER-1gamma levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that chronic exposure to palmitate inhibits the Cx36 expression through PKA-mediated ICER-1gamma overexpression. This Cx36 down-regulation may contribute to the reduced glucose sensitivity and altered insulin secretion observed during the pre-diabetic stage and in the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16179281>Serum fatty acids in postinfarction middle-aged men.</a></h2><p>There is a multitude of data showing that coronary heart disease is affected by the quality of dietary fat. The fatty  composition of serum lipids has been shown to reflect that of the diet. It is likely that, after myocardial infarction, both the health-care professionals and the patients themselves pay more attention to dietary guidelines. In order to assess the correctness of this assumption, we compared the composition of serum fatty acids in 40 male subjects with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with that of 40 age-matched controls, both from the FINRISK study. The percentage composition of fatty acids of total serum lipids was analysed by gas chromatography. In comparison with the control group, the MI group had higher body mass index (BMI), a higher prevalence of diabetes, higher level of serum triglycerides and a lower level of serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, all indicators of the . The MI group had higher proportions of serum  (16:0) and oleic acids (18:1), and a lower proportion of linoleic (18:2 n-6)  than the control group. The  is accompanied by an elevated level of serum insulin, which is known to enhance the synthesis of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, such as 16:0 and 18:1, and to stimulate the activity delta-6 desaturase, decreasing the concentration of linoleic .

At 4 weeks of age, obese and lean rats have essentially identical basal and insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. By 8 weeks of age, however, the obese rats no longer exhibit such intake. Plasma insulin concentrations in the normal fed state show only small increases up to 4 weeks, with a rapid rise to a marked hyperinsulinemia thereafter, with an age at half-development of 5.5 weeks. Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in fed obese rats are elevated at 3 weeks and rise rapidly thereafter. The triacylglycerol content of skeletal muscle is significantly elevated in the obese rats at 4 weeks of age. Histological examination of Oil Red O-stained muscle tissue and transmission electron microscopy shows the presence of intracellular lipid droplets. Treatment with the potent triacylglycerol-lowering agent MEDICA 16 (beta,beta'-tetramethylhexadecanedioic ) from 6 weeks of age reduces plasma lipids markedly, but it reduces body weight and insulin resistance only modestly. In contrast, treatment with MEDICA 16 from the time of weaning at 3 weeks of age results in the normalization of food intake and body weight to over 8 weeks of age. The development of hyperinsulinemia is also delayed until 8.5 weeks of age, and insulin levels remain strongly reduced. Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations remain at the same level as in lean rats, and neither an elevated muscle triacylglycerol content nor intracellular lipid droplets are found at 4 weeks of age. The results indicate that insulin resistance develops in the young animals and is not directly due to a genetically determined defect in insulin metabolism. The mechanism of induction instead appears to be related to an exaggerated triacylglycerol metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26113297>Hepatic TLR4 signaling in obese NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occurs frequently in the setting of , but the factors leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are not fully understood. This study investigated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in human liver with the goal of delineating whether activation of this pathway segregates those with nonalcoholic fatty liver from those with NASH. Experiments were performed using liver biopsy tissue obtained from class III obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery, and extended to an immortalized human hepatocyte HepaRG cell line and primary human hepatocytes. The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and total free fatty  levels were significantly increased in plasma of NASH patients. TLR4 mRNA levels were significantly increased in subjects with NASH compared with NAFL as was interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 in the myeloid differentiation factor 88-independent signaling pathway. In HepaRG cells, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and functional activity increased following treatment with the fatty , palmitate, and following exposure to LPS compared with hepatocytes stimulated with a lipogenic treatment that induced de novo lipogenesis. Palmitate and LPS induction of NF-κB activity was partially attenuated by chemical- or small-interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of TLR4. Expression of TLR4 and its downstream mediators was upregulated with palmitate and LPS. Similar results were observed using primary human hepatocytes from a lean donor. Interestingly, NF-κB activity assays showed obese donor hepatocytes were resistant to chemical TLR4 inhibition. In conclusion, TLR4 expression is upregulated in a large cohort of NASH patients, compared with those with NAFL, and this occurs within the setting of increased LPS and fatty acids.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23454278>An environmental wide association study (EWAS) approach to the .</a></h2><p>Environmental contaminants have previously been linked to components of the  (MetS).

Free fatty acids (FFAs) in the circulation are increased in this disorder and inhibit insulin signaling. Lipid oversupply contributes to the development of insulin resistance, likely by promoting the accumulation of lipid metabolites capable of inhibiting signal transduction.This study was designed to examine the effects of FFAs and their metabolites on the insulin signaling pathway that leads to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increase in nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells.Here we demonstrate that exposing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to palmitate inhibits activation of Akt/eNOS signal pathway by insulin, and subsequently insulin-stimulated NO generation. Palmitate concomitantly induced the accumulation of ceramide, a product of acyl-CoA that has been shown to accumulate in insulin-resistant tissues and to inhibit insulin signaling. Preventing de novo ceramide synthesis abolished the antagonistic effect of palmitate toward the Akt/ eNOS pathway. Moreover, inducing ceramide buildup augmented the inhibitory effect of palmitate.Taken together, we have demonstrated that  induces accumulation of ceramide, which appears to mediate 's inhibitory effects on the Akt/eNOS pathway, leading to a significant decrease in NO generation. Therefore, ceramide is a necessary and sufficient intermediate mediating the inhibition of the AKT/eNOS signaling pathway by palmitate in endothelial cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529902>[The insulin initiates "kinetic perfection" of biologic function of locomotion.

Relevance to fatty -induced endothelial dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Circulating levels of free fatty acids are commonly elevated in patients with the  and exert, through activating proinflammatory pathways, harmful effects of the vascular endothelium. In this study, we examined the effect of palmitate (PA) on endothelial C-reactive protein (CRP) expression and the role of CRP in PA-induced nitric oxide (NO) inhibition. Palmitate increased, in a dose-dependent manner, CRP protein expression and production in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Induction of CRP protein was mimicked by ceramide, whereas bromopalmitate and other common free fatty acids such as oleate or linoleate were ineffective. Palmitate also elicited reactive oxygen species production in HAECs, an effect prevented by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition and adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) activation. Palmitate-treated HAECs showed increased CRP messenger RNA expression and nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation. Induction of CRP expression by PA was prevented by antioxidants and normalized by PKC and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors. Disrupting NF-κB and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathways or inducing AMPK activation also suppressed the stimulatory effect of PA on CRP messenger RNA expression. Finally, in HAECs, PA reduced NO release, an effect reversed by anti-CRP antibody. These data demonstrate that PA-induced endothelial CRP expression involves PKC-driven oxidative stress, possibly through AMPK inhibition, and activation of downstream redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including NF-κB. They further support a role for endothelial cell-derived CRP as mediator of the suppressive effect of PA on NO production.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim was to determine concomitant changes in thrombin generation in the blood compartment and at the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and its interplay with adipokines, free  acids (FFA), and metalloproteinases (MMPs) in obese Zucker rats that share features of the human MetS.  Obese and age-matched lean Zucker rats were compared at 25 and 80 weeks of age. Thrombin generation was assessed by calibrated automated thrombography (CAT).  Endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) was increased in obese rats independent of platelets and age. Clot half-lysis time was delayed with obesity and age. Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-13 were increased with obesity and age respectively. Addition of exogenous fibrinogen, leptin, linoleic, or  increased thrombin generation in plasma whereas adiponectin had an opposite effect. ETP was increased at the surface of VSMCs from obese rats and addition of exogenous  further enhanced ETP values. Gelatinase activity was increased in aorta at both ages in obese rats and MMP-2 activity was increased in VSMCs from obese rats.  Our study demonstrated in MetS an early prothrombotic phenotype of the blood compartment reinforced by procoagulant properties of dedifferentiated and inflammatory VSMCs.

The FAHFA levels are significantly decreased in insulin-resistant individuals, their application exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and restoring the glucose-insulin homeostasis. The aim of our research was to analyze the overall FAHFA composition in a common diet, as only a partial FAHFA composition has been revealed so far (only the PAHSA subclass was analyzed in a few foods). A new approach to the FAHFAs analysis includes nano-LC and post-column modifier followed by negative ion mass spectrometry, in order to obtain maximum sensitivity. Analysis of different foods - oat (whole grain, coarse flakes and fine flakes), apple, clementine, lemon, strawberry, blueberry, mango, kiwi, avocado, pineapple, banana, onion, garlic, cherry tomato, carrot, parsley root, pepper and radish - exhibited wide inter-food variation in the FAHFA profiles. Sixteen analyzed FAHFAs (, oleic, palmitoleic and stearic hydroxy-esters) showed microgram to low nanogram levels (0.165 ng/g - 32 μg/g FW), with the highest abundancy in oat, clementine, garlic and pineapple. Stearic  hydroxy stearic  (SAHSA) was the most abundant FAHFA, especially in the food with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and beneficial  effects.

The course have once been fatal and is often characterized by severe hypoglycemia without ketonuria. Systematic gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric determinations of selected organic  metabolites in the urine, together with enzymatic measurements in fibroblasts and clinical data from 4 patients of this category, have shown that the biochemical basis of this  can be inborn errors of the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, localized to the medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenation system. The biosynthesis of adipic, suberic and sebacic acids was studied using ketotic rats as the model, since ketosis in rats and humans is accompanied by excessive urinary excretion of adipic and suberic acids. A probable pathway for the production of the three dicarboxylic acids was found to be an initial omega-oxidation of the medium-chain C10-C14-monocarboxylic acids followed by beta-oxidation of the resulting medium-chain dicarboxylic acids. It is argued that the source of the omega-oxidizable monocarboxylic acids in ketosis most probably is the fat deposites, and it is speculated that the patients with beta-oxidation defects supplement this source with beta-oxidation intermediate medium-chain monocarboxylic acids, accumulated as a result of the defect. The ratio between the excreted amounts of adipic  and sebacic  in the urine from the patients with beta-oxidation defects is less than 50. This is in contrast to the ratio in urine from ketotic patients, where it is greater than 100. Adipic /sebacic  ratio-measured by means of a gas chromatographic analysis-is therefore suggested as a tool in the diagnosis of dicarboxylic acidurias. Based on the clinical picture and the pattern of a series of organic acids in the urinary  profile our four patients can be divided in two types of dicarboxylic aciduria. The two types have different therapeutic implications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18771663>Visceral fat thickness in overweight men correlates with alterations in serum fatty  composition.</a></h2><p>We examined relationships between visceral fat amount and alterations in serum fatty  composition, both of which represent critical factors in the development of .Correlations were analyzed between visceral fat thickness as measured by ultrasonography and proportions of individual fatty acids in 21 normal-weight and 24 overweight Japanese men.Significant associations were identified in overweight subjects.

The present study was undertaken to define the inhibitory effects of saturated NEFAs on EDR (endothelium-dependent relaxation). Experiments were performed in rings of rabbit aorta to establish (i) dose-response relationships, (ii) the effect of chain length, (iii) the effect of the presence of double bonds, (iv) reversibility and time course of inhibition, and (v) the effect on nitric oxide production. Aortic rings were incubated (1 h) with NEFA-albumin complexes derived from lauric (C(12:0)), myristic (C(14:0)),  (C(16:0)), stearic (C(18:0)) and linolenic (C(18:3)) acids. EDR induced by acetylcholine (0.1-10 mumol/l) was measured after pre-contraction with noradrenaline. Inhibition of EDR was dose-dependent (0.5-2 mmol/l NEFA), and the greatest inhibition (51%) was observed with stearic  (2 mmol/l). Lauric  had the smallest inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effects were always reversible and were evident after 15 min of incubation. Linolenic  caused a significantly lower inhibition of EDR than stearic . SOD (superoxide dismutase) restored the inhibitory effect caused by NEFAs, suggesting the involvement of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in removing nitric oxide. The nitric oxide concentration measured after exposure of the rings to acetylcholine was lower after incubation with NEFAs than with Krebs buffer alone. This finding is consistent with removal of nitric oxide by ROS. This claim was supported by the demonstration of increased concentrations of nitrated tyrosine in the rings incubated with NEFAs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18165129>Lipotoxic effects of triacylglycerols in J774.2 macrophages.</a></h2><p>Triacylglycerols (TGs) are being considered as an independent risk factor in atherosclerosis and , acting by dysregulation of the TG/high-density lipoprotein axis. Accumulation of lipids in subendothelial space attracts macrophages, leading to atherosclerotic plaque formation and increased plaque instability due to formation of foam cells and macrophage death. The aim of this study was to evaluate lipotoxic effects in macrophages caused by TG uptake.J774.2 macrophages were exposed to soybean or olive oil-based lipid emulsions as a source of TGs (1 mg/mL) in a presence or absence of lipase inhibitor paraoxon (20 microM) or to bovine serum albumin-complexed  (150 microM), linoleic (600 microM), and oleic (600 microM) fatty acids.The results demonstrated accumulation of TGs, G1/S arrest, and cell death with necrotic morphologic features after exposure to TG emulsions. These effects were prevented by treatment with an antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (0.5 mM). Paraoxon inhibited intracellular TG degradation but did not prevent lipotoxicity and cell death. Olive oil TG triggered macrophage death in a manner similar to soybean oil. Treatment of the macrophages with free fatty , mainly with , showed a reactive oxygen species-independent cell death pathway, which was different from that of TG and was not prevented by N-acetyl-cysteine.This study shows a direct lipotoxic pathway for TG molecules in macrophages, which is not associated with degradation of TG molecule to free fatty acids. This study for the first time can explain at a cellular level how TGs as an independent risk factor aggravate atherosclerotic outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068143>Downregulation of the longevity-associated protein sirtuin 1 in insulin resistance and : potential biochemical mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that regulate metabolism and life span. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine ex vivo whether insulin resistance/ influences SIRTs. We also assessed the potential mechanisms linking  alterations to SIRTs in human monocytes (THP-1) in vitro.SIRT1-SIRT7 gene and protein expression was determined in PBMCs of 54 subjects (41 with normal glucose tolerance and 13 with ). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the minimal model analysis. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). In THP-1 cells exposed to high glucose or fatty acids in vitro, we explored SIRT1 expression, p53 acetylation, Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, NAD(+) levels, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression. The effects of SIRT1 induction by resveratrol and of SIRT1 gene silencing were also assessed.In vivo, insulin resistance and  were associated with low PBMC SIRT1 gene and protein expression. SIRT1 gene expression was negatively correlated with carotid IMT. In THP-1 cells, high glucose and palmitate reduced SIRT1 and NAMPT expression and reduced the levels of intracellular NAD(+) through oxidative stress. No effect was observed in cells exposed to linoleate or insulin. High glucose and palmitate increased p53 acetylation and JNK phosphorylation; these effects were abolished in siRNA SIRT1-treated cells. Glucose- and palmitate-mediated effects on NAMPT and SIRT1 were prevented by resveratrol in vitro.Insulin resistance and subclinical atherosclerosis are associated with SIRT1 downregulation in monocytes.

The mitochondria will begin to oxidize glucose if there will be no ketone bodies in cytosol and no remains of short-chained fatty acids and  fatty . According to "the biologic subordination principle" philogenically late insulin can't change the functional characteristics of the phylogeny earliest mitochondria. To "force" the mitochondria starting to oxidize glucose first of all the insulin is to inhibit the biochemical reactions in all cells where releasing of polar non-etherified fatty acids and formation of their polar metabolites occurs. As in case of insulin, the same marked and prolonged hypoglycemia is induced by DL-aminocarnitine. This substance specifically inhibits both activity of carnitine-palmitoilacylaminotrsansferase and flux of acyl-KoA in mitochondria. The pronounced decrease of fatty acids content and their metabolites in matrix force mitochondria to oxidize glucose. It is possible to be validly of opinion that the same philogenically ancient principles as inhibition of activity of carnitine-palmitoilacylaminotrsansferase, decrease of formation of fatty  metabolites C4 (ketone bodies), short-chained metabolites of  fatty  and olein mono fatty  are applied in realization of philogenically late insulin effect. The first insulin effect in the hypoglycemia and biologic exotrophy reaction conditions is targeted to the regulation of fatty acids metabolism. Only second insulin effect is targeted to the glucose  transformation. Therefore, there is a background to consider the diabetes mellitus primarily as a disorder of metabolism of unsaturated and mono fatty acids and only secondary and only then as a disorder of glucose metabolism. If insulin will not be able to decrease in cytosol the content of lipid substances of oxidation of insulin the mitochondria will not oxidize glucose. At that, a pathogenesis uniform  of resistance to insulin is formed independently of etiologic factors. Under these conditions the mitochondria physiologically "don't want" to oxidize glucose a possibility exists to oxidize fatty acids and their polar metabolites.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717198>Aspalathin-Enriched Green Rooibos Extract Reduces Hepatic Insulin Resistance by Modulating PI3K/AKT and AMPK Pathways.</a></h2><p>We previously demonstrated that an aspalathin-enriched green rooibos extract (GRE) reversed palmitate-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle and 3T3-L1 fat cells by modulating key effectors of insulin signalling such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, the effect of GRE on hepatic insulin resistance is unknown. The effects of GRE on lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance using palmitate-exposed C3A liver cells and obese insulin resistant (OBIR) rats were explored. GRE attenuated the palmitate-induced impairment of glucose and lipid metabolism in treated C3A cells and improved insulin sensitivity in OBIR rats. Mechanistically, GRE treatment significantly increased PI3K/AKT and AMPK phosphorylation while concurrently enhancing glucose transporter 2 expression. These findings were further supported by marked stimulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism, such as insulin receptor () and insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 ( and ), as well as those involved in lipid metabolism, including Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) following GRE treatment.

Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose metabolism; regulation of FA metabolism in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose metabolism. Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral fat cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient oleic variant of FA metabolism instead of phylogenetically early less efficient  variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance ,  and obesity. We believe that the food of herbivores should contain  in the amounts that hepatocytes can esterify into oleic very low density lipoproteins and cells can internalize as ligand oleic by apoЕ/В-100 endocytosis without formation of low density lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23525243>Developmental programming: impact of prenatal testosterone excess on insulin sensitivity, adiposity, and free fatty  profile in postpubertal female sheep.</a></h2><p>Prenatal T excess causes reproductive and  disruptions including insulin resistance, attributes of women with polycystic ovary . This study tested whether increases in visceral adiposity, adipocyte size, and total free fatty acids underlie the insulin resistance seen in prenatal T-treated female sheep. At approximately 16 months of age, insulin resistance and adipose tissue partitioning were determined via hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and computed tomography, respectively, in control and prenatal T-treated females. Three months later, adipocyte size and free fatty  composition were determined. Results revealed that at the postpubertal time points tested, insulin sensitivity was increased, visceral adiposity and adipocyte size in both the sc and the visceral compartments were reduced, and circulating  was increased in prenatal T-treated females relative to controls. In parallel studies, 20-month-old prenatal T-treated females tended to have increased basal insulin to glucose ratio. Relative to earlier findings of reduced insulin sensitivity of prenatal T-treated females during early life and adulthood, these findings of increased insulin sensitivity and reduced adiposity postpubertally are suggestive of a period of developmental adaptation. The disruption observed in free fatty  metabolism a few months later correspond to a time point when the insulin sensitivity indices of prenatal T-treated animals appear to shift toward insulin resistance. In summary, current findings of improved insulin sensitivity and reduced visceral adiposity in postpubertal prenatal T-treated sheep relative to our earlier findings of reduced insulin sensitivity during early postnatal life and adulthood are indicative of a period of developmental adaptation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951211>MicroRNA-194 inhibition improves dietary-induced non-alcoholic  disease in mice through targeting on FXR.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) affects obesity-associated metabolic syndrome, which exhibits hepatic steatosis, insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance. Previous studies indicated that hepatic microRNAs (miRs) play critical roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we aim to explore the pathophysiological role of miR-194 in obesity-mediated metabolic dysfunction. Our findings show that the high fat diet or  treatment significantly increase hepatic miR-194 levels in vivo and in vitro. Silence of miR-194 protects -induced inflammatory response in cultured hepatocytes, and attenuates structural disorders, lipid deposits and inflammatory response in . MiR-194 inhibitor also improves glucose and insulin intolerance in obese mice. Through dual luciferase assay, we demonstrate that miR-194 directly binds to FXR/Nr1h4 3'-UTR, and inhibits gene expression of FXR/Nr1h4. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-194 downregulates FXR/Nr1h4 in cultured hepatocytes, but miR-194 inhibitor reversely increases FXR/Nr1h4 expression in obese mouse  tissues. On the contrast, silence of FXR/Nr1h4 abolishes the hepatic benefits in obese mice treated with miR-194 inhibitor. Present study provides a novel finding that suppression of miR-194 attenuates dietary-induced NAFLD via upregulation of FXR/Nr1h4.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as a hepatic manifestation of  with impaired lipid and glucose metabolism and increased oxidative stress. Our recent study showed that folic  supplementation attenuated hepatic oxidative stress and lipid accumulation in high-fat diet-fed mice. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of folic  on hepatic AMPK during high-fat diet feeding and the mechanisms involved. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control diet (10% kcal fat), a high-fat diet (60% kcal fat), or a high-fat diet supplemented with folic  (26 mg/kg diet) for 5 wk. Mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited hyperglycemia, hepatic cholesterol accumulation, and reduced hepatic AMPK phosphorylation. Folic  supplementation restored AMPK phosphorylation (activation) and reduced blood glucose and hepatic cholesterol levels. Activation of AMPK by folic  was mediated through an elevation of its allosteric activator AMP and activation of its upstream kinase, namely, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) in the liver. Consistent with in vivo findings, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (bioactive form of folate) restored phosphorylation (activation) of both AMPK and LKB1 in -treated HepG2 cells. Activation of AMPK by folic  might be responsible for AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase, leading to reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis during high-fat diet feeding. These results suggest that folic  supplementation may improve cholesterol and glucose metabolism by restoration of AMPK activation in the liver.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30002491>Perivascular adipose tissue dysfunction aggravates adventitial remodeling in obese mini pigs via NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1 signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), a special type of adipose tissue, closely surrounds vascular adventitia and produces numerous bioactive substances to maintain vascular homeostasis. PVAT dysfunction has a crucial role in regulating vascular remodeling, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether and how obesity-induced PVAT dysfunction affected adventitia remodeling in early vascular injury stages. Mini pigs were fed a high sugar and fat diet for 6 months to induce  and obesity. In the mini pigs, left carotid vascular injury was then generated using balloon dilation. Compared with normal mini pigs, obese mini pigs displayed significantly enhanced vascular injury-induced adventitial responses, evidenced by adventitia fibroblast (AF) proliferation and differentiation, and adventitia fibrosis, as well as exacerbated PVAT dysfunction characterized by increased accumulation of resident macrophages, particularly the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, increased expression of leptin and decreased expression of adiponectin, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Primary AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium from obese mini pigs also showed significantly increased proliferation and differentiation. We further revealed that activated nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and its downstream products, i.e., IL-1 family members such as IL-1β and IL-18 were upregulated in the PVAT of obese mini pigs; PVAT dysfunction was also demonstrated in preadipocytes treated with . Finally, we showed that pretreatment with IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonist or IL-1R knockdown blocked AF proliferation and differentiation in AFs cultured in PVAT-conditioned medium.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Since it is known that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways play a crucial role in periodontitis, we hypothesized that MetS enhances LPS-induced periodontal inflammation and alveolar bone loss. In this study, we induced MetS in C57BL/6 mice by feeding them high-fat diet (HFD), and we induced periodontitis by periodontal injection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans LPS. We found that mice fed a HFD had significantly increased body weight, plasma lipids, insulin, and insulin resistance when compared with mice fed regular chow, indicating that the mice developed MetS. We also found that a HFD markedly increased LPS-induced alveolar bone loss, osteoclastogenesis, and inflammatory infiltration. Analysis of gene expression in periodontal tissue revealed that HFD and LPS injection cooperatively stimulated expression of cytokines that are known to be involved in periodontal tissue inflammation and osteoclastogenesis-such as interleukin 6, monocyte-chemotactic protein 1, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor. To further understand the potential mechanisms involved in MetS-boosted tissue inflammation, our in vitro studies showed that -the most abundant saturated fatty  (SFA) and the major SFA in the HFD used in our animal study-potently enhanced LPS-induced proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages. In sum, this study demonstrated that MetS was associated with increased periodontal inflammation and alveolar bone loss in an LPS-induced periodontitis animal model. This study also suggests that SFA  may play an important role in MetS-associated periodontitis by enhancing LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages.© International & American Associations for Dental Research 2014.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4039270>omega-123I-hexadecanoic   probe of cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>The utility of omega-123I-hexadecanoic  myocardial scintigraphy as a  probe of cardiomyopathies was investigated.

Biological reactions of inflammation and hydrodynamic pressure, or blood pressure, are in vivo activated to compensate for intercellular debris accumulation by endogenous phlogogens--ligand-free low density lipoproteins (LDL). The biological reactions jointly remove LDL from blood to the intima of elastic type arteries, to interstitial tissue for the local pool of the intravascular medium. The causes of formation of aphysiological LDLs are a preponderance of palmitate-oleate-palmitate triglycerides in the latter and impaired hydrolysis upon exposure to post-heparin lipase to give rise to small, dense LDLs; intimal macrophages utilize the debris only partially and develop atheromatosis from polyenic fatty acids (FA) etherified by cholesterol alcohol. Excess of  saturated fatty  (sFA) is responsible for the lowered permeability of the plasma membrane, cell death via the mechanism similar to apoptosis. Aphysiological protein palmitoylation (covalent interaction with  sFA) increased the debris accumulation of the intercellular medium and the activity of both biological reactions. Elevated plasma  sFA and its enhanced passive absorption in the form of unetherified FA, as well as high C-reactive protein levels are a cause of insulin resistance. The only way to prevent atherosclerosis in the population is to normalize the biological function of exotrophy when the energy value ratio of FA, proteins and carbohydrates is 1:1:1 and that of sFA, monoenic, and polyenic FA is also 1:1:1. The lower amount of  sFA and the higher concentration of essential polyenic FA, the lower blood levels of cholesterol alcohol and triglycerides are.

With impaired biological function of exotrophy (fasting, early postnatality, hibernation), the cells perform a reverse process--the synthesis of glucose from FA. Physiologically, the substrate of gluconeogenesis is acetyl-CoA that is converted by the malate --> 9 piruvate --> glucose pathway in the glyoxalate cycle. Under the pathological conditions of hypoxia and energy deficiency, gluconeogenesis occurs without ATP consumption via the methylglyoxalate pathway (MGP) while using as a substrate of ketone bodies: butyric  (butyrate) --> beta-hydroxybutyrate --> acetoacetate --> acetone --> acetol --> methylglyoxal (MG) --> S-D-lactolglutathione --> D-lactate --> piruvate --> D-lactate. Under physiological conditions, this pathway of gluconeogenesis does not work. The authors hold that gene expression and gluconeogenesis occur via the MGP when glucose levels are low in the cell cytosol (glycopenia) and FA cannot be oxidized in the mitochondria. Cytosol, intercellular medium, plasma show elevated levels of MG and D-lactate, to which it converts under the action of glyoxalases I and II. Glycopenia develops in fasting, diabetes mellitus, , renal failure, phenofibrate therapy, impaired function of exotrophy--excessive dietary intake of saturated and trans fatty acids. The chemical interaction of MG with amino  residues of lysine and arginine leads to protein denaturation during carbonylation--glycosylation and impaired biological function of endoecology.

To analyze influence of systemic inflammatory response to , we inoculated an attenuated vaccine strain of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) into leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. BCG administration significantly decreased epididymal white adipose tissue weight, serum insulin levels, and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Serum high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin level and HMW/total adiponectin ratio of the BCG treated mice were significantly higher than those of control mice. Hepatic triglyceride accumulation and macrovesicular steatosis were markedly alleviated, and the enzymatic activities and mRNA levels of lipogenic-related genes in liver were significantly decreased in the BCG injected mice. We also exposed human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells to high levels of palmitate, which enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene expression and impaired insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (Ser473). BCG treatment ameliorated both of these detrimental events. The present study therefore suggested that BCG administration suppressed development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, at least partly, by alleviating fatty -induced insulin resistance in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15450210>Glucose and fatty  metabolism in McA-RH7777 hepatoma cells vs. rat primary hepatocytes: responsiveness to nutrient availability.</a></h2><p>The overabundance of dietary fats and simple carbohydrates contributes significantly to obesity and  disorders associated with obesity. The liver balances glucose and lipid distribution, and disruption of this balance plays a key role in these  syndromes. We investigated (1) how hepatocytes balance glucose and fatty  metabolism when one or both nutrients are supplied in abundance and (2) whether rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH7777) reflect nutrient partitioning in a similar manner as compared with primary hepatocytes. Increasing media palmitate concentration increased fatty  uptake, triglyceride synthesis and beta-oxidation. However, hepatoma cells had a 2-fold higher fatty  uptake and a 2-fold lower fatty  oxidation as compared with primary hepatocytes. McA-RH7777 cells did not synthesize significant amounts of glycogen and preferentially metabolized the glucose into lipids or into oxidation. In primary hepatocytes, the glucose was mostly spared from oxidation and instead partitioned into both de novo glycogen and lipid synthesis. Overall, lipid production was rapidly induced in response to either glucose or fatty  excess and this may be one of the earliest indicators of  development associated with nutrient excess.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609031>MSP is a negative regulator of inflammation and lipogenesis in ex vivo models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a  disorder consisting of steatosis and inflammation, is considered the hepatic equivalent of  and can result in irreversible liver damage. Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is a hepatokine that potentially has a beneficial role in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the current study, we investigated the regulatory role of MSP in the development of inflammation and lipid metabolism in various NASH models, both in vitro and ex vivo. We observed that MSP treatment activated the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and  (PA)-induced gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, MSP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in PA-induced lipid accumulation and inhibited the gene expression of key lipogenic enzymes in HepG2 cells. Upon short hairpin RNA-induced knockdown of RON (the membrane-bound receptor for MSP), the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic effects of MSP were markedly ablated. Finally, to mimic NASH ex vivo, we challenged bone marrow-derived macrophages with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in combination with LPS. OxLDL+LPS exposure led to a marked inhibition of AMPK activity and a robust increase in inflammation. MSP treatment significantly reversed these effects by restoring AMPK activity and by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and secretion under this condition. Taken together, these data suggest that MSP is an effective inhibitor of inflammation and lipid accumulation in the stressed liver, thereby indicating that MSP has a key regulatory role in NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30959940>Comparison of Fatty  Profiles in a Group of Female Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and  (MetS)⁻Similar Trends of Changes, Different Pathophysiology.</a></h2><p>Fatty  (FA) profiles in the plasma of patients with  and chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be identical despite their different etiology (dietary mistakes vs. cachexia). The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with  (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of arachidonic  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of oleic  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary  pathways of oleic  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of oleic  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of  (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary  pathways are activated for oleic , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22700542>Palmitate increases the susceptibility of cells to drug-induced toxicity: an in vitro method to identify drugs with potential contraindications in patients with  disease.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids are an important source of energy. Excessive energy intake results in elevated levels of free fatty acids that are thought to be the pathogenic factors causing  disorders such as dyslipidemia, obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, and fatty liver. Underlying  disorders have been suggested to be a predisposing factor for drug-induced liver injury. The steadily expanding population with  disease may pose a higher risk for drug-induced toxicity. In order to understand the interaction of free fatty acids and drug-induced toxicity at the cellular level, we explored whether the saturated free fatty  palmitate could modulate drug-induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. A number of drugs known to induce hepatotoxicity in humans were selected to test this hypothesis. Drugs without reported hepatotoxicity were also tested to evaluate the specificity of the palmitate-induced effects. We demonstrate that palmitate, at sublethal concentrations, was able to potentiate the cytotoxicity and/or apoptosis induced by some but not all drugs tested. The palmitate and drug coincubation potentiated toxicity, which when combined with the plasma maximum concentration (C(max)), allowed us to identify idiosyncratic toxic drugs that were not flagged in previously deployed cytotoxicity assays. Our data suggest that treatment of cells with palmitate improves the sensitivity to detect compounds with risk of inducing idiosyncratic liver toxicity. Furthermore, this assay may be used to identify compounds that have higher safety risks in a population with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398632>Metformin reduces intracellular reactive oxygen species levels by upregulating expression of the antioxidant thioredoxin via the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress induced by free fatty acids plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in patients with .

Reducing oxidative stress may attenuate these pathogenic processes. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been reported to reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The thioredoxin (Trx) system is a major antioxidant system. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the AMPK-mediated regulation of Trx expression and the reduction of intracellular ROS levels.We observed that activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) significantly reduced ROS levels induced by  in human aortic endothelial cells. Activation of AMPK increased expression of the antioxidant Trx, which mediated the ROS reduction. RT-PCR showed that AMPK regulated Trx at the transcriptional level.Forkhead transcription factor 3 (FOXO3) was identified as the target transcription factor involved in the upregulation of Trx expression. FOXO3 bound to the Trx promoter, recruited the histone acetylase p300 to the Trx promoter, and formed a transcription activator complex, which was enhanced by AICAR treatment. AMPK activated FOXO3 by promoting its nuclear translocation. We further showed that AICAR injection increased the expression of Trx and decreased ROS production in the aortic wall of ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet.These results suggest that activation of the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway reduces ROS levels by inducing Trx expression. Thus, the AMPK-FOXO3-Trx axis may be an important defense mechanism against excessive ROS production induced by  stress and could be a therapeutic target in treating cardiovascular diseases in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3340286>Inhibition of fatty  beta oxidation by influenza B virus and salicylic  in mice: implications for Reye's .</a></h2><p>Injection of concentrated influenza B/Lee/40 virus into 4-week-old Balb C mice resulted in 60% inhibition of 14C-palmitate oxidation in isolated hepatic mitochondria.

Acne vulgaris is primarily a disease of wealthy countries and exhibits higher prevalence rates in developed compared with developing countries. No acne has been found in non-Westernized populations still living under Paleolithic dietary conditions constraining hyperglycemic carbohydrates, milk, and dairy products. The high prevalence rates of adolescent acne cannot be explained by the predominance of genetic factors but by the influence of a Western diet that overstimulates the key conductor of metabolism, the nutrient- and growth factor-sensitive kinase mTORC1. Increased mTORC1 activity has been detected in lesional skin and sebaceous glands of acne patients compared with acne-free controls. Increased mTORC1 signaling is a characteristic feature of insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Rats were fed a diet high in carbohydrates and saturated fats to develop diet-induced obesity over 16 weeks. This nutritional overload caused overexpression and secretion of phospholipase A(2) group IIA (pla2g2a) from immune cells in adipose tissue rather than adipocytes, whereas expression of adipose-specific phospholipase A(2) (pla2g16) was unchanged. These immune cells produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which influences adipocyte signaling.

Oral administration of KH064 (5 mg/kg/day) to rats fed the high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet prevented the overexpression of pla2g2a and the increased macrophage infiltration and elevated PGE(2) concentrations in adipose tissue. The treatment also attenuated visceral adiposity and reversed most characteristics of , producing marked improvements in insulin sensitivity, glucose intolerance, and cardiovascular abnormalities.

At the very early stages ofphylogenesis, the ancient Archaea that formed mitochondria under symbiotic interaction with later bacterial cells conjointly formed yet another system. In this system, there are no cells' absorption of glucose if it is possible to absorb fatty acids from intercellular medium in the form of unesterfied fatty acids or ketonic bodies--metabolites of fatty acids. This is caused by objectively existed conditions and subsequent availability of substrates at the stages ofphylogenesis: acetate, ketonic bodies, fatty acids and only later glucose. The phylogenetically late insulin used after billions years the same dependencies at formation of regulation ofmetabolism offatty acids and cells' absorption of glucose. In order that  ofresistance ceased to exist as afoundation of  pandemic Homo Sapiens has to understand the following. After successful function ofArchaea+bacterial cells and considered by biology action of insulin for the third time in phylogenesis and using biological function of intelligence the content ofphylogenetically earlier  saturated fatty  infood can't to exceed possibilities of phylogenetically late lipoproteins to transfer it in intercellular medium and blood and cells to absorb it. It is supposed that at early stages of phylogenesis biological function of intelligence is primarily formed to bring into line "unconformities" of regulation of metabolism against the background of seeming relative biological "perfection". These unconformities were subsequently and separately formed at the level of cells in paracrin regulated cenosises of cells and organs and at the level of organism. The prevention of resistance to insulin basically requires biological function of intelligence, principle of self-restraint, bringing into line multiple desires of Homo Sapiens with much less extensive biological possibilities.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of  fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of  triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes  TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) , the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with  type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type metabolism of FA. The IR  can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species.

CD36, a class B scavenger receptor, is highly expressed in the renal proximal tubules and mediates FFA uptake. It is not clear whether FFA- and proteinuria-mediated CD36 activation coordinates NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce renal tubular injury and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the roles of CD36 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in FFA-induced renal injury in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice and palmitate-treated HK2 renal tubular cells were used as in vivo and in vitro models. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CD36, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels increased progressively in the kidneys of HFD-fed mice. Sulfo- N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO), a CD36 inhibitor, attenuated the HFD-induced upregulation of NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 and suppressed the colocalization of NLRP3 and ASC in renal tubular cells. In vitro, SSO abolished the palmitate-induced activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 in HK2 proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, treatment with SSO and the knockdown of caspase-1 expression by siRNA both inhibited palmitate-induced cell death and apoptosis in HK2 cells. Collectively, palmitate causes renal tubular inflammation, cell death, and apoptosis via the CD36/NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which may explain, at least in part, the mechanism underlying FFA-related renal tubular injury. The blockade of CD36-induced cellular processes is therefore a promising strategy for treating obesity-related nephropathy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130531>Acute hypoxic preconditioning prevents -induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via switching  GLUT4-glucose pathway back to CD36-fatty  dependent.</a></h2><p> is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Myocardial cell damage leads to an imbalance of energy metabolism, and many studies have indicated that short-term hypoxia during myocardial cell injury has a protective effect. In our previous animal studies, we found that short-term hypoxia in the heart has a protective effect, but long-term hypoxia increases myocardial cell injury.  (PA)-treated H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat ventricle cardiomyocytes were used to simulate hyperlipidemia model, which suppress cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and activate glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). We exposed the cells to short- and long-term hypoxia and investigated the protective effects of hypoxic preconditioning on PA-induced lipotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Preconditioning with short-term hypoxia enhanced both CD36 and GLUT4 metabolism pathway protein levels. Expression levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-Akt, phospho-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC1α, PPARα, CD36, and CPT1β induced by PA was reversed by short-term hypoxia in a time-dependent manner. PA-induced increased GLUT4 membrane protein level was reduced in the cells exposed to short-term hypoxia and si-PKCζ. Short-term hypoxia, resveratrol and si-PKCζ rescue H9c2 cells from apoptosis induced by PA and switch the  pathway from GLUT4 dependent to CD36 dependent.

However, whether HGF is a beta-cell prosurvival factor in situations of excessive lipid supply has not been deciphered. Mice overexpressing HGF in the beta-cell [rat insulin type II promoter (RIP)-HGF transgenic mice] fed with standard chow display improved glucose homeostasis and increased beta-cell mass and proliferation compared with normal littermates. However, after 15 wk of high-fat feeding, glucose homeostasis and beta-cell expansion and proliferation are indistinguishable between normal and transgenic mice. Interestingly, RIP-HGF transgenic mouse beta-cells and normal beta-cells treated with HGF display increased sensitivity to palmitate-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Palmitate completely eliminates Akt and Bad phosphorylation in RIP-HGF transgenic mouse islets. HGF-overexpressing islets also show significantly decreased AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase phosphorylation, diminished fatty  oxidation, increased serine palmitoyltransferase expression, and enhanced ceramide formation compared with normal islets. Importantly, human islets overexpressing HGF also display increased beta-cell apoptosis in the presence of palmitate. Treatment of both mouse and human islet cells with the de novo ceramide synthesis inhibitors myriocin and fumonisin B1 abrogates beta-cell apoptosis induced by HGF and palmitate.

Methyl esters of the fatty acids in the disaturated phospholipids were prepared and the enrichment of [(13)C]methyl palmitate was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography/combination/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). Mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) was used to calculate the fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of palmitate synthesized from acetate. With both GC/MS and GC/C/IRMS, palmitate (13)C enrichment was first detected 12.3 h after the start of the tracer infusion. The enrichment increased in a linear fashion, reached a peak at 47 h and remained constant in the remainder of the samples. The FSR of palmitate from acetate was 5.2% per day. Stable isotope techniques and MIDA will provide insights into the kinetics of surfactant metabolism in newborns with respiratory dysfunction.Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768879>[The person in philogenesis is not (omnivores), but the herbivores with the carnivores past and the fuzzy future. Biological function of trophology (nutrition) in ontogenesis.]</a></h2><p>According to the phylogenetic theory of general pathology, seven biological functions have been formed over billions of years. 1. biological function of trophology, nutrition; 2. homeostasis function; 3. biological function of endoecology; 4. function of adaptation; 5. function of the continuation of the species; 6. function of locomotion and 7. cognitive biological function, including intelligence. Millions of years in life consistently in the waters of several oceans, all the ancestors of man were carnivorous (Carnivores), fish-eating mammals. When the ocean retreated and the carnivorous (fish-eating) were on land, each individual privatized a "piece" of the ocean. Animals transformed it ito a pool of intercellular medium in vivo. The biological role of the late in the phylogeny of insulin is the formation of new biological functions in vivo. The action of insulin has transformed the carnivorous (fish-eating) ocean into herbivorous (Herbivores) species on land. There was it by synthesis in vivo from exogenous glucose of fatty acids (FA). Regulatory action of insulin was the directed conversion of exogenous glucose into ω-6 C18: 1 cis-oleic FA. Insulin late in phylogeny expressed the synthesis of new, conjugated enzymes: it is palmitoyl-CoA-elongase and stearyl-CoAdesaturase. Two enzymes synthesized FAs along the way: synthesized in situ de novo, from exogenous glucose, C16: 0  → C18: 0 stearic  → ω-6 C18: 1 cis-oleic  without accumulation of stearic FA. Insulin is not converted into an oleic FA exogenous  from carnivorous food. On land, the action of insulin transformed the species Homo sapiens, into a herbivore, but with carnivorous, fish-eating, past. The idea of a person as omnivorous (Omnivor) - nonsense; such forms of nature did not form. Violation of the function of nutrition, the biological reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), is the etiological and pathogenetic basis of the seven  pandemics, the diseases of civilization. 1. Atherosclerosis and atheromatosis; 2.  arterial hypertension; 3. ; 4. obesity; 5.  of insulin resistance; 6. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 7. endogenous hyperuricemia. The primary prevention of  pandemics in the biological function of nutrition, in the biological reactions of exo-and endotrophy, will allow us to understand the theoretical bases and implementation of preventive actions that will determine the characteristics of nutrition in the future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30818824>A Pathophysiological Model of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Using Precision-Cut Liver Slices.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder closely related to . NAFLD can progress to an inflammatory state called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may result in the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To develop therapeutic strategies against NAFLD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism is needed. Current in vitro NAFLD models fail to capture the essential interactions between liver cell types and often do not reflect the pathophysiological status of patients. To overcome limitations of commonly used in vitro and in vivo models, precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs) were used in this study. PCLSs, prepared from liver tissue obtained from male Wistar rats, were cultured in supraphysiological concentrations of glucose, fructose, insulin, and  to mimic . Accumulation of lipid droplets was visible and measurable after 24 h in PCLSs incubated with glucose, fructose, and insulin, both in the presence and absence of . Upregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 and 2, and of sterol responsive element binding protein 1c, suggests increased de novo lipogenesis in PCLSs cultured under these conditions. Additionally, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 expression was reduced, which indicates impaired fatty  transport and disrupted mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, steatosis was successfully induced in PCLSs with modified culture medium. This novel ex vivo NAFLD model could be used to investigate the multicellular and molecular mechanisms that drive NAFLD development and progression, and to study potential anti-steatotic drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30463189>Chitosan Oligosaccharides Improve Glucolipid Metabolism Disorder in Liver by Suppression of Obesity-Related Inflammation and Restoration of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ).</a></h2><p>Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) display various biological activities. In this study, we aimed to explore the preventive effects of COS on glucolipid metabolism disorder using  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice as experimental models in vitro and in vivo, respectively. The results showed that COS pretreatment for 12 h significantly ameliorated lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells exposed to PA for 24 h, accompanied by a reversing of the upregulated mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α) and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators (SCD-1, ACC1, PCK1-α). In addition, COS treatment alleviated glucolipid metabolism disorder in mice fed with HFD for five months, including reduction in body weight and fasting glucose, restoration of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance, and suppression of overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and glucolipid metabolism-related regulators. Furthermore, our study found that COS pretreatment significantly reversed the downregulation of PPARγ at transcriptional and translational levels in both PA-induced HepG2 cells and liver tissues of HFD-fed mice. In summary, the study suggests that COS can improve glucolipid metabolism disorder by suppressing inflammation and upregulating PPARγ expression. This indicates a novel application of COS in preventing and treating glucolipid metabolism-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18077198>Characterization of L-aminocarnitine, an inhibitor of fatty  oxidation.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of hypoketotic hypoglycemia and cardiomyopathy in patients with fatty  oxidation (FAO) disorders is still poorly understood. In vitro studies are hampered by the lack of natural mutants to asses the effect of FAO inhibition. In addition, only a few inhibitors of FAO are known. Furthermore, most inhibitors of FAO are activating ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). We show that l-aminocarnitine (L-AC), a carnitine analog, inhibits FAO efficiently, but does not activate PPAR. L-AC inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) with different sensitivities towards CPT1 and CPT2, as well as carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). We further characterized L-AC using fibroblasts cell lines from controls and patients with different FAO defects. In these cell lines acylcarnitine profiles were determined in culture medium after loading with [U-(13)C]. In control fibroblasts, L-AC inhibits FAO leading to a reduction of C2-acylcarnitine and elevation of C16-acylcarnitine. In very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)-deficient fibroblasts, L-AC decreased the elevated C14-acylcarnitine and increased C16-acylcarnitine. In CACT and CPT2-deficient cell lines, L-AC did not change the already elevated C16-acylcarnitine level, showing that CPT1 is not inhibited. Oxidation of pristanic  was only partly inhibited at high L-AC concentrations, indicating minimal CACT inhibition. Therefore, we conclude that in intact cells L-AC inhibits CPT2. Combined with our observation that l-AC does not activate PPAR, we suggest that L-AC is useful to simulate a FAO defect in cells from different origin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29500968>Effects of a hypoenergetic diet rich in α-linolenic  on fatty  composition of serum phospholipids in overweight and obese patients with .</a></h2><p>Plant-derived α-linolenic  (ALA) may exert cardioprotective effects.

We showed that oxidative stress was elevated in CACs cultured from blood of individuals with  (MetS) and diabetes. We then assessed the action of  (PA), a deregulated and increased NEFA in  disorders, focusing on its oxidant potential. We observed that the phyto-polyphenol resveratrol normalized oxidative stress both in CACs isolated from MetS patients or treated with PA. Resveratrol further decreased the deleterious action of PA on gene expression of vascularization factors (TNFα, VEGF-A, SDF1α, PECAM-1, VEGFR2, Tie2 and CXCR4) and improved CAC motility. Particularly, resveratrol abolished the PA-induced over-expression of the pro-oxidant protein p66Shc. Neither KLF2 nor SIRT1, previously shown in resveratrol and p66Shc action, was directly involved. Silencing p66Shc normalized PA action on VEGF-A and TNFα specifically, without abolishing the PA-induced oxidative stress, which suggests a deleterious role of p66Shc independently of any major modulation of the cellular oxidative status in a high NEFA levels context. Besides showing that resveratrol reverses PA-induced harmful effects on human CAC function, certainly through profound cellular modifications, we establish p66Shc as a major therapeutic target in  disorders, independent from glycemic control.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Altered fatty  (FA) composition and desaturase activities have been associated with several  diseases, including MetS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of the plasma FA profile and desaturase activities with the MetS in a Mediterranean population at high risk of CVD.Baseline data from 427 participants aged 55-80 years who took part in the interventional PREDIMED study were obtained. Individual FA was determined in plasma and desaturase activities were estimated from product/precursor ratios. Odds ratios (OR) and partial correlation coefficients were used to examine these relations with MetS and its components, respectively.We found higher levels of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, estimated Δ(9)- or stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and estimated Δ(6) desaturase (D6D), and lower levels of C18:2n-6 in people with MetS compared to those without it. After adjustment for several confounders, only higher quartiles of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, and D6D were found to be associated with an increasing prevalence of MetS, while higher quartiles of C18:2n-6 were inversely associated with MetS. High proportions of C14:0, C16:0, C16:1n-7, C20:3n-6, SCD, and D6D, and decreased proportions of C18:2n-6 and estimated Δ(5)-desaturase (D5D) were associated with adverse profiles of several  risk factors.

Bioactive phytochemicals derived from vegetables and fruits have gained increasing attention owing to their potential on suppressing the detrimental effect of excessive PA accumulation. However, the protective effect of natural phytochemicals derived from Rubus chingii Hu, a kind of fruit widely grown in China, against PA-induced lipotoxicity is still uncleared. In the present study, we therefore extracted the polysaccharide from Rubus chingii Hu, and identified its chemical structure. Structural characterization by HPLC, HPGPC, IR spectroscopy and GC indicated that the polysaccharide mainly consists of galacturonic  and arabinose with copious 1 → 2 glycosidic linkages in its backbone. In addition, our results showed the cytoprotective effect of the polysaccharide against PA-induced lipotoxicity in normal human hepatocyte cell line L02. Further study indicated that the polysaccharide mitigated oxidative stress through impeding cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, alleviating mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse and attenuating glutathione (GSH) reduction. Overall, this study revealed that Rubus chingii Hu polysaccharide was capable of effectively alleviating -induced lipotoxicity, which provided a novel perspective of the health-promoting potential of isolated polysaccharide.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, low level of vitamin D is observed in those conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of 1α,25(OH) D on PA-treated THP-1 cells. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we measure mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and chemokine IL-8 under PA and 1α,25(OH) D influence. PA, at all concentrations (25-100 μM), enhanced LPS stimulatory effect on those mRNA expression compared to LPS-treated and -untreated cells. Combination with 1α,25(OH) D increased cytokine expression at high (10 M) and high-normal (10 M) concentrations compared to PA + LPS and LPS alone, both for 2 and 24 h. However, low-normal (10 M) and low (10 M) levels of 1α,25(OH) D could not enhance PA effect, but mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine was higher than LPS-treated cells. Upstream pathway of 1α,25(OH) D , which is cholecalciferol, also gave the similar result. Further, inhibition of calcium pathway does not play a role in this mechanism. Thus, these findings support pro-inflammatory effect of PA and vitamin D on innate immune response, especially on fat-induced inflammation.The effect of vitamin D on chronic inflammation in obesity is uncertain. This study shows an in vitro possibility that vitamin D could exaggerate inflammation when combined with high SFAs.

In total, 36 metabolites were found significantly different between PCOS and controls, and 9 metabolites were discovered significantly different between IR and non-IR PCOS patients. Significant increases in the levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (myristic , linoleic , 9-/13-HODE, etc.), fatty amides ( amide, oleamide), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, L-glutamic , azelaic , L-glyceric , pyroglutamic , and decreases in the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, uridine, and L-carnitine were found in PCOS patients compared with controls. In IR PCOS patients, linoleic , myristic , palmitoleic , and vaccenic  also increased significantly compared with non-IR PCOS patients. All these changed metabolites showed abnormalities of steroid hormone biosynthesis, amino acids and nucleosides metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and lipids and carbohydrates metabolism in PCOS patients. The subgroup IR PCOS patients exhibited greater  deviations than non-IR PCOS patients. These findings may help yield promising insights into the pathogenesis and advance the diagnosis and prevention of PCOS.

The present study was designed to test whether this NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the "two-hit" injury during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether it can be a therapeutic target for the action of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), a widely used herbal remedy for hyperlipidemia and  in China. We first demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation as well as lipid deposition occurred in the liver of mice on the high-fat diet (HFD), as shown by increased NLRP3 aggregation, enhanced production of IL-1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and remarkable lipid deposition in liver cells. FTZ extracts not only significantly reduced the NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation but also attenuated the liver steatosis and fibrogenic phenotype changed. In  studies,  (PA) was found to increase colocalization of NLRP3 components and enhanced caspase-1 activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicating enhanced formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by PA. PA also increased lipid deposition. Nlrp3 siRNA can reverse this effect by silencing the NLRP3 inflammasome and both with FTZ. In FTZ-treated cells, not only inflammasome formation and activation was substantially attenuated but also lipid deposition in HSCs was blocked. This inhibition of FTZ on lipid deposition was similar to the effects of glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, stimulated membrane raft redox signaling platform formation and increased O production by PA to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in HSCs was blocked by FTZ treatment. It is concluded that FTZ extracts inhibit NASH by its action on both inflammatory response and liver lipid metabolism associated with NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19766268>Polyunsaturated fatty acids effect on serum triglycerides concentration in the presence of  components. The Alaska-Siberia Project.</a></h2><p>Serum fatty acids (FAs) have wide effects on metabolism: Serum saturated fatty acids (SFAs) increase triglyceride (TG) levels in plasma, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) reduce them. Traditionally, Eskimos have a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (omega3 FAs); but the Westernization of their food habits has increased their dietary SFAs, partly reflected in their serum concentrations. We studied the joint effect of serum SFAs and PUFAs on circulating levels of TGs in the presence of  components. We included 212 men and 240 women (age, 47.9 +/- 15.7 years; body mass index [BMI], 26.9 +/- 5.3) from 4 villages located in Alaska for a cross-sectional study. Generalized linear models were used to build surface responses of TG as functions of SFAs and PUFAs measured in blood samples adjusting by sex, BMI, and village. The effects of individual FAs were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis, and partial correlations (r) were calculated. The most important predictors for TG levels were glucose tolerance (r = 0.116, P = .018) and BMI (r = 0.42, P < .001). Triglyceride concentration showed negative associations with 20:3omega6 (r = -0.16, P = .001), 20:4omega6 (r = -0.14, P = .005), 20:5omega3 (r = -0.17, P < .001), and 22:5omega3 (r = -0.26, P < .001), and positive associations with  (r = 0.16, P < .001) and 18:3omega3 (r = 0.15, P < .001). The surface response analysis suggested that the effect of  on TG is blunted in different degrees according to the PUFA chemical structure. The long-chain omega3, even in the presence of high levels of saturated fat, was associated with lower TG levels. Eicosapentaenoic  (20:5omega3) had the strongest effect against  on TG. The total FA showed moderate association with levels of TG, whereas SFA was positively associated and large-chain PUFA was negatively associated. The Westernized dietary habits among Eskimos are likely to change their  profile and increase comorbidities related to  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30462534>Anxa2 gene silencing attenuates obesity-induced insulin resistance by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) continues to pose a major threat to public health due to its role in the pathogenesis of  and its ever-increasing prevalence on a global scale. The aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of Anxa2 in obesity-induced IR through the mediation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Microarray analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed genes associated with obesity. To verify whether Anxa2 was differentially expressed in IR triggered by obesity, IR mouse models were established in connection with a high-fat diet (HFD). In the mouse IR model, the role of differentially expressed Anxa2 in glycometabolism and IR was subsequently detected. To investigate the effect of Anxa2 on IR and its correlation with inflammation, a  (PA)-induced IR cell model was established, with the relationship between Anxa2 and the NF-κB signaling pathway investigated accordingly. Anxa2 was determined to be highly expressed in IR. Silencing Anxa2 was shown to inhibit IR triggered by obesity. When Anxa2 was knocked down, elevated expression of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), IRS1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1a, and glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity along with 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was detected, whereas decreased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and p50 was observed. Taken together, the current study ultimately demonstrated that Anxa2 may be a novel drug strategy for IR disruption, indicating that Anxa2 gene silencing is capable of alleviating PA or HFD-induced IR and inflammation through its negative regulatory role in the process of p50 nuclear translocation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20920255>Reduced levels of SCD1 accentuate palmitate-induced stress in insulin-producing β-cells.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is an ER resident enzyme introducing a double-bond in saturated fatty acids. Global knockout of SCD1 in mouse increases fatty  oxidation and insulin sensitivity which makes the animal resistant to diet-induced obesity. Inhibition of SCD1 has therefore been proposed as a potential therapy of the . Much of the work has focused on insulin target tissue and very little is known about how reduced levels of SCD1 would affect the insulin-producing β-cell, however. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate how reduced levels of SCD1 affect the β-cell.Insulin-secreting MIN6 cells with reduced levels of SCD1 were established by siRNA mediated knockdown. When fatty  oxidation was measured, no difference between cells with reduced levels of SCD1 and mock-transfected cells were found. Also, reducing levels of SCD1 did not affect insulin secretion in response to glucose. To investigate how SCD1 knockdown affected cellular mechanisms, differentially regulated proteins were identified by a proteomic approach. Cells with reduced levels of SCD1 had higher levels of ER chaperones and components of the proteasome. The higher amounts did not protect the β-cell from palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Instead, rise in levels of p-eIF2α and CHOP after palmitate exposure was 2-fold higher in cells with reduced levels of SCD1 compared to mock-transfected cells. Accordingly, apoptosis rose to higher levels after exposure to palmitate in cells with reduced levels of SCD1 compared to mock-transfected cells.In conclusion, reduced levels of SCD1 augment palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis in the β-cell, which is an important caveat when considering targeting this enzyme as a treatment of the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17680645> induces production of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 from hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Obesity and the  are closely correlated with hepatic steatosis. Simple hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can be a precursor to more serious liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying progression of steatosis to NASH remain unclear; however, inflammation, proinflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been postulated to play key roles. We previously reported that patients with NASH have elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), which are likely to contribute to hepatic injury. This study specifically examines the effect of hepatic steatosis on IL-8 production. We induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (HepG2, rat primary hepatocytes, and human primary hepatocytes) by exposing them to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of  to simulate the excessive influx of fatty acids into hepatocytes. Significant fat accumulation was documented morphologically by Oil Red O staining in cells exposed to , and it was accompanied by an increase in intracellular triglyceride levels. Importantly,  was found to induce significantly elevated levels of biologically active neutrophil chemoattractant, IL-8, from steatotic hepatocytes. Incubation of the cells with palmitate led to increased IL-8 gene expression and secretion (both mRNA and protein) through mechanisms involving activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/activator protein-1.These data demonstrate for the first time that lipid accumulation in hepatocytes can stimulate IL-8 production, thereby potentially contributing to hepatic inflammation and consequent liver injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209679>Increased erythrocytes n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is significantly associated with a lower prevalence of steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is commonly associated with obesity,  and type 2 diabetes. Although dietary fat contributes substantially to the accumulation of liver fat, the role of individual fatty acids in this accumulation is unclear.In this study, we set out to determine whether liver fat content (LFC), was associated with red blood cell fatty  (RBC-FA) composition in people with type 2 diabetes.One hundred and sixty-two type 2 diabetic patients were included in this study. LFC was measured using (1)H-MR Spectroscopy. RBC-FA composition was measured by gas chromatography.One hundred and nine (67.2%) patients had steatosis. Patients with steatosis had a higher BMI (p = 0.0005), and higher plasma triglyceride levels (p = 0.009) than did patients without steatosis. We report a significant association between  (16:0), palmitoleic  (16:1n-7) concentrations and ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fatty  (palmitoleic  to ) and higher liver fat content. Total polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), homo-gamma-linolenic  (20:3n-6), docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3), and arachidonic  (20:4 n-6) were associated with lower LFC.Our data showed that an increased erythrocytes long-chain n-3 and n-6 fatty acids was associated with a lower prevalence of steatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. These results suggest that n-3 and n-6 fatty acids supplementation could be a promising treatment for NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Reduction of intracellular oxidative stress may attenuate these pathogenic processes. The dietary polyphenol resveratrol reportedly exerts potential protective effects against endothelial injury. This study determined whether resveratrol can reduce the  (PA)-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and further explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that resveratrol significantly reduced the PA-induced endothelial ROS levels in human aortic endothelial cells. Resveratrol also induced endothelial cell autophagy, which mediated the effect of resveratrol on ROS reduction. Resveratrol stimulated autophagy via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mTOR pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that resveratrol prevents PA-induced intracellular ROS by autophagy regulation via the AMPK-mTOR pathway. Thus, the induction of autophagy by resveratrol may provide a novel therapeutic candidate for cardioprotection in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25727313>Apolipoprotein E isoforms 3/3 and 3/4 differentially interact with circulating stearic, , and oleic fatty acids and lipid levels in Alaskan Natives.</a></h2><p>Lifestyle changes in Alaskan Natives have been related to the increase of cardiovascular disease and  in the last decades. Variation of the apolipoprotein E (Apo E) genotype may contribute to the diverse response to diet in lipid metabolism and influence the association between fatty acids in plasma and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the interaction between Apo E isoforms and plasma fatty acids, influencing phenotypes related to  diseases in Alaskan Natives. A sample of 427 adult Siberian Yupik Alaskan Natives was included. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, Apo A1, and Apo B plasma concentrations were measured using reference methods. Concentrations of 13 fatty acids in fasting plasma were analyzed by gas chromatography, and Apo E variants were identified. Analyses of covariance were conducted to identify Apo E isoform and fatty  main effects and multiplicative interactions. The means for body mass index and age were 26 ± 5.2 and 47 ± 1.5, respectively. Significant main effects were observed for variation in Apo E and different fatty acids influencing Apo B levels, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Significant interactions were found between Apo E isoform and selected fatty acids influencing total cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B concentrations. In summary, Apo E3/3 and 3/4 isoforms had significant interactions with circulating levels of stearic, , oleic fatty acids, and phenotypes of lipid metabolism in Alaskan Natives.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The  disorder of fatty acids and triglycerides].</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty disease of liver (steatosis) is still as unclear as a loss of hepatocytes similar to apoptosis, development of biological reaction of inflammation, its transformation into steatohepatitis with subsequent fibrosis and formation of atrophic cirrhosis. The article suggests that steatosis is developed due to higher concentration of  saturated fatty  (C 16:0) in food, intensification of its endogenic synthesis from food carbohydrates and glucose and development of insulin resistance. It is displayed in in hormone ability to activate both oxidation in cells of glucose and synthesis of oleic monoene fatty  from  saturated fatty  (C 18:1). The insulin resistance initiates pathologic process on the level of paracrine associations of cells resulting in permanent increase of concentration of non-etherified fatty acids in intercellular medium and intensification of their passive absorption by cells. The phylogenetically ancient mitochondrions will not to oxidize glucose until non-etherified fatty acids are present in cytosol and hence there is an opportunity to oxidize them. To eliminate undesirable action of polar saturated  fatty , the cells etherify it by spirit glyceride into triglycerides to deposit in cytosol or to secrete into blood in a form of lipoproteins of very low density. Under insulin resistance, saturated  fatty  synthesized by hepatocytes from glucose, does not further transform into oleic monoenic fatty . The cells are to etherify endogenic (exogenic) palmnitic saturated fatty  into composition of aphysiologic  triglycerides (saturated  fatty  in position sn-2 of spirit glyceride). At that, triglycerides of palmitat-palmitat-oleat and even tripalmitat type are formed. The melting temperature of tripalmitat is 48 degrees C and melting temperature of physiologic trioletat is 13 degrees C. The intracellular lipases factually can't hydrolyze  triglycerides. So, hepatocytes, overloaded by them, are destroyed in a way similar to apoptosis. The formed corpuscles of apoptosis disorder the biologic function of endoecology and trigger biologic reaction of inflammation. At that, steatosis changes into steato-hepatitis. The prevention of steatosis consists in dramatic restriction of concentration of  saturated fatty  in food. The treatment effect is targeted to: decreasing the formation of palmitine triglycerides by force of concurrent etherification of  saturated fatty  not into triglycerides but into phosphatidylcholine (symmetric phospholipids of soya); intensification of oxidation of  saturated fatty  in peroxisomes (glytazones and fibrates); decrease of insulin resistance (binuanide metformine).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20102700>Metformin reduces lipid accumulation in macrophages by inhibiting FOXO1-mediated transcription of fatty -binding protein 4.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of lipids in macrophages contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Strategies to reduce lipid accumulation in macrophages may have therapeutic potential for preventing and treating atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications. The antidiabetic drug metformin has been reported to reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes. In this study, we examined the effects of metformin on lipid accumulation in macrophages and investigated the mechanisms involved.We observed that metformin significantly reduced  (PA)-induced intracellular lipid accumulation in macrophages. Metformin promoted the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), while reduced the expression of fatty -binding protein 4 (FABP4) which was involved in PA-induced lipid accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that metformin regulates FABP4 expression at the transcriptional level. We identified forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 as a positive regulator of FABP4 expression. Inhibiting FOXO1 expression with FOXO1 siRNA significantly reduced basal and PA-induced FABP4 expression. Overexpression of wild-type FOXO1 and constitutively active FOXO1 significantly increased FABP4 expression, whereas dominant negative FOXO1 dramatically decreased FABP4 expression. Metformin reduced FABP4 expression by promoting FOXO1 nuclear exclusion and subsequently inhibiting its activity.Taken together, these results suggest that metformin reduces lipid accumulation in macrophages by repressing FOXO1-mediated FABP4 transcription. Thus, metformin may have a protective effect against lipid accumulation in macrophages and may serve as a therapeutic agent for preventing and treating atherosclerosis in .Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Increasing evidence suggests that mitophagy, a process of autophagic turnover of damaged mitochondria, maintains mitochondrial integrity. PINK1 (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1) and Parkin signaling is a key pathway in mitophagy control. In this study, we examined whether this pathway could protect mitochondria under  stress. We found that  (PA) induced significant mitophagy and activated PINK1 and Parkin in endothelial cells. Knocking down PINK1 or Parkin reduced mitophagy, leading to impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria and intracellular accumulation of mitochondrial fragments. Furthermore, PINK1 and Parkin prevented PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production and apoptosis. Finally, we show that PINK1 and Parkin were up-regulated in vascular wall of obese mice and diabetic mice. Our study demonstrates that PINK1-Parkin pathway is activated in response to  stress. Through induction of mitophagy, this pathway protects mitochondrial integrity and prevents  stress-induced endothelial injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19337800>Castration modifies aortic vasoreactivity and serum fatty acids in a sucrose-fed rat model of .</a></h2><p>Levels of testosterone and estradiol influence the incidence of cardiovascular diseases: generally, estrogens in females are protective before menopause; coronaropathies, hypertension, and dyslipidemias in normal men are more frequent at comparable ages. We investigated the modulation by castration of in vitro vasoreactivity, serum lipid content, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in rats with sucrose-induced . The main characteristics of the rat model are: hypertriglyceridemia, moderately high blood pressure, intra-abdominal accumulation of adipose tissue, hyperinsulinemia, nephropathy, increased oxidative stress, and altered vasoreactivity. Male weanling rats received 30% sucrose solution for 16 weeks (; MS), controls (C) had plain water; both had commercial rodent chow. They were subdivided into five groups with two subgroups each: Group 1, intact C and MS rats, Groups 2-5, C and MS rats castrated for periods of 16, 12, 8, and 4 weeks. At the end of the study period, systolic blood pressure was measured, and blood and aortas were obtained for fatty  determination and vasoreactivity assays, respectively. After 16 weeks' sucrose treatment MS aortas showed hypercontractility and decreased vasodilation.  and palmitoleic acids were increased in MS versus C. Arachidonic  levels in MS were lower than in intact or castrated C. Long-term castration of 16 weeks normalized the levels of  and oleic acids. With the shorter periods of castration, contractility increased and relaxation decreased in C and MS, but it was more significant in C.

Given that patients with MS take statins to reduce cholesterol, and statins also have anti-inflammatory effects, it is important to determine if statin intake hinders the progression of MS-associated PD. In this study, PD was induced in Zucker fat rats (ZFRs), an animal model for MS, and in control lean rats by periodontal injection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while simvastatin was given to some of the rats via gavage. After 4 wk of treatment, alveolar bone loss was determined by micro-computed tomography. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we determined the effect of simvastatin on tissue inflammation and the expression of molecules involved in osteoclastogenesis. Results showed that while bone loss was increased by LPS in both ZFRs and the control lean rats, it was significantly more in the former than the latter. Simvastatin effectively alleviated bone loss in both ZFRs and the control rats. Results also showed that LPS stimulated leukocyte tissue infiltration and expression of molecules for osteoclastogenesis, but simvastatin significantly modulated the stimulation.

DNA methylation is a potent regulator of gene expression and may be associated with protein levels. In this study we investigate whether the effect of dietary fatty acids on TNFa released from adipocytes might be associated with modifications of the TNFa promoter DNA methylation status. A group of rats was assigned to three diets with a different composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Samples of visceral adipose tissues were taken for adipocyte isolation, in which released TNFa levels were measured, and for methylation and expression studies. In addition, 3 T3-L1 cells were treated with , oleic and linoleic acids, with and without 5-Azacitydine (5-AZA). After treatments, cells and supernatants were included in the same analyses as rat samples. TNFa promoter methylation levels, gene expression and secretion were different according to the diets and fatty  treatments associated with them. Cells treated with 5-AZA displayed higher TNFa levels than in the absence of 5-AZA, without differences between fatty acids.

It has been reported that the early feeding mode affects growth and body composition and it could be considered a critical factor for  development. Human milk is a source of different nutrients and bioactive factors, especially hormones and growth factors like leptin, ghrelin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) playing a role in food intake regulation, metabolism and body composition. In particular breast milk leptin may provide a physiological explanation for a number of advantages seen in reaching proper growth and energy balance in breast-fed infants compared with formula fed ones. Etiopathogenesis and therapeutic approach in common minor gastrointestinal diseases in infants are important subject of study for pediatricians. Colic, constipation and regurgitation can be considered feeding problems and they might benefit from dietary treatment. Regarding infantile colic, dietary modifications seem to be more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms; also prebiotics and probiotics are useful for this aim. The occurence of constipation is related to the kind of feeding and it is lower in breastfed infants. Moreover formulas with probiotics and beta- could promote a regression of symptoms. A dietary approach may be useful also in regurgitation.

Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were preconditioned with TXL extracts before exposed to PA for 24 hours.We found that PA (0.5 mM) exposure induced 73% apoptosis in endothelial cells. However, when HAECs were preconditioned with ethanol extracted TXL (100 microg/ml), PA induced only 7% of the endothelial cells into apoptosis. Using antibody-based protein microarray, we found that TXL attenuated PA-induced activation of p38-MAPK stress pathway. To investigate the mechanisms involved in TXL's protective effects, we found that TXL reduced PA-induced intracellular oxidative stress. Through AMPK pathway, TXL restored the intracellular antioxidant system, which was depressed by the PA treatment, with an increased expression of thioredoxin and a decreased expression of the thioredoxin interacting protein.In summary, our study demonstrates that TXL protects endothelial cells from PA-induced injury. This protection is likely mediated by boosting intracellular antioxidant capacity through AMPK pathway, which may account for the therapeutic efficacy in TXL-mediated cardiovascular protection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24341187>[The  and oleic modes of metabolism of fatty acids.

KSHV induced pathways that are commonly altered in cancer cells including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, amino  production and fatty  synthesis. Interestingly, over half of the detectable long chain fatty acids detected in our screen were significantly increased by latent KSHV infection. KSHV infection leads to the elevation of metabolites involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, not degradation from phospholipids, and leads to increased lipid droplet organelle formation in the infected cells. Fatty  synthesis is required for the survival of latently infected endothelial cells, as inhibition of key enzymes in this pathway led to apoptosis of infected cells. Addition of  to latently infected cells treated with a fatty  synthesis inhibitor protected the cells from death indicating that the products of this pathway are essential. Our metabolomic analysis of KSHV-infected cells provides insight as to how oncogenic viruses can induce  alterations common to cancer cells. Furthermore, this analysis raises the possibility that  pathways may provide novel therapeutic targets for the inhibition of latent KSHV infection and ultimately KS tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12544656>Dietary fat, fatty  composition in plasma and the .</a></h2><p>The , a cluster of disorders often including abdominal obesity, is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death. Insulin resistance is a key feature of the . Observational studies have indicated that the type of fat in the diet may be related to the development of insulin resistance and the , also independent of possible effects on body weight. Dietary surveys are often imprecise. One way to monitor the type of fat in the diet is to record the fatty  composition in plasma. This review summarizes recent data on the relationships between fatty  composition in plasma and insulin resistance, diabetes and other disorders related to the .Insulin resistance and insulin resistant states are often associated with the fatty  pattern in plasma, characterized by an increased proportion of  (16 : 0) and a low proportion of linoleic (18 : 2 n-6) acids, with a distribution of other fatty acids indicating an increased activity of delta-9 and delta-6 desaturase. This shows that there may be a causal relationship between the type of fat in the diet and insulin action, an assumption supported by recent dietary intervention studies.In a public health perspective these results, from both observational and intervention studies, underline the importance of fat quality in the diet for the development of a number of prevalent diseases. Taken together with several earlier studies and recent epidemiological findings, they give strong support to present dietary guidelines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384535>Silibinin ameliorates hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in mice with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by regulating CFLAR-JNK pathway.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic  and the CFLAR-JNK pathway can reverse the process of NASH. Although silibinin is used for the treatment of NASH in clinical, its effect on CFLAR-JNK pathway in NASH remains unclear.

The  study was performed using male C57BL/6 mice fed with methionine- choline-deficient diet and simultaneously treated with silibinin for 6 weeks. The  study was performed by using mouse NCTC-1469 cells which were respectively pretreated with oleic  plus , and adenovirus-down  for 24 h, then treated with silibinin for 24 h. After the drug treatment, the key indicators involved in CFLAR-JNK pathway including hepatic injury, lipid metabolism and oxidative stress were determined. Silibinin significantly activated CFLAR and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK, up-regulated the mRNA expression of  and , reduced the activities of serum ALT and AST and the contents of hepatic TG, TC and MDA, increased the expression of NRF2 and the activities of CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1, and decreased the activities and expression of CYP2E1 and CYP4A . These effects were confirmed by the  experiments. Silibinin prevented NASH by regulating CFLAR-JNK pathway, and thereby on one hand promoting the -oxidation and efflux of fatty acids in liver to relieve lipid accumulation, and on the other hand inducing antioxidase activity (CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1) and inhibiting pro-oxidase activity (CYP2E1 and CYP4A) to relieve oxidative stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19192424>Dietary interventions for : role of modifying dietary fats.</a></h2><p>In humans, insulin sensitivity is relatively impaired by diets that are low in oleic  (OA), a cis monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), or rich in trans MUFA or  (PA), a saturated fatty  (FA). Emerging evidence exists that PA, in contrast to OA, causes insulin resistance via stimulation of inflammatory signaling and production of cytosolic lipid compounds (diacylglycerol and ceramide), leading one to presume that dietary or pharmacologic maneuvers that facilitate transport of FA into the mitochondria would be beneficial. However, in some models, insulin resistance is caused by excessive FA transport into the mitochondria, coupled with deficient electron transport and possibly increased reactive oxygen species formation; PA may impair electron transport via effects on gene expression. A research challenge is to determine whether feeding humans diets with markedly different contents of PA and OA would alter insulin sensitivity and/or critical biochemical mechanisms impacting muscle insulin signaling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20455448>[Features of fatty- spectrum of triglycerides in patients with insulin resistance and ].</a></h2><p>The article presents results of the study of fatty- spectrum of triglycerides in insulin resistance patients with .

The comparison of tests results of patients with ischemic heart disease and volunteers].</a></h2><p>According to the generally accepted theory, the atherosclerosis is a kind of disorder of metabolism of lipids which chemically are the ethers of fatty lipids with spirits. Hence, the atherosclerosis is fatty acids pathology. In conformity with the biologic classification, among fatty acids it is functionally valid to distinguish saturated fatty acids without double bonds; monoenic fatty acids with one double bond; unsaturated fatty acids with two or three double bonds and polyenic fatty acids with four of six double bonds in chain. The saturated and monenic fatty acids are the substrates for cells to groundwork energy, ATP The unsaturated fatty acids in vivo are needed to form membranes. The polyenic fatty acids are essential since they are precursors of cell synthesis of humoral regulators--eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). To clarify the pathogenesis of the " pandemics" most prevalent in human population, the quantitative determination of individual fatty acids in blood plasma and erythrocytes using gas chromatography technique is needed. It is necessary to evaluate the content of medium chain fatty acids;  and stearic saturated fatty acids; oleic monoenic fatty  and its transforms--linoleic, linolenic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic unsaturated fatty acids; essential polyenic omega-6 arachidonic, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids. The higher is in food the content of  saturated fatty , palmitoleic and trans-vaccenic monoenic fatty acids, the more is in patient diet of beef meat and products of fat cow's milk. The higher is ratio of /oleic fatty acids the lower is the risk of formation of atheromatosis of arteries intima and development of ischemic heart disease and vice versa. The decrease of ratio of omega-3/omega-6 essential polyenic fatty acids is undesirable in prognostic sense. The metabolism of these acids differs and functional activity of omega-3 eicosanoid type 3 is higher In case of deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 polyenic fatty acids in cells eicosanoids are synthesized from unsaturated dihomogamma-linolenic fatty  and their influence turns out to be aphysiologic. This condition is a pathogenic foundation of atherosclerosis. There is a diagnostic reason to detect fatty acids in case of diabetes mellitus, obesity,  and partially arterial hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803879>Associations of erythrocyte fatty acids in the de novo lipogenesis pathway with risk of  in a cohort study of middle-aged and older Chinese.</a></h2><p>Experimental studies suggest that elevated de novo lipogenesis (DNL) might be involved in the pathogenesis of  disorders.

As CD36 is a major receptor for fatty acids, we investigated periodontal CD36 expression in mice with periodontitis and MetS, and the role of CD36 in inflammatory gene expression in macrophages stimulated by palmitate.MetS and periodontitis were induced in mice by HFD and periodontal injection of LPS, respectively. The periodontal CD36 expression and its relationship with alveolar bone loss were studied using immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, and correlation analysis. The role of CD36 in upregulation of inflammatory mediators by LPS and palmitate in macrophages was assessed using pharmacological inhibitor and small interfering RNA.Periodontal CD36 expression was higher in mice with both MetS and periodontitis than that in mice with periodontitis or MetS alone and was correlated with osteoclastogenesis and alveolar bone loss. In vitro studies showed that CD36 expression in macrophages was upregulated by LPS and palmitate, and targeting CD36 attenuated palmitate-enhanced gene expression.CD36 expression is upregulated in mice with periodontitis and MetS and involved in gene expression in macrophages stimulated by palmitate and LPS.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Furthermore, pathway enrichment was analyzed based on KEGG and DAVID databases and  network was constructed via metaboanalyst and cytoscape.The top-3 metabolites with higher abundance in PCRC compared with HC were terephthalic  (165.417-fold), ornithine (24.484-fold) and aminomalonic  (21.346-fold).

Increased levels of terephthalic  might indicate high risk of relapse and elevated ornithine may contribute to the post-operational recovery or may raise the susceptibility to PCRC recurrence. The  profiles of DHS, SDS, LKYDS and NS were almost separately clustered, indicating the possibility of explaining TCM syndromes classification using metabolomics.

This non-familiar form could be a consequence of , characterized by obesity and the development of a brain-specific insulin resistance known as type III diabetes. This work demonstrates the development of a significant AD-like neuropathology due to these  alterations.C57BL/6J mice strain were divided into two groups, one fed with a diet rich in  (high-fat diet, HFD) since their weaning until 16 months of age, and another group used as a control with a regular diet. The analyses were carried out in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus using a Thioflavin-S stain and immunofluorescence assays.The most significant finding of the present research was that HFD induced the deposition of the βA peptide. Moreover, the diet also caused alterations in different cell processes, such as increased inflammatory reactions that lead to a decrease in the neuronal precursor cells. In addition, the results show that there were also dysregulations in normal autophagy and apoptosis, mechanisms related to βA formation.The present findings confirm that HFD favors the formation of βA depositions in the brain, a key feature of AD, supporting the  hypothesis of sporadic AD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The significance of Nrf2 in intermediary metabolism is also beginning to be recognized. Thus this transcription factor negatively affects fatty  synthesis. However, the effect of Nrf2 on fatty  oxidation is currently unknown. In the present paper, we report that the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain () and short-chain (hexanoic) fatty acids is depressed in the absence of Nrf2 and accelerated when Nrf2 is constitutively active. Addition of fatty acids stimulates respiration in heart and liver mitochondria isolated from wild-type mice. This effect is significantly weaker when Nrf2 is deleted, whereas it is stronger when Nrf2 activity is constitutively high. In the absence of glucose, addition of fatty acids differentially affects the production of ATP in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type, Nrf2-knockout and Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)-knockout mice. In acute tissue slices, the rate of regeneration of FADH2 is reduced when Nrf2 is absent.

An altered fatty  composition has been associated with MetS, but the Mediterranean diet has been shown to have a protective effect. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as assessed by the biomarkers of food supplied, on the plasma fatty  composition and its relation with MetS after 1 year of intervention.A total of 424 subjects were randomly selected from the PREDIMED randomized dietary trial after completing a 1-year intervention program. Participants aged 55 to 80 years and at high risk of cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to three dietary interventions: Mediterranean diet supplemented with virgin olive oil or nuts, or a low-fat diet.After 1 year of intervention participants in the virgin olive oil group showed significantly increased plasma concentrations of  and oleic acids, but reduced proportions of margaric, stearic, and linoleic acids. In turn, subjects in the nut group showed significantly increased levels of , linoleic, and α-linolenic acids, but reduced proportions of myristic, margaric, palmitoleic, and dihommo-γ-linoleic acids. Increases in the biomarkers of foods supplied to the Mediterranean diet groups, i.e., oleic and α-linolenic acids, were beneficially associated with the incidence, reversion and prevalence of MetS. No weight changes were observed among participants.The nut and olive oil diets induced a fatty  composition that has been shown to be beneficial in the face of MetS.

Leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glucose and palmitate tracers were infused after an overnight fast and samples were obtained from the renal vein, femoral vein and femoral artery.Insulin deprivation significantly increased whole-body fluxes (20-25%) of phenylalanine, tyrosine and leucine, and leucine oxidation (50%). Kidney contributed 5-10% to the whole-body leucine and phenylalanine flux. A net uptake of phenylalanine, conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine (5 micromol/min) and net release of tyrosine (approximately 5 micromol/min) occurred across the kidney. Whole-body (three-fold) and leg (two-fold) leucine transamination increased but amino  metabolism in the kidney did not alter with diabetes or insulin deprivation. Insulin deprivation doubled endogenous glucose production, renal glucose production was unaltered by insulin deprivation and diabetes (ranging between 100 and 140 micromol/min). Renal palmitate exchange was unaltered by insulin deprivation.In conclusion, kidney post-absorptively accounts for 5-10% of whole-body protein turnover, 15-20% of leucine transamination and 10-15% of endogenous glucose production, and actively converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. During insulin deprivation, leg becomes a major site for leucine transamination but insulin deprivation does not affect renal phenylalanine, leucine, palmitate or glucose metabolism.

The aim of present study is to characterize the plasma  characteristics of PCOS patients with and without IR, and subsequently identify the potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCOS and its IR complication. A total of 59 plasma samples from eligible healthy controls (CON, n=19), PCOS patients without IR (non-IR PCOS, n=19) and PCOS patients with IR (IR PCOS, n=21) were profiled by an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOFMS) followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Compared to the healthy controls, significant decrease in the levels of phosphocholines (PCs) and lyso PC (18:2), and increase in trilauric glyceride level were observed in the plasma of IR PCOS. Meanwhile, the significant increase in the levels of saturated fatty acids ( and stearic ) and decanoylcarnitine, and decrease in PC (36:2) and PS (36:0) were found in non-IR PCOS patients. Trilauric glyceride and decanoylcarnitine were identified as the potential biomarkers with the highest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PCOS patients with and without IR, respectively. Furthermore, based on these alterations of metabolites, MetPA network pathway analysis suggested a profound involvement of the abnormalities of glycerophospholipid, glycerolipid and fatty  metabolisms in the pathogenesis of PCOS and IR complications. Collectively, LC-MS-based metabolomics provides a promising strategy for complementary diagnosis of PCOS and its IR complication and offers a new insight to understand their pathogenesis mechanisms.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) enzyme has been linked to inflammatory changes in blood vessels that precede the development of atherosclerosis. The expression and role of 12/15-LO in adipocytes have not been evaluated. We found that 12/15-LO mRNA was dramatically upregulated in white epididymal adipocytes of high-fat fed mice. 12/15-LO was poorly expressed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and was upregulated during differentiation into adipocytes. Interestingly, the saturated fatty  palmitate, a major component of high fat diets, augmented expression of 12/15-LO in vitro. When 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with the 12/15-LO products, 12-hydroxyeicosatetranoic  (12(S)-HETE) and 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (12(S)-HPETE), expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-12p40, was upregulated whereas anti-inflammatory adiponectin gene expression was downregulated. 12/15-LO products also augmented c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) phosphorylation, a known negative regulator of insulin signaling. Consistent with impaired insulin signaling, we found that insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes exhibited decreased IRS-1(Tyr) phosphorylation, increased IRS-1(Ser) phosphorylation, and impaired Akt phosphorylation when treated with 12/15-LO product. Taken together, our data suggest that 12/15-LO products create a proinflammatory state and impair insulin signaling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Because 12/15-LO expression is upregulated in visceral adipocytes by high-fat feeding in vivo and also by addition of  in vitro, we propose that 12/15-LO plays a role in promoting inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315313>Optimal elevation of β-cell 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 is a compensatory mechanism that prevents high-fat diet-induced β-cell failure.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes ultimately results from pancreatic β-cell failure.

Elevated 11β-HSD1 is also found in pancreatic islets of obese/diabetic rodents and is hypothesized to suppress insulin secretion and promote diabetes. To define the direct impact of elevated pancreatic β-cell 11β-HSD1 on insulin secretion, we generated β-cell-specific, 11β-HSD1-overexpressing (MIP-HSD1) mice on a strain background prone to β-cell failure. Unexpectedly, MIP-HSD1(tg/+) mice exhibited a reversal of high fat-induced β-cell failure through augmentation of the number and intrinsic function of small islets in association with induction of heat shock, protein kinase A, and extracellular signal-related kinase and p21 signaling pathways. 11β-HSD1(-/-) mice showed mild β-cell impairment that was offset by improved glucose tolerance. The benefit of higher β-cell 11β-HSD1 exhibited a threshold because homozygous MIP-HSD1(tg/tg) mice and diabetic Lep(db/db) mice with markedly elevated β-cell 11β-HSD1 levels had impaired basal β-cell function.

In vitro study indicated that histidine suppresses IL6 and TNF mRNA expression and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) protein production in -induced adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and these changes were diminished by an inhibitor of NF-κB.Histidine supplementation could improve IR, reduce BMI, fat mass and NEFA and suppress inflammation and oxidative stress in obese women with MetS; histidine could improve IR through suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, possibly by the NF-κB pathway, in adipocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22633490>The Sjögren-Larsson  gene encodes a hexadecenal dehydrogenase of the sphingosine 1-phosphate degradation pathway.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) functions not only as a bioactive lipid molecule, but also as an important intermediate of the sole sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid  pathway. However, the precise reactions and the enzymes involved in this pathway remain unresolved. We report here that yeast HFD1 and the Sjögren-Larsson  (SLS)-causative mammalian gene ALDH3A2 are responsible for conversion of the S1P degradation product hexadecenal to hexadecenoic . The absence of ALDH3A2 in CHO-K1 mutant cells caused abnormal metabolism of S1P/hexadecenal to ether-linked glycerolipids. Moreover, we demonstrate that yeast Faa1 and Faa4 and mammalian ACSL family members are acyl-CoA synthetases involved in the sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid  pathway and that hexadecenoic  accumulates in Δfaa1 Δfaa4 mutant cells. These results unveil the entire S1P  pathway: S1P is metabolized to glycerolipids via hexadecenal, hexadecenoic , hexadecenoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA. From our results we propose a possibility that accumulation of the S1P metabolite hexadecenal contributes to the pathogenesis of SLS.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The qualitative NEFA composition presented by 31 components of individual fatty acids was analyzed, by taking into account of glucose-insulin homeostatic changes in MS patients: those without insulin resistance (IR) (Group 1) and those with diagnosed IR (Group 2). MS patients with normal insulinemia were ascertained to have lower levels of lauric, myristic, , C24:0, C16:0i acids. With a decrease in the relative quantity of saturated NEFA, the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) increased. The proportions of linoleic (C18:2 omega 6) and linolenic (C18:3 omega 3) acids doubled (p < 0.01), arachidonic  (C20:4 omega 6) was observed to tend to rise. The cumulative FA index sigma omega 6 increased twofold. In Group 1, the integrated index of changes in the FA series (unsaturation index) was 41% higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). In Group 2, the vector of changes in the relative quantity of NEFA was similar, but impairments were less marked than that in Group 1. The findings suggest that the development of insulin resistance is preceded by impaired blood cell transfer and absorption of NEFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27239345>8-Hydroxyeicosapentaenoic  Decreases Plasma and Hepatic Triglycerides via Activation of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>PPARs regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid homeostasis. PPARs serve as molecular sensors of fatty acids, and their activation can act against obesity and  syndromes. 8-Hydroxyeicosapentaenoic  (8-HEPE) acts as a PPAR ligand and has higher activity than EPA. However, to date, the PPAR ligand activity of 8-HEPE has only been demonstrated in vitro. Here, we investigated its ligand activity in vivo by examining the effect of 8-HEPE treatment on high fat diet-induced obesity in mice. After the 4-week treatment period, the levels of plasma and hepatic triglycerides in the 8-HEPE-fed mice were significantly lower than those in the HFD-fed mice. The expression of genes regulated by PPARα was significantly increased in 8-HEPE-fed mice compared to those that received only HFD. Additionally, the level of hepatic  in 8-HEPE-fed mice was significantly lower than in HFD-fed mice. These results suggested that intake of 8-HEPE induced PPARα activation and increased catabolism of lipids in the liver. We found no significant differences between EPA-fed mice and HFD-fed mice. We demonstrated that 8-HEPE has a larger positive effect on  than EPA and that 8-HEPE acts by inducing PPARα activation in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24063548>PTEN phosphorylation and nuclear export mediate free fatty -induced oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress induced by free fatty acids (FFA) contributes to -associated development of cardiovascular diseases, yet molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed at establishing whether phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and its subcellular location play a role in FFA-induced endothelial oxidative stress.Exposing human endothelial cells (ECs) with FFA activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6K pathway, and upon activation, S6K directly phosphorylated PTEN at S380. Phosphorylation of PTEN increased its interaction with its deubiquitinase USP7 in the nucleus, leading to PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear export. The reduction of PTEN in the nucleus, in turn, decreased p53 acetylation and transcription, reduced the expression of the p53 target gene glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1), resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and endothelial damage. Finally, C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat atherogenic diet (HFAD) showed PTEN nuclear export, decreased p53 and GPX1 protein expressions, elevated levels of ROS, and significant lesions in aortas. Importantly, inhibition of mTOR or S6K effectively blocked these effects, suggesting that mTOR/S6K pathway mediates HFAD-induced oxidative stress and vascular damage via PTEN/p53/GPX1 inhibition in vivo.Our study demonstrated for the first time that S6K directly phosphorylated PTEN at S380 under high FFA conditions, and this phosphorylation mediated FFA-induced endothelial oxidative stress. Furthermore, we showed that S380 phosphorylation affected PTEN monoubiquitination and nuclear localization, providing the first example of coordinated regulation of PTEN nuclear localization via phosphorylation and ubiquitination.Our studies provide a novel mechanism by which hyperlipidemia causes vascular oxidative damage through the phosphorylation of PTEN, blocking of PTEN nuclear function, and inhibition of p53/GPX1 activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27455563>[THE UNESTERIFIED FATTY ACIDS IN BLOOD PLASMA AND INTERCELLULAR MEDIUM: EFFECT OF INSULIN AND ALBUMIN (THE LECTURE)].</a></h2><p>The high content of  saturated fatty ,  triglycerides in food, the large amount of lipoproteins of very low density of the same name in blood, obvious insufficient amount of unesterified fatty acids releasing under lipolysis in blood to meet in vivo requirements in biotransforming energy of ATP are the causes of biological malfunction of homeostasis.

Akt participates in PA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. GSK-3β is a substrate of Akt, we investigated its role in PA-induced apoptosis. We reveal that PA inhibits GSK-3β phosphorylation accompanied by inactivation of Akt in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. We also reveal that inhibition the activity of GSK-3β by its inhibitor LiCl or knockdown by siRNA significantly attenuates PA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, this suggesting that GSK-3β plays a pro-apoptotic role. To detect its downstream factors, we analyzed the roles of JNK, p38 MAPK and β-arrestin 2 (β-Arr2). Here, we report that GSK-3β regulate PA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis by affecting the distribution of β-Arr2. PA diminishes the protein level of β-Arr2 and changes its distribution from nucleus to cytoplasm. Either inhibition of β-Arr2 by its siRNA or overexpression of its protein level by transfection of β-Arr2 full-length plasmid promotes PA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which remind us to focus on the changes of its location. β-Arr2 siRNA decreased the background level of β-Arr2 in nucleus in normal H9c2 cells. Overexpression of β-Arr2 increased cytoplasm level of β-Arr2 as PA did. While LiCl, the inhibitor of GSK-3β decreased PA-induced apoptosis, accompany with increased nucleus level of β-Arr2.

Obese patients are at increased risk of developing hypertension, heart disease, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes and renal disease. The excess calories are stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue, but also may accumulate ectopically in other organs, including the kidney, which contributes to the damage through a toxic process named lipotoxicity. Recently, the evidence suggests that renal lipid accumulation leads to glomerular damage and, more specifically, produces dysfunction in podocytes, key cells that compose and maintain the glomerular filtration barrier. Our aim was to analyze the early mechanisms underlying the development of renal disease associated with the process of lipotoxicity in podocytes. Our results show that treatment of podocytes with  produced intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. This was accompanied by the development of inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance. We found specific rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and slit diaphragm proteins (Nephrin, P-Cadherin, Vimentin) associated with this insulin resistance in -treated podocytes. We conclude that lipotoxicity accelerates glomerular disease through lipid accumulation and inflammation. Moreover, saturated fatty acids specifically promote insulin resistance by disturbing the cytoarchitecture of podocytes. These data suggest that renal lipid metabolism and cytoskeleton rearrangements may serve as a target for specific therapies aimed at slowing the progression of podocyte failure during .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031387> pathways of oleic and  are intensified in PCOS patients with normal androgen levels.</a></h2><p>The aetiology and pathogenesis polycystic ovary  (PCOS) remain uncertain and thus the relative studies are still crucial.Our aim was to analyse the fatty acids profiles of the main phospholipids species in serum from women with PCOS classified into phenotypes, and to diagnose women more susceptible to the occurrence of inflammatory state.PCOS screening tests were performed in The Clinic of Gynecology and Urogynecology of Pomeranian Medical University in the 2014-2015 years.The study are designed for general community and a primary care or referral center.39 patients with PCOS, diagnosed according to Rotterdam's criteria, and 14 healthy women, as a control group, participated in this study.

However, some data suggest heterogeneity within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) depot with potential  differences between the superficial SAT (sSAT) and deep SAT (dSAT) compartments. We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of these three depots with regard to fatty  (FA) composition and gene expression. Adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 75 obese women undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery. FA composition and gene expression were determined with gas chromatography and quantitative real-time-PCR, respectively. Stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity was estimated by product-to-precursor FA ratios. All polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA) with 20 carbons were consistently lower in VAT than either SAT depots, whereas essential PUFA (linoleic , 18:2n-6 and α-linolenic , 18:3n-3) were similar between all three depots. Lauric and  were higher and lower in VAT, respectively. The SCD-1 product palmitoleic  as well as estimated SCD-1 activity was higher in VAT than SAT. Overall, there was a distinct association pattern between lipid metabolizing genes and individual FAs in VAT. In conclusion, SAT and VAT are two distinct depots with regard to FA composition and expression of key lipogenic genes. However, the small differences between sSAT and dSAT suggest that FA metabolism of SAT is rather homogenous.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16531506>Substrate-energy metabolism and  risk factors for cardiovascular disease in relation to fetal growth and adult body composition.</a></h2><p>The effect of fetal programming on intermediary metabolism is uncertain. Therefore, we examined whether fetal programming affects oxidative and nonoxidative macronutrient metabolism and the prevalence of the  in adult life. Healthy older men, aged 64-72 years, with either a lower birth weight (LBW, <or=25th %ile; n = 16) or higher birth weight (HBW, >or=75th %ile; n = 13) had measurements of 1) net oxidative metabolism using indirect calorimetry before and for 6 h after a mixed meal (3,720 kJ) and 2) postprandial oxidation of exogenous [13C]. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. After adjustment for current weight and height, the LBW group had a lower resting energy expenditure (REE) in the preprandial (4.01 vs. 4.54 kJ/min, P = 0.015) and postprandial state (4.60 vs. 5.20 kJ/min, P = 0.004), and less fat-free mass than the HBW group. The BW category was a significant, independent, and better predictor of REE than weight plus height. There were no significant differences between groups in net oxidative and nonoxidative macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate) metabolism (or of exogenous [13C]palmitate) or in the prevalence of the , which was present almost twice as commonly in the LBW than in the HBW group. The study suggests that fetal programming affects both pre- and postprandial EE in older life by mechanisms that are at least partly related to the mass of the fat-free body.

We aim to characterize the hepatoprotective effects of Leonurine hydrochloride (LH) and the possible pathway in a cell and rodent model of diet-induced steatohepatitis (NASH).For in vitro studies,  (PA) and free fatty  (FFA) induced HepG2 and HL7702 steatosis cell models were used. For in vivo studies, NASH was induced by feeding mice MCD diet. These mice received either placebo or LH at three different doses (50、100、200 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks. Histological staining's, and commercially available kits for ALT and AST and hepatic contents of TG, TC, MDA, SOD, and GSH were used to assess NASH. Furthermore, relative liver protein and gene expression levels were determined by Western Blot and qPCR, respectively.After establishing NASH models, LH treatment improved lipid accumulation, hepatic contents of TG, TC, and expression levels of ALT and AST in dose-dependent manner. Also, LH improved MDA, SOD, and GSH expression levels. The results of RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that LH upregulated the expression of AMPK phosphorylation and downregulated SREBP-1c and its target genes expression level.Our data reveal the promising role of Leonurine hydrochloride in the prevention and treatment of NASH, in vitro and in vivo. This effect may be partially mediated by the AMPK/SREBP1 pathway. These findings provide a novel therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Although vascular calcification is invariably associated with atherosclerosis, the mechanisms involved are not completely elucidated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that EPA prevents the osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) induced by  (PA), the most abundant long-chain saturated fatty  in plasma. PA increased and EPA abolished the expression of the genes for bone-related proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, Msx2 and osteopontin in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC). Among the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) subfamily, ACSL3 expression was predominant in HASMC, and PA robustly increased and EPA efficiently inhibited ACSL3 expression. Importantly, PA-induced osteoblastic differentiation was mediated, at least in part, by ACSL3 activation because acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) inhibitor or siRNA targeted to ACSL3 completely prevented the PA induction of both BMP-2 and Msx2. Conversely, adenovirus-mediated ACSL3 overexpression enhanced PA-induced BMP-2 and Msx2 expression. In addition, EPA, ACSL3 siRNA and ACS inhibitor attenuated calcium deposition and caspase activation induced by PA. Notably, PA induced activation of NF-κB, and NF-κB inhibitor prevented PA-induction of osteoblastic gene expression and calcium deposition. Immunohistochemistry revealed the prominent expression of ACSL3 in VSMC and macrophages in human non-calcifying and calcifying atherosclerotic plaques from the carotid arteries. These results identify ACSL3 and NF-κB as mediators of PA-induced osteoblastic differentiation and calcium deposition in VSMC and suggest that EPA prevents vascular calcification by inhibiting such a new molecular pathway elicited by PA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28731787>Effect of Euterpe oleracea Mart.

The oil from the fruits of Euterpe oleracea (OFEO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids with potential for treating alterations in lipid metabolism. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of OFEO on hyperlipidemia induced by Cocos nucifera L. saturated fat (GSC) in Wistar rats. Chromatographic profile showed that unsaturated fatty acids account for 66.08% in OFEO, predominately oleic  (54.30%), and saturated fatty acids ( 31.6%) account for 33.92%. GSC-induced dyslipidemia resulted in an increase in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and liver and abdominal fat, as well as atherogenic processes in the thoracic aorta. OFEO treatment did not reduce hypertriglyceridemia, but did reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic action of OFEO. OFEO treatment inhibited the formation of atheromatous plaques in the vascular endothelium of the treated rats, as well as those who were treated with simvastatin.

We recently isolated and identified (7E)-9-oxohexadec-7-enoic  (1) and (10E)-9-oxohexadec-10-enoic  (2) from the marine algae Chaetoceros karianus. Herein we report the total synthesis, pharmacological characterization, and biological evaluations of these naturally occurring oxo-fatty acids (oFAs). The syntheses of 1 and 2 afforded sufficient material for extensive biological evaluations. Both oFAs show an appreciable dose-dependent activation of PPARα and -γ, with EC values in the micromolar range, and an ability to regulate important PPAR target genes in hepatocytes and adipocytes. Moreover, both 1 and 2 are able to drive adipogenesis when evaluated in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel  (SGBS) pre-adipocyte cell model, but with lowered expression of adipocyte markers and reduced lipid accumulation compared to the drug rosiglitazone. This seems to be caused by a transient upregulation of PPARγ and C/EBPα expression. Importantly, whole transcriptome analysis shows that both compounds induce anti-diabetic gene programs in adipocytes by upregulating insulin-sensitizing adipokines and repressing pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Mice, 3 weeks old, were fed a HFD for 60 d. Subgroups were treated with 3 mg/kg body weight 7-HMR (HMRLignan™) or 10 mg/kg body weight TEP by oral administration. 7-HMR and TEP limited the increase in body weight (-11 and -13 %) and fat mass (-11 and -18 %) in the HFD-fed mice. Epididymal adipocytes were 19 and -12 % smaller and the liver was less steatotic (-62 and -65 %). Serum lipids decreased in TEP-treated mice (-11 % cholesterol, -23 % LDL and -15 % TAG) and sugar metabolism was ameliorated by both lignan preparations, as shown by a more than 70 % decrease in insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The expression of several  genes was modulated by the HFD with an effect that was reversed by lignan. In 3T3-L1 cells, the 7-HMR metabolites enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) showed a 40 % inhibition of cell differentiation accompanied by the inhibited expression of the adipogenic genes PPARγ, C/EBPα and aP2. Furthermore, END and ENL caused a 10 % reduction in TAG uptake in HEPA 1-6 hepatoma cells.

We postulate that the fatty acids carried on filtered albumin could contribute to the deleterious effects of proteinuria. The effects of fatty -albumin complexes on lipid metabolism have been studied in opossum kidney (OK) cells, a proximal tubule cell line. OK cells transported two-thirds of [14C]palmitate-albumin (5 mg/ml) intracellularly within 16 h. [14C]palmitate-albumin was distributed into phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylinositols, and tri- and diglycerides. 14C-labeled unsaturated fatty  albumins (oleate, linoleate, and arachidonate) showed preferential incorporation into triglycerides, with lesser incorporation into phospholipids. Studies of total lipid pools showed that fatty -albumin uptake produced a particularly marked increase in total triglyceride levels (approximately 10-fold). Oil red O staining of OK cells cultured with oleate-albumin showed a marked increase in intracellular lipid droplets, compared with cells cultured with delipidated albumin, consistent with triglyceride accumulation. Less than 1% of [14C]palmitate taken up was isolated as intracellular free fatty . Less than 5% of [14C]palmitate internalized was oxidized to 14CO2. Different fatty acids, when taken up by the OK cell, have distinct  fates. Each fatty  is incorporated in a characteristic fashion into certain complex lipids, possibly dependent on the presence or absence of double bonds.

Unexpectedly, when perfused ex vivo, working VLCAD null mouse hearts maintained values similar to those of the controls for functional parameters and for the contribution of exogenous palmitate to β-oxidation (energy production), even at high palmitate concentration (1 mM) and increased energy demand (with 1 μM epinephrine) or after fasting. However, in vivo, these hearts displayed a prolonged rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval under all conditions examined, as well as the following lipid alterations: 1) age- and condition-dependent accumulation of triglycerides, and 2) 20% lower docosahexaenoic  (an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty ) in membrane phospholipids. The latter was independent of liver but affected by feeding a diet enriched in saturated fat (exacerbated) or fish oil (attenuated). Our finding of a longer QTc interval in VLCAD null mice appears to be most relevant given that such condition increases the risk of sudden cardiac death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29546476>Ceramide stearic to  ratio predicts incident diabetes.</a></h2><p>Ceramide lipids have a role in the development of insulin resistance, diabetes and risk of cardiovascular disease. Here we investigated four ceramides and their ratios to find the best predictors of incident diabetes.A validated mass-spectrometric method was applied to measure Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) from serum or plasma samples.

Despite considerable studies on the mechanisms of hepatic insulin resistance, the link between epigenetic regulation and the development of insulin resistance remains elusive. Here, we reported that G9a/EHMT2, a histone methyltransferase, was markedly decreased in the liver of db/db mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In cultured hepatic cells, G9a knockdown resulted in downregulation of insulin receptor, p-AKT and p-GSK3β; while upon upregulation, G9a prevented the - or glucosamine-induced insulin resistance by preserving the normal level of insulin receptor and integrity of insulin signaling. Further mechanistic study suggested that G9a regulated the expression level of high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), a key regulator responsible for the transcription of insulin receptor (INSR) gene. Overexpression of HMGA1 normalized the impaired insulin signaling in G9a knockdown hepatic cells. Importantly, in db/db mice, restoring the expression level of G9a not only upregulated HMGA1 level and improved the impaired hepatic insulin signaling, but also alleviated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Together, our results revealed a novel role for G9a in modulating insulin signaling, at least in part, depending on its regulatory function on HMGA1.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) is a rate-limiting enzyme that converts saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids. Previous studies have shown that SCD1-deficinent mice are protected from insulin resistance and diet-induced obesity; however, the role of SCD1 in the heart remains to be determined. We examined the expression of SCD1 in obese rat hearts induced by a sucrose-rich diet for 3 months. We also examined the effect of SCD1 on myocardial energy metabolism and apoptotic cell death in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in the presence of SFAs. Here we showed that the expression of SCD1 increases 3.6-fold without measurable change in the expression of lipogenic genes in the heart of rats fed a high-sucrose diet. Forced SCD1 expression augmented -induced lipid accumulation, but attenuated excess fatty  oxidation and restored reduced glucose oxidation. Of importance, SCD1 substantially inhibited SFA-induced caspase 3 activation, ceramide synthesis, diacylglycerol synthesis, apoptotic cell death, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Experiments using SCD1 siRNA confirmed these observations. Furthermore, we showed that exposure of cardiac myocytes to glucose and insulin induced SCD1 expression. Our results indicate that SCD1 is highly regulated by a  component in the heart, and such induction of SCD1 serves to alleviate SFA-induced adverse fatty  catabolism, and eventually to prevent SFAs-induced apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17658692>Identification of palmitate-regulated genes in HepG2 cells by applying microarray analysis.</a></h2><p>Palmitate is the most abundant saturated fatty  in the human diet and the major one synthesized de novo.

Herein, early and persistently elevated, proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1 expression was detected in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model in C57BL/6 mice. The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated  in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and  function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429  conditional knockout mice (miR-429), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe  inflammation and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4-JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback.

Fatty acids in plasma triglycerides (TGs) may help to explain part of this heterogeneity. This study compared TG fatty  profile of adults with and without abdominal obesity and examined the associations of these fatty acids with MetS components.Fifty-four abdominally obese subjects were matched by age and sex with 54 adults without abdominal obesity. People were classified with MetS according to the harmonizing criteria for MetS. Fatty acids in plasma TGs were analyzed by gas chromatography.There were no differences in fatty acids of plasma TGs between people with and without abdominal obesity. However, there were differences between abdominally obese people with and without MetS. The abdominally obese group with MetS had higher  (+2.9%; P = 0.012) and oleic (+4.0%; P = 0.001) acids and lower linoleic (-6.4%; P = 0.018) and arachidonic (-1.2%; P = 0.004) acids. After adjustment for abdominal obesity, age, and sex, a stepwise regression analysis showed that  positively contributed to the variance in insulin (β = +1.08 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index (β = +1.09 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and myristic  positively contributed to the variance in systolic blood pressure (β = +1.09 ± 1.03; P = 0.006).

Multiple stepwise regression models revealed that baPWV was significantly influenced by systolic blood pressure, age, body weight, triglyceride and LA in serum phospholipids (R(2) = 0.378). Interestingly, baPWV (1419 ± 1 cm/s) and MetS (22%) were highest in individuals with lower proportion of LA (< 12.361%) and higher proportion of DGLA (≥ 1.412%) in serum phospholipid FAs.The features of MetS significantly related to serum phosopholipid FA composition.

Here, we used an acute inflammation model in which pigs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that hepatic glycolysis and fatty  oxidation are both promoted. Acetyl-proteome profiling of LPS-infected pigs liver showed that inflammatory stress exacerbates the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins. Both mitochondrial glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2) and malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) were acetylated, and the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity was stimulated to maintain glycolysis. With the use of C-carbon tracing in vitro, acetyl-CoA was found to be mainly supplied by lipid-derived fatty  oxidation rather than glucose-derived pyruvate oxidative decarboxylation, while glucose was mainly used for lactate production in response to inflammatory stress. The results of the mitochondrial experiment showed that acetyl-CoA directly increases MDH2 and, in turn, the GOT2 acetylation level affects MAS activity. Treatment with palmitate in primary hepatocytes from LPS-injected pigs increased the hepatic production of acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and lactate; MAS activity; and hepatic MDH2 and GOT2 hyperacetylation, while the deficiency of long-chain acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase resulted in the stabilization of these parameters. These observations suggest that acetyl-CoA produced by fatty  oxidation promotes MAS activity and glycolysis via nonenzymatic acetylation during the inflammatory stress response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26763130>Fructose and glucose combined with free fatty acids induce  disorders in HepG2 cell: A new model to study the impacts of high-fructose/sucrose and high-fat diets in vitro.</a></h2><p>This work investigated the underlying mechanism of high-fructose/sucrose and high-fat diets, which rapidly induce  in vivo, via a new cell model.Glucose and/or fructose were used to induce the human hepatoma cell (HepG2) in the presence of , oleic , or combined fatty acids (CFA) for 24 h.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subchronic withdrawal from a high-carbohydrate, high-saturated fat (HCHF) diet during MetS with reference to changes in deleterious SFA (C12:0, lauric ; C14:0, myristic ; C16:0, ; C18:0, stearic ) distribution in liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), and feces.MetS induced by prolonged feeding of an HCHF diet in Wistar albino rat is used as a model of human MetS. The MetS-induced rats were withdrawn from the HCHF diet and changed to a basal diet for final 4 wk of the total experimental duration of 16 wk. SFA distribution in target tissues and hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression were analyzed.Analyses of changes in SFA concentration of target tissues indicate that C16:0 and C18:0 reduced in WAT and liver after withdrawal of the HCHF diet. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in fecal C12:0 with HCHF feeding, which significantly (P < 0.01) increased after withdrawal of this diet. Also, an improvement in expression of hepatic LDLr was observed after withdrawal of HCHF diet.The prolonged consumption of an HCHF diet leads to increased SFA accumulation in liver and WAT, decreased SFA excretion, and reduced hepatic LDLr expression during MetS, which is prominently reversed after subchronic withdrawal of the HCHF diet. This can contribute to better understanding of the  fate of dietary SFA during MetS and may apply to the potential reversal of complications by the simple approach of nutritional modification.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Rabbits fed with a moderate Fatty-- Enriched Diet 3%  (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and liver function. Liver samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure lipid accumulation, the expression of inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4. Chronic consumption by 6-months of FAED did not generate  changes, but it induced fatty liver. We also observed the development of low-grade inflammation characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of  disorders, such as overweight/obesity and . However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of  alterations.

FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and  aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Data show that the saturated fatty  , as well as lauric  and stearic , trigger the release of TNFα and IL-6 from astrocytes. Unsaturated fatty acids were unable to induce cytokine release from cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, the effects of  on cytokine release require Toll-like receptor 4 rather than CD36 or Toll-like receptor 2, and do not depend on  metabolism to palmitoyl-CoA. Inhibitor studies revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of p38 or p42/44 MAPK pathways prevents the pro-inflammatory effects of , whereas JNK and PI3K inhibition does not affect cytokine release. Depletion of microglia from primary astrocyte cultures using the lysosomotropic agent l-leucine methyl ester revealed that the ability of  to trigger cytokine release is not dependent on the presence of microglia. Finally, data show that the essential ω-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  acts in a dose-dependent manner to prevent the actions of  on inflammatory signaling in astrocytes. Collectively, these data demonstrate the ability of saturated fatty acids to induce astrocyte inflammation in vitro. These data thus raise the possibility that high levels of circulating saturated fatty acids could cause reactive gliosis and brain inflammation in vivo, and could potentially participate in the reported adverse neurologic consequences of obesity and .© 2012 The Authors.

We investigated pro-inflammatory resistin and anti-inflammatory adiponectin regulation during oral lipid ingestion (OLI) in healthy adults. Response of resistin upon free fatty  (FFA) stimulation was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.100 healthy volunteers underwent OLI. Venous blood was drawn after 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours (h). Subjects were characterized by anthropometric and standard laboratory parameters. Serum concentrations of adiponectin and resistin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Adipocytes were stimulated with FFA and concentrations of adipokines were measured by ELISA.Irrespective of BMI and gender, OLI led to a significant reduction of resistin serum levels in a stepwise manner whereas adiponectin concentrations remained unchanged. There were positive correlations of resistin with waist/hip ratio and visfatin levels, as was calculated by regression analysis. Resistin concentrations were significantly higher in smokers when compared to non-smokers. Adiponectin concentrations were higher in females and in users of hormonal contraception. Adiponectin levels showed a positive correlation with heart rate and HDL cholesterol and a negative correlation with age, waist/hip-ratio, BMI, diastolic/systolic blood pressure, visfatin levels and LDL/HDL-ratio. Resistin secretion was significantly induced by , linoleic  and oleic  in adipocytes.OLI is a physiological repressor of systemic resistin release whereas FFA upregulate resistin release in vitro from adipocytes.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606881>Ceramide-activated phosphatase mediates fatty -induced endothelial VEGF resistance and impaired angiogenesis.</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction, including endothelial hyporesponsiveness to prototypical angiogenic growth factors and eNOS agonists, underlies vascular pathology in many dysmetabolic states. We investigated effects of a saturated free fatty ,  (PA), on endothelial cell responses to VEGF. PA-pretreated endothelial cells had markedly diminished Akt, eNOS, and ERK activation responses to VEGF, despite normal VEGFR2 phosphorylation. PA inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenic cord formation in Matrigel, and PA-treated endothelial cells accumulated early species (C16) ceramide. The serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor myriocin reversed these defects. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) became more eNOS-associated in PA-treated cells; the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  reversed PA-induced signaling defects. Mice fed a diet high in saturated fat for 2 to 3 weeks had impaired i) aortic Akt and eNOS phosphorylation to infused VEGF, ii) ear angiogenic responses to intradermal adenoviral-VEGF injection, and iii) vascular flow recovery to hindlimb ischemia as indicated by laser Doppler and αVβ3 SPECT imaging. High-fat feeding did not impair VEGF-induced signaling or angiogenic responses in mice with reduced serine palmitoyltransferase expression. Thus, de novo ceramide synthesis is required for these detrimental PA effects. The findings demonstrate an endothelial VEGF resistance mechanism conferred by PA, which comprises ceramide-induced, PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of critical activation sites on enzymes central to vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis.

Furthermore, these diseases are linked to an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, mild cognitive impairment and even Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise actions of elevated PA levels on neurons and their association with neuronal  disruption that leads to the expression of pathological markers of AD, such as the overproduction and accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide, represent an area of intense investigation. A possible molecular mechanism involved in the effects of PA may be through dysfunction of the NAD sensor enzyme, SIRT1. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the relationship between the effects of PA metabolism on the function of SIRT1 and the upregulation of BACE1 in cultured hippocampal neurons. PA reduced the total amount of NAD in neurons that caused an increase in p65 K310 acetylation due to inhibition of SIRT1 activity and low protein content. Furthermore, BACE1 protein and its activity were increased, and BACE1 was relocated in neurites after PA exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20040361>Activation of PPARdelta up-regulates fatty  oxidation and energy uncoupling genes of mitochondria and reduces palmitate-induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence indicates that decreased oxidative capacity, lipotoxicity, and mitochondrial aberrations contribute to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) activation on lipid oxidation, mitochondrial function, and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. After HIT-T15 cells (a beta-cell line) were exposed to high concentrations of palmitate and GW501516 (GW; a selective agonist of PPARdelta), we found that administration of GW increased the expression of PPARdelta mRNA. GW-induced activation of PPARdelta up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2); alleviated mitochondrial swelling; attenuated apoptosis; and reduced basal insulin secretion induced by increased palmitate in HIT cells. These results suggest that activation of PPARdelta plays an important role in protecting pancreatic beta-cells against aberrations caused by lipotoxicity in  and diabetes.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

It is still largely unknown how these mitochondrial respiratory chain defects affect cellular metabolisms and lead to variable clinical phenotypes. Here, we analyzed  signatures in a cellular model of MELAS/ Leigh overlap  using untargeted gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). .We obtained fibroblasts from a MELAS/Leigh overlap  patient carrying the heteroplasmic m.10191T>C mutation, and generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from these fibroblast. Isogenic iPSC clones carrying two different loads of the heteroplasmic mutation (ND3hig-iPSC, ND3"*w- iPSC-) were subjected to metabolome analysis. Metabolite profiles, which were identified by GC-MS, were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA).We were able to identify about 40 metabolites in control fibroblasts and iPSCs. Upon comparative metabolome analysis between fibroblasts and iPSCs, lactic  and proline were distinct between the two groups. When we compared patient fibroblasts and control fibroblasts, no significant distinct metabolites were found. On the other hand, patient specific iPSC with high mutational load (ND3high_ iPSC) showed a distinct metabolite profile compared with ND3""-iPSC and control-iPSCs. Metabolites that contributed to this distinction were pyruvate, malic , , stearic , and lactic .

Blockade of LDLP absorption by apoB endocytosis and deficit of poly-FA constitute the etiological basis of atherosclerosis. Its pathogenetic basis is the excess of  VLDLP with LDPL density in the intercellular space that block absorption of linoleic LDLP with all transferred SC poly-FA. Atheromatosis is clinically and prognostically most significant symptom of atherosclerosis associated with accumulation of ligand-free VLDLP and LDLP in arterial intima of the elastic type as the local pool of interstitial tissue for intravascular pool of intercellular medium. Type 2 diabetes mellitus in aged patients is a symptom of atherosclerosis resulting from SC poly-FA deficit and GLUT4 incompetence. Insulin-dependent cells differ in the degree of insulin resistance.

Involvement of selenoproteins in energy metabolism after Scly disruption was also examined in vitro in the murine hepatoma cell line, Hepa1-6, following palmitate treatment.Scly KO mice were more susceptible to diet-induced obesity than their wild-type counterparts after feeding a high-fat selenium-adequate diet. Scly KO mice had aggravated hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, glucose, and insulin intolerance, but unchanged inflammatory cytokines and expression of most selenoproteins, except increased serum selenoprotein P (Sepp1). Scly KO mice also exhibited enhanced hepatic levels of pyruvate and enzymes involved in the regulation of pyruvate cycling, such as pyruvate carboxylase (Pcx) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh). However, in vitro silencing of Scly in Hepa1-6 cells led to diminished Sepp1 expression, and concomitant palmitate treatment decreased Pdh expression.The role of selenium in lipid metabolism is recognized, but specific selenium-dependent mechanisms leading to obesity are unclear. This study uncovers that Scly has a remarkable effect on obesity and  development triggered by high-fat exposure, independent of the expression of most selenoproteins.Diet-induced obesity in Scly KO mice is aggravated, with effects on pyruvate levels and consequent activation of energy metabolism independent of selenoprotein levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25046734>Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II activation by exercise regulates saturated & unsaturated fatty acids and improves some  markers.</a></h2><p>Activation of Calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMK)-II by exercise has a plethora of benefits in health. Fatty acids play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of  (MetS). Prevention of MetS and treatment of its main characteristics are very significant to fight against type 2 diabetes. CaMKII activation in the regulation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in relation to type 2 diabetes and MetS has not been studied, which became the focus of this present study.Using Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry, we investigated saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. Quantitative real time PCR was also used to assess the gene expression.Results indicate that both palmitoleic  and oleic  which are monounsaturated fatty acids were increased in response to CaMKII activation. On the other hand, myristic  and  which are saturated fatty acids known to increase the risk factors of MetS and type 2 diabetes were decreased by exercise induction of CaMKII. Conversely, lauric  also a saturated fatty  was increased in response to CaMKII activation by exercise. This fatty  is known to have beneficial effects in alleviating symptoms of both type 2 diabetes and MetS.According to our knowledge, this is the first study to show that CaMKII activation by exercise regulates fatty acids essential in type 2 diabetes and MetS.

However, the mechanisms underlying the association between increased psoriasis severity and concomitant  have not been fully clarified. Herein, we show that imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation was exacerbated and prolonged in diabetic obese mice compared to that in control mice, accompanied by remarkably increased lesional expressions of Cxcl5 and Il-1b. Notably, a large number of CXCL5 Ly6G cells infiltrated the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue of the diabetic obese mice. Most macrophages in the subcutaneous fat tissues of the diabetic obese mice were positive for expression of IL-1β and GRP78/Bip, an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker. Depletion of Ly6G cells and macrophages diminished the imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation. Further, CXCL5 potentiated the secretion of IL-1β from macrophages and , a fatty  released from subcutaneous adipocytes, further enhanced IL-1β secretion via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction.

In an animal model of  we investigated the association between intake of carbon black (CB, 14nm) particles and hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and gene expression of Srebp-1, Fasn and Scd-1 involved in lipid synthesis. There was a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular lipid content after exposure to CB in HepG2 cells, which was only observed after co-exposure to oleic/. Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells after exposure to diesel exhaust particles, fullerenes C60 or pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes.

However, the role of autophagy of myeloid cells in adipose tissue inflammation and type 2 diabetes has not been addressed. We produced mice with myeloid cell-specific deletion of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), an essential autophagy gene (Atg7 conditional knockout [cKO] mice). While Atg7 cKO mice were metabolically indistinguishable from control mice, they developed diabetes when bred to ob/w mice (Atg7 cKO-ob/ob mice), accompanied by increases in the crown-like structure, inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammasome activation in adipose tissue. Mφs (macrophages) from Atg7 cKO mice showed significantly higher interleukin 1 β release and inflammasome activation in response to a  plus lipopolysaccharide combination. Moreover, a decrease in the NAD(+):NADH ratio and increase in intracellular ROS content after treatment with  in combination with lipopolysaccharide were more pronounced in Mφs from Atg7 cKO mice, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction in autophagy-deficient Mφs leads to an increase in lipid-induced inflammasome and  deterioration in Atg7 cKO-ob/ob mice.

We aimed to investigate the functional role of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in modulating local mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of human and experimental non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Muscle biopsies were obtained from morbid obese NAFLD patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

Several muscle miRNAs, including miR-34a, were found increased with human NAFLD progression. Activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway, concomitant with impairment in insulin signalling mediators and deregulation of mitochondrial-shaping proteins, was evident in C2C12 cells incubated with PA, as well as in the skeletal muscle of all three diet-induced NAFLD mice models.
