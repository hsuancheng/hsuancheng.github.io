<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461945>, a Metabolite of the Microbiome, Increases Oxidative Stress in Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>In breast cancer patients, the diversity of the microbiome decreases, coinciding with decreased production of cytostatic bacterial metabolites like  (LCA). We hypothesized that LCA can modulate oxidative stress to exert cytostatic effects in breast cancer cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with LCA decreased nuclear factor-2 (NRF2) expression and increased Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (KEAP1) expression via activation of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor (TGR5) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Altered NRF2 and KEAP1 expression subsequently led to decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), an antioxidant enzyme, and increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The imbalance between the pro- and antioxidant enzymes increased cytostatic effects via increased levels of lipid and protein oxidation. These effects were reversed by the pharmacological induction of NRF2 with RA839, tBHQ, or by thiol antioxidants. The expression of key components of the LCA-elicited cytostatic pathway (iNOS and 4HNE) gradually decreased as the breast cancer stage advanced. The level of lipid peroxidation in tumors negatively correlated with the mitotic index. The overexpression of iNOS, nNOS, CAR, KEAP1, NOX4, and TGR5 or the downregulation of NRF2 correlated with better survival in breast cancer patients, except for triple negative cases. Taken together, LCA, a metabolite of the gut microbiome, elicits oxidative stress that slows down the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The LCA-oxidative stress protective pathway is lost as breast cancer progresses, and the loss correlates with poor prognosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29412511>Comprehensive bile  profiling in hereditary intrahepatic cholestasis: Genetic and clinical correlations.</a></h2><p>Genetic defects causing dysfunction in bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) lead to liver diseases. ABCB11 mutations alter the bile  metabolome. We asked whether profiling plasma bile acids could reveal compensatory mechanisms and track genetic and clinical status.We compared plasma bile acids in 17 ABCB11-mutated patients, 35 healthy controls and 12 genetically undiagnosed cholestasis patients by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/multiple-reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (UPLC/MRM-MS). We developed an index to rank bile  hydrophobicity, and thus toxicity, based on LC retention times. We recruited 42 genetically diagnosed hereditary cholestasis patients, of whom 12 were presumed to have impaired BSEP function but carried mutations in genes other than ABCB11, and 8 healthy controls, for further verification.The overall hydrophobicity indices of total bile acids in both the ABCB11-mutated group (11.89 ± 1.07 min) and the undiagnosed cholestasis group (11.46 ± 1.07 min) were lower than those of healthy controls (13.69 ± 0.77 min) (both p < 0.005). This was owing to increased bile  modifications. Secondary bile acids were detected in patients without BSEP expression, suggesting biliary bile  secretion through alternative routes. A diagnostic panel comprising  (LCA), tauro-LCA, glyco-LCA and hyocholic  was identified that could differentiate the ABCB11-mutated cohort from healthy controls and undiagnosed cholestasis patients (AUC=0.946, p < 0.0001) and, in non-ABCB11-mutated cholestasis patients, could distinguish BSEP dysfunction from normal BSEP function (9/12 vs 0/38, p < 0.0000001).Profiling of plasma bile acids has provided insights into cholestasis alleviation and may be useful for the clinical management of cholestatic diseases.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Methyl 3α-acetoxy-7-oxo-cholanate (1), methyl 3α-acetoxy-12-oxo-cholanate (2) and methyl 3α,7α-diacetoxy-12-oxo-cholanate (3) were subjected to Baeyer-Villiger oxidation to provide homolactones (7-9) or to the Beckmann rearrangement of the corresponding oximes to give homolactams (16-18). Both reactions proceed regio- and stereoselectively. Ring B homolog of  (20) was efficiently synthesized. Among these compounds, 7, 9 and 16 were found to have the significant activity, with IC50 values ⩽3μM against α-2,6-(N)-ST selectively, which are 5-fold lower than that of Lith-O-Asp. Given the reality that LCA and its analogue, Lith-O-Asp, have been revealed to improve inhibitory efficacy of ST and to have a wide range of antimetastatic activities in different human cancer cells, the up-to-date findings have noteworthy pharmacological significance as they open a promising path to the improvement of a prospective molecular targeted application of modified LCA analogues as agents for the treatment of cancer metastasis.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight.

PC patients administered drugs locally in the tumor region, such as in intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPCh), suffer from low drug retention time and tumor penetration. Herein, we synthesized a  (LCA)-conjugated disulfide-linked polyethyleneimine (ssPEI) micelle (LAPMi) nanoconstruct by covalently conjugating ssPEI and LCA, thereby forming positive charged nanomicellar structures loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) (LAPMi-PTX) for IPCh. The incorporation of a positive surface charge aided in prolonging the peritoneal retention time, presumably via ascites-induced protein corona formation, and the subsequent size expansion caused resistance against undesired clearance through lymphatic openings. Furthermore, preferential tumor penetration by LAPMi-PTX is attributable to the permeation-enhancing properties of LCA, and the subsequent tumor activatable drug release was induced by the presence of disulfide linkages. By integrating these properties, LAPMi exhibited prolonged peritoneal residence time, enhanced tumor permeation and chemotherapeutic effect evidenced by in vitro, tumor spheroid and in vivo studies. Importantly, our strategy enabled significant PC inhibition and increased the overall survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, we provided a new paradigm of intractable PC treatment by enabling the prolonged residence time of the nanoconstruct, thereby enhancing tumor penetration and anti-tumor therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

When drug insults result in liver damage, the variances of bile acids (BAs) are related to the physiological status of the liver. Here, we established a method to simultaneously quantify 19 BAs in rat plasma, liver, bile and different intestinal section contents (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon) using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to reveal the pattern of bile  homeostasis in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in physiological situations. Dynamic changes in bile  composition appeared throughout the enterohepatic circulation of the BAs; taurine- and glycine-conjugated BAs and free BAs had different dynamic homeostasis levels in the circulatory system. cholic  (CA), beta-muricholic  (beta-MCA),  (LCA), glycocholic  (GCA) and taurocholic  (TCA) greatly fluctuated in the bile  pool under physiological conditions. Taurine- and glycine-conjugated bile acids constituted more than 90% in the bile and liver, whereas GCA and TCA accounted for more than half of the total bile acids and the secretion of bile mainly via conjugating with taurine. While over 80% of BAs in plasma were unconjugated bile acids, CA and HDCA were the most abundant elements. Unconjugated bile acids constituted more than 90% in the intestine, and CA, beta-MCA and HDCA were the top three bile acids in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum content, but LCA and HDCA were highest in the cecum and colon content. As the main secondary bile  converted by microflora in the intestine, LCA was enriched in the cecum and DCA mostly in the colon. As endogenous substances, the concentrations of plasma BAs were closely related to time rhythm and diet. In conclusion, analyzing detailed BA profiles in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in a single run is possible using LC-MS/MS. Based on the physiological characteristics of the  profiling of 19 BAs in the total bile  pool and the time rhythm variation of the endogenous bile acids, this study provided a new valuable method and theoretical basis for the clinical research of bile  homeostasis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In BA-free medium, the potent cholestatic drugs cyclosporine A, chlorpromazine, and troglitazone reduced endogenous BA synthesis after 24 hours, whereas the rarely cholestatic drugs tolcapone, trovafloxacin, and tacrolimus reduced BA synthesis only after 6 days. In the presence of physiologic serum BA concentrations, cyclosporine A, chlorpromazine, and troglitazone induced early and preferential cellular accumulation of unconjugated , deoxycholic, and chenodeoxycholic acids that increased 8- to 12-fold and 47- to 50-fold after 24 hours and 6 days, respectively. Accumulation of these hydrophobic BAs resulted from strong inhibition of amidation, and in addition, for  reduction of its sulfoconjugation, and was associated with variable alterations of uptake and efflux transporters. Trovafloxacin also caused BA accumulation, especially after 6 days, whereas tolcapone and tacrolimus were still without effect. However, when exogenous BAs were added to the medium at cholestatic serum concentrations, a 6-day treatment with all drugs resulted in cellular BA accumulation with higher folds of chenodeoxycholic and  acids. At the tested concentration, tolcapone had the lowest effect. These results bring the first demonstration that major cholestatic drugs can cause preferential and progressive in vitro cellular accumulation of unconjugated toxic hydrophobic BAs and bring new insights into mechanisms involved in drug-induced cellular accumulation of toxic BAs.Copyright © 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316997>Microbiota-Related Changes in Unconjugated Fecal Bile Acids Are Associated With Naturally Occurring, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in Dogs.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans has recently been associated with altered intestinal microbiota.

Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA)  which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA  in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM.

MAFG interacts directly with methionine adenosyltransferase α1 (MATα1) and other transcription factors at the E-box element to repress transcription. We studied mechanisms of MAFG up-regulation in cholestatic tissues and the pathways by which S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) prevent the increase in MAFG expression. We also investigated whether obeticholic  (OCA), an farnesoid X receptor agonist, affects MAFG expression and how it contributes to tumor growth in mice.We obtained 7 human cholangiocarcinoma specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from patients that underwent surgical resection in California and 113 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues from China, along with clinical data from patients.

We studied mice with bile-duct ligation, orthotopic cholangiocarcinomas, cholestasis-induced cholangiocarcinoma, diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors, and xenograft tumors.LCA activated expression of MAFG in HepG2 and MzChA-1 cells, which required the activator protein-1, nuclear factor-κB, and E-box sites in the MAFG promoter. LCA reduced expression of MAT1A but increased expression of MAT2A in cells. Overexpression of MAT2A increased activity of the MAFG promoter, whereas knockdown of MAT2A reduced it. MAT1A and MAT2A had opposite effects on the activator protein-1, nuclear factor-κB, and E-box-mediated promoter activity. Expression of MAFG and MAT2A increased, and expression of MAT1A decreased, in diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumors in mice. SAMe and UDCA had shared and distinct mechanisms of preventing LCA-mediated increased expression of MAFG. OCA increased expression of MAFG, MAT2A, and c-MYC, but reduced expression of MAT1A. Incubation of human liver and biliary cancer cells lines with OCA promoted their proliferation; in nude mice given OCA, xenograft tumors were larger than in mice given vehicle. Levels of MAFG were increased in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. High levels of MAFG in HCC samples correlated with hepatitis B, vascular invasion, and shorter survival times of patients.Expression of MAFG increases in cells and tissues with cholestasis, as well as in human cholangiocarcinoma and HCC specimens; high expression levels correlate with tumor progression and reduced survival time.

Here we report that  (LCA) derivatives are inhibitors of USP proteins, including USP2a. The most potent LCA derivative, LCA hydroxyamide (LCAHA), inhibits USP2a, leading to a significant Akt/GSK3β-independent destabilization of cyclin D1, but does not change the expression of p27. This leads to the defects in cell-cycle progression. As a result, LCAHA inhibits the growth of cyclin D1-expressing, but not cyclin D1-negative cells, independently of the p53 status. We show that LCA derivatives may be considered as future therapeutics for the treatment of cyclin D1-addicted p53-expressing and p53-defective cancer types.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Bile acids are a component of gastric refluxate and have previously been implicated in the development of fibrosis in other airway subsites. There is clear evidence that bile acids reflux into the upper airway. We therefore investigated the potential role of bile acids in the pathophysiology of laryngotracheal fibrosis and stenosis, specifically investigating the highly conserved process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Translational research study.Human primary tracheal epithelial cells (PTECs) were challenged with the four most common digestive bile acids (cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and ). EMT markers transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and procollagen proteins were measured in the supernatant at 48 hours via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was also used to measure E-cadherin and fibronectin expression.Significantly greater concentrations of TGF-β1 and MMP-9 were measured in the culture supernatants of cells treated with each bile  at 10 µmol/L.  and deoxycholic  induced significantly increased expression of procollagen protein. Upregulation of fibronectin and downregulation of E-cadherin were observed with all bile acids, except for deoxycholic .This is the first proof of principle demonstration that physiologically relevant bile  challenge induces EMT mechanisms in PTECs. This implies a potential role for bile acids in laryngotracheal scarring and airway remodeling of potential translational significance in laryngotracheal stenosis.NA.

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

We have determined effects of caffeine and its xanthine metabolites on pancreatic acinar IPR-mediated Ca signalling and experimental AP.Isolated pancreatic acinar cells were exposed to secretagogues, uncaged IP or toxins that induce AP and effects of xanthines, non-xanthine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP/cGMP) determined. The intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca]), mitochondrial depolarisation and necrosis were assessed by confocal microscopy. Effects of xanthines were evaluated in caerulein-induced AP (CER-AP), taurolithocholic  3-sulfate-induced AP (TLCS-AP) or palmitoleic  plus ethanol-induced AP (fatty  ethyl ester AP (FAEE-AP)). Serum xanthines were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Caffeine, dimethylxanthines and non-xanthine PDE inhibitors blocked IP-mediated Ca oscillations, while monomethylxanthines had little effect. Caffeine and dimethylxanthines inhibited uncaged IP-induced Ca rises, toxin-induced Ca release, mitochondrial depolarisation and necrotic cell death pathway activation; cAMP/cGMP did not inhibit toxin-induced Ca rises. Caffeine significantly ameliorated CER-AP with most effect at 25 mg/kg (seven injections hourly); paraxanthine or theophylline did not. Caffeine at 25 mg/kg significantly ameliorated TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP. Mean total serum levels of dimethylxanthines and trimethylxanthines peaked at >2 mM with 25 mg/kg caffeine but at <100 µM with 25 mg/kg paraxanthine or theophylline.Caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites reduced pathological IPR-mediated pancreatic acinar Ca signals but only caffeine ameliorated experimental AP.

However, these effects have not yet been examined in cholestatic liver dysfunction. Hence, this study aimed to explore the ability of vardenafil, a known phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, to repress  (LCA)-induced cholestatic liver injury and investigate the possible molecular .Male Swiss albino mice were treated with LCA (0.125 mg/g) twice daily for 7 days to induce cholestatic liver damage. Vardenafil was administered 3 days before and throughout the administration of LCA. Serum markers of hepatotoxicity and hepatic nitro-oxidative stress along with antioxidant parameters were measured, and the histopathology of liver tissues was assessed. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes was examined using PCR. The activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and the levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined. NLRP3 inflammasome and its components were studied by PCR and western blot.LCA induced marked cholestatic liver damage as demonstrated by increased serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, and bile acids. Examination of liver specimens confirmed the biochemical results. Nitro-oxidative stress parameters were significantly elevated along with reduced antioxidant capacity in hepatic tissue following LCA administration. LCA suppressed Nrf2 and its target genes and decreased the mRNA expression and binding capacity of Nrf2 as well as the mRNA expression of GCLm, GCLc, Nqo1, and HO-1. Additionally, LCA enhanced the activation of NF-κB, which was accompanied by elevations of inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, LCA induced the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. LCA increased the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β genes and proteins in hepatic tissue. The activities of IL-1β and caspase-1 were increased in the LCA group. Interestingly, vardenafil ameliorated LCA-induced hepatic injury and alleviated all biochemical, histopathological, and inflammatory parameters.These data elucidated the effects of Nrf2 inhibition and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LCA-induced liver injury. The hepatoprotective activity of vardenafil in LCA-induced cholestatic damage may result from the drug's ability to activate Nrf2 signaling and prevent the activation of NLRP3, which could suppress the inflammatory responses in hepatic tissue. Thus, vardenafil can be considered a novel anti-inflammatory remedy for cholestatic liver damage.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072966>Functional role of MicroRNA-19b in acinar cell necrosis in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNA-19b (miR-19b) in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and its functional role in acinar cell necrosis of SD rats were investigated. Twelve SD rats were divided into two groups randomly, including control group and ANP group. The rat ANP models were established by intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine (2400 mg/kg body weight), and equal volume of 0.9% NaCl was injected in the control group. MiRNA chip assay was performed to examine the expression of miRNAs in the pancreas in two different groups. Besides, to further explore the role of miR-19b in ANP in vitro, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate disodium salt (TLC-S) (200 μmol/L) was administrated to treat the rat pancreatic acinar cell line, AR42J, for establishing the ANP cells model. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was adopted to measure the miR-19b expression. Moreover, the mimic miRNA, miRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO) and control vector were used to transfect AR42J cells, the expression of miR-19b was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the necrotizing rate of AR42J cells was detected with AO/EB method. The expression of miR-19b was significantly higher in ANP group than in control group as displayed by the miRNA chip assay. Furthermore, after inducing necrosis of AR42J cells in vitro, the expression of miR-19b was significantly increased by 2.51±0.14 times in comparison with the control group. As revealed by qRT-PCR assay, the expression of miR-19b was 5.94±0.95 times higher in the mimic miRNA group than in the control vector group, companied with an obviously increased acinar cell necrotizing rate (50.3%±1.5% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Moreover, the expression of miR-19b in the miRNA AMO group was 0.38±0.15 times lower than in the control vector group, and the cell necrosis rate was much lower accordingly (23.1%±3.3% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference between the control vector cells and the cells without treatment (P>0.05). The expression of miR-19b was significantly induced in ANP. In addition, up-regulation of miR-19b could promote the necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells and miR-19b deficiency could decrease the rate of pancreatic acinar cell necrosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27464459>Combination of soya pulp and Bacillus coagulans lilac-01 improves intestinal bile   without impairing the effects of prebiotics in rats fed a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria are involved in bile  (BA) deconjugation and/or dehydroxylation and are responsible for the production of secondary BA. However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA  in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced obesity and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA  and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25950256>Living longer through mitochondrial housekeeping.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28116898>Engineering 7β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase for Enhanced Ursodeoxycholic  Production by Multiobjective Directed Evolution.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the main active ingredient of natural bear bile powder with multiple pharmacological functions. 7β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) is a key biocatalyst for the synthesis of UDCA.

The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced weight loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile  (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the  improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to  and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45 ± 12 years, mean BMI 45 ± 7 kg/m) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12 months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total  acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic  changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.Serum BA are associated with glucose  and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration.

Besides their well-known function as detergents in lipid digestion, bile acids are important signaling molecules mediating effects on the host's metabolism.Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are supplemented with 50 μmol L LCA either for 30 days or throughout their lifetime. LCA supplementation results in a significant induction of the mean (+12 days), median (+10 days), and maximum lifespan (+ 11 days) in comparison to untreated control flies. This lifespan extension is accompanied by an induction of spargel (srl), the fly homolog of mammalian PPAR-γ co-activator 1α (PGC1α). In wild-type flies, the administration of antibiotics abrogates both the LCA-mediated lifespan induction as well as the upregulation of srl.It is shown that the secondary bile  LCA significantly induces the mean, the median, and the maximum survival in D. melanogaster.

The investigation necessitated the development of novel synthetic routes for  (LCA) glucuronides (Gluc). Biochemical and cell-based assays were used to demonstrate that hydroxylated LCA analogs were not able to bind VDR. This excludes VDR from mediating their biological and pharmacological activities. Among the synthesized LCA conjugates a novel VDR agonist was identified. LCA Gluc II increased the expression of CYP24A1 in DU145 cancer cells especially in the presence of the endogenous VDR ligand 1,25(OH)2D3. Furthermore, the methyl ester of LCA was identified as novel VDR antagonist. For the first time, we showed that calcitroic , the assumed inactive final metabolite of vitamin D, was able to activate VDR-mediated transcription to a higher magnitude than bile  LCA. Due to a higher  stability in comparison to vitamin D, a very low toxicity, and high concentration in bile and intestine, calcitroic  is likely to be an important mediator of the protective vitamin D properties against colon cancer.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We therefore envisioned that a LCA-based peptide delivery system could extend the half-life of GLP-1 analogs by facilitating the noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin. On the basis of our previously identified Xenopus GLP-1 analogs (1-3), a series of LCA-modified Xenopus GLP-1 conjugates were designed (4a-4r), and the bioactivity studies of these conjugates were performed to identify compounds with balanced in vitro receptor activation potency and plasma stability. 4c, 4i, and 4r were selected, and their LCA side chains were optimized to further increase their stability, affording 5a-5c. Compound 5b showed a more increased albumin affinity and prolonged in vitro stability than that of 4i and liraglutide. In db/ db mice, 5b exhibited comparable hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide and semaglutide. Importantly, the enhanced albumin affinity of 5b resulted in a prolonged in vivo antidiabetic duration. Finally, chronic treatment investigations of 5b demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 5b on HbA1c, body weight, blood glucose, and pancreatic endocrine deficiencies on db/ db mice.

Metabolomic analysis and gene analysis were used to assess involvement of pregnane X receptor (PXR). Molecular docking, cell-based reporter gene analysis and knockout mice were used to demonstrate the critical role of the PXR pathway in the anti-cholestasis effects of SolB.SolB protected against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis. Furthermore, therapeutic treatment with SolB decreased mortality in cholestatic mice. Metabolomics and gene analysis showed that SolB accelerated  of bile acids, promoted bile  efflux into the intestine, and induced hepatic expression of the PXR-target genes Cyp3a11, Ugt1a1, and Oatp2, which are involved in bile  homeostasis. Mechanistic studies showed that SolB activated human PXR and up-regulated PXR target genes in human cell lines. Additionally, SolB did not protect Pxr-null mice from liver injury induced by intrahepatic cholestasis, thus providing genetic evidence that the effect of SolB was PXR-dependent.These findings provide direct evidence for the hepatoprotective effects of SolB against cholestasis by activating PXR.

Among the metabolites identified, six metabolites were discovered to have the strongest correlation with CHD after adjusting for multiple testing: palmitic  (β = 0.205; p < 0.0001), linoleic  (β = 0.133; p < 0.0001), 4-pyridoxic  (β = 0.142; p < 0.0001), phosphatidylglycerol (20:3/2:0) (β = 0.287; p < 0.0001), carnitine (14:1) (β = 0.332; p < 0.0001) and  (β = 0.224; p < 0.0001); of these, 4-pyridoxic ,  and phosphatidylglycerol (20:3/2:0) were, to the best of our knowledge, first reported in this study. A logistic regression model further quantified their positive independent correlations with CHD. In conclusion, this study surveyed a broad panel of nontargeted metabolites in Chinese CHD populations and identified novel metabolites that are potentially involved in CHD pathogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28005388>Metadynamics for Perspective Drug Design: Computationally Driven Synthesis of New Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors Targeting the EphA2 Receptor.</a></h2><p>Metadynamics (META-D) is emerging as a powerful method for the computation of the multidimensional free-energy surface (FES) describing the protein-ligand binding process. Herein, the FES of unbinding of the antagonist N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan (UniPR129) from its EphA2 receptor was reconstructed by META-D simulations. The characterization of the free-energy minima identified on this FES proposes a binding mode fully consistent with previously reported and new structure-activity relationship data. To validate this binding mode, new N-(3α-hydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-l-β-homotryptophan derivatives were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to displace ephrin-A1 from the EphA2 receptor. Among them, two antagonists, namely compounds 21 and 22, displayed high affinity versus the EphA2 receptor and resulted endowed with better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than the parent compound. These findings highlight the importance of free-energy calculations in drug design, confirming that META-D simulations can be used to successfully design novel bioactive compounds.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30089729>Divergent effects of resistance and endurance exercise on plasma bile acids, FGF19, and FGF21 in humans.</a></h2><p>Exercise has profound pleiotropic health benefits, yet the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Endocrine FGF21, bile acids (BAs), and BA-induced FGF19 have emerged as  signaling molecules. Here, we investigated if dissimilar modes of exercise, resistance exercise (RE) and endurance exercise (EE), regulate plasma BAs, FGF19, and FGF21 in humans.Ten healthy, moderately trained males were enrolled in a randomized crossover study of 1 hour of bicycling at 70% of VO2peak (EE) and 1 hour of high-volume RE. Hormones and metabolites were measured in venous blood and sampled before and after exercise and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes after exercise.We observed exercise mode-specific changes in plasma concentrations of FGF19 and FGF21. Whereas FGF19 decreased following RE (P < 0.001), FGF21 increased in response to EE (P < 0.001). Total plasma BAs decreased exclusively following RE (P < 0.05), but the composition of BAs changed in response to both types of exercise. Notably, circulating levels of the potent TGR5 receptor agonist, , increased with both types of exercise (P < 0.001).This study reveals divergent effects of EE and RE on circulating concentrations of the BA species, FGF19, and FGF21.

In this study, low molecular weight linear polyethyleneimine (2.5 kDa) was modified by conjugation to a lipid, , and complexed with a natural polysaccharide, dermatan sulfate (DS), to mask extra cationic charges of the modified polymer. In vitro examination revealed that these modifications improved complex stability with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and transfection efficiency. This novel ternary polyplex (pDNA/3E/DS) was used to investigate if tumor-targeted radiotherapy led to enhanced accumulation and retention of gene therapy vectors in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Imaging of biodistribution revealed that tumor irradiation led to increased accumulation and retention as well as decreased off-target tissue buildup of pDNA in not only pDNA/3E/DS, but also in associated PEI-based polyplexes and commercial DNA delivery vehicles. The DS-containing complexes developed in this study displayed the greatest increase in tumor-specific pDNA delivery.

T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) luciferase assay was employed to examine the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Downregulation of muscarinic 3 receptor (M3R) was achieved through transfection of corresponding siRNA.We found DCA/LCA to induce CSCs in normal human colonic epithelial cells, as evidenced by the increased proportion of CSCs, elevated levels of several CSC markers, as well as a number of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers together with increased colonosphere formation, drug exclusion, ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression, and induction of M3R, p-EGFR, matrix metallopeptidases, and c-Myc. Inhibition of M3R signaling greatly suppressed DCA/LCA induction of the CSC marker ALDHA1 and also c-Myc mRNA expression as well as transcriptional activation of TCF/LEF.Our results suggest that bile acids, specifically DCA and LCA, induce cancer stemness in colonic epithelial cells by modulating M3R and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and thus could be considered promoters of colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29664215>Plasma bile  changes in type 2 diabetes correlated with insulin secretion in two-step hyperglycemic clamp.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) conduct crucial signals in human metabolism. Correlations between changes in plasma BA concentrations, insulin secretion defects, and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in humans have not been sufficiently investigated. This study explored the trajectories of changes in human plasma BA concentrations and their association with insulin secretion dynamics during a two-step hyperglycemic clamp.Eleven healthy subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 33 drug-naïve T2DM subjects were enrolled in the study. The two-step hyperglycemic clamp consisted of a classic clamp as Step 1 with fasting, followed by a Step 2 clamp after ingestion of a carbohydrate meal, illustrating basal and incretin-amplified insulin responses to glucose. Plasma BA were assayed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Nine T2DM subjects were followed-up, and the two-step clamp was repeated after 3 months sulfonylurea treatment.Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) was lower and  (LCA) and taurocholic  (TCA) were higher in T2DM compared with NGT subjects. The dynamics of plasma UDCA concentrations and the UDCA/LCA ratio was positively correlated with insulin secretion in T2DM subjects and were corrected after treatment. Moreover, fasting ratios of UDCA/LCA and unconjugated/conjugated BAs were correlated with the first phase of insulin secretion in T2DM subjects.The abnormal BA composition in T2DM subjects and its correlation with insulin secretion during the clamp suggest an interaction between BA signals and insulin secretion capacity, and the potential to use fasting plasma BA composition indices to predict and evaluate the progression and prognosis of T2DM.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28538412>Biomarkers of unstable angina pectoris and yangxin decoction intervention: An exploratory metabonomics study of blood plasma.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to explore the related  biomarkers and to observe the effects of Yangxin Decoction (YXD) on plasma  of patients with unstable angina (UA).In total, 10 patients with UA (intervention group) and 10 healthy participants (control group) were recruited for this study from January 2009 to December 2010.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of  (LCA) on the lipogenesis of breast cancer cells. The putative cytotoxic effects of LCA on these cells were also examined.The effects of LCA on breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were studied using MTT viability assays, Annexin-FITC and Akt phosphorylation assays to evaluate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, qRT-PCR and Western blotting assays to assess the expression of the bile  receptor TGR5 and the estrogen receptor ERα, and genes and proteins involved in apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2, p53) and lipogenesis (SREBP-1c, FASN, ACACA).

Also, an increase in pro-apoptotic p53 protein expression and a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression were observed after LCA treatment of MCF-7 cells. In addition, we found that LCA reduced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also noted that LCA reduced the expression of SREBP-1c, FASN and ACACA in both breast cancer-derived cell lines and that cells treated with LCA contained low numbers of lipid droplets compared to untreated control cells.

The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of yangonin, a product isolated from an edible botanical Kava against  (LCA)-induced cholestasis, and further to elucidate the involvement of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the anticholestatic effect using in vivo and in vitro experiments. The cholestatic liver injury model was established by intraperitoneal injections of LCA in C57BL/6 mice. Serum biomarkers and H&E staining were used to identify the amelioration of cholestasis after yangonin treatment. Mice hepatocytes culture, gene silencing experiment, real-time PCR and Western blot assay were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying yangonin hepatoprotection. The results indicated that yangonin promoted bile  efflux and reduced hepatic uptake via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep, Mrp2 expression and an inhibition in Ntcp, all of which are responsible for bile  transport. Furthermore, yangonin reduced bile  synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile   through an induction in gene expression of Sult2a1, which are involved in bile  synthesis and . In addition, yangonin suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β. In vitro evidences showed that the changes in transporters and enzymes induced by yangonin were abrogated when FXR was silenced. In conclusions, yangonin produces protective effect against LCA-induced hepatotoxity and cholestasis due to FXR-mediated regulation. Yangonin may be an effective approach for the prevention against cholestatic liver diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to show that LCA alters the age-related dynamics of changes in levels of many mitochondrial proteins, as well as numerous proteins in cellular locations outside of mitochondria. These proteins belong to 2 regulons, each modulated by a different mitochondrial dysfunction; we call them a partial mitochondrial dysfunction regulon and an oxidative stress regulon. We found that proteins constituting these regulons (1) can be divided into several "clusters", each of which denotes a distinct type of partial mitochondrial dysfunction that elicits a different signaling pathway mediated by a discrete set of transcription factors; (2) exhibit 3 different patterns of the age-related dynamics of changes in their cellular levels; and (3) are encoded by genes whose expression is regulated by the transcription factors Rtg1p/Rtg2p/Rtg3p, Sfp1p, Aft1p, Yap1p, Msn2p/Msn4p, Skn7p and Hog1p, each of which is essential for longevity extension by LCA. Our findings suggest that LCA-driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and functionality, thereby enabling mitochondria to operate as signaling organelles that orchestrate an establishment of an anti-aging transcriptional program for many longevity-defining nuclear genes.

Dogs were initially adapted to the same commercial dry food. Thereafter, incremental substitution of the dry food by boiled minced beef over 3 weeks resulted in a diet in which 75% of each dog's total  requirement was provided as minced beef during week 5.

Previously we revealed that oleanolic  (OA) protected against  (LCA)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in mice. Cholestasis caused by LCA is characterized by segmental bile duct obstruction, whether OA possesses the beneficial effect on completed obstructive cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that BDL-induced mice liver pathological change, and increase in serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP were all significantly reduced by OA (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Meanwhile, OA also lowered total bilirubin and total bile acids levels in serum, as well as total bile acids level in liver, in contrast, urinary total bile acids output was remarkably up-regulated by OA. Gene expression analysis showed that OA caused significant increased mRNA expression of MRP3 and MRP4 located at hepatic basolateral membrane, and restoration of MRP2 and BSEP located at hepatic cannalicular membrane. Furthermore, significant NRF2 protein accumulation in nucleus was also observed in OA treated mice. In mice primary cultured hepatocytes, the effects of OA on MRP2, MRP3 and MRP4 expression were directly proved to be mediated via NRF2 activation, and BSEP downregulation induced by OA was in part due to FXR antagonism. Luciferase assay performed in Hep G2 cells also illustrated that OA was a partial FXR antagonist.

Genetic and biochemical studies performed with one of these bacteria (P. putida DOC21) allowed the identification of the genes and enzymes belonging to the 9,10-seco pathway, the route involved in the aerobic assimilation of steroids. In this manuscript, we describe the most relevant methods required for (1) isolation and characterization of these species; (2) determining the chromosomal location, nucleotide sequence, and functional analysis of the catabolic genes (or gene clusters) encoding the enzymes from this pathway; and (3) the tools employed to establish the role of some of the proteins that participate in this route.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31102695>Vitamin E analogues differentially inhibit human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)-mediated oxidative metabolism of : Impact of δ-tocotrienol on  cytotoxicity.</a></h2><p> is a cytotoxic bile  oxidized at the C-3 position by human cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) to form 3-ketocholanoic , but it is not known whether this metabolite is cytotoxic. Tocotrienols, in their various isomeric forms, are vitamin E analogues. In the present study, the hypothesis to be tested is that tocotrienols inhibit CYP3A-catalyzed  3-oxidation, thereby influencing  cytotoxicity. Our enzyme catalysis experiments indicated that human recombinant CYP3A5 in addition to CYP3A4, liver microsomes, and intestinal microsomes catalyzed  3-oxidation to form 3-ketocholanoic . Liver microsomes with the CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3 genotypes were associated with decreased  3-oxidation. α-Tocotrienol, γ-tocotrienol, δ-tocotrienol, and a tocotrienol-rich vitamin E mixture, but not α-tocopherol (a vitamin E analogue), differentially inhibited  3-oxidation catalyzed by liver and intestinal microsomes and recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Compared to  3-oxidation, CYP3A-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation was inhibited to a lesser extent by α-tocotrienol, γ-tocotrienol, δ-tocotrienol, and a tocotrienol-rich vitamin E mixture. δ-Tocotrienol inhibited  3-oxidation by a mixed mode. Like , 3-ketocholanoic  was also cytotoxic in human intestinal and liver cell models. δ-Tocotrienol decreased the extent of  3-oxidation and this inhibition was associated with enhanced cytotoxicity in LS180 cells treated with δ-tocotrienol and . Overall, vitamin E analogues inhibited in vitro  3-oxidation in an isomer-dependent manner, with inhibition occurring with tocotrienols, but not α-tocopherol. The enhanced  toxicity by δ-tocotrienol in a human intestinal cell model warrants future investigations in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The secosteroid stimulates intestinal Ca absorption. Whether LCA alters this process remains unknown. The aim of our work was to determine the effect of LCA on intestinal Ca absorption in the absence or presence of NaDOC, bile  that inhibits the cation transport. The data show that LCA by itself did not alter intestinal Ca absorption, but prevented the inhibitory effect of NaDOC. The concomitant administration of LCA avoided the reduction of intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity caused by NaDOC. In addition, LCA blocked a decrease caused by NaDOC on gene and protein expression of molecules involved in the transcellular pathway of intestinal Ca absorption. The oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC were abrogated by LCA co-treatment. In conclusion, LCA placed in the intestinal lumen protects intestinal Ca absorption against the inhibitory effects caused by NaDOC. LCA avoids the reduction of the transcellular Ca movement, apparently by blocking the oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC, normalizing the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in Ca movement. Therefore, LCA might become a possible treatment to improve intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849189>Screening and validation of differentially expressed extracellular miRNAs in acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to screen for differentially expressed extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) during the development of acute pancreatitis (AP) and validate the miRNA expression in the plasma of patients with AP. The culture medium of taurolithocholic ‑3 sulfate‑treated rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells was collected to extract total RNA for miRNA microarray analysis. Compared with the miRNA test results of the AP rats in the GEO databases, the differentially expressed extracellular miRNAs were screened. The TargetScan, miRanda, and PicTar programs were used for target gene prediction of the identified miRNAs, and gene ontology‑biological processes (GO‑BP) functional annotation was performed. Finally, the results from the combined microarray analyses (in vitro cell line and in vivo rat samples) were validated using plasma samples from patients with mild and moderately severe AP by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that extracellular miR‑24 was differentially expressed by microarray and bioinformatics analysis in both the cell line and the animal model of AP. Bioinformatics prediction analysis revealed that downstream target genes of miR‑24 included Vav2, Syk, Lhcgr, Slc9a3r1, Cacnb1, Cacna1b, Bcl10, and Fgd3. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the main GO‑BP predicted functional presentations were positive regulation of calcium‑mediated signaling, activation of c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase activity, calcium ion transport, regulation of Rho protein signal transduction, negative regulation of the protein kinase B signaling cascade, and the T cell receptor signaling pathway. Validation analysis for the plasma miR‑24 expression in humans revealed a significant upregulation of miR‑24 in the plasma samples of AP patients compared with the healthy controls, while no significant difference was observed in the miR‑24 expression between the mild and the moderately severe AP groups. The present study confirmed the high expression of miR‑24 in peripheral blood during AP, suggesting that miR‑24 might have an intercellular communication role contributing to the AP‑associated distant organ injury.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734123>Enhanced activity and substrate tolerance of 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase by directed evolution for 7-ketolithocholic  production.</a></h2><p>7-Ketolithocholic  (7-KLCA) is an important intermediate for the synthesis of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). UDCA is the main effective component of bear bile powder that is used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of human cholesterol gallstones. 7α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7α-HSDH) is the key enzyme used in the industrial production of 7-KLCA. Unfortunately, the natural 7α-HSDHs reported have difficulty meeting the requirements of industrial application, due to their poor activities and strong substrate inhibition. In this study, a directed evolution strategy combined with high-throughput screening was applied to improve the catalytic efficiency and tolerance of high substrate concentrations of NADP+-dependent 7α-HSDH from Clostridium absonum. Compared with the wild type, the best mutant (7α-3) showed 5.5-fold higher specific activity and exhibited 10-fold higher and 14-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and NADP+, respectively. Moreover, 7α-3 also displayed significantly enhanced tolerance in the presence of high concentrations of substrate compared to the wild type. Owing to its improved catalytic efficiency and enhanced substrate tolerance, 7α-3 could efficiently biosynthesize 7-KLCA with a substrate loading of 100 mM, resulting in 99% yield of 7-KLCA at 2 h, in contrast to only 85% yield of 7-KLCA achieved for the wild type at 16 h.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435224>Investigation of triamterene as an inhibitor of the TGR5 receptor: identification in cells and animals.</a></h2><p>G-protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (GPBAR1, also known as TGR5) has been shown to participate in glucose homeostasis. In animal models, a TGR5 agonist increases incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Many agonists have been developed for clinical use. However, the effects of TGR5 blockade have not been studied extensively, with the exception of studies using TGR5 knockout mice. Therefore, we investigated the potential effect of triamterene on TGR5.We transfected the TGR5 gene into cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1 cells) to express TGR5. Then, we applied a fluorescent indicator to examine the glucose uptake of these transfected cells. In addition, NCI-H716 cells that secrete incretin were also evaluated. Fura-2, a fluorescence indicator, was applied to determine the changes in calcium concentrations. The levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Moreover, rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1-like diabetes were used to investigate the effects in vivo.Triamterene dose dependently inhibits the increase in glucose uptake induced by TGR5 agonists in CHO-K1 cells expressing the TGR5 gene. In cultured NCI-H716 cells, TGR5 activation also increases GLP-1 secretion by increasing calcium levels. Triamterene inhibits the increased calcium levels by TGR5 activation through competitive antagonism. Moreover, the GLP-1 secretion and increased cAMP levels induced by TGR5 activation are both dose dependently reduced by triamterene. However, treatment with KB-R7943 at a dose sufficient to block the Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) failed to modify the responses to TGR5 activation in NCI-H716 cells or CHO-K1 cells expressing TGR5. Therefore, the inhibitory effects of triamterene on TGR5 activation do not appear to be related to NCX inhibition. Blockade of TGR5 activation by triamterene was further characterized in vivo using the STZ-induced diabetic rats.Based on the obtained data, we identified triamterene as a reliable inhibitor of TGR5. Therefore, triamterene can be developed as a clinical inhibitor of TGR5 activation in future studies.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872803>Barley β-glucan increases fecal bile  excretion and short chain fatty  levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals.</a></h2><p>The cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan has been proposed to be the result of a pleiotropic effect, which involves several biological mechanisms such as gut fermentation, inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased bile  excretion and its synthesis. However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular weights (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular weight promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28291252>Influence of ad Libitum Feeding of Piglets With Bacillus Subtilis Fermented Liquid Feed on Gut Flora, Luminal Contents and Health.</a></h2><p>Some scholars caution that long-term ad libitum feeding with probiotic fermented food poses potential health risks to baby animals. We conducted a feeding experiment to investigate the influence of ad libitum feeding of pre-and post-weaned piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented diet on the gut microbiome, gut metabolomic profiles, bile  , proinflammatory cytokines and faecal consistency. Compared with piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pellet diet, piglets fed the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet had lower intestinal bacterial diversity (P > 0.05), higher intestinal fungal diversity (P > 0.05), more Firmicutes (P > 0.05), fewer Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (P > 0.05), higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropionic  (P < 0.05), orotic  (P < 0.05), interleukin-6 (P < 0.01), lactic  (P < 0.01), deoxycholic  (P > 0.05) and  (P < 0.01) and a higher incidence of diarrhoea (P > 0.05). The data show that ad libitum feeding of piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet during the suckling and early post-weaning periods promotes the growth of lactic  bacteria, bile salt hydrolase-active bacteria and 7a-dehydroxylase-active bacteria in the intestinal lumen; disturbs the normal production of lactic , orotic  and unconjugated bile acids; and increases circulating interleukin-6 levels and diarrhoea incidence.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709472>Activation of TGR5 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis has been associated with vascular pathophysiology. The G-protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) is an important mediator of bile  signaling and glucose metabolism. However, the effects of TGR5 on mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells remain elusive. In this study, we found that activation of TGR5 using its specific agonist taurolithocholic  (TLCA) promoted the expression of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Additionally, activation of TGR5 increased the expression of PGC-1α target genes, such as NRF1 and TFAM. Indeed, we found that TLCA treatment promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA (mtDNA/nDNA), COX-Ⅰ expression, and cytochrome c oxidase activity in HAECs. Notably, our results displayed that activation of TGR5 resulted in a functional gain in mitochondria by increasing the rate of respiration and ATP production. Mechanistically, we found that TLCA treatment activated the transcriptional factor CREB by inducing the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133. Using the PKA/CREB inhibitor H89 abolished the effects of TLCA on PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM expression as well as the increase in mtDNA/nDNA and ATP production. These findings suggest that activation of TGR5 promoted mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells, which is mediated by the CREB/PGC-1α signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Inspired by our recent development of N-(11)C-methyl-glycocholic -that is, (11)C-cholylsarcosine-a tracer for PET of the endogenous glycine conjugate of cholic , we report here a radiosynthesis of N-(11)C-methyl-taurine-conjugated bile acids and biodistribution studies in pigs by PET/CT.A radiosynthesis of N-(11)C-methyl-taurine-conjugated bile acids was developed and used to prepare N-(11)C-methyl-taurine conjugates derived from cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, ursodeoxycholic, and . The lipophilicity of these new tracers was determined by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography. The effect of lipophilicity and structure on the biodistribution was investigated in pigs by PET/CT using the tracers derived from cholic  (3α-OH, 7α-OH, 12α-OH), ursodeoxycholic  (3α-OH, 7β-OH), and  (3α-OH).The radiosyntheses of the N-(11)C-methyl-taurine-conjugated bile acids proceeded with radiochemical yields of 61% (decay-corrected) or greater and radiochemical purities greater than 99%. PET/CT in pigs revealed that the tracers were rapidly taken up by the liver and secreted into bile. There was no detectable radioactivity in urine. Significant reflux of N-(11)C-methyl-taurolithocholic  into the stomach was observed.We have successfully developed a radiosynthesis of N-(11)C-methyl-taurine-conjugated bile acids. These tracers behave in a manner similar to endogenous taurine-conjugated bile acids in vivo and are thus promising for functional PET of patients with cholestatic diseases.© 2016 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172112>Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary pomegranate extract and inulin in mice fed an obesogenic diet.</a></h2><p>It has been demonstrated in animal studies that both polyphenol-rich pomegranate extract (PomX) and the polysaccharide inulin, ameliorate  changes induced by a high-fat diet, but little is known about the specific mechanisms.This study evaluated the effect of PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination on cholesterol and lipid  in mice.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat/high-sucrose [HF/HS (32% energy from fat, 25% energy from sucrose)] diets supplemented with PomX (0.25%) and inulin (9%) alone or in combination for 4 weeks. At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and lipid  as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis . Inulin decreased gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol de novo synthesis Srebf2 and Hmgcr and significantly increased fecal elimination of total bile acids and neutral sterols. Only PomX in combination with inulin reduced liver and lipid weight significantly compared to the HF/HS control group. PomX showed a trend to decrease liver triglyceride (TG) levels, while inulin or PomX-inulin combination had no effect on either serum or liver TG levels.Dietary PomX and inulin supplementation decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol by different mechanisms and the combination leading to a significant enhancement of the cholesterol-lowering effect.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of hydrophobic BAs on the detrusor contractility of rat bladder and to explore the possible mechanism.  (LCA) treatment increased the micturition interval and induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of bladder detrusor strips. In addition, LCA reduced the concentration of intracellular free Ca(2+)([Ca(2+)]i) and inhibited both the outward and inward Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) current (INCX) in primary isolated smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To further investigate the mechanism of action of LCA, several pharmacologic agents were used. We found that the NCX inhibitor 3',4'-Dichlorobenzamil (DCB) can significantly inhibit the relaxation of detrusor strips and a reduction of the [Ca(2+)]i induced by LCA, while the antagonist of muscarinic receptor and the agonist of the G protein-coupled bile  receptor (TGR5) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) had no effect.

In the present study, the objectives were to develop and validate an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) method to quantify 3-KCA and apply it to the human liver microsomal CYP3A-dependent LCA 3-oxidation assay. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Waters ACQUITY™ UPLC C18 column (50×2.1mm, 1.7μm) with a gradient system consisting of 0.1% v/v formic  in water (solvent A) and 0.1% v/v formic  in acetonitrile (solvent B). The retention time was 3.73min for 3-KCA and 2.73min for cortisol (internal standard). Positive electrospray ionization with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to quantify 3-KCA (m/z 375.4→135.2) and cortisol (m/z 363.5→121.0). The limit of detection of 3-KCA was 10μM, the lower limit of quantification was 33.3μM, and the calibration curve was linear from 0.05-10μM with r(2)>0.99. Intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision were <13.7%. The quality control samples were stable when assessed after 4h at room temperature, 24h at 4°C, 14days at -20°C, and three freeze-thaw cycles. The liver microsomal matrix did not affect 3-KCA quantification. The amount of KCA formed in the human liver microsomal LCA 3-oxidation assay was linear with respect to the amount of microsomal protein (up to 40μg) and incubation time (5-30min). Enzyme kinetics experiment indicated that LCA 3-oxidation followed the Michaelis-Menten model with an apparent Km of 26±7μM and Vmax of 303±50pmol/min/mg protein.

Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative,  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

Recent evidence suggests that bile  microaspiration may contribute to the development of lung fibrosis. However, the molecular evidence is scarce and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. We have recently demonstrated that bile acids induce activation of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung fibroblasts  In the present study, a rat model of bile  microaspiration was established by weekly intratracheal instillation of three major bile acids including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and  (LCA). Repeated microaspiration of CDCA, DCA, and LCA caused fibrotic changes, including alveolar wall thickening and extensive collagen deposition, in rat lungs. Bile  microaspiration also induced alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as indicated by up-regulation of mesenchymal markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and vimentin, as well as down-regulaton of epithelial markers E-cadherin and cytokeratin in alveolar epithelium of rat lungs. The expression of fibrogenic mediators, including transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and periostin, was significantly elevated in rat lungs exposed to microaspiration of bile acids. Furthermore, microaspiration of bile acids also induced p-Smad3 and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression in rat lungs. Our findings suggest that microaspiration of bile acids could promote the development of pulmonary fibrosis , possibly via stimulating fibrogenic mediator expression and activating TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling and FXR.© 2017 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the Biochemical Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26347551>Mixed input to olfactory glomeruli from two subsets of ciliated sensory neurons does not impede relay neuron specificity in the crucian carp.</a></h2><p>The consensus view of olfactory processing is that the axons of receptor-specific primary olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) converge to a small subset of glomeruli, thus preserving the odour identity before the olfactory information is processed in higher brain centres. In the present study, we show that two different subsets of ciliated OSNs with different odorant specificities converge to the same glomeruli. In order to stain different ciliated OSNs in the crucian carp Carassius carassius we used two different chemical odorants, a bile salt and a purported alarm substance, together with fluorescent dextrans. The dye is transported within the axons and stains glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Interestingly, the axons from the ciliated OSNs co-converge to the same glomeruli. Despite intermingled innervation of glomeruli, axons and terminal fields from the two different subsets of ciliated OSNs remained mono-coloured. By 4-6 days after staining, the dye was transported trans-synaptically to separately stained axons of relay neurons. These findings demonstrate that specificity of the primary neurons is retained in the olfactory  despite mixed innervation of the olfactory glomeruli.

However, the crosstalk among nutrition, microbiota, and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased colonic production, and systemic accumulation of  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200128>TRO40303 Ameliorates Alcohol-Induced Pancreatitis Through Reduction of Fatty  Ethyl Ester-Induced Mitochondrial Injury and Necrotic Cell Death.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibition is a promising approach to treat acute pancreatitis (AP).

In this method, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was initially adsorbed on the fluid interface and induced LCs to adopt the homeotropic ordering. Inclusion complexation of SDS and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) disturbed interaction between LCs and SDS and evoked LCs to keep a tilted alignment. When injecting LCA into the mixed solution of SDS and β-CD, SDS excluded from the cavity of β-CD by competitive host-guest inclusion and could be re-adsorbed at the LCs/aqueous interface, resulting in the orientational transition of LCs from tilted to homeotropic state. Correspondingly, a bright-to-dark optical response was observed under polarized optical microscope (POM). The as-prepared LCs-based sensor could detect LCA as low as about 2 μM in aqueous solution. Moreover, the practicability of the approach was validated by monitoring the known amount of LCA in human urine.

The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, -, deoxycholic- and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile acids can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids.

Herein, we used a novel computational strategy with two-dimensional virtual screening for FXR agonists. For the first time, we found that auraptene (AUR), a natural product, can activate FXR to exert hepatoprotective effect against cholestatic liver injury in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, AUR was found to significantly decrease the mortality of cholestatic mice. Dynamic change analysis of bile acids and gene analysis revealed that AUR promoted bile  efflux from liver into intestine via an induction in FXR-target genes Bsep and Mrp2 expression, and reduced hepatic uptake through an inhibition in Ntcp. Furthermore, AUR reduced bile  synthesis through repressing FXR-target genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, and increased bile  metabolism through an induction in Sult2a1. In addition, AUR promoted liver repair through an induction in liver regeneration-related gene, and suppressed liver inflammation through repressing inflammation-related gene NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. However, the changes in these genes and protein, as well as ameliorative liver histology induced by AUR were abrogated by FXR antagonist guggulsterone in vivo and FXR siRNA in vitro.

One protein that protects against acute injury, including ischemic injury to both the kidney and heart, is renalase, which is secreted into the blood by the kidney and other tissues. However, whether renalase reduces acute injury associated with pancreatitis is unknown. Here, we used both  and  murine models of acute pancreatitis to study renalase's effects on this condition. In isolated pancreatic lobules, pretreatment with recombinant human renalase (rRNLS) blocked zymogen activation caused by cerulein, carbachol, and a bile . Renalase also blocked cerulein-induced cell injury and histological changes. In the  cerulein model of pancreatitis, genetic deletion of renalase resulted in more severe disease, and administering rRNLS to cerulein-exposed WT mice after pancreatitis onset was protective. Because pathological increases in acinar cell cytosolic calcium levels are central to the initiation of acute pancreatitis, we also investigated whether rRNLS could function through its binding protein, plasma membrane calcium ATPase 4b (PMCA4b), which excretes calcium from cells. We found that PMCA4b is expressed in both murine and human acinar cells and that a PMCA4b-selective inhibitor worsens pancreatitis-induced injury and blocks the protective effects of rRNLS. These findings suggest that renalase is a protective plasma protein that reduces acinar cell injury through a plasma membrane calcium ATPase. Because exogenous rRNLS reduces the severity of acute pancreatitis, it has potential as a therapeutic agent.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28011201>Design, synthesis, in vitro characterization and preliminary imaging studies on fluorinated bile  derivatives as PET tracers to study hepatic transporters.</a></h2><p>With the aim of identifying a fluorinated bile  derivative that could be used as [F]-labeled Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer for imaging the in vivo functioning of liver transporter proteins, and particularly of OATP1B1, three fluorinated bile  triazole derivatives of cholic, deoxycholic and  (CATD, DCATD and LCATD 4a-c, respectively) were synthesized and labeled with tritium. In vitro transport properties were studied with cell-based assays to identify the best substrate for OATP1B1. In addition, the lead compound, LCATD (4c), was tested as a substrate of other liver uptake transporters OATP1B3, NTCP and efflux transporter BSEP to evaluate its specificity of liver transport. The results suggest that 4c is a good substrate of OATP1B1 and NTCP, whereas it is a poor substrate of OATP1B3. The efflux transporter BSEP also appears to be involved in the excretion of 4c from hepatocytes. The automated radiosynthesis of [F]-4c was accomplished in a multi-GBq scale and a pilot imaging experiment in a wild type rat was performed after i.v. administration to assess the biodistribution and clearance of the tracer. PET imaging revealed that radioactivity was primarily located in the liver (t=75s) and cleared exclusively through the bile, thus allowing to image the hepatobiliary excretion of bile acids in the animal model. These findings suggest that [F]-LCATD 4c is a promising PET probe for the evaluation of hepatic transporters OATP1B1, NTCP and BSEP activity with potential for studying drug-drug interactions and drug-induced toxicity involving these transporters.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal barrier function. In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal barrier function through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

Bile acids are known to induce Ca signals and necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells but the effects of bile acids on stellate cells are unexplored. Here we show that cholate and taurocholate elicit more dramatic Ca signals and necrosis in stellate cells compared to the adjacent acinar cells in pancreatic lobules; whereas taurolithocholic  3-sulfate primarily affects acinar cells. Ca signals and necrosis are strongly dependent on extracellular Ca as well as Na ; and Na -dependent transport plays an important role in the overall bile  uptake in pancreatic stellate cells. Bile -mediated pancreatic damage can be further escalated by bradykinin-induced signals in stellate cells and thus killing of stellate cells by bile acids might have important implications in acute biliary pancreatitis.Acute biliary pancreatitis, caused by bile reflux into the pancreas, is a serious condition characterised by premature activation of digestive enzymes within acinar cells, followed by necrosis and inflammation. Bile acids are known to induce pathological Ca signals and necrosis in acinar cells. However, bile -elicited signalling events in stellate cells remain unexplored. This is the first study to demonstrate the pathophysiological effects of bile acids on stellate cells in two experimental models: ex vivo (mouse pancreatic lobules) and in vitro (human cells). Sodium cholate and taurocholate induced cytosolic Ca elevations in stellate cells, larger than those elicited simultaneously in the neighbouring acinar cells. In contrast, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate (TLC-S), known to induce Ca oscillations in acinar cells, had only minor effects on stellate cells in lobules. The dependence of the Ca signals on extracellular Na and the presence of sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) indicate a Na -dependent bile  uptake mechanism in stellate cells. Bile  treatment caused necrosis predominantly in stellate cells, which was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca and significantly reduced in the absence of Na , showing that bile-dependent cell death was a downstream event of Ca signals. Finally, combined application of TLC-S and the inflammatory mediator bradykinin caused more extensive necrosis in both stellate and acinar cells than TLC-S alone. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism by which bile acids promote pancreatic pathology. This involves not only signalling in acinar cells but also in stellate cells.© 2016 The Authors The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661219>Feeding of the water extract from Ganoderma lingzhi to rats modulates secondary bile acids, intestinal microflora, mucins, and propionate important to colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Consumption of reishi mushroom has been reported to prevent colon carcinogenesis in rodents, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

Studies in the yeast  have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids is one of the key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast chronological aging. We demonstrated that exogenously added  bile  can delay chronological aging in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast chronological aging by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern. In this review, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the essential role of mitochondrial membrane lipids in yeast chronological aging.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27932556>Orally Administered Berberine Modulates Hepatic Lipid  by Altering Microbial Bile   and the Intestinal FXR Signaling Pathway.</a></h2><p>Previous studies suggest that the lipid-lowering effect of berberine (BBR) involves actions on the low-density lipoprotein receptor and the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling . However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of lipid , we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high-fat-diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its lipid-lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28863822>Regulation of Ca-Sensitive K Channels by Cholesterol and Bile Acids via Distinct Channel Subunits and Sites.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol (CLR) conversion into bile acids (BAs) in the liver constitutes the major pathway for CLR elimination from the body. Moreover, these steroids regulate each other's . While the roles of CLR and BAs in regulating  and tissue function are well known, research of the last two decades revealed the existence of specific protein receptors for CLR or BAs in tissues with minor contribution to lipid , raising the possibility that these lipids serve as signaling molecules throughout the body. Among other lipids, CLR and BAs regulate ionic current mediated by the activity of voltage- and Ca-gated, K channels of large conductance (BK channels) and, thus, modulate cell physiology and participate in tissue pathophysiology. Initial work attributed modification of BK channel function by CLR or BAs to the capability of these steroids to directly interact with bilayer lipids and thus alter the physicochemical properties of the bilayer with eventual modification of BK channel function. Based on our own work and that of others, we now review evidence that supports direct interactions between CLR or BA and specific BK protein subunits, and the consequence of such interactions on channel activity and organ function, with a particular emphasis on arterial smooth muscle. For each steroid type, we will also briefly discuss several mechanisms that may underlie modification of channel steady-state activity. Finally, we will present novel computational data that provide a chemical basis for differential recognition of CLR vs  by distinct BK channel subunits and recognition sites.© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the pathophysiology is not fully understood. Here, we explored the roles of mTOR signaling and ER stress in placenta during ICP.Placental tissues were collected from normal and ICP pregnancies. mTOR signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress were detected by immunohistochemistry in the placenta. The human placenta trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo was used in vitro experiment.ICP placenta displayed histological abnormalities with fewer trophoblasts. Moreover, the expression of Bip and the phosphorylation of pS6(S235/236) or pAkt(S473) were higher comparing with normal placenta. In in vitro studies, the bile acids specifically to  rather than taurocholic  or ursodeoxycholic , drastically increased the phosphorylation of pS6K1(T389), pS6(S235/236), or pAkt(S473), whereas the mTOR inhibitor can prohibit the upregulation. Similarly, the expressions of IRE1α and BiP increased sharply under  (20 μM) administration, while the same inhibitor can also decrease the expression. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy showed enlarged endoplasmic reticulum lumen under the  treatment. Furthermore, the cell viability reduced sharply under treatment with different dose of . The mTOR inhibitor can reverse the decrease of cell viability to some extent.Bile  can activate mTOR signaling which resulted in endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to trophocyte viability decrease. mTOR pathway activation may be associated with the pathophysiology of ICP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the connections between LCA function performance and change of UGT2B7 enzymatic activity in mice livers, two morphine metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) were quantified by solid phase extraction (SPE)-HPLC-MS/MS. The result indicated no matter in acute or chronic morphine tolerance, the concentrations of M3G and M6G were all decreased, the later one fell even more. Besides that, 50 mg/kg of LCA administration can prevent auto-phosphorylation of CaMKIIα at Thr286 in acute or chronic morphine tolerance mice prefrontal cortexes (mPFCs) due to synthesis increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

Here, we determined whether there is interplay between c-Myc, Maf proteins, and methionine adenosyltransferase α1 (MATα1), which is responsible for SAMe biosynthesis in the liver. We used bile duct ligation (BDL) and  (LCA) treatment in mice as chronic cholestasis models, a murine CCA model, human CCA cell lines KMCH and Huh-28, human liver cancer HepG2, and human CCA specimens to study gene and protein expression, protein-protein interactions, molecular mechanisms, and functional outcomes. We found that c-Myc, MATα1 (encoded by MAT1A), MafG, and c-Maf interact with one another directly. MAT1A expression fell in hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells during chronic cholestasis and in murine and human CCA. The opposite occurred with c-Myc, MafG, and c-Maf expression. MATα1 interacts mainly with Mnt in normal liver, but this switches to c-Maf, MafG, and c-Myc in cholestatic livers and CCA. Promoter regions of these genes have E-boxes that are bound by MATα1 and Mnt in normal liver and benign bile duct epithelial cells that switched to c-Myc, c-Maf, and MafG in cholestasis and CCA cells. E-box positively regulates c-Myc, MafG, and c-Maf, but it negatively regulates MAT1A. MATα1 represses, whereas c-Myc, MafG, and c-Maf enhance, E-box-driven promoter activity. Knocking down MAT1A or overexpressing MafG or c-Maf enhanced CCA growth and invasion in vivo.There is a novel interplay between MATα1, c-Myc, and Maf proteins, and their deregulation during chronic cholestasis may facilitate CCA oncogenesis.

Overexpression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) has been detected in CRC, and it contributes to poor prognosis. However, the effect of LCA on IL-8 expression is still undefined. In this study, we observed that LCA treatment induced IL-8 expression in CRC HCT116 cells. Pharmacological inhibition and mutagenesis studies indicated that Erk1/2 is critical for LCA-induced IL-8 expression. Furthermore, LCA reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3, and the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, accelerated LCA-induced IL-8 expression, suggesting that STAT3 is involved in LCA-induced IL-8 expression. Activation of Erk1/2 functioned as an upstream signal of the STAT3 suppression induced by LCA. In conclusion, LCA activated Erk1/2 and in turn, suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation to induce IL-8 expression in HCT116 cells, thus stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and tube like formation.

Therefore, we designed a gastric pH stable bile  derived amphiphile where Tamoxifen (as a model anticancer drug) is conjugated to  derived phospholipid (LCA-Tam-PC). In vitro studies suggested the selective nature of LCA-Tam-PC for cancer cells over normal cells as compared to the parent drug.

We then investigated the antitumor potential, toxicity, and median survival in 4T1 tumor bearing BALB/c mice upon LCA-Tam-PC treatment. Our studies confirmed a significant reduction in the tumor volume, tumor weight, and reduced hepatotoxicity with a significant increase in median survival on LCA-Tam-PC treatment as compared to the parent drug. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies using LCA-Tam-NBD-PC witnessed the enhanced gut absorption, blood circulation, and tumor site accumulation of phospholipid-drug conjugate leading to improved antitumor activity.

To make clear the actions of those BAs on this physiological process, an overview of current information about the mechanisms by which the intestinal Ca2+ occurs is described.The PubMed database was searched until 2017, using the keywords bile acids, NaDOC, UDCA and LCA and redox state, apoptosis, autophagy and intestinal Ca2+ absorption.The modulation of redox state, apoptosis and autophagy are mechanisms that are involved in the action of BAs on intestinal Ca2+ absorption. Although the mechanisms are still not completely understood, we provide the latest knowledge regarding the effect of BAs on intestinal Ca2+ absorption.The response of the intestine to absorb Ca2+ is affected by BAs, but it is different according to the type and dose of BA. When there is a single administration, NaDOC has an inhibitory effect, UDCA is an stimulator whereas LCA does not have any influence. However, the combination of BAs modifies the response. Either UDCA or LCA protects the intestine against the oxidative injury caused by NaDOC by blocking the oxidative/nitrosative stress, apoptosis and autophagy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325318>Mono-lithocholated exendin-4-loaded glycol chitosan nanoparticles with prolonged antidiabetic effects.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobically modified glycol chitosan (HGC) nanoparticles loaded with mono--conjugated exendin-4 at the Lys(27) residue (LAM1-Ex4) were prepared and characterized by particle size measurement, proteolytic stability, in vitro drug-release profile, and in vivo antidiabetic effects in a db/db diabetic mouse model.

BAs and their  and transportation appear to follow the clear circadian rhythms, and they are recently proposed also as the potential chronobiological signals that can affect the molecular clock mechanism. Cholecystectomy are believed to affect the circadian rhythms of BAs and the relevant enterohepatic transporters and enzymes systems and their regulatory signaling , for the reason that the circadian cycle of gallbladder filling and emptying play a pivotal role in controlling the flow of bile into the intestine and the enterohepatic circulation of BAs. Here, in the present study, the circadian rhythms about BAs concentration and composition and the mRNA expression of genes involved in BAs transportation,  and regulation in liver and ileum of mice with or without gallbladder were evaluated. As a result, it has been found that, mice with gallbladder exhibited significant and distinct circadian oscillations in BAs concentration, mRNA expression of enterohepatic transporters and enzymes systems and farnesoid X receptor-mediated regulatory  both in liver and ileum during gallbladder emptying period (1:00 AM and 1:00 PM), despite food was restricted during these periods; the circadian rhythmicity of BAs pool and hepatic and ileal BAs diminished but the BAs composition had no significant alteration in liver and ileum after cholecystectomy as compared with sham-operated mice; in parallel to the alteration of BAs levels in liver and ileum after cholecystectomy, the day/night circadian oscillations in the mRNA expression of the relevant transporting and  genes and the farnesoid X receptor signaling pathway-mediated â€œintestine-liverâ€ regulatory axis also shifted. In conclusion, the BAs concentration and the corresponding genes exhibit significant circadian rhythms in mice with gallbladder, and the circadian oscillations of most of the investigation factors are flattened and altered following by cholecystectomy, which could mainly ascribe to the disappearance of the filling and emptying cycle of gallbladder and might result in pathological states or drug chronopharmacology alternation.

Wound healing within the corneal endothelium typically occurs through cell spreading and migration rather than through proliferation. The mechanisms that control corneal endothelial cell migration are unclear. In this study we demonstrate that cultures of corneal endothelial cells display reduced migration in scratch wound assays, and reduced levels of E-cadherin mRNA, following suppression of ligand-activated Eph receptor signalling by treatment with . Two Eph receptors, EphA1 and EphA2, were subsequently detected in corneal endothelial cells, and their potential involvement during migration was explored through gene silencing using siRNAs. EphA2 siRNA reduced levels of mRNA for both EphA2 and N-cadherin, but increased levels of mRNA for both EphA1 and E-cadherin. No effect, however, was observed for EphA2 siRNA on migration. Our results indicate a potential role for Eph receptor signalling during corneal endothelial cell migration via changes in cadherin expression.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR), a xenobiotic sensor and signaling intermediate for certain host-bacterial metabolites, has been shown to negatively regulate TLR4 signaling. Here we investigated the relationship between PXR and TLR4 in the developing murine intestine and explored the capacity of PXR to modulate inflammatory  involved in experimental NEC.MethodsWild-type and PXR mice were studied at various time points of development in an experimental model of NEC. In addition, we studied the ability of the secondary bile   (LCA), a known PXR agonist in liver, to activate intestinal PXR and reduce NEC-related intestinal inflammation.ResultsWe found a reciprocal relationship between the developmental expression of PXR and TLR4 in wild-type murine intestine, with PXR acting to reduce TLR4 expression by decreasing TLR4 mRNA stability. In addition, PXR mice exhibited a remarkably heightened severity of disease in experimental NEC. Moreover, LCA attenuated intestinal proinflammatory responses in the early stages of experimental NEC.ConclusionThese findings provide proactive insights into the regulation of TLR4 in the developing intestine. Targeting PXR may be a novel approach for NEC prevention.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27888615>Unconjugated secondary bile acids activate the unfolded protein response and induce golgi fragmentation via a src-kinase-dependant mechanism.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are components of gastro-duodenal refluxate and regarded as causative agents in oesophageal disease but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that a specific subset of physiological bile acids affect the protein secretory pathway by inducing ER stress, activating the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and causing disassembly of the Golgi apparatus in oesophageal cells. Deoxycholic  (DCA), Chemodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (LCA) activated the PERK arm of the UPR, via phosphorylation of eIF2α and up-regulation of ATF3, CHOP and BiP/GRP78. UPR activation by these bile acids is mechanistically linked with Golgi fragmentation, as modulating the UPR using a PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) or salubrinal attenuated bile -induced effects on Golgi structure. Furthermore we demonstrate that DCA, CDCA and LA activate Src kinase and that inhibition of this kinase attenuated both bile -induced BiP/GRP78 expression and Golgi fragmentation. This study highlights a novel mechanism whereby environmental factors (bile acids) impact important cellular processes regulating cell homeostasis, including the UPR and Golgi structure, which may contribute to cancer progression in the oesophagus.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31177942>The ' lifestyle' of bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria: comparative genomics, metatranscriptomic, and bile  metabolomics analysis of a defined microbial community in gnotobiotic mice.</a></h2><p>The formation of secondary bile acids by gut microbes is a current topic of considerable biomedical interest.

We reported recently that activation of FXR induces TGR5 to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion to improve insulin sensitivity and hepatic . In this study, we used the intestine-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (FEX) to study the effect of activation of intestinal FXR on the gut microbiome, bile  , and FXR and TGR5 signaling. The current study revealed that FEX markedly increased taurolithocholic , increased secretion of fibroblast growth factors 15 and 21 and GLP-1, improved insulin and glucose tolerance, and promoted white adipose tissue browning in mice. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of the gut microbiome identified the FEX-induced and -producing bacteria Acetatifactor and Bacteroides. Antibiotic treatment completely reversed the FEX-induced  phenotypes and inhibited taurolithocholic  synthesis, adipose tissue browning, and liver bile  synthesis gene expression but further increased intestinal FXR target gene expression. FEX treatment effectively improved lipid profiles, increased GLP-1 secretion, improved glucose and insulin tolerance, and promoted adipose tissue browning, while antibiotic treatment reversed the beneficial  effects of FEX in obese and diabetic mice.This study uncovered a mechanism in which activation of intestinal FXR shaped the gut microbiota to activate TGR5/GLP-1 signaling to improve hepatic glucose and insulin sensitivity and increase adipose tissue browning; the gut microbiota plays a critical role in bile   and signaling to regulate  homeostasis in health and disease.

HepG2 cells were used to investigate the vitrol effects of Tan IIA on PXR and CYP3A4. Gut-formed LCA is hepatotoxic, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cholestatic diseases. To further investigate the hepatoprotective mechanisms of Tan IIA against LCA-induced cholestasis in vivo, we choose the normal mice and siRNA-treated mice. The in vitro study demonstrated that the effect of Tan IIA on CYP3A4 was mediated by transactivation of PXR in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The in vivo experiments using PXR siRNA revealed that Tan IIA could protect against LCA-induced hepatotoxicity and cholestasis in a dose-dependent manner.

A preliminary study has shown that patients with IBS-C have reduced levels of bile acids (BAs) in feces and reduced synthesis of BA. We compared the levels of primary and secondary BAs in fecal samples collected over a 48-hour period from patients with IBS-C on a diet that contained 100 g fat per day, and compared them with levels in samples from healthy volunteers (controls). We also examined the relationship between overall colonic transit and biomarkers of BAs in patients with IBS-C.We performed a retrospective study of 45 patients with IBS-C and 184 controls. For controls, we estimated the 10th percentile of fasting serum levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4, n = 184) and 48-hour fecal BAs (n = 46), and the 90th percentile of the fasting serum level of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19, n = 50). Colonic transit was measured in patients using a validated scintigraphic method. Data from patients with IBS-C were analyzed using Spearman correlations to determine the relationships among levels of C4, FGF19, fecal BAs, and colonic transit.Among the patients with IBS-C, 2 of 45 had low serum levels of C4, 4 of 43 had increased serum levels of FGF19, and 6 of 39 had low levels of BAs in feces collected over 48 hours. Patients with IBS-C had a significant increase in the proportions of fecal  compared with controls (P = .04), and a decrease in deoxycholic  compared with controls (P = .03). In patients with IBS-C, there were inverse relationships between serum levels of C4 and FGF19 and correlations among levels of 48-hour fecal BAs, colonic transit, and serum C4 and FGF19.Approximately 15% of patients with IBS-C have reduced total BAs and level of deoxycholic  in fecal samples collected over 48 hours on a 100 g fat diet.

In this study, in order to elucidate the differences in VDR action induced by 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and LCA, we compared their effect on the VDR target gene induction in the intestine of mice. While the oral administration of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ induced the  expression effectively in the duodenum and jejunum, the LCA increased target gene expression in the ileum as effectively as 1,25(OH)₂D₃. 1,25(OH)₂D₃, but not LCA, increased the expression of the calcium transporter gene  in the upper intestine, and increased the plasma calcium levels. Although LCA could induce an ileal  expression as well as 1,25(OH)₂D₃, the oral LCA administration was not effective in the VDR target gene induction in the kidney.

However, the mechanisms of acinar injury in human AP and the associated systemic inflammation are not clearly understood. This study, for the first time, evaluated the early interactions of bile  induced human pancreatic acinar injury and the resulting cytokine response. We exposed freshly procured resected human pancreata to taurolithocolic  (TLCS) and evaluated for acinar injury, cytokine release and interaction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We observed autophagy in acinar cells in response to TLCS exposure. There was also time-dependent release of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α from the injured acini that resulted in activation of PBMCs. We also observed that cytokines secreted by activated PBMCs resulted in acinar cell apoptosis and further cytokine release from them. Our data suggests that the earliest immune response in human AP originates within the acinar cell itself, which subsequently activates circulating PBMCs leading to SIRS.

We determined the effects of chronic i.c.v. infusion of tLCA, GW4064, or vehicle on energy expenditure, body weight and composition as well as tissue specific fatty  uptake in mice equipped with osmotic minipumps. We found that i.c.v. administration of tLCA (final concentration in cerebrospinal fluid: 1 μM) increased fat oxidation (tLCA group: 0.083 ± 0.006 vs control group: 0.036 ± 0.023 kcal/h,  = 5.46,  = 0.04) and decreased fat mass (after 9 days of tLCA infusion: 1.35 ± 0.13 vs controls: 1.96 ± 0.23 g,  = 0.03).

Twelve young pigs (11.05 ± 0.11 kg) were randomly divided into 2 groups and fed corn-soybean meal diets with either 5% pectin or cornstarch for 72 d. In pigs fed with pectin, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were lowered but high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) was increased (P < 0.05). Serum triglycerides tended to be lower in the pectin-fed animals (P = 0.093), whereas no change was noted in serum total bile . Along the length of the intestine, the size and composition of BA pools vary. The ratio of primary, secondary, taurine-conjugated, and glycine-conjugated BAs in the ileal pool was about 46:15:9:30, whereas it was 28:61:1:11 in the cecum and 22:65:3:9 in the colon (P < 0.05). In the feces,  and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) made up of over 97% of the total BA pool. Overall, the ileum had the greatest expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and apical sodium-coupled bile  transporter (ASBT) than the duodenum, jejunum, cecum, and colon (P < 0.05), whereas organic solute transporters α/β (OSTα/β) gene expression was peaked in the ileum and jejunum (P < 0.05). Expression multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) gradually decreased towards the end of the intestine (P < 0.05). Greater expression of G protein-coupled bile  receptor and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3) was found in the cecum and colon (P < 0.05). In pigs fed with 5% pectin, only cecal UDCA (P = 0.097) and hyocholic  (P = 0.088) showed a decreasing tendency. But FXR, ASBT, and MRP2 were upregulated in the ileum and FXR, OSTα/β, MRP2, and MRP3 in the cecum of PEC-fed pigs (P < 0.05). Liver enzymes involved in BA biosynthesis (CYP7A1, CYP27A1, bile -CoA synthase, and bile -CoA:amino  N acyltransferase) were not affected by pectin consumption. In conclusion, the abundant distribution of BA transporters and the greater BA pool size suggests the ileum as the major site for intestinal BA reabsorption in pigs.

Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs.

Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver  was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules.

In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut microbiota and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids.

The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed microbiota unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse microbiota" (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation.

MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10 µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP.

The effect of GLP-2 on GB smooth muscle (GBSM) calcium transients was characterized .Acute administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 lowered glucose but had no effect on GB volume in mice. In contrast, GLP-2 rapidly enhanced GB filling in a dose-dependent manner, actions maintained in the presence of cholecystokinin, and mediated through the canonical GLP-2R. GLP-2 also rapidly induced immediate early gene expression in GB, consistent with detection of the endogenous  in GB RNA. The ability of GLP-2 to increase GB volume was not abrogated by systemic administration of hexamethonium, propranolol, a vasoactive peptide receptor antagonist or N-Nitroarginine methyl ester, and was maintained in  mice. In contrast, , a Tgr5 agonist, increased GB filling in  but not in  mice. GLP-2 had no effect on ileal uptake or hepatic clearance of taurocholic  or on hepatic bile flow, yet reduced the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients in murine GBSM , in a tetrodotoxin-sensitive manner.Our data extend endocrine concepts of regulation of GB filling beyond FXR-FGF15/19 and the direct effects of BA via Tgr5, to encompass a novel BA-Tgr5-L cell GLP-2 axis providing nutrient-mediated feedback from BA to terminate meal-related GB contraction. These findings have implications for conditions characterized by elevated circulating levels of GLP-2 such as after bariatric surgery and the development and use of agents that promote Tgr5 activation, L cell secretion, or GLP-2R agonism for the treatment of  disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27076617> attenuates cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion in human colonic epithelial T84 cells.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) play a complex role in colonic fluid secretion. We showed that dihydroxy BAs, but not the monohydroxy BA  (LCA), stimulate Cl(-) secretion in human colonic T84 cells (Ao M, Sarathy J, Domingue J, Alrefai WA, Rao MC. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 305: C447-C456, 2013). In this study, we explored the effect of LCA on the action of other secretagogues in T84 cells. While LCA (50 μM, 15 min) drastically (>90%) inhibited FSK-stimulated short-circuit current (Isc), it did not alter carbachol-stimulated Isc LCA did not alter basal Isc, transepithelial resistance, cell viability, or cytotoxicity. LCA's inhibitory effect was dose dependent, acted faster from the apical membrane, rapid, and not immediately reversible. LCA also prevented the Isc stimulated by the cAMP-dependent secretagogues 8-bromo-cAMP, lubiprostone, or chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The LCA inhibitory effect was BA specific, since CDCA, cholic , or taurodeoxycholic  did not alter FSK or carbachol action. While LCA alone had no effect on intracellular cAMP concentration ([cAMP]i), it decreased FSK-stimulated [cAMP]i by 90%. Although LCA caused a small increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), chelation by BAPTA-AM did not reverse LCA's effect on Isc LCA action does not appear to involve known BA receptors, farnesoid X receptor, vitamin D receptor, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3, or bile -specific transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5. LCA significantly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was completely abolished by the MEK inhibitor PD-98059. Surprisingly PD-98059 did not reverse LCA's effect on Isc Finally, although LCA had no effect on basal Isc, nystatin permeabilization studies showed that LCA both stimulates an apical cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) current and inhibits a basolateral K(+) current. In summary, 50 μM LCA greatly inhibits cAMP-stimulated Cl(-) secretion, making low doses of LCA of potential therapeutic interest for diarrheal diseases.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871908>Acetylated deoxycholic (DCA) and cholic (CA) acids are potent ligands of pregnane X (PXR) receptor.</a></h2><p>The Pregnane X (PXR), Vitamin D (VDR) and Farnesoid X (FXR) nuclear receptors have been shown to be receptors of bile acids controlling their detoxification or synthesis. Chenodeoxycholic (CDCA) and  (LCA) acids are ligands of FXR and VDR, respectively, whereas 3-keto and acetylated derivates of LCA have been described as ligands for all three receptors. In this study, we hypothesized that oxidation or acetylation at position 3, 7 and 12 of bile acids DCA (deoxycholic ), LCA, CA (cholic ), and CDCA by detoxification enzymes or microbiome may have an effect on the interactions with bile  nuclear receptors. We employed reporter gene assays in HepG2 cells, the TR-FRET assay with recombinant PXR and RT-PCR to study the effects of acetylated and keto bile acids on the nuclear receptors activation and their target gene expression in differentiated hepatic HepaRG cells. We demonstrate that the DCA 3,12-diacetate and CA 3,7,12-triacetate derivatives are ligands of PXR and DCA 3,12-diacetate induces PXR target genes such as CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and ABCB1/MDR1. In conclusion, we found that acetylated DCA and CA are potent ligands of PXR. Whether the acetylated bile  derivatives are novel endogenous ligands of PXR with detoxification or physiological functions should be further studied in ongoing experiments.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Forty-eight Genesus [(Duroc boar × Yorkshire-Landrace sows] barrows (25.0 ± 0.32 kg initial BW) were housed in pairs. Pigs were assigned to 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets-a basal corn-soybean meal-containing diet (control), a flaxseed meal-containing diet (FM), or an oat hulls-containing diet (OH)-in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and to contain similar standardized ileal digestible AA contents and meet other nutrient requirements for growing pigs. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Average daily feed intake; ADG; G:F; ATTD of fat, serum lipids, and digesta; and fecal VFA, BA, and NS concentrations were determined. Pigs fed the control or OH had greater final BW ( < 0.001), ADFI ( = 0.005), and ADG ( < 0.001) than FM-fed pigs. The ATTD of fat in the FM was lowest at 70.1% followed by 79.2% in OH and was greatest at 92.4% in the control ( = 0.020). Total serum cholesterol content was 2.25 and 1.99 mmol/L and lower ( < 0.001) in pigs fed FM and OH, respectively, than the 2.36 mmol/L in pigs fed the control. Pigs fed the FM and OH had greater ileal and cecal total VFA ( < 0.001), ileal deoxycholic  ( < 0.01), and cecal ( < 0.001) and fecal cholesterol ( = 0.002) concentrations than those fed the control. Pigs fed the FM excreted more fecal  ( = 0.002) and ursodeoxycholic  ( = 0.001) compared with those that consumed the control and OH. The concentrations of coprostanol in cecal digesta ( < 0.001) and feces ( = 0.011) were higher in pigs fed the FM and OH than in pigs fed the control. In conclusion, feeding flaxseed meal and oat hulls induced intestinal fermentation; however, the former depressed growth performance whereas the latter did not have any effect. Addition of flaxseed meal and oat hulls in growing pig diets reduced fat digestibility and serum cholesterol and stimulated malabsorption of primary BA and excretion of secondary BA and NS.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27630168>Reduction in circulating bile  and restricted diffusion across the intestinal epithelium are associated with a decrease in blood cholesterol in the presence of oat β-glucan.</a></h2><p>Although oat (1,3:1,4)-β-glucan (BG) has been shown to decrease blood cholesterol in intervention trials, the detailed mechanism is not yet defined, but restricted reabsorption of bile acids (BAs) has been hypothesized. Using pigs as a model for humans we demonstrated that, compared to the control, BG added to the diet for 26 d caused decreases of 24% in blood total BAs (TBAs), 34% in total cholesterol (TC), and 57% in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (P < 0.01); decreases of 20% TBA in the midjejunum and terminal ileum (P < 0.01); increases of 80% in cecal total neutral sterols (TNSs) including cholesterol (P < 0.01); a 50% reduction in BA active transport across ex vivo ileum after 40 min (P < 0.001); and 32% decrease in jejunal microvillus heights with apparent increased goblet cell activity. The results suggest that BG not only physically hinders the active reabsorption of BAs and uptake of cholesterol, but also changes the BAs profile with lower circulating levels without excess excretion in the feces, thus resulting in reduced blood TC and LDL-C.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol , lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

This study tested whether increasing vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression prevents dedifferentiation of β cells in a high-glucose state in vitro. Culturing a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6) in a high-glucose environment decreased VDR expression. However, increased VDR following vitamin D3 (VD3) treatment improved insulin release of early-passage MIN6 and insulin index of db/- (heterozygous) islets to levels seen in normal functional islets. Treatment with VD3, its analogues and derivatives also increased the expression of essential transcription factors, such as Pdx1, MafA and VDR itself, ultimately increasing expression of Ins1 and Ins2, which might protect β cells against dedifferentiation. VD3 agonist  (LCA) propionate was the most potent candidate molecule for protecting against dedifferentiation, and an e-pharmacophore mapping model confirmed that LCA propionate exhibits a stabilizing conformation within the VDR binding site. This study concluded that treating db/+ islets with a VD3 analogue and/or derivatives can increase VDR activity, preventing the pathological dedifferentiation of β cells and the onset of T2D.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

Paradoxically, taurolithocholate (TLC) activates p38 MAPK but decreases PM-MRP2 in hepatocytes. These opposing effects of cAMP and TLC could be mediated via different p38 MAPK isoforms (α and β) that are activated differentially by upstream kinases (MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6). Thus we tested the hypothesis that p38α MAPK and p38β MAPK mediate increases and decreases in PM-MRP2 by cAMP and TLC, respectively. Studies were conducted in hepatocytes isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and MKK3-knockout (MKK3(-/-)) mice and in a hepatoma cell line (HuH7) that overexpresses sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) (HuH-NTCP). Cyclic AMP activated MKK3, p38 MAPK, and p38α MAPK and increased PM-MRP2 in WT hepatocytes, but failed to activate p38α MAPK or increase PM-MRP2 in MKK3(-/-) hepatocytes. In contrast to cAMP, TLC activated total p38 MAPK but decreased PM-MRP2, and did not activate MKK3 or p38α MAPK in WT hepatocytes. In MKK3(-/-) hepatocytes, TLC still decreased PM-MRP2 and activated p38 MAPK, indicating that these effects are not MKK3-dependent. Additionally, TLC activated MKK6 in MKK3(-/-) hepatocytes, and small interfering RNA knockdown of p38β MAPK abrogated TLC-mediated decreases in PM-MRP2 in HuH-NTCP cells. Taken together, these results suggest that p38α MAPK facilitates plasma membrane insertion of MRP2 by cAMP, whereas p38β MAPK mediates retrieval of PM-MRP2 by TLC.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639449>Identification of the anti-oxidant components in a two-step solvent extract of bovine bile lipid: Application of reverse phase HPLC, mass spectrometry and fluorimetric assays.</a></h2><p>An ether extract of nine different bacterial metabolites in combination with two solvent extract (ether followed by ethanol) of bile lipids from ox gall bladder is used as an immune stimulator drug.

Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile -activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by  (LCA) a secondary bile . GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of HS. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to HS. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including  syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192491>Sialyltransferase inhibition and recent advances.</a></h2><p>Sialic acids, existing as terminal sugars of glycoconjugates, play important roles in various physiological and pathological processes, such as cell-cell adhesion, immune defense, tumor cell metastasis, and inflammation.

Because activation of GPBA leads to increased cAMP levels and secretion of incretins and insulin, GPBA has been proposed as a promising drug target for the treatment of  syndrome. Previously, we have developed a ligand-screening system to identify novel agonists of GPBA by means of a fusion protein of GPBA with G protein stimulatory α subunit (Gsα) and by a [S]GTPγS-binding assay. To express the GPBA-Gsα fusion protein, transgenic silkworms were employed in this study, and cell membrane fractions were prepared from their fat body or pupae. We applied them to the screening of a chemical library that contains 10,625 compounds from the RIKEN Natural Products Depository (NPDepo). Eventually, a unique partial agonist, GUM2, was successfully identified. Our results indicated that the GPCR-Gα fusion proteins were beneficial for ligand identification and that the transgenic silkworms were useful for large-scale production of GPCRs. In HEK293 cells transiently expressing GPBA, GUM2 showed 50% effective concentration (EC) of 3.5 ± 2.4μM and induced GPBA internalization as effectively as did an endogenous agonist, TLC. We also confirmed that GUM2 stimulates insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. Moreover, a single 2mg/kg dose of GUM2 significantly reduced blood glucose levels in mice during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test even though GUM2 is only a partial agonist with a low intrinsic activity.

This partnership is speculated to be limited to higher vertebrates (birds and mammals), as lower vertebrates do not synthesize the parent compound of . However, the molecular functions associated with the observed insensitivity of basal VDRs to  have not been explored. Here we characterize canonical nuclear receptor functions of VDRs from select species representing key nodes in vertebrate evolution and span a range of bile salt phenotypes. Competitive ligand binding assays revealed that the receptor's affinity for  is highly conserved across species, suggesting that  affinity is an ancient and non-adaptive trait. However, transient transactivation assays revealed that -mediated VDR activation might have evolved more recently, as the non-mammalian receptors did not respond to  unless exogenous coactivator proteins were co-expressed. Subsequent functional assays indicated that differential -mediated receptor activation is potentially driven by differential protein-protein interactions between VDR and nuclear receptor coregulator proteins. We hypothesize that the vitamin D receptor- partnership evolved as a by-product of natural selection on the ligand-receptor partnership between the vitamin D receptor and the native VDR ligand: 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D3.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28036160>Bile acids: a potential role in the pathogenesis of pharyngeal malignancy.</a></h2><p>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is thought to be a risk factor for head and neck malignancies. Bile acids are one of the principle components of gastric refluxate and have previously been implicated in the development of oesophageal and bowel malignancies. There is clear evidence that bile acids reflux into the laryngopharynx. Despite this, the carcinogenic properties of bile acids in this area are yet to be fully identified. We therefore investigated the potential role of bile acids in pharyngeal malignancy, through the highly conserved process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT occurs in invasion and metastasis and is a central process in the development of epithelial carcinoma.Translational research study.Human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma FaDu cells were challenged with primary (cholic or chenodeoxycholic) and secondary (deoxycholic or ) bile acids. EMT-relevant proteins TGF-β1 and MMP-9 were measured in the cell culture supernates at 48 h via ELISA. Cell viability was confirmed >95% via CellTiter-Blue assay.Significantly greater concentrations of TGF-β1 were measured in the culture supernates of cells treated with cholic , deoxycholic  and chenodeoxycholic . MMP-9 levels were increased in deoxycholic  and lithocolic  stimulations when compared to control (P < 0.05).This is the first demonstration that bile acids induce TGF-β1 and MMP-9 in pharyngeal cells. TGF-β1 is considered a master switch for EMT, while MMP-9 is a part of the EMT proteome which degrades basement membranes. This implies a potential role for bile acids in pharyngeal carcinogenesis through the mechanism of EMT and suggests potential novel therapeutic targets.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27450898>Quantitative profiling of bile acids in rat bile using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-orbitrap mass spectrometry: Alteration of the bile  composition with aging.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) play important roles in physiological functions, including the homeostasis of cholesterol and lipids and as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). With the increasing importance of BAs, analytical methods for their quantification and screening have been developed. However, due to the diverse range and variety of BAs with different activation potency, a simple, effective, and sensitive method is required to screen BAs for accurate quantification and identification. This paper presents an application of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS) for profiling BAs in bile. Using this method, along with the accurate quantification of 19 targeted BAs, 22 unknown BAs were detected and characterized by their fragmentation patterns. The method is beneficial for screening most of the BAs (quantitatively and qualitatively) in rat bile with simple preparation in a single run. The sample dilution ranges of each BA were optimized depending on the concentration of BAs in the bile to obtain good peak separation and accurate data. The method validation was performed successfully using charcoal-treated bile and the intra and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 20% for all BAs while the recovery were above 88.5% except for the . The method was applied to profile the age-dependent changes in the contents of rat BAs. Through statistical analysis, we found that as the rats aged, unconjugated BAs and glycine-conjugated BAs decreased or were unaffected, while taurine-conjugated BAs were increased in general. Among the unknown BAs, 5 of the taurine-conjugated BAs increased, while a glycine-conjugated BA decreased, in agreement with the trends of the targeted BAs.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the synthetic steroid N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA) arised as a promising LXR ligand. This compound was able to dissociate certain beneficial LXRs effects from those undesirable ones involved in triglyceride . Here, we synthetized a series of DMHCA analogues with different modifications in the steroidal nucleus involving the A/B ring fusion, that generate changes in the overall conformation of the steroid. The LXRα and LXRβ activity of these analogues was evaluated by using a luciferase reporter assay in BHK21 cells. Compounds were tested in both the agonist and antagonist modes. Results indicated that the agonist/antagonist profile is dependent on the steroid configuration at the A/B ring junction. Notably, in contrast to DMHCA, the amide derived from  (2) with an A/B cis configuration and its 6,19-epoxy analogue 4 behaved as LXRα selective agonists, while the 2,19-epoxy analogues with an A/B trans configuration were antagonists of both isoforms. The binding mode of the analogues to both LXR isoforms was assessed by using 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results revealed conformational differences between LXRα- and LXRβ-ligand complexes, mainly in the hydrogen bonding network that involves the C-3 hydroxyl. Overall, these results indicate that the synthetized DMHCA analogues could be interesting candidates for a therapeutic modulation of the LXRs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the anti-glioma mechanism of LCA is unclear at present. Although malondialdehyde (MDA) is not specific to detect tumors, biologically active α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can be used to detect the outcome of gliomas, especially the mitochondria, as a research tool. The purpose of this research was to determine the optimum conditions for a lipid peroxidation model, according to changes in the aldehydes formed from the reaction between 2-thiobarbituric  and biologically active α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Experimental methods and procedures were successfully established for a model of lipid peroxidation induced by H2O2 in glioma mitochondria for glioma treatment and optimum conditions for LCA treatment were determined. The optimal conditions for the model were a glioma mitochondrial concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, H2O2 concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, duration of action of 30 min, and addition of 4.0 ml of 46 mM thiobarbituric .

Species differences in BA  may play a major role in the failure of currently used in vitro and in vivo models to predict reliably the DILI during the early stages of drug discovery and development. We developed an in vitro cofactor-fortified liver S9 fraction model to compare the  profiles of the four major BAs (cholic , chenodeoxycholic ,  and ursodeoxycholic ) between humans and several animal species. High- and low-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of BAs and their metabolites. Major species differences were found in the  of BAs. Sulfation into 3-O-sulfates was a major pathway in human and chimpanzee (4.8%-52%) and it was a minor pathway in all other species (0.02%-14%). Amidation was primarily with glycine (62%-95%) in minipig and rabbit and it was primarily with taurine (43%-81%) in human, chimpanzee, dog, hamster, rat and mice. Hydroxylation was highest (13%-80%) in rat and mice followed by hamster, while it was lowest (1.6%-22%) in human, chimpanzee and minipig. C6-β hydroxylation was predominant (65%-95%) in rat and mice, while it was at C6-α position in minipig (36%-97%).

They play an important role in phase II  process. The impact of the cofactor (PAPS) on the structure and flexibility of the enzyme has been studied extensively, and the response of the active-cap region to cofactor binding was proposed as the molecular basis for substrate selectivity. In this study, individual and cooperative effects of the cofactor and substrate on the structure and flexibility of the enzyme were investigated. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for four systems, including free enzyme, binary complexes (cofactor or substrate bound enzyme) and ternary complex (both cofactor and substrate bound enzyme). The influence of ligands (the cofactor and the substrate) on the structure and flexibility of the enzyme, especially that of the active-site cap region, was analyzed. Moreover, mutual structural impact of the ligands was examined as well. The results show that the impact of both the cofactor and the substrate was significant.

We have previously shown that FGF19 can modulate glucose handling by suppressing the activity of hypothalamic AGRP/NPY neurons. As bile acids stimulate the release of FGF19/FGF15 into the circulation, we pursued the potential of bile acids to improve glucose tolerance via a gut-brain axis involving FXR and FGF15/FGF19 within enterocytes and FGF receptors on hypothalamic AGRP/NPY neurons.A 5-day gavage of taurocholic , mirroring our previous protocol of a 5-day FGF19 treatment, was performed. Oral glucose tolerance tests in mice with genetic manipulations of FGF signaling and melanocortin signaling were used to define a gut-brain axis responsive to bile acids.The taurocholic  gavage led to increased serum concentrations of taurocholic  as well as increases of FGF15 mRNA in the ileum and improved oral glucose tolerance in obese (ob/ob) mice. In contrast, , an FXR antagonist but a potent agonist for GPBAR1, did not improve glucose tolerance. The positive response to taurocholic  is dependent upon an intact melanocortinergic system as obese MC4R-null mice or ob/ob mice without AGRP did not show improvements in glucose tolerance after taurocholate gavage. We also tested the FGF receptor isoform necessary for the bile  response, using AGRP:Fgfr1-/- and AGRP:Fgfr2-/- mice. While the absence of FGFR1 in AGRP/NPY neurons did not alter glucose tolerance after taurocholate gavage, manipulations of Fgfr2 caused bidirectional changes depending upon the experimental model. We hypothesized the existence of an endogenous hypothalamic FGF, most likely FGF17, that acted as a chronic activator of AGRP/NPY neurons. We developed two short peptides based on FGF8 and FGF17 that should antagonize FGF17 action. Both of these peptides improved glucose homeostasis after a 4-day course of central and peripheral injections. Significantly, daily average blood glucose from continuous glucose monitoring was reduced in all tested animals but glucose concentrations remained in the euglycemia range.We have defined a gut-brain axis that regulates glucose  mediated by antagonistic fibroblast growth factors. From the intestine, bile acids stimulate FGF15 secretion, leading to activation of the FGF receptors in hypothalamic AGRP/NPY neurons. FGF receptor intracellular signaling subsequently silences AGRP/NPY neurons, leading to improvements of glucose tolerance that are likely mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Finally, short peptides that antagonize homodimeric FGF receptor signaling within the hypothalamus have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis without inducing hypoglycemia. These peptides could provide a new mode of regulating glucose .Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The bidirectional effects between intestinal microbiota (IM) and bile acids (BA) suggest that dysbiosis may be accompanied by an altered bile  (BA) homeostasis, which in turn can contribute to the  dysregulation seen in NAFLD. This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH. Levels of total fecal BA, cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and BA synthesis were higher in patients with NASH compared to HC (p<0.05 for all comparisons). The primary to secondary BA ratio was higher in NASH compared to HC (p = 0.004), but ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was not different between the groups. Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum counts were decreased in in a subset of 16 patients with NASH compared to 25 HC, after adjusting for body mass index and weight-adjusted calorie intake (p = 0.028 and p = 0.030, respectively).

Despite that bile acids cause vasodilation, it is unclear why these effects involve GPBAR1, and the vascular phenotype of GPBAR1 deficient mice remains poorly defined. Previous studies have suggested a role for nitric oxide (NO) in regulatory activity exerted by GPBAR1 in liver endothelial cells. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a vasodilatory agent generated in endothelial cells by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE). Here we demonstrate that GPBAR1 null mice had increased levels of primary and secondary bile acids and impaired vasoconstriction to phenylephrine. In aortic ring preparations, vasodilation caused by chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a weak GPBAR1 ligand and farnesoid-x-receptor agonist (FXR), was iberiotoxin-dependent and GPBAR1-independent. In contrast, vasodilation caused by LCA was GPBAR1 dependent and abrogated by propargyl-glycine, a CSE inhibitor, and by 5β-cholanic , a GPBAR1 antagonist, but not by N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (l-NIO), an endothelial NO synthase inhibitor, or iberiotoxin, a large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels antagonist. In venular and aortic endothelial (HUVEC and HAEC) cells GPBAR1 activation increases CSE expression/activity and H2S production. Two cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) sites (CREs) were identified in the CSE promoter. In addition, TLCA stimulates CSE phosphorylation on serine residues. In conclusion we demonstrate that GPBAR1 mediates the vasodilatory activity of LCA and regulates the expression/activity of CSE. Vasodilation caused by CDCA involves BKCa channels. The GPBAR1/CSE pathway might contribute to endothelial dysfunction and hyperdynamic circulation in liver cirrhosis.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26198044>Cellular Accumulation and Toxic Effects of Bile Acids in Cyclosporine A-Treated HepaRG Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Alteration of bile  (BA) profiles and secretion by cholestatic drugs represents a major clinical issue. Species differences exist in BA composition, synthesis, and regulation; however presently, there is no in vitro reproducible cell model to perform studies on BAs in humans. We have evaluated the capacity of the human HepaRG cell line to synthesize, conjugate, and secrete BAs, and analyzed changes in BA content and profile after cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. Our data show that HepaRG cells produced normal BAs at daily levels comparable, though in different proportions, to those measured in primary human hepatocytes. A 4-h treatment with CsA led to BA accumulation and profile changes associated with occurrence of cholestatic features, while after 24 h BAs were decreased in cell layers and increased in media. The latter effects resulted from reduced function of BA uptake transporter (Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide), reduced expression of BA metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P4507A1, cytochrome P4508B1, and cytochrome P45027A1, and induction of alternative basolateral transporters. Noteworthy, HepaRG cells incubated in a 2% serum-supplemented medium showed dose-dependent accumulation of the cytotoxic BA  in a nonsulfoconjugated form associated with early inhibition of the canalicular transporter MRP2 and sulfotransferase 2A1. In summary, our data bring the first demonstration that an in vitro human liver cell line is able to produce and secrete conjugated BAs, and to accumulate endogenous BAs transiently, concomitantly to occurrence of various other cholestatic features following CsA treatment. Retention of the hydrophobic  supports its toxic role in drug-induced cholestasis. Overall, our results argue on the suitability of HepaRG cells for investigating mechanisms involved in the development of the disease.© The Author 2015.

Mitochondria are the main source of ROS as by-products of electron transport chain. Most of the time the intestine responds adequately against the oxidative stress, but with aging or under conditions that exacerbate the ROS and/or RNS production, the defenses are not enough and contribute to developing intestinal pathologies. The endogenous antioxidant defense system in gut includes glutathione (GSH) and GSH-dependent enzymes as major components. When the ROS and/or RNS production is exacerbated, oxidative stress occurs and the intestinal Ca absorption is inhibited.

However, whether WZ exerts a protective effect against cholestasis remains unclear. In this study, the protective effect of WZ on  (LCA)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis in mice was characterized and the involved mechanisms were investigated. WZ pretreatment (350 mg/kg) with LCA significantly reversed liver necrosis and decreased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids and total bilirubin were also remarkably reduced. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed that hepatic expression of pregnane X receptor (PXR) target genes such as CYP3A11 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 were significantly increased by WZ treatment. Luciferase assays performed in LS174T cells illustrated that WZ extract and its six bioactive lignans could all activate human PXR. In addition, WZ treatment significantly promoted liver regeneration via inhibition of p53/p21 to induce cell proliferation-associated proteins such as cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In conclusion, WZ has a protective effect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, partially owing to activation of the PXR pathway and promotion of liver regeneration.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924312>Effect of Wheat Dietary Fiber Particle Size during Digestion In Vitro on Bile , Faecal Bacteria and Short-Chain Fatty  Content.</a></h2><p>The influence of bile  concentration on the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria was demonstrated. Exposing these bacteria to the environment containing bile  salts, and very poor in nutrients, leads to the disappearance of these microorganisms due to the toxic effect of bile acids. A multidimensional analysis of data in the form of principal component analysis indicated that lactic  bacteria bind bile acids and show antagonistic effect on E. coli spp. bacteria.

This is direct proof of  binding ability of the tested lactic  bacteria with respect to cholic ,  and deoxycholic . This research demonstrated that the degree of fineness of wheat dietary fibre does not affect the sorption of bile acids and growth of some bacteria species; however, it has an impact on the profile of synthesized short-chained fatty acids. During the digestion of a very fine wheat fibre fraction (WF 90), an increase in the concentration of propionic and butyric acids, as compared with the wheat fiber fraction of larger particles - WF 500, was observed.

In this study, we examined whether this decrease in CYP3A expression is induced by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is the main component of GP. After a diet containing 1.5% EGCG was given to mice, the hepatic CYP3A expression was measured. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp., the concentration of  (LCA) in the feces, and the level of the translocation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) to the nucleus in the liver were examined. A decrease in the CYP3A expression level was observed beginning on the second day of the treatment with EGCG. The level of translocation of PXR to the nucleus was significantly lower in the EGCG group. The fecal level of LCA was clearly decreased by the EGCG treatment. The level of intestinal bacteria of Clostridium spp. was also decreased by the EGCG treatment. It is clear that the hepatospecific decrease in the CYP3A expression level observed after a high-dose intake of GP was caused by EGCG. Because EGCG, which is not absorbed from the intestine, causes a decrease in the level of LCA-producing bacteria in the colon, the level of LCA in the liver decreases, resulting in a decrease in the nuclear translocation of PXR, which in turn leads to the observed decrease in the expression level of CYP3A.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the serum biochemistry, liver histopathology, and bile  profiles by LC-MS/MS, and the mRNA expression of transporters and CYPs by an RT-PCR after the following treatments to male Crl:CD (SD) rats: (a) bile duct ligation (BDL); (b) a single oral dose of 150 mg/kg α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT); and (c) repeated oral doses of a novel pyrrolidinecarboxylic  derivative (abbreviated as PCA) at 30, 300, and 1000 mg/kg. The serum total bile  levels and bilirubin concentrations were found to be elevated in all of the groups. However, the bile  component profiles of the PCA group differed significantly from BDL and ANIT models: deoxycholic , , and sulfated bile acids were upregulated in a dose-dependent manner only in the PCA group. In addition, the PCA group demonstrated high levels of hepatic heme oxygenase-1 expression, whereas the profiles of the mRNA levels of the hepatic transporters and CYPs of all groups were found to be similar. The histopathological findings, for both the BDL and ANIT groups, were of bile duct hyperplasia, hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis. In contrast, only bile duct hyperplasia and hepatocyte degeneration were observed in the PCA group, even at a lethal dose. These results indicated that PCA induced a cholestatic condition and the increase of oxidative stress markers implies that this will also lead hepatocellular injury. In conclusion, the serum bile  components and sulfated bile  levels, and the expression of oxidative stress markers could provide information that aids in the diagnosis of liver injury type and helps to elucidate the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. These findings can be extrapolated into our clinical investigation.

We synthesized three dimeric bile  amphiphiles where , deoxycholic , and cholic  are conjugated to cholic  phospholipid using click chemistry. Interactions of these dimeric amphiphiles with model membranes showed that these amphiphiles form different structural assemblies and molecular packing in model membranes depending on the number and position of free hydroxyl groups on bile acids.

This action has been attributed to activation of the G protein-coupled bile  receptor GPBAR1 (TGR5), although other potential bile  sensors include the nuclear farnesoid receptor and the apical sodium-coupled bile  transporter ASBT. The aim of this study was to identify  important for GLP-1 release and to determine whether bile acids target their receptors on GLP-1-secreting L-cells from the apical or basolateral compartment. Using transgenic mice expressing fluorescent sensors specifically in L-cells, we observed that taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) and taurolithocholate (TLCA) increased intracellular cAMP and Ca(2+). In primary intestinal cultures, TDCA was a more potent GLP-1 secretagogue than taurocholate (TCA) and TLCA, correlating with a stronger Ca(2+) response to TDCA. Using small-volume Ussing chambers optimized for measuring GLP-1 secretion, we found that both a GPBAR1 agonist and TDCA stimulated GLP-1 release better when applied from the basolateral than from the luminal direction and that luminal TDCA was ineffective when intestinal tissue was pretreated with an ASBT inhibitor. ASBT inhibition had no significant effect in nonpolarized primary cultures. Studies in the perfused rat gut confirmed that vascularly administered TDCA was more effective than luminal TDCA. Intestinal primary cultures and Ussing chamber-mounted tissues from GPBAR1-knockout mice did not secrete GLP-1 in response to either TLCA or TDCA. We conclude that the action of bile acids on GLP-1 secretion is predominantly mediated by GPBAR1 located on the basolateral L-cell membrane, suggesting that stimulation of gut hormone secretion may include postabsorptive mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29656109>Bile acids are important direct and indirect regulators of the secretion of appetite- and -regulating hormones from the gut and pancreas.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) facilitate fat absorption and may play a role in glucose and  regulation, stimulating the secretion of gut hormones. The relative importance and mechanisms involved in BA-stimulated secretion of appetite and  regulating hormones from the gut and pancreas is not well described and was the purpose of this study.The effects of bile acids on the secretion of gut and pancreatic hormones was studied in rats and compared to the most well described nutritional secretagogue: glucose. The molecular mechanisms that underlie the secretion was studied by isolated perfused rat and mouse small intestine and pancreas preparations and supported by immunohistochemistry, expression analysis, and pharmacological studies.Bile acids robustly stimulate secretion of not only the incretin hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), but also glucagon and insulin in vivo, to levels comparable to those resulting from glucose stimulation. The mechanisms of GLP-1, neurotensin, and peptide YY (PYY) secretion was secondary to intestinal absorption and depended on activation of basolateral membrane Takeda G-protein receptor 5 (TGR5) receptors on the L-cells in the following order of potency:  (LCA) >Deoxycholicacid (DCA)>Chenodeoxycholicacid (CDCA)> Cholic  (CA). Thus BAs did not stimulate secretion of GLP-1 and PYY from perfused small intestine in TGR5 KO mice but stimulated robust responses in wild type littermates. TGR5 is not expressed on α-cells or β-cells, and BAs had no direct effects on glucagon or insulin secretion from the perfused pancreas.BAs should be considered not only as fat emulsifiers but also as important regulators of appetite- and -regulating hormones by activation of basolateral intestinal TGR5.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial  on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial  of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial  of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660434>A Localized Chimeric Hydrogel Therapy Combats Tumor Progression through Alteration of Sphingolipid Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Rapid proliferation of cancer cells assisted by endothelial cell-mediated angiogenesis and acquired  at the tumor microenvironment (TME) lowers the success rate of chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled -dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and , leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid metabolic genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650892>Structure and functional characterization of a bile  7α dehydratase BaiE in secondary bile  synthesis.</a></h2><p>Conversion of the primary bile acids cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) to the secondary bile acids deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA) is performed by a few species of intestinal bacteria in the genus Clostridium through a multistep biochemical pathway that removes a 7α-hydroxyl group.

The role of the breast microbiome in breast cancer is unresolved, nevertheless it seems that the gut microbiome does have a role in the pathology of the disease.

We highlight the bacterial species or taxonomical units that generate these metabolites, we show their mode of action, and discuss how the metabolites affect mitochondrial  and other molecular events in breast cancer. These metabolites resemble human hormones, as they are produced in a "gland" (in this case, the microbiome) and they are subsequently transferred to distant sites of action through the circulation.

Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) and cAMP reverse TLC-induced cholestasis by inhibiting TLC-induced retrieval of MRP2. However, cellular mechanisms for this reversal are incompletely understood. Recently, we reported that TLC decreases PM-MRP2 by activating PKCε followed by phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS). Thus, cAMP and TUDC may reverse TLC-induced cholestasis by inhibiting the TLC/PKC/MARCKS phosphorylation pathway. We tested this hypothesis by determining whether TUDC and/or cAMP inhibit TLC-induced activation of PKCε and phosphorylation of MARCKS Studies were conducted in HuH-NTCP cell line and rat hepatocytes. Activation of PKC was determined from the translocation of PKC to PM using a biotinylation method. Phosphorylation of MARCKS was determined by immunoblotting with a phospho-MARCKS antibody. TLC, but not cAMP and TUDC, activated PKC and increased MARCKS phosphorylation in HuH-NTCP as well in rat hepatocytes. Treatment with TUDC or cAMP inhibited TLC-induced activation of PKCε and increases in MARCKS phosphorylation in both cell types.

Parallel effects were observed with bilirubin, which up-regulated apoptotic genes and CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and down-regulated antiapoptotic genes (BCL2 and BCL2L1), BMP3, BMP4 and RUNX2. UDCA 100 μM had specific consequences since differential expression was observed, up-regulating BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, CALCR (calcitonin receptor), SPOCK3 (osteonectin), BGLAP (osteocalcin) and SPP1 (osteopontin), and down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, most of the differential expression changes induced by both LCA and bilirubin were partially or completely neutralized by UDCA. Conclusion: Our observations reveal novel target genes, whose regulation by retained substances of cholestasis may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in cholestatic and end-stage liver diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The complicated etiology and injury mechanism greatly limits the development of new drugs for its treatment. To better understand the mechanism of cholestatic liver damage, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-linked electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS) and multivariate data analysis were used to determine the metabolic changes in three recognized mouse cholestasis models. The cholestatic liver damage was generated by alphanaphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT), 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) and  (LCA). The results indicated that the levels of bile acids were commonly increased in plasma of three mouse cholestasis models, while arginine was decreased. The level of plasma glutathione was decreased in ANIT- and LCA-induced intrahepatic PBC and PSC, respectively. But, the liver glutathione was decreased in DDC induced extrahepatic PSC. The level of plasma phospholipids was elevated in ANIT and DDC models, whereas that was depleted in LCA model. And protoporphyrin IX was significantly increased in the liver of DDC model. These metabolomics data could potentially distinguish the metabolic differences of three types of cholestasis, contributing to the understanding of the potential mechanism of cholestatic liver damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because TGR5 promotes energy expenditure and improves glucose homeostasis, it is recognized as a key target in treating  diseases. We previously showed that nomilin, a citrus limonoid, activates TGR5 and confers anti-obesity and anti-hyperglycemic effects in mice. Information on the TGR5-nomilin interaction regarding molecular structure, however, has not been reported. In the present study, we found that human TGR5 (hTGR5) shows higher nomilin responsiveness than does mouse TGR5 (mTGR5). Using mouse-human chimeric TGR5, we also found that three amino  residues (Q77ECL1, R80ECL1, and Y893.29) are important in the hTGR5-nomilin interaction. Based on these results, an hTGR5-nomilin binding model was constructed using in silico docking simulation, demonstrating that four hydrophilic hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between nomilin and hTGR5. The binding mode of hTGR5-nomilin is vastly different from those of other TGR5 agonists previously reported, suggesting that TGR5 forms various binding patterns depending on the type of agonist. Our study promotes a better understanding of the structure of TGR5, and it may be useful in developing and screening new TGR5 agonists.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185272>Bile acids induce activation of alveolar epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts through farnesoid X receptor-dependent and independent .</a></h2><p>The roles of bile  microaspiration and bile -activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unclear. We hypothesized that bile acids activate alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung fibroblasts, which may be regulated by FXR activation.Human AECs and normal or IPF-derived lung fibroblast cells were incubated with the three major bile acids:  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The AECs injury indices, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung fibroblast activation were evaluated. FXR expression in IPF lungs and the roles of FXR and FXR-independent  in bile -induced profibrotic effects were also investigated.LCA, DCA and CDCA reduced cell viability and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in A549 cells. They all induced EMT, as shown by enhanced α-SMA and vimentin and decreased E-cadherin levels. LCA directly induced differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. All three bile acids promoted cellular migration but not proliferation of lung fibroblasts. FXR expression was upregulated in IPF lungs, and inhibition of FXR restrained the bile -induced EMT and lung fibroblast activation. Differentiation and proliferation were enhanced in lung fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium from bile -stimulated A549 cells, which contained increased levels of profibrotic factors.

They undergo enterohepatic circulation through various transporters expressed in intestine and liver. Human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 contribute to hepatic uptake of bile acids such as taurocholic . However, the transport properties of individual bile acids are not well understood. Therefore, we selected HEK293 cells overexpressing OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 to evaluate the transport of five major human bile acids (cholic , chenodeoxycholic , deoxycholic , ursodeoxycholic , ) together withtheir glycine and taurine conjugates via OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The bile acids were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The present study revealed that cholic , chenodeoxyxcholic , and deoxycholic  were transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, while ursodeoxycholic  and  were not significantly transported by OATPs. However, all the conjugated bile acids were taken up rapidly by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Kinetic analyses revealed the involvement of saturable OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bile acids. The apparent Km values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 of the conjugated bile acids were similar (0.74-14.7 μM for OATP1B1 and 0.47-15.3 μM for OATP1B3). They exhibited higher affinity than cholic  (47.1 μM for OATP1B1 and 42.2 μM for OATP1B3).

Recently, we reported the crystal structure of human NAPE-PLD and discovered specific binding sites for the bile  deoxycholic . In this study, we demonstrate that in the presence of this secondary bile , the stiffness of the protein measured by elastic neutron scattering increases, and NAPE-PLD is ∼7 times faster to catalyze the hydrolysis of the more unsaturated substrate N-arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, compared with N-palmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. Chenodeoxycholic  and glyco- or tauro-dihydroxy conjugates can also bind to NAPE-PLD and drive its activation. The only natural monohydroxy bile , , shows an affinity of ∼20 μM and acts instead as a reversible inhibitor (IC ≈ 68 μM).

However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic  and cholic ) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic  (Urs type), and deoxycholic and  (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with -dominant microbiota corresponding to the neonatal type or -dominant microbiota corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with  colonization, mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex microbiota dominated by a variety of  and  species.

Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the dimeric MNoV VP1 protruding (P) domain in complex with its cellular receptor CD300lf. CD300lf binds the P domain with a 2:2 stoichiometry, engaging a cleft between the AB and DE loops of the P2 subdomain at a site that overlaps the epitopes of neutralizing antibodies. We also identify that bile acids are cofactors enhancing MNoV cell-binding and infectivity. Structures of CD300lf-P domain in complex with glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) and  (LCA) reveal two bile  binding sites at the P domain dimer interface distant from receptor binding sites. The structural determinants for receptor and bile  binding are supported by numerous biophysical assays utilizing interface residue mutations. We find that the monomeric affinity of CD300lf for the P domain is low and is divalent cation dependent. We have also determined the crystal structure of CD300lf in complex with phosphocholine, revealing that MNoV engages its receptor in a manner mimicking host ligands including similar metal coordination. Docking of the cocomplex structures onto a cryo-EM-derived model of MNoV suggests that each virion can make multiple CD300lf engagements, and thus, infection may be driven by the avidity of cell surface clustered CD300lf. These studies identify multiple potential modulators of norovirus infection that may act to regulate the interaction between the viral capsid P domain and its cognate cellular receptor.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

Twelve Genesus [(Duroc ♂ × Yorkshire-Landrace ♀)] cannulated barrows (initial BW: 35.1 ± 0.44 kg) were individually housed and offered diets in a two-period cross-over design (n = 8). In each period, four pigs were assigned to one of the three corn-soybean meal-based diets without (control), or with FM or OHs. Soybean oil was added in each diet to give an FA content of 4.56%, 6.02%, and 6.05 % in the control, FM, and OH diets, respectively. Feces and ileal digesta contents were collected to determine apparent ileal (AID), total tract (ATTD) digestibility of dietary components and flows of FA and BA. Pigs fed the control diet had greater (P < 0.05) AID of SFA and insoluble DF and ATTD of SFA than pigs offered the OH and FM diets. The AID of total FA and MUFA in FM diet-fed pigs was lower (P = 0.02) compared to those fed the control and OH diets. The ATTD of CP, NDF, insoluble and total DF was lower (P < 0.05) in pigs fed the OH diet than in pigs that consumed the control and FM diets. In the terminal ileum, pigs fed OH and FM diets excreted more (P < 0.05) primary BA and all secondary BA (except ) compared to control diet-fed pigs. The intestinal flows of  in pigs fed the FM diet were higher (P < 0.05) than in pigs offered the control diet. Pigs fed FM and OH diets excreted more (P = 0.001) fecal ursodeoxycholic and total BAs compared to pigs that consumed the control diet. The ileal flows of eicosapentaenoic and erucic acids in pigs fed the FM and OH diets were greater (P < 0.05) than in pigs fed the control diet. The flow of all SFA, and palmitoleic, palmitelaidic, oleic, nervonic, linoleic, eicosapentaenoic, erucic, docosatetraenoic and docosapentaenoic acids in feces were greater (P < 0.05) in OH diet-fed pigs compared to pigs fed other diets. In conclusion, addition of FM and OHs in pig diets reduced FA digestibility, increased gastrointestinal flows of FA and excretion of BA. Dietary supplementation with FM and OHs induces variable effects on digestibility of DF fractions and fecal flows of unsaturated FA. Future studies are needed to quantify the contribution of endogenous FA losses from the host to gastrointestinal flows of FA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248338>Angiopoietin-Like Protein 8 Is a Novel Vitamin D Receptor Target Gene Involved in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Pathogenesis.</a></h2><p>Hepatic vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression is increased in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and is required for liver steatosis in an NAFL mouse model. However, how hepatocyte VDR is involved in setting up steatosis remains unclear. The authors transduced human hepatocyte-derived cells with an adenoviral vector encoding human VDR and found that angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) expression was increased upon VDR activation by vitamin D or . The mRNA levels of hepatic VDR- and vitamin D-related genes [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2R1, CYP27A1, and CYP3A4] were higher in NAFL patients compared with normal liver subjects. Noteworthy, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in NAFL patients, and its mRNA correlated with VDR mRNA and with the steatosis grade. Moreover, increases in serum conjugated bile acids, including the VDR agonist glycine-, were observed in NAFL patients. Additionally, free fatty acids and insulin were able to up-regulate both VDR and ANGPTL8 mRNA in human hepatocytes, whereas ANGPTL8 gene knockdown attenuated free fatty acids-induced triglyceride accumulation in these cells. In conclusion, activated VDR up-regulates ANGPTL8 expression, contributing to triglyceride accumulation in human hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatic ANGPTL8 mRNA positively correlates with VDR mRNA content and the grade of steatosis in NAFL patients, suggesting that this novel pathway may play a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatosteatosis.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Dietary fibre should be contained in everyday, easily accessible food products. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine sorption capacities of primary bile  (cholic  - CA) and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic - DCA and  acids - LCA) by muffins (BM) and cookies (BC) with bioactive substances and control muffins (CM) and cookies (CC) in two sections of the in vitro gastrointestinal tract. Variations in gut flora were also analysed in the process of in vitro digestion of pastry products in a bioreactor. Enzymes: pepsin, pancreatin and bile salts: cholic , deoxycholic  and  were added to the culture. Faecal bacteria, isolated from human large intestine, were added in the section of large intestine. The influence of dietary fibre content in cookies and concentration of bile acids in two stages of digestion were analysed. Generally, pastry goods with bioactive substances were characterized by a higher content of total fibre compared with the control samples. These products also differ in the profile of dietary fibre fractions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the bile  profile after two stages of digestion depends on the quality and quantity of fibre. The bile  profile after digestion of BM and BC forms one cluster, and with the CM and CC forms a separate cluster. High concentration of H (hemicellulose) is positively correlated with LCA (low binding effect) and negatively correlated with CA and DCA contents. The relative content of bile acids in the second stage of digestion was in some cases above the content in the control sample, particularly LCA. This means that the bacteria introduced in the 2nd stage of digestion synthesize the LCA.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325587>Oxidative stress markers, secondary bile acids and sulfated bile acids classify the clinical liver injury type: Promising diagnostic biomarkers for cholestasis.</a></h2><p>Clinicians sometimes encounter difficulty in choosing a therapeutic strategy due to the uncertainty regarding the type of liver injury. In particular, cholestasis is difficult to diagnose by conventional markers at an early stage of disease. The aim of this study was to identify promising biomarkers for distinguishing the symptom-based types of liver injury (e.g. hepatocellular injury, cholestasis), which was derived from a rigorously statistical perspective. The associations between diagnostic biomarkers (e.g. bile  components, oxidative stress markers and liver fibrosis markers) and the liver injury types were assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis using 304 blood samples from patients with liver disease. As a result, reductions in the  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA) levels, and elevation of the serum sulfated bile  (SSBA), liver fibrosis marker IV collagen (type IV collagen), hyaluronic  (HA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were all significantly associated with cholestasis. On the other hand, elevations in the LCA and type IV collagen levels, and a reduction in the ursodeoxy cholic  (UDCA) level, were significantly associated with hepatocellular injury. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found for ROS, followed by DCA, HA, LCA, SSBA and type IV collagen in the cholestatic-type cases. These results indicated that ROS, the secondary bile  levels such as DCA and LCA, and SSBA are promising biomarkers for cholestasis and for classifying the type of liver injuries.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA) are the only two FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to develop new therapeutic approaches for cholestasis. Here, anti-cholestasis effects of the lignans from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Schisandra sphenanthera, were investigated as well as the involved mechanisms.Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 9 groups including the control group, LCA group, LCA with specific lignan treatment of Schisandrin A (SinA), Schisandrin B (SinB), Schisandrin C (SinC), Schisandrol A (SolA), Schisandrol B (SolB), Schisantherin A (StnA) and Schisantherin B (StnB), respectively. Mice were treated with each drug (qd) for 7 days, while the administration of  (LCA) (bid) was launched from the 4th day. Twelve hours after the last LCA injection, mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. Serum biochemical measurement and histological analysis were conducted. Metabolomics analysis of serum, liver, intestine and feces were performed to study the  profile of bile acids. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the hepatic expression of genes and proteins related to bile  homeostasis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to investigate the transactivation effect of lignans on human pregnane X receptor (hPXR). RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect induction effects of lignans on hPXR-targeted genes in HepG2 cells.Lignans including SinA, SinB, SinC, SolA, SolB, StnA, StnB were found to significantly protect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, as evidenced by significant decrease in liver necrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids (TBA) and total bilirubin (Tbili) were also significantly reduced. Metabolomics analysis revealed these lignans accelerated the  of bile acids and increased the bile  efflux from liver into the intestine or feces. Gene analysis revealed these lignans induced the hepatic expressions of PXR-target genes such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1. Luciferase reporter gene assays illustrated that these bioactive lignans can activate hPXR. Additionally, they can all upregulate hPXR-regulate genes such as CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and OATP2.These results clearly demonstrated the lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera exert hepatoprotective effects against LCA-induced cholestasis by activation of PXR.

We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile  species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated  (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling  in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile -based drugs and gut microbiota.

Several genes encoding these enzymes, known as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH) have yet to be identified. It is also uncertain whether the products of E. lenta bile   are further metabolized by other members of the gut microbiota. We characterized a novel human fecal isolate identified as E. lenta strain C592. The complete genome of E. lenta strain C592 was sequenced and comparative genomics with the type strain (DSM 2243) revealed high conservation, but some notable differences. E. lenta strain C592 falls into group III, possessing 3α, 3β, 7α, and 12α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, as determined by mass spectrometry of thin layer chromatography (TLC) separated metabolites of primary and secondary bile acids. Incubation of E. lenta oxo-bile  and iso-bile  metabolites with whole-cells of the high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium, Clostridium scindens VPI 12708, resulted in minimal conversion of oxo-derivatives to  (LCA). Further, Iso-chenodeoxycholic  (iso-CDCA; 3β,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic ) was not metabolized by C. scindens. We then located a gene encoding a novel 12α-HSDH in E. lenta DSM 2243, also encoded by strain C592, and the recombinant purified enzyme was characterized and substrate-specificity determined. Genomic analysis revealed genes encoding an Rnf complex (rnfABCDEG), an energy conserving hydrogenase (echABCDEF) complex, as well as what appears to be a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Our prediction that by changing the gas atmosphere from nitrogen to hydrogen, bile  oxidation would be inhibited, was confirmed.

Plasma biomarkers are needed to guide the genetic testing of spastic paraplegia. Spastic paraplegia type 5 (SPG5) is an autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia due to mutations in CYP7B1, which encodes a cytochrome P450 7α-hydroxylase implicated in cholesterol and bile acids . We developed a method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry to validate two plasma 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) as diagnostic biomarkers in a cohort of 21 patients with SPG5. For 14 patients, SPG5 was initially suspected on the basis of genetic analysis, and then confirmed by increased plasma 25-OHC, 27-OHC and their ratio to total cholesterol. For seven patients, the diagnosis was initially based on elevated plasma oxysterol levels and confirmed by the identification of two causal CYP7B1 mutations. The receiver operating characteristic curves analysis showed that 25-OHC, 27-OHC and their ratio to total cholesterol discriminated between SPG5 patients and healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Taking advantage of the robustness of these plasma oxysterols, we then conducted a phase II therapeutic trial in 12 patients and tested whether candidate molecules (atorvastatin, chenodeoxycholic  and resveratrol) can lower plasma oxysterols and improve bile acids profile. The trial consisted of a three-period, three-treatment crossover study and the six different sequences of three treatments were randomized. Using a linear mixed effect regression model with a random intercept, we observed that atorvastatin decreased moderately plasma 27-OHC (∼30%, P < 0.001) but did not change 27-OHC to total cholesterol ratio or 25-OHC levels. We also found an abnormal bile acids profile in SPG5 patients, with significantly decreased total serum bile acids associated with a relative decrease of ursodeoxycholic and  acids compared to deoxycholic . Treatment with chenodeoxycholic  restored bile acids profile in SPG5 patients. Therefore, the combination of atorvastatin and chenodeoxycholic  may be worth considering for the treatment of SPG5 patients but the neurological benefit of these  interventions remains to be evaluated in phase III therapeutic trials using clinical, imaging and/or electrophysiological outcome measures with sufficient effect sizes. Overall, our study indicates that plasma 25-OHC and 27-OHC are robust diagnostic biomarkers of SPG5 and shall be used as first-line investigations in any patient with unexplained spastic paraplegia.© The Author (2017).
