COX-2 is mostly known for the production of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. However, it also metabolizes the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide into the less well-studied bioactive lipids PG-glycerol esters (PG-Gs) and PG-ethanolamides (PG-EAs or prostamides). We previously showed that PGD-G, a product of 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2, has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we used the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of colitis in mice to explore the role of PGD-G in murine models of IBD. Colon inflammation was assessed using macroscopic and histologic scores, myeloperoxidase activity, and expression of inflammatory mediators by real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. We also compared the effects of PGD-G with those of PGD and PGD-EA. Finally, we used receptor antagonists to gain mechanistic insight into the receptors responsible for the observed effects. PGD-G reduced DSS-induced colitis, but PGD and PGD-EA did not have the same effect. Furthermore, we showed that PGD-G is an agonist of the PGD receptor 1 (DP1) and that some of the effects of PGD-G were blocked by antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and DP1. Therefore, PGD-G could be one of the products from the COX-2/prostaglandin D synthase axis to exert beneficial effects in colitis.-Alhouayek, M., Buisseret, B., Paquot, A., Guillemot-Legris, O., Muccioli, G.

Although available through different precursor phospholipids, there is considerable overlap between the biosynthetic  of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids and anandamide-derived prostamides. Prostamides exhibit physiological actions and are involved in ocular hypotension, smooth muscle contraction, and inflammatory pain. Although topical application of bimatoprost, a structural analog of prostaglandin F2α ethanolamide (PGF2α-EA), is currently a first-line treatment for ocular hypertension, the endogenous production of prostamides and their biochemical precursors in corneal tissue has not yet been reported. In this study, we report the presence of anandamide, palmitoyl-, stearoyl-, α-linolenoyl docosahexaenoyl-, linoleoyl-, and oleoyl-ethanolamines in rabbit cornea, and following treatment with anandamide, the formation of PGF2α-EA, PGE2-EA,  by corneal extracts (all analyzed by LC/ESI-MS/MS). A number of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines, precursors of anandamide and other fatty acyl ethanolamines, were also identified in corneal lipid extracts using ESI-MS/MS. These findings suggest that the prostamide and fatty acid ethanolamine  are operational in the cornea and may provide valuable insight into corneal physiology and their potential influence on adjacent tissues and the aqueous humor.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30858059>Prostaglandin D-ethanolamide induces skin cancer apoptosis by suppressing the activity of cellular antioxidants.</a></h2><p>The combined incidence of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is greater than the incidence of all other malignancies in the US. Previously, we demonstrated that the endocannabinoid, arachidonoyl-ethanolamide (AEA), was a potent inducer of apoptosis in NMSC. The  of AEA to the prostaglandin, PGD-EA, was a prerequisite for AEA cytotoxicity. However, the mechanism of PGD-EA cell death has not been clearly defined. In the present study, we report that PGD-EA causes apoptosis in melanoma and NMSC cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that PGD-EA was dehydrated to three J-series prostaglandins; PGJ-EA, ΔPGJ-EA, and 15deoxy,Δ12,14 PGJ-EA. PGD-EA inhibited the antioxidant activity of glutathione and thioredoxin which then caused oxidative stress. This increase in oxidative stress was accompanied by the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis. The effect of PGD-EA was independent of DP1, DP2, and PPARγ receptors suggesting that PGD-EA cytotoxicity was mediated by its  product, 15dPGJ-EA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
