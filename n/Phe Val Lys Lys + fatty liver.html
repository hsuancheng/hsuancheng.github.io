<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2900138>Identification by amino acid sequencing of three major regulatory phosphorylation sites on rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase.</a></h2><p>We have examined the sites phosphorylated on acetyl-CoA carboxylase by three protein kinases which have been shown to inactivate the enzyme, i.e. cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase-2 (ACK2, purified from rat mammary gland) and the AMP-activated protein kinase (formerly called acetyl-CoA carboxylase kinase-3, purified from rat ). Each protein kinase phosphorylates two out of three sites (termed 1-3) which have been established by amino acid sequencing. The two sites phosphorylated by each kinase can be recovered on separate peptides, TC1 and TC2, derived by combined digestion of the native enzyme by trypsin and chymotrypsin: TC1 = Ser-2Ser(P)-Met-3Ser(P)-Gly-Leu; TC2 = Arg-Met-1Ser(P)-- Cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates sites 1 and 2 exclusively, whereas the AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylates sites 1 and 3, plus at least one other minor site. ACK2 phosphorylates site 1 and, more slowly, an unidentified site(s) within TC1. We have also established the structures of the single major phosphopeptides (T1 and C1 respectively) which are recovered by HPLC after acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase is digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin alone. T1 is related to TC1, and has the structure: Ser-Ser(P)-Met-Ser-Gly-Leu-His-Leu--. C1 is identical with TC2. We have carried out studies on the correlation of the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase with the occupancy of sites 1, 2 and 3 during phosphorylation by each of the three protein kinases. The results suggest that phosphorylation of site 3 is primarily responsible for the large decrease in Vmax produced by the AMP-activated protein kinase, while phosphorylation of site 1 may be primarily responsible for the increase in A0.5 for citrate and more modest depression of Vmax produced by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and ACK2. Our results emphasize that amino acid sequence information is essential in the unequivocal interpretation of data from phosphopeptide mapping experiments and allow a more complete interpretation of previous data on phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in intact cells. They also open the way to experiments which could establish the physiological roles of these protein kinases in the control of  acid synthesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2498303>The NH2-terminal structures of human and rat  microsomal NADH-cytochrome b5 reductases.</a></h2><p>Detergent-solubilized NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was purified from human  microsomes. Both the purified enzyme and the membrane-binding domain isolated from the purified enzyme were determined to be modified at the NH2-terminal amino acid, glycine, by myristic acid in an amide form. Myristic acid was identified as a methyl ester by gas chromatography after the acid methanolysis of the purified enzyme and the NH2-terminal peptide. The NH2-terminal structure of the membrane-binding domain was determined to be CH3(CH2)12-CO-Gly-Ala-Gln-Leu-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gly-His-Met--Leu--Pro-Va l- Trp--Leu-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Leu-Met-. The sequence from Leu-7 to -24 completely coincided with that deduced from the base sequence of complementary DNA (cDNA) from human placenta (Yubisui, T. et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. 84, 3609-3613). The NH2-terminal structure of the detergent-solubilized enzyme from rat  microsomes was also analyzed for comparison with that of human  microsomal enzyme. The NH2-terminal myristic acid and the first 7 amino acids of the membrane-binding domains of human, rat, and steer  microsomal enzymes are completely conserved, and more than 70% homology was observed over the whole membrane-binding domains, implying the importance of the conserved structure as an anchor of the enzyme to the membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19528608>Effect of abomasal glucose infusion on splanchnic amino acid metabolism in periparturient dairy cows.</a></h2><p>Six Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulas and permanent indwelling catheters in the portal vein, hepatic vein, mesenteric vein, and an artery were used to study the effects of abomasal glucose infusion on splanchnic AA metabolism. The experimental design was a split plot, with cow as the whole plot, treatment as the whole-plot factor and days in milk (DIM) as the subplot factor. Cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control or infusion of 1,500 g/d of glucose into the abomasum from the day of calving to 29 DIM. Cows were sampled prepartum and at 4, 15, and 29 DIM. Postpartum dry matter intake increased at a lower rate with infusion compared with the control. Arterial concentrations of all essential AA (EAA) were lower with infusion compared with the control. Net portal fluxes of His, Ile, Leu, , Met, , Thr, , Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr were lower with infusion compared with the control and the net portal fluxes of these AA showed positive correlations with dry matter intake, whereas the net portal fluxes of Asp, Glu, and Gln were unaffected by treatment. Net hepatic fluxes of EAA were not affected by treatment but increased as lactation progressed with both treatments. On a net basis, all EAA were removed by the  prepartum and at 4 DIM, whereas Met, , and Thr were the only EAA being removed at 29 DIM. Except for Ala, AA removed by the  might be used primarily for noncatabolic processes, as exemplified by the 16% of hepatic Gly uptake accounted for as urinary hippurate. The measured hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors (glucogenic AA, volatile  acids, lactate, and glycerol) accounted for 50 to 90% of the hepatic release of glucose. The hepatic urea output accounted for more than 100% of the hepatic ureagenic precursor uptake, indicating that the glucogenic precursors unaccounted for are nonnitrogen-containing compounds. In conclusion, an increased exogenous glucose supply to the small intestine did not seem to affect the amount of EAA and non-EAA available for peripheral tissues in early lactation, and the study did not indicate an AA-sparing effect of small intestinal glucose absorption. In periparturient dairy cows, hepatic catabolism of AA was not driven by the increased whole-body demand for glucose, and Ala was the only AA that contributed substantially to hepatic gluconeogenesis. In very early lactation, the supply of EAA might be of greater concern than the supply of glucogenic substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3699445>Effects of chronic ethanol ingestion on circulating metabolites and  composition in the lactating rat.</a></h2><p>A model of chronic ethanol administration has been used to study the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the general metabolism of lactating rats on day 15 after delivery. We have studied the effects of ethanol on calories, food and fluid intake, body weight, circulating parameters such as glucose, glycerol, free  acids (FFA), triacylglycerols (TAG), amino acids (AA), ketone bodies, insulin and ethanol levels and  composition. Chronic ethanol consumption markedly increases the levels of circulating B-OH-butyrate (B-OB-B), glycerol and FFA, while those of acetoacetate (AcAc), glucose, insulin and TAG remain constant. With the only exception of an increase in Glu + Gln levels, plasma AA decrease in the alcohol-treated rats, the change being significant for Ala, Pro, , Arg, ,  and 4-OH-proline. In the  ethanol treatment causes an increment in TAG concentration and a decrease in glycogen content. In conclusion, chronic ethanol consumption produces notable alterations in the metabolism of lactating rats, which may diminish the efficiency of lactation, influencing milk production and, therefore, the pups' development.</p></html>
