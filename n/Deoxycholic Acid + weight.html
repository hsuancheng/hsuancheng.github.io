Here, we summarize the effect of obesity on NASH and how it has a cascading effect on cardiovascular dysfunction. We also review the current and emerging treatment options for NASH.The link between NASH and cardiac dysfunction has been further delineated in recent studies demonstrating endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and increased coronary artery calcification in patients with known NASH. Standard treatment of obesity with lifestyle interventions including diet, exercise, and behavioral modification has been shown to improve NASH as well as reduce cardiovascular dysfunction. In addition to FDA-approved drugs like vitamin E and pioglitazone, several agents including NGM282, obeticholic , elafibranor, and liraglutide are currently being investigated for their therapeutic potential in NASH. Recent studies show that bariatric surgery results in significant improvement or resolution of NASH.Obesity is a major factor in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to steatohepatitis. Patients with NAFLD have a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk. For biopsy-proven NASH, vitamin E and pioglitazone are the recommended medical treatments in addition to lifestyle modification.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797574>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell donors with a high  mass index display elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress and are functionally impaired.</a></h2><p>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are promising candidates for regenerative medicine purposes. The effect of obesity on the function of BM-MSCs is currently unknown. Here, we assessed how obesity affects the function of BM-MSCs and the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) therein. BM-MSCs were obtained from healthy donors with a normal (<25) or high (>30)  mass index (BMI). High-BMI BM-MSCs displayed severely impaired osteogenic and diminished adipogenic differentiation, decreased proliferation rates, increased senescence, and elevated expression of ER stress-related genes ATF4 and CHOP. Suppression of ER stress using tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) resulted in partial recovery of osteogenic differentiation capacity, with a significant increase in the expression of ALPL and improvement in the UPR. These data indicate that BMI is important during the selection of BM-MSC donors for regenerative medicine purposes and that application of high-BMI BM-MSCs with TUDCA or 4-PBA may improve stem cell function. However, whether this improvement can be translated into an in vivo clinical advantage remains to be assessed.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669332>Spirulina Liquid Extract Protects against Fibrosis Related to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Increases Ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by an excess of lipids and oxidative stress in the liver. Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract NASH development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, lipid metabolism, and gallbladder bile  profile. WDS2 gained significantly less  than WD. Liver -to- ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic  and β-muricholic . Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of SLE against WD induced NASH that is related to less inflammation and oxidative stress, a preserved glucose tolerance, and less hepatotoxic bile  profile.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28978875>Agaro-Oligosaccharides Regulate Gut Microbiota and Adipose Tissue Accumulation in Mice.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota are deeply associated with the prevalence of obesity. Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue  and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content  were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (, lithocholic , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue . The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue . Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AGO-received mice is still unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AGO administration affects the gut microbial composition and inhibits obesity in mice.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29745989>Potential Functional Byproducts from Guava Purée Processing.</a></h2><p>The valorization of guava waste requires compositional and functional studies.

We analyzed the chemical composition and quantified the prebiotic activity score and selected carbohydrates; we also determined the water holding (WHC), oil holding (OHC), cation exchange capacities, bile  binding, and glucose dialysis retardation (GDR) of the solid fraction and the antioxidative and α-amylase inhibitory capacities (AIC) of the ethanolic extract. Refiner contained 7.7% lipid, 7.08% protein and a relatively high phytate content; it had a high prebiotic activity score and possessed the highest binding capacity with . Siever contained high levels of low molecular  carbohydrates and total tannin but relatively low crude fiber and cellulose contents. It had the highest binding with chenodeoxycholic  (74.8%), and exhibited the highest 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity. Decanter was rich in cellulose and had a high prebiotic activity score. The WHC and OHC values of decanter were within a narrow range and also exhibited the highest binding with cholic  (86.6%), and the highest values of GDR and AIC. The refiner waste could be included in animal feed but requires further processing to reduce the high phytate levels. All three guava byproducts had the potential to be a source of antioxidant dietary fiber (DF), a finding that warrants further in vivo study.To differing extents, the guava byproducts exhibited useful physicochemical binding properties and so possessed the potential for health-promoting activity. These byproducts could also be upgraded to other marketable products so the manufacturers of processed guava might be able to develop their businesses sustainably by making better use of them.© 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141297>Saxagliptin alters bile  profiles and yields metabolic benefits in drug-naïve overweight or obese type 2 diabetes patient.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic benefits of saxagliptin and its effects on serum bile acids (BAs) in normal  and overweight/obese drug-naïve type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients.In all, 282 drug-naïve T2D patients (123 normal  [NW], with  mass index [BMI] between 19.0 and <25.0 kg/m ; 159 overweight/obese [OW/OB], with BMI ≥25.0 kg/m ) were enrolled in the study and treated with saxagliptin 5 mg daily for 24 weeks.

Recent studies have highlighted that disrupted bile  metabolism is associated with metabolism disorders such as dyslipidaemia, intestinal chronic inflammatory diseases and obesity. In particular, type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with quantitative and qualitative modifications in bile  metabolism. Bile acids bind and modulate the activity of transmembrane and nuclear receptors (NR). Among these receptors, the G-protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5) and the NR farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are implicated in the regulation of bile , lipid, glucose and energy homeostasis. The role of these receptors in the intestine in energy metabolism regulation has been recently highlighted. More precisely, recent studies have shown that FXR is important for glucose homeostasis in particular in metabolic disorders such as T2D and obesity.

Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying obesity was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of obesity, as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation of receptor sensitivity, obesity may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27283098>High performance liquid chromatography-charged aerosol detection applying an inverse gradient for quantification of rhamnolipid biosurfactants.</a></h2><p>A method using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to charged-aerosol detection (HPLC-CAD) was developed for the quantification of rhamnolipid biosurfactants. Qualitative sample composition was determined by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The relative quantification of different derivatives of rhamnolipids including di-rhamnolipids, mono-rhamnolipids, and their precursors 3-(3-hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acids (HAAs) differed for two compared LC-MS instruments and revealed instrument dependent responses. Our here reported HPLC-CAD method provides uniform response. An inverse gradient was applied for the absolute quantification of rhamnolipid congeners to account for the detector's dependency on the solvent composition. The CAD produces a uniform response not only for the analytes but also for structurally different (nonvolatile) compounds. It was demonstrated that n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside or  can be used as alternative standards. The method of HPLC-ultra violet (UV) detection after a derivatization of rhamnolipids and HAAs to their corresponding phenacyl esters confirmed the obtained results but required additional, laborious sample preparation steps. Sensitivity determined as limit of detection and limit of quantification for four mono-rhamnolipids was in the range of 0.3-1.0 and 1.2-2.0μg/mL, respectively, for HPLC-CAD and 0.4 and 1.5μg/mL, respectively, for HPLC-UV. Linearity for HPLC-CAD was at least 0.996 (R(2)) in the calibrated range of about 1-200μg/mL. Hence, the here presented HPLC-CAD method allows absolute quantification of rhamnolipids and derivatives.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a new amphiphilic bifunctional pullulan derivative (named as PDP) synthesized by grafting lipophilic desoxycholic  and low-molecular  (1kDa) branched polyethylenimine onto the backbone of pullulan was evaluated as a nano-carrier for the co-delivery of drug and gene for potential cancer therapy. PDP exhibited good blood compatibility and low cytotoxicity in the hemolysis and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, respectively. By self-assembly process, the amphiphilic PDP polymer formed cationic core-shell nanomicelles in aqueous solution with an average diameter of 160.8nm and a zeta potential of approximate 28mV. The PDP micelles had relative higher drug encapsulation efficiency (84.05%) and loading capacity (7.64%) for doxorubicin (DOX), an effective anti-tumor drug, demonstrating sustained drug release profile and good DNA-binding ability. The flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that PDP/DOX micelles could be successfully internalized by MCF-7 cells, and presenting higher cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells than that of free DOX. Furthermore, PDP micelles could efficiently transport tumor suppressor gene p53 into MCF-7 cells, and the expressed exogenous p53 protein induced MCF-7 cells to die. More excitedly, in comparison with single DOX or p53 delivery, the co-delivery of DOX and gene p53 using PDP micelles displayed higher cytotoxicity, induced higher apoptosis rate of tumor cells and blocked more effectively the migration of cancer cells in vitro. In tumor-bearing mice, co-delivery of DOX and p53 also exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy as compared with single delivery of DOX or p53 alone. In summary, these results demonstrated that it is highly promising to use cationic PDP micelles for effectively co-delivering functional gene and chemotherapeutic agent, and thus improving antitumor efficacy and systemic toxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A fundamental part of that research involves devising a method for purifying samples with good reproducibility; the samples obtained need to be stable and their constituents need to retain the same structure and functions they possess when in mitochondrial membranes. Submitochondrial bovine heart particles were isolated using differential centrifugation to adjust to a membrane concentration of 46.0% (w/v) or 31.5% (w/v) based on . After 0.7% (w/v) , 0.4% (w/v) decyl maltoside, and 7.2% (w/v) potassium chloride were added to the mitochondrial membranes, those membranes were solubilized. At a membrane concentration of 46%, complex V was selectively solubilized, whereas at a concentration of 31.5% (w/v), complexes I and III were solubilized. Two steps-sucrose density gradient centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography on a POROS HQ 20 μm column-enabled selective purification of samples that retained their structure and functions. These two steps enabled complexes I, III, and V to be purified in two days with a high yield. Complexes I, III, and V were stabilized with n-decyl-β-D-maltoside. A total of 200 mg-300 mg of those complexes from one bovine heart (1.1 kg muscle) was purified with good reproducibility, and the complexes retained the same functions they possessed while in mitochondrial membranes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

They can be usually improved by steroid therapy. Actinomycosis is a chronic, suppurative, granulomatous infection, for which immune suppression is a predisposing factor. It can also mimic malignant tumors.A 67-year-old man presented with mild abdominal discomfort and a 5-kg  loss for 3 months. Initially, he visited another hospital and was treated with antibiotics under the assumption of a liver abscess. Symptom was not resolved.He diagnosed as having an IgG4-related pseudotumor of the right lobe of the liver after liver biopsy. Despite 2 months of steroid therapy, the liver mass was aggravated and invaded the right lung, as observed on follow-up computed tomography scan.We performed en bloc resection of the tumor under the assumption that it was a malignant tumor.The pathology of the tumor was revealed as actinomycotic colonies and IgG4-positive plasma cells of the liver. He recovered well and was discharged with ursodeoxycholic  tablet for 14 days. After 3 months, he underwent postoperative follow-up CT and there was no remarkable finding in remnant left hepatic lobe.Hepatic actinomycosis and IgG4-related pseudotumors of the liver are both difficult to diagnose. As in our patient, combined diseases are more difficult to diagnose and to determine the optimal treatment. Since immunosuppression therapy of autoimmune diseases can cause and aggravate infection, management must be approached carefully. We can learn that various possibilities must be considered before diagnosing and treating a hepatic mass.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397356>Gut microbiota and intestinal FXR mediate the clinical benefits of metformin.</a></h2><p>The anti-hyperglycemic effect of metformin is believed to be caused by its direct action on signaling processes in hepatocytes, leading to lower hepatic gluconeogenesis. Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut microbiota community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut microbiota. However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts in part through a B. fragilis-GUDCA-intestinal FXR axis to improve metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27727520>The therapeutic landscape of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, and may be associated with liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis and its complications. A pharmacological approach is necessary to treat NASH because of failure to change dietary habits and lifestyle in most patients. Insulin resistance with an increased release of free fatty acids, oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory cytokines seem to be key features for disease progression. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and antioxidant agents, such as vitamin E, were the first pharmacological options to be evaluated for NASH. In recent years, several new molecules that target different pathways related to NASH pathogenesis, such as liver metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, have been developed. Obeticholic  (INT-747) and elafibranor (GFT-505) have provided promising results in phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and they are being evaluated in ongoing phase III studies. Most of the potential treatments for NASH are under investigation in phase II studies, with some at phase I. This diversity in possible treatments calls for a better understanding of NASH in order to enrich trial populations with patients more susceptible to progress and to respond. This manuscript aims to review the pharmacological NASH treatment landscape.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the  and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed.

Based on the results, the number of hydroxyl groups attached to the steroidal backbone plays a major role in the gelation, although the nature of the aliphatic side chain also modulates the gelation abilities. Of the 50 gel systems studied, 35 are based on lithocholic  and 15 on cholic  derivatives. The  derivatives did not form any gels. The gelation occurred primarily in aromatic solvents and the gels manifested typical fibrous or spherical morphologies.

Adipose tissue is not just a fat depot but also an endocrine organ, which cross-talks with other tissue types and organs throughout the , like liver, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Its secreted molecules have an influence on the nervous, immune, and vascular system, thus adipose tissue plays an important role in the regulation of whole- homeostasis. Proteomic analysis of adipose tissue is challenging due to the extremely high lipid content and a variety of different cell types included. We investigated the influence of different detergents to the lysis buffer and compared commonly used methods like protein precipitation and filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) with workflows involving  labile or precipitable surfactants.

Its efficacy in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still under debate. Here, we aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms of UDCA in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study, liver and serum samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese NAFLD-patients were analysed. Patients received UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) or no treatment 3 weeks before samples were obtained during bariatric surgery.Patients treated with UDCA displayed higher scoring of steatosis (S), activity (A) and fibrosis (F), the so called SAF-scoring. UDCA partially disrupted ER homeostasis by inducing the expression of the ER stress markers CHOP and GRP78. However, ERDJ4 and sXBP1 levels were unaffected. Enhanced CHOP expression, a suggested pro-apoptotic trigger, failed to induce apoptosis via BAK and BAX in the UDCA treated group. Potentially pro-apoptotic miR-34a was reduced in the vesicle-free fraction in serum but not in liver after UDCA treatment. Thiobarbituric  reactive substances, 4-hydroxynonenal and mRNA levels of several oxidative stress indicators remained unchanged after UDCA treatment.Our data suggest that UDCA treatment has ambivalent effects in NAFLD patients. While increased SAF-scores and elevated CHOP levels may be disadvantageous in the UDCA treated cohort, UDCA's cytoprotective properties potentially changed the apoptotic threshold as reflected by absent induction of pro-apoptotic triggers.

Total and glycine-amidated BAs increase after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and correlate to improved metabolic disease. No specific bile  subtype has been shown conclusively to mediate the  loss effect. Therefore, the objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the comprehensive changes in meal-stimulated BAs after SG and determine if a specific change in the BA profile correlates to the early  loss response.Patients were prospectively enrolled at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who were undergoing a SG for treatment of morbid obesity. Primary and secondary plasma bile acids and their amidated (glycine, G-, or taurine, T-) subtypes were measured at fasting, 30 and 60 min after a liquid meal performed pre-op, and at 6 and 12 weeks post-op. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the hour meal test for each bile  subtype. BAs that were significantly increased post-op were correlated to  mass index (BMI) loss.Total BA AUC was significantly increased at 6 (p < 0.01) and 12 weeks post-op (p < 0.01) compared to pre-operative values. The increase in total BA AUC was due to a statistically significant increase in G-BAs. Nine different BA AUC subtypes were significantly increased at both 6 and 12 weeks post-op. Increased total and G-chenodeoxycholic  AUC was significantly correlated to the 6 week BMI loss (p = 0.03). Increased G-hyocholic  was significantly correlated to increased  loss at both 6 (p = 0.05) and 12 weeks (p = 0.006).SG induced an early and persistent post-prandial surge in multiple bile  subtypes. Increased G-hyocholic consistently correlated with greater early BMI loss.

Despite intensive study, no effective simple treatment for these conditions exists. As such, the need for go-to drugs is serious. Bile acids (BAs) present the possibility of reversing these problems, as various in vivo studies and clinical trials have shown significant effects with regard to  and obesity reduction, insulin sensitivity restoration and cardiovascular improvements. However, the mechanism of action of BA-induced metabolic improvement has yet to be fully established. The currently most accepted model involves non-shivering thermogenesis for energy waste, but this is disputed. As such, we propose to determine whether the BA chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) can exert anti-obesogenic effects in vitro, independent of thermogenic brown adipose tissue activation. By exposing differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes to high glucose and CDCA, we demonstrate that this BA has anti-obesity effects in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of metabolic pathways clearly indicates an improvement in metabolic status, as these cells become more oxidative rather than glycolytic, which may be associated with an increase in fatty  oxidation. Our work demonstrates that CDCA-induced metabolic alterations occur in white and brown adipocytes and are not totally dependent on endocrine/nervous system signaling, as thought until now. Furthermore, future exploration of the mechanisms behind these effects will undoubtedly reveal interesting targets for clinical modulation.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692197>The Asia-Pacific Working Party on Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease guidelines 2017-Part 2: Management and special groups.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513725>Assessment of serum bile  profiles as biomarkers of liver injury and liver disease in humans.</a></h2><p>To assess the potential of individual bile acids (IBA) and their profiles as mechanistic biomarkers of liver injury for humans in real world situations, we interrogated samples collected under minimum controlled conditions (ie subjects were not fasted).

Patients will undergo a preoperative ultrasound and randomization will be stratified for pre-existing gallstones and for type of surgery. The intervention group will receive UDCA 900 mg once daily for six months. The placebo group will receive similar-looking placebo tablets. The primary endpoint is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Secondary endpoints consist of the development of gallstones on ultrasound at 24 months, number of cholecystectomies, side-effects of UDCA and quality of life.

OCA pretreatment protected against LPS-induced fetal death. In addition, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced reduction of fetal  and crown-rump length. Additional experiments showed that OCA inhibited LPS-evoked TNF-α in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. Moreover, OCA significantly attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of placental proinflammatory genes including Tnf-α, Il-1β, IL-6, Il-12, Mip-2, Kc, and Mcp-1 By contrast, OCA elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and placenta.

Here we investigated whether TGR5-mTORC1 signaling mediates the RYGB-induced alteration in GLP-1 production in mice and human beings.Circulating bile acids, TGR5-mTORC1 signaling, GLP-1 synthesis and secretion were determined in lean or obese male C57BL/6 mice with or without RYGB operation, as well as in normal glycemic subjects, obese patients with type 2 diabetes before and after RYGB.Positive relationships were observed among circulating bile acids, ileal mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and GLP-1 during changes in energy status in the present study. RYGB increased circulating bile acids, ileal Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and mTORC1 signaling activity, as well as GLP-1 production in both mice and human subjects. Inhibition of ileal mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the stimulation of bile  secretion, TGR5 expression and GLP-1 synthesis induced by RYGB in lean and diet-induced obese mice. GLP-1 production and ileal TGR5-mTORC1 signaling were positively correlated with plasma  (DCA) in mice. Treatment of STC-1 cells with DCA stimulated the production of GLP-1. This effect was associated with a significant enhancement of TGR5-mTORC1 signaling. siRNA knockdown of mTORC1 or TGR5 abolished the enhancement of GLP-1 synthesis induced by DCA. DCA increased interaction between mTOR-regulatory-associated protein of mechanistic target of rapamycin (Raptor) and TGR5 in STC-1 cells.-TGR5-mTORC1 signaling contributes to the up-regulation of GLP-1 production after RYGB.Copyright © 2018.

To enter a low energy state, misfolded proteins form aggregates, which are associated with many degenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have shown the use of low molecular  chemical chaperones to be an effective method of reducing protein aggregation in various cell types. This study demonstrates a novel non-biased assay to assess the molecular efficacy of these compounds at preventing protein misfolding and/or aggregation. This assay utilizes a thioflavin T fluorescent stain to provide a qualitative and quantitative measure of protein misfolding within cells. The functionality of this method was first assessed in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells treated with various endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers. Once established in the renal model system, we analyzed the ability of some known chemical chaperones to reduce ER stress. A total of five different compounds were selected: 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), docosahexaenoic  (DHA), tauroursodeoxycholic , trehalose, and glycerol. The dose-dependent effects of these compounds at reducing thapsigargin-induced ER stress was then analyzed, and used to determine their EC values. Of the chaperones, 4-PBA and DHA provided the greatest reduction of ER stress and did so at relatively low concentrations. Upon analyzing the efficiency of these compounds and their corresponding structures, it was determined that chaperones with a localized hydrophilic, polar end followed by a long hydrophobic chain, such as 4-PBA and DHA, were most effective at reducing ER stress. This study provides some insight into the use of low molecular  chemical chaperones and may serve as the first step towards developing new chaperones of greater potency thereby providing potential treatments for diseases caused by protein aggregation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Guidelines recommend initial treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate, but this drug has substantial side effects, a high cost, and limited availability. Itraconazole is available in oral form, is associated with fewer unacceptable side effects than amphotericin, and is widely used in place of amphotericin; however, clinical trials comparing these two treatments are lacking.In this open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned 440 HIV-infected adults who had talaromycosis, confirmed by either microscopy or culture, to receive either intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate (amphotericin) (219 patients), at a dose of 0.7 to 1.0 mg per kilogram of  per day, or itraconazole capsules (221 patients), at a dose of 600 mg per day for 3 days, followed by 400 mg per day, for 11 days; thereafter, all the patients received maintenance therapy with itraconazole. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at week 2. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at week 24, the time to clinical resolution of talaromycosis, early fungicidal activity, relapse of talaromycosis, development of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and the side-effect profile.The risk of death at week 2 was 6.5% in the amphotericin group and 7.4% in the itraconazole group (absolute risk difference, 0.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.9 to 5.6; P<0.001 for noninferiority); however, the risk of death at week 24 was 11.3% in the amphotericin group and 21.0% in the itraconazole group (absolute risk difference, 9.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 16.6; P=0.006). Treatment with amphotericin was associated with significantly faster clinical resolution and fungal clearance and significantly lower rates of relapse and IRIS than itraconazole. The patients who received amphotericin had significantly higher rates of infusion-related reactions, renal failure, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and anemia than patients in the itraconazole group.Amphotericin was superior to itraconazole as initial treatment for talaromycosis with respect to 6-month mortality, clinical response, and fungicidal activity.

As cholesterol is the precursor of BAs, we analyzed alterations of the entire BA metabolic pathway in response to a HF diet without the addition of cholesterol and BA in the diet. Additionally, we evaluated the relationships between BA metabolism and some disorders, such as plasma transaminase activities and glucose intolerance induced by the HF diet. Acclimated WKAH/HkmSlc male rats (3 wk old) were divided into two groups fed a control or the HF diet for 22 wk. Fasting blood glucose was measured during the experimental period, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed at week 21. As a result, ingestion of the HF diet selectively increased the concentration of taurocholic  in the bile and small intestinal contents as well as  in the large intestinal contents and feces. These results indicated a selective increase of 12α-hydroxylated BA concentrations in response to the HF diet. Moreover, fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA concentration was positively correlated with cumulative energy intake, visceral adipose tissue , and glucose intolerance. The present study suggests that fecal 12α-hydroxylated BA is a non-invasive marker that can detect the early phase of glucose intolerance.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27811171>Fibroblast growth factor 21 reverses suppression of adiponectin expression via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose tissue of obese mice.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has recently emerged as a novel endocrine hormone involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the exact mechanisms whereby FGF21 mediates insulin sensitivity remain not fully understood. In the present study, FGF21was administrated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and tunicamycin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and metabolic parameters, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicators, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting. The administration of FGF21 in obese mice reduced , blood glucose and serum insulin, and increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in alleviation of insulin resistance. Meanwhile, FGF21 treatment reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress in adipose tissue of obese mice. Additionally, suppression of ER stress via the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  increased adiponectin expression and improved insulin resistance in obese mice and in tunicamycin-induced adipocytes. In conclusion, our results showed that the administration of FGF21 reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress under the condition of insulin resistance, demonstrating the causative role of ER stress in downregulating adiponectin levels.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804232>Obeticholic  improves adipose morphometry and inflammation and reduces steatosis in dietary but not metabolic obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the outcome of interactions between overnutrition, energy metabolism, and adipose function.

This study therefore investigated OCA effects in Wt mice, which develop obesity with atherogenic dietary feeding, and appetite-dysregulated, Alms1 mutant foz/foz mice fed the same diet, which develop metabolic obesity and diabetes.OCA (1 mg/kg) was administered orally to female foz/foz mice and Wt littermates from weaning until 28 weeks. Adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and fatty liver pathology were studied. Experiments were repeated with OCA 10 mg/kg.OCA reduced  and hepatic lipids and improved glucose disposal only in Wt mice. OCA limited Wt adipose expansion, altered morphometry in favor of small adipocytes, enhanced expression of genes indicating adipose browning, and reduced crown-like structure number in visceral adipose tissue. foz/foz mice showed more crown-like structures in all compartments; OCA failed to alter adipose morphometry, browning, inflammation, or improve NASH severity, even at 10 mg/kg.OCA improved adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and steatosis in a milder metabolic phenotype but failed to improve these factors in morbidly obese diabetic mice.

Prior to treatment, all mice underwent liver biopsy for confirmation and stratification of liver steatosis and fibrosis, using the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis staging system. The mice were kept on the diet and received vehicle, liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg, SC, BID), obeticholic  (OCA, 30 mg/kg PO, QD), or elafibranor (30 mg/kg PO, QD) for eight weeks. Within-subject comparisons were performed on changes in steatosis, inflammation, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis scores. In addition, compound effects were evaluated by quantitative liver histology, including percent fractional area of liver fat, galectin-3, and collagen 1a1.Liraglutide and elafibranor, but not OCA, reduced  in both models. Liraglutide improved steatosis scores in DIO-NASH mice only. Elafibranor and OCA reduced histopathological scores of hepatic steatosis and inflammation in both models, but only elafibranor reduced fibrosis severity. Liraglutide and OCA reduced total liver fat, collagen 1a1, and galectin-3 content, driven by significant reductions in liver . The individual drug effects on NASH histological endpoints were supported by global gene expression (RNA sequencing) and liver lipid biochemistry.DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models show distinct treatment effects of liraglutide, OCA, and elafibranor, being in general agreement with corresponding findings in clinical trials for NASH. The present data therefore further supports the clinical translatability and utility of DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models of NASH for probing the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for NASH.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29059144>Commentary on ATX-101 ( Injection) for Paradoxical Adipose Hyperplasia Secondary to Cryolipolysis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601882>Microbial metabolite  controls Clostridium perfringens-induced chicken necrotic enteritis through attenuating inflammatory cyclooxygenase signaling.</a></h2><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile   (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and  (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089371>FXR/TGR5 Dual Agonist Prevents Progression of Nephropathy in Diabetes and Obesity.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5. We have shown that FXR and TGR5 have renoprotective roles in diabetes- and obesity-related kidney disease. Here, we determined whether these effects are mediated through differential or synergistic signaling pathways. We administered the FXR/TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 to DBA/2J mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, db/db mice with type 2 diabetes, and C57BL/6J mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity. We also examined the individual effects of the selective FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 in diabetic mice. The FXR agonist OCA and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 modulated distinct renal signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment of diabetic DBA/2J and db/db mice with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 improved proteinuria and prevented podocyte injury, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. INT-767 exerted coordinated effects on multiple pathways, including stimulation of a signaling cascade involving AMP-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, PGC-1, sirtuin 3, estrogen-related receptor-, and Nrf-1; inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress; and inhibition of enhanced renal fatty  and cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, in mice with diet-induced obesity, INT-767 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and kidney fibrosis determined by second harmonic imaging microscopy. These results identify the renal signaling pathways regulated by FXR and TGR5, which may be promising targets for the treatment of nephropathy in diabetes and obesity.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458053>Circulating bile acids in healthy adults respond differently to a dietary pattern characterized by whole grains, legumes and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars: A randomized, controlled, crossover feeding study.</a></h2><p>The effects of diets high in refined grains on biliary and colonic bile acids have been investigated extensively. However, the effects of diets high in whole versus refined grains on circulating bile acids, which can influence glucose homeostasis and inflammation through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5), have not been studied.We conducted a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled crossover feeding trial () in 80 healthy adults (40 women/40 men, age 18-45 years) from the greater Seattle Area, half of which were normal  (BMI 18.5-25.0 kg/m) and half overweight to obese (BMI 28.0-39.9 kg/m). Participants consumed two four-week controlled diets in randomized order: 1) a whole grain diet (WG diet), designed to be low in glycemic load (GL), high in whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables, and 2) a refined grain diet (RG diet), designed to be high GL, high in refined grains and added sugars, separated by a four-week washout period. Quantitative targeted analysis of 55 bile  species in fasting plasma was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, and CRP were measured in fasting serum. Linear mixed models were used to test the effects of diet on bile  concentrations, and determine the association between plasma bile  concentrations and HOMA-IR and CRP. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was used to control for multiple testing.A total of 29 plasma bile acids were reliably detected and retained for analysis. Taurolithocholic  (TLCA), taurocholic  (TCA) and glycocholic  (GCA) were statistically significantly higher after the WG compared to the RG diet (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant differences by BMI or sex.

When stratifying by BMI, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), cholic  (CA), UDCA, 5β-cholanic -3β, , and total, 12α-hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile  groups were significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR among overweight to obese individuals (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by sex, GCA, CDCA, TCA, CA, UDCA, GDCA, glycolithocholic  (GLCA), total, primary, 12α‑hydroxylated, and glycine-conjugated bile acids were significantly associated with HOMA-IR among women, and CDCA, GDCA, and GLCA were significantly associated among men (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant associations between bile acids and CRP.Diets with comparable macronutrient and energy composition, but differing in carbohydrate source, affected fasting plasma bile acids differently. Specifically, a diet characterized by whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars led to modest increases in concentrations of TLCA, TCA and GCA, ligands for FXR and TGR5, which may have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth , glucose intolerance, obesity, and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high-fat diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and microbiota composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced obesity in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting insulin, and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal microbiota correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with resistance to the -lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation. Our findings suggest that BA metabolism may be a previously unrecognized contributor to developmentally programmed diabetes risk.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29944388>β-Klotho deficiency shifts the gut-liver bile  axis and induces hepatic alterations in mice.</a></h2><p>β-Klotho (encoded by Klb) is an obligate coreceptor, mediating both fibroblast growth factor (FGF)15 and FGF21 signaling. Klb mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed (increased) bile  (BA) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, fed a chow diet focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived , classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity through direct action (mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms (mediating FGF15 signaling that maintains BA level and composition).</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315087>Molecular Properties of Guar Gum and Pectin Modify Cecal Bile Acids, Microbiota, and Plasma Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein in Rats.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) act as signaling molecules in various physiological processes, and are related to colonic microbiota composition as well as to different types of dietary fat and fiber. This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles, microbiota composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular- (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high-fat diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbiota composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels, microbiota composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high-fat diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and ursodeoxycholic acids as well as α-, β-, and ω-muricholic acids to a greater extent than other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal - and hyodeoxycholic  were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ω-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF32. These results indicate that the molecular properties of guar gum and pectin are important for their ability to modulate cecal BA formation, gut microbiota composition, and high-fat diet induced inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29333665>Clinical and metabolic effects associated with  changes and obeticholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>In a 72-week, randomised controlled trial of obeticholic  (OCA) in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), OCA was superior to placebo in improving serum ALT levels and liver histology.

ALT levels also improved in those with vs without  loss in OCA- (-43 vs -34 U/L, P = 0.12) and placebo-treated patients (-29 vs -10 U/L, P = 0.02). However, among those who lost , OCA was associated with opposite effects from placebo on changes in alkaline phosphatase (+21 vs -12 U/L, P<0.001), total (+13 vs -14 mg/dL, P = 0.02) and LDL cholesterol (+18 vs -12 mg/dL, P = 0.01), and HbA1c (+0.1 vs -0.4%, P = 0.01).OCA leads to  loss in up to 44% of patients with NASH, and OCA therapy and  loss have additive benefits on serum aminotransferases and histology. However, favourable effects of  loss on alkaline phosphatase, lipids and blood glucose seen in placebo-treated patients were absent or reversed on OCA treatment. These findings stress the importance of assessing concomitant metabolic effects of new therapies of NASH.

Specifically, RS has beneficial effects on of the glycemic index, diabetes, cholesterol levels, and  management. However, the effects of once-daily intake of RS on postprandial hypertriglyceridemia remain poorly characterized. In this study, the effects of a single administration of cornstarch-derived RS on postprandial increases in blood triglyceride levels were investigated in rats using oral fat tolerance/loading tests. Following the administration of lipid meals, increases in serum triglycerides levels were significantly reduced in rats fed corn oil containing 500mg/mL RS. Moreover, fecal lipid volumes and wet  following lipid meals were significantly greater in rats fed corn oil containing 500mg/mL RS than in the corn oil only group, confirming the inhibition of dietary fat absorption. Finally, a significant positive correlation was observed between fecal lipid contents and wet  in rats administered RS. These results suggest that RS intake with dietary fats induces defecation and confirm results of recent reports on the health-promoting potential of once-daily RS intake.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to  fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice.GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut microbiota of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut microbiota. In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile  and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile  metabolism. Decreased cecal bile  levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut microbiota and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile  levels and specific bacteria of the order  (phylum ) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group). Following 10 weeks of tumor growth, all animals were sacrificed to collect total white adipose tissue (WAT). Luminex assays were performed for gut hormone and inflammation marker analysis. Bile acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in feces and serum. The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean  of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels. Moreover, the TG mice displayed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-10. Lithocholic , , and ursodeoxycholic  were significantly decreased in the stool of TG mice. Significant alterations of the intestinal microbiome were found in the ileal contents of the TG.The present study provides a first glimpse that human NB in a murine model induces tumor cachexia associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory parameters, as well as changes in the intestinal microbiota. Since the intestinal microbiome is known to contribute to the host's ability to harvest energy, a favorable modulation of the intestinal microbiome in tumor patients could potentially represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent tumor-associated cachexia.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202625>Gut Microbiota Promotes Obesity-Associated Liver Cancer through PGE-Mediated Suppression of Antitumor Immunity.</a></h2><p>Obesity increases the risk of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which obesity promotes HCC development are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota may influence liver diseases by transferring its metabolites and components. Here, we show that the hepatic translocation of obesity-induced lipoteichoic  (LTA), a Gram-positive gut microbial component, promotes HCC development by creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in obesity-associated HCC. The gut microbiota-driven COX2 pathway produced the lipid mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immunity, suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic NASH-associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27089995>Influence of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on plasma bile  profiles: a comparative study between rats, pigs and humans.</a></h2><p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the most widely used bariatric surgery procedure, which induces profound metabolic and physiological effects, such as substantial improvements in obesity, type 2 diabetes and their comorbidities. Increasing evidence identifies bile acids (BAs) as signaling molecules that contribute to the metabolic improvement after RYGBP. However, how and to what extent BAs mediate the metabolic effects of RYGBP still remains unclear and requires mechanism of action studies using preclinical models. In this study, we compared plasma BA profiles before and after RYGBP in two animal models, rats and pigs, with humans to evaluate their translational potential.Plasma BAs were profiled in rats, pigs and humans by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry before and after RYGBP.RYGBP increased baseline plasma total BA concentrations in humans and in the two animal models to a similar extent (∼3-fold increase), despite differences in presurgery BA levels and profiles between the models. However, qualitatively, RYGBP differently affected individual plasma BA species, with similar increases in some free species (cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (DCA)), different increases in glyco-conjugated species depending on the model and globally no increase in tauro-conjugated species whatever the model.The tested animal models share similar quantitative RYGBP-induced increases in peripheral blood BAs as humans, which render them useful for mechanistic studies. However, they also present qualitative differences in BA profiles, which may result in different signaling responses.

To pursue the possibility that the capsule of Francisella live vaccine strain (LVS) has a structurally unique lipid anchor, we have metabolically labeled Francisella with [14C]acetate to facilitate highly sensitive compositional analysis of capsule-associated lipids. Capsule was purified by two independent methods and yielded similar results. Autoradiographic and immunologic analysis confirmed that this purified material was largely devoid of low molecular  LPS and of the copious amounts of free lipid A that the Francisellae accumulate. Chemical hydrolysis yielded [14C]-labeled free fatty acids characteristic of Francisella lipid A but with a different molar ratio of 3-OH C18:0 to 3-OH C16:0 and different composition of non-hydroxylated fatty acids (mainly C14:0 rather than C16:0) than that of free Francisella lipid A. Mild  hydrolysis to induce selective cleavage of KDO-lipid A linkage yielded a [14C]-labeled product that partitioned during Bligh/Dyer extraction and migrated during thin-layer chromatography like lipid A. These findings suggest that the O-antigen capsule of Francisella contains a covalently linked and structurally distinct lipid A species.

Experiments in rodents with trained exercise have shown that exercise improves vascular function and reduces vascular inflammation by modulating the balance between nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. However, the upstream regulator of exercise-induced vascular benefits is unclear. We aimed to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in exercise-induced vascular functional improvement. We show that PPARδ is a crucial mediator for exercise to exert a beneficial effect on the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. In db/db mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas and flow-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries, whereas genetic ablation of Ppard abolished such improvements. Exercise induces AMPK activation and subsequent PPARδ activation, which help to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, thus increasing NO bioavailability in endothelial cells and vascular tissues. Chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric  and tauroursodeoxycholic  decrease ER stress and protect against endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice.

Circulating TMAO, glycocholic  and  levels were significantly increased in NAFLD patients. Endogenous circulating ethanol levels were increased in NASH patients in comparison to those in SS patients.These findings suggest that the intestine participates in the progression of NAFLD. Moreover, levels of certain circulating microbiota-related metabolites are associated with NAFLD severity and could be used as a "liquid biopsy" in the noninvasive diagnosis of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28508430>Combined Delivery of a Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Peptide and the Heme Oxygenase-1 Gene Using -Conjugated Polyethylenimine for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury.</a></h2><p>A ternary complex comprising plasmid DNA, lipopolysaccharide-binding peptide (LBP), and -conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI-DA) is prepared for combinational therapy of acute lung injury (ALI). The LBP is designed as an anti-inflammatory peptide based on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding domain of HMGB-1. In vitro cytokine assays show that LBP reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting LPS. PEI-DA is synthesized as the gene carrier by conjugation of  to low-molecular  polyethylenimine (2 kDa, PEI2k). PEI-DA has higher transfection efficiency than high-molecular  polyethylenimine (25 kDa, PEI25k). The ternary complex of an HO-1 plasmid (pHO-1), PEI-DA, and LBP is prepared as a combinational system to deliver the therapeutic gene and peptide. The transfection efficiency of the ternary complex is higher than that of the pHO-1/PEI-DA binary complex. The ternary complex also reduces TNF-α secretion in LPS-activated Raw264.7 macrophage cells. Administration of the ternary complex into the lungs of an animal ALI model by intratracheal injection induces HO-1 expression and reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines more efficiently than the pHO-1/PEI-DA binary complex or LBP alone. In addition, the ternary complex reduces inflammation in the lungs. Therefore, the pHO-1/PEI-DA/LBP ternary complex may be an effective treatment for ALI.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Plasma concentrations of bile acids (BAs) increase after RYGB, and BAs may act as molecular enhancers of GLP-1 secretion through activation of TGR5-receptors. We aimed to evaluate GLP-1 secretion after oral administration of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) (which are available for oral use) in RYGB-operated participants. Eleven participants (BMI 29.1 ± 1.2, age 37.0 ± 3.2 years, time from RYGB 32.3 ± 1.1 months,  loss after RYGB 37.0 ± 3.1 kg) were studied in a placebo-controlled, crossover-study. On three different days, participants ingested (1) placebo (water), (2) UDCA 750 mg, (3) CDCA 1250 mg (highest recommended doses). Oral intake of CDCA increased plasma concentrations of GLP-1, C-peptide, glucagon, peptide YY, neurotensin, total bile acids, and fibroblast growth factor 19 significantly compared with placebo (all  < 0.05 for peak and positive incremental area-under-the-curve (piAUC)). All plasma hormone concentrations were unaffected by UDCA Neither UDCA nor CDCA changed glucose, cholecystokinin or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentrations.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the most used medicine, but the efficacy and safety of UDCA remain uncertain. Several meta-analyses had been made to assess the effects of UDCA in ICP. However, the samples were not large enough to convince obstetricians to use UDCA. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects and safety of UDCA in patients with ICP, which included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Six databases were searched. The search terms were "ursodeoxycholicacid," "therapy," "management," "treatment," "intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy," "obstetric cholestasis," "recurrent jaundice of pregnancy," "pruritus gravidarum," "idiopathic jaundice of pregnancy," "intrahepatic jaundice of pregnancy," and "icterus gravidarum."Randomized controlled trials of UDCA versus control groups (included using other medicines) among patients with ICP were included. The primary outcomes were improved pruritus scores and liver function. Secondary outcomes were the maternal and fetal outcomes in patients with ICP.Data were extracted from included RCTs. The Mantel-Haenzel random-effects model or fixed-effects model was used for meta-analysis.A total of 12 RCTs involving 662 patients were included in the meta-analysis. In pooled analyses that compared UDCA with all controls, UDCA was associated with resolution of pruritus (risk ratio [RR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.12-2.52; P = 0.01),decrease of serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (standardized mean difference (SMD), -1.36; 95% CI, -2.08 to -0.63; P <0.001), reduced serum levels of bile  (SMD, -0.68; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.20; P <0.001), fewer premature births (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.72; P <0.001),reduced fetal distress (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94; P = 0.02), high Apgar scores at 5 minutes (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24-0.82; P = 0.009), less frequent respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.86; P = 0.02), and fewer neonates in the intensive care unit (NICU) (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87; P <0.05), increased gestational age (SMD,0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.63; P <0.001), and birth  (SMD, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.02-0.40; P = 0.03). There were no differences in meconium staining and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) between the groups (P >0.05).

This condition peaks in adolescence with up to 20% of adolescents with cystic fibrosis developing chronic liver disease. Early changes in the liver may ultimately result in end-stage liver disease with people needing transplantation. One therapeutic option currently used is ursodeoxycholic . This is an update of a previous review.To analyse evidence that ursodeoxycholic  improves indices of liver function, reduces the risk of developing chronic liver disease and improves outcomes in general in cystic fibrosis.We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted drug companies and searched online trial registries.Date of the most recent search of the Group's trials register: 09 April 2017.Randomised controlled trials of the use of ursodeoxycholic  for at least three months compared with placebo or no additional treatment in people with cystic fibrosis.Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality. The authors used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.Twelve trials have been identified, of which four trials involving 137 participants were included; data were only available from three of the trials (118 participants) since one cross-over trial did not report appropriate data. The dose of ursodeoxycholic  ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day for up to 12 months. The complex design used in two trials meant that data could only be analysed for subsets of participants. There was no significant difference in  change, mean difference -0.90 kg (95% confidence interval -1.94 to 0.14) based on 30 participants from two trials. Improvement in biliary excretion was reported in only one trial and no significant change after treatment was shown. There were no data available for analysis for long-term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation.There are few trials assessing the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic . The quality of the evidence identified ranged from low to very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to justify its routine use in cystic fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28089591>Evaluation of incidence of cholelithiasis after bariatric surgery in subjects treated or not treated with ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>The use of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) to prevent gallstone formation after gastric bypass (RYGB) is still debated.

Patients who underwent at least 1 ultrasound in the first postoperative year (±6 months) were included. We started to systematically prescribe UDCA (500 mg/d) for 6 months postoperatively, in February 2012 for RYGB (once or twice daily) and in October 2013 for SG (once daily).Mean follow-up was 13.0±3.4 months. The incidence of CL was 32.5% in the 117 nontreated RYGB and 25.5% in the 51 nontreated SG. It was reduced to 2.4% in the 42 SG treated once daily (P = .005), to 5.7% in the 87 RYGB with 250 mg twice daily (P<.001), but only to 18.6% in the 102 RYGB with 500 mg once daily (P = .03).UDCA 500 mg once daily for 6 months is efficient to prevent CL 1 year after SG, but the twice-daily doses seem to be more effective after RYGB. The effectiveness of UDCA once daily after SG and the superiority of the twice-daily doses after RYGB should be confirmed with more patients and longer follow-up.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Such effects are still unknown in avian (non-mammalian) species. We, therefore, undertook this study to determine the effect of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on growth performance and on the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and hepatic lipogenic genes in broiler chickens. Chickens fed with diet-containing 0.1% or 0.5% CDCA for two weeks exhibited a significant and a dose dependent reduction of feed intake and  compared to the control (standard diet). These changes were accompanied with a significant decrease in plasma glucose levels at d10 and d15 post-treatment. At molecular levels, CDCA treatment significantly up-regulated the expression of feeding-related hypothalamic neuropeptides (NPY, AgRP, ORX, CRH, Ghrl, and MC1R) and down-regulated the hypothalamic expression of SOCS3. CDCA treatment also decreased the mRNA levels of key hepatic lipogenic genes (FAS, ACCα, ME, ATPcl, and SCD-1) and their related transcription factors SREBP-1/2 and PPARα. In addition, CDCA reduced the hepatic expression of FXR and the adipokine, visfatin, and adiponectin genes compared to the control. Together, our data provide evidence that CDCA alters growth performances in broilers and modulates the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and hepatic lipogenic and adipocytokine genes.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In 5-20%, there is a progression from NAFL to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Until now, it is not well understood why only some patients develop NASH, and currently, no drugs are licensed for this indication. Different T-cell populations such as T-regulatory, Th1 and Th17 cells play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of fatty liver disease and open the option of future interleukin (IL)-17-based therapeutics. The inflammatory process underlying NASH is furthermore characterized by elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Anakinra, a recombinant version of IL-1Ra shows promising metabolic effects with improved hyperglycemia and beta-cell secretory function in a double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial in type 2 diabetic patients but such studies are still in their preliminary stages for NASH. Several studies point out that bile  farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated signals (such as the enterohepatic hormone fibroblast growth factor 15/19) are involved in the regulation of triglyceride and glucose metabolism. Recent clinical trials have revealed a beneficial impact of the FXR agonist obeticholic  on , insulin sensitivity and liver histology in patients with NASH.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether reduction of ERS by a known chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) can attenuate pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Oral administration of TUDCA at a dose of 300 mg/kg  (BW) in the TUDCA-TAC group reduced ERS markers (GRP78, p-PERK, and p-eIf2α), compared to the Vehicle (Veh)-TAC group. TUDCA administration, for 4 weeks after TAC significantly reduced cardiac hypertrophy as shown by the reduced heart  (HW) to BW ratio, and expression of hypertrophic marker genes (ANF, BNP, and α-SKA). Masson's trichrome staining showed that myocardial fibrosis and collagen deposition were also significantly reduced in the TUDCA-TAC group. We also found that TUDCA significantly decreased expression of TGF-β signaling proteins and collagen isoforms. TUDCA administration also reduced cardiac apoptosis and the related proteins in the TUDCA-TAC group. Microarray analysis followed by gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis demonstrated that extracellular matrix genes responsible for hypertrophy and fibrosis, and mitochondrial genes responsible for apoptosis and fatty  metabolism were significantly altered in the Veh-TAC group, but the alterations were normalized in the TUDCA-TAC group, suggesting potential of TUDCA in treatment of heart diseases related to pressure-overload.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30370307>Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Can Alleviate Gastrointestinal Transit in Rats with High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity via Regulation of Serotonin Biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>We tested the hypothesis that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could regulate the biotransformation of bile acids, such as  (DCA) and cholic  (CA), which in turn regulate the biosynthesis of serotonin in the gut and relieve gastrointestinal dysmotility in high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced obesity in rats.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the control diet group, HFD group, and HFD-fed with receiving FMT.

In HFD-fed rats, TPH1 protein expression was increased significantly, while SERT protein expression was decreased, but not significant. The levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with the control group.

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is  loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We have previously shown that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has antioxidative activity through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling-mediated glutathione production. In this study, we investigated the effects of UDCA on insulin response by analyzing intracellular ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. The level of ROS was quantified using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCFDA), and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting assay using appropriate antibodies. The intracellular ROS levels were increased by palmitate but were reduced by treatment with UDCA and insulin. Furthermore, insulin significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt. When the cells were pre-treated with palmitate, insulin-induced Akt-phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. However, when the cells were treated with palmitate and UDCA, the effects of insulin were partially restored.

Metabolomic study is an effective approach to investigating drug pharmacological actions, new diagnostic markers, and potential mechanisms of actions. In the present study, a new strategy was used to evaluate the protective effect of TRQ capsule against carbon tetrachloride (CCl)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, by analyzing metabolic profiling of endogenous bile acids (BAs) along with biochemical and histological analyses. BAs concentrations were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis were then employed to analyze the UPLC-MS results and compare the hepatoprotective effect of TRQ capsule in different groups at the doses of 0.36, 1.44, and 2.88 g·kg , respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that taurocholic  (TCA) and taurohyodesoxycholic  (THDCA) were the most important biochemical markers, which were indicative of CCl-induced acute hepatic damage and hepatoprotective effect of TRQ capsule.

Previously, we reported LHbisD4, which is the conjugate of low molecular  heparin (LMWH) and four bis-deoxycholates as a potent anti-angiogenic drug with less toxicity and orally active property. Here, we show that LHbisD4 could also suppress the formation of new lymphatic vessels and attenuate the incidence of metastasis by blocking VEGF-C signaling pathway. LHbisD4 significantly enhanced binding affinity with VEGF-C when compared with LMWH, which enables LHbisD4 to suppress the proliferation, migration and formation of tubular structures of human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells(HDLECs) in in vitro condition even in the presence of excessive amounts of VEGF-C. Similarly, we found that the density of lymphatic vessels in the primary tumor tissue in breast cancer bearing mice was significantly diminished when LHbisD4 was administered compared with the control group. Also, the incidence of axillary lymph nodes and distant organ metastasis was significantly reduced in the LHbisD4 administered group, which demonstrates that LHbisD4 could successfully lower the incidence of metastasis through blocking VEGF-C induced lymphangiogenesis. Based on these results, we propose LHbisD4 as a potent anti-cancer drug that can reduce the incidence of metastasis by suppressing lymphangiogenesis through blocking VEGF-C signaling pathway.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we examined the protective effect of protease inhibitor aprotinin and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi) on pulmonary inflammation in rats with severe pancreatitis-associated ALI.A rat model of acute pancreatitis (AP) was established by injecting sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDOC) into the pancreatic duct. Pharmacological interventions included pretreatment with a protease inhibitor aprotinin (10mg/kg) and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi, 100g/kg). The extent of pancreatic and lung injury and systemic inflammation was assessed by examinations of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung tissue. Pancreatic or lung tissue edema was evaluated by tissue water content. Pulmonary arterial pressure and alveolar-capillary membrane permeability were evaluated post-injury via a catheter inserted into the pulmonary artery in an isolated, perfused lung model.Pre-treatment with aprotinin or MMPi significantly decreased amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the wet/dry  ratio of the lung and pancreas in AP rats. Compared to the GDOC alone group, administration of aprotinin or MMPi prevented pancreatitis-induced IL-6 increases in the lung. Similarly, treatment with aprotinin or MMPi significantly decreased the accumulation of white blood cells, oxygen radicals, nitrite/nitrates in both blood and BAL, and markedly reduced lung permeability.Pretreatment with either aprotinin or MMPi attenuated the systemic inflammation and reduced the severity of lung and pancreas injuries. In short, our study demonstrated that inhibition of protease may be therapeutic to pulmonary inflammation in this GDOC-induced AP model.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study, a conjugate of the low molecular  (M) polyethylenimine (PEI) (M 1800) and  (DA) was further modified with 4-fluorothiophenol (FTP) (TP-DA-PEI) to achieve systemic siRNA delivery. The thiophenol group would be involved with disulfide bonds between the polymer chains and siRNA modified with free thiols (thiol-siRNA) to form and π⁻π interactions between the pendent aromatic groups and coprostane ring of the bile . The TP-DA-PEI conjugates could generate stable nanoparticles with thiol-siRNA. The TP-DA-PEI conjugate not only achieved enhanced intracellular uptake, serum stability, and transfection efficiency, but also showed high accumulation of TP-DA-PEI/thiol-siRNA polyplexes and significant tumor growth inhibition effect in tumor-bearing mice after systemic administration.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30660440>Evaluation of a liquid electron ionization liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry interface.</a></h2><p>Liquid Electron Ionization (LEI), is an innovative liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) interface that converts liquid HPLC eluent to the gas-phase in a mass spectrometer equipped with an electron ionization (EI) source. LEI extends the electronic spectra libraries access to liquid chromatography, providing a powerful tool in the untargeted approacssh. Negligible matrix effects allow accurate quantitative information. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the main aspects concerning the interfacing process. These fundamental studies were necessary to understand the mechanism of LEI in details, and improve the interfacing process, especially regarding robustness and sensitivity. Hardware components were installed to prevent analytes precipitation, reduce thermal decomposition of sensitive compounds, and to stabilize the nano-flow delivery with different mobile-phase compositions. Particular attention was devoted to insulating the heated vaporization area from the LC part of the system. Experiments were performed to optimize the interface inner capillary dimensions, and other operative parameters, including temperature, gas and liquid flow rates. Test compounds of environmental interest were selected based on molecular , thermal stability, volatility, and polarity. Robustness was evaluated with a set of replicated injections and calibration experiments using a soil matrix as a test sample. MRM detection limits in the low-picogram range were obtained for five pesticides belonging to different classes in a soil sample. High-quality electron ionization mass spectra of a mixture of pesticides were also obtained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

While the hydrophilic bile  subtype, ursodeoxycholic , has been shown to attenuate hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and thereby improve glucose regulation in mice, the effect of hydrophobic bile  subtypes on ER stress and glucose regulation in vivo is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the hydrophobic bile  subtype,  (DCA), on ER stress and glucose regulation. Eight week old C57BL/6J mice were fed a high fat diet supplemented with or without DCA. Glucose regulation was assessed by oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance testing. In addition, circulating bile  profile and hepatic insulin and ER stress signaling were measured. DCA supplementation did not alter  or food intake, but did impair glucose regulation. Consistent with the impairment in glucose regulation, DCA increased the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile  profile, decreased hepatic insulin signaling and increased hepatic ER stress signaling. Together, these data suggest that dietary supplementation of DCA impairs whole  glucose regulation by disrupting hepatic ER homeostasis in mice.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27895393>Emerging role of obeticholic  in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest chronic liver disease and its prevalence is increasing driven by the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic  (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA.  loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714405>Emerging Targets to Relieve Fat Stress-Induced Liver Diseases: UDCA, Tocotrienol, ω-3 PUFAs, and IgY Targeted NPC1L1 Cholesterol Transporter.</a></h2><p>Fat stress-induced liver disease is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome initiated by excess fat accumulation and encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a precursor lesion progressing to more aggressive liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the incidence of these fat stress-induced liver diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide in parallel with the growing epidemics of obesity and metabolic diseases, its exact pathogenesis is not well defined. Although obesity, sedentary life-style, altered dietary pattern, insulin resistance, altered intestinal barrier function, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been acknowledged as contributing factors because of the indefinite pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, the only reliable treatment is lifestyle intervention composed of restrictive diet and exercise. Additionally, some existing medications such as pioglitazone and antioxidants such as vitamin E were reported to be effective; in this review, several novel agents especifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis under clinical trial will be introduced. These include an NPC1L1 blocker (ezetimibe), which significantly improved histological and symptomatic scores associated with steatohepatitis and fibrosis; clofibrate, phentoxyfylline, ursodeoxycholic , and tocopherol, all of which are prescribed to relieve fat stress; and additional IgY targeted NPC1L1, tocotrienol, ursodeoxycholic , and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are actively under investigation to confirm the safety of long-term use.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634226>Reduction of Hypothalamic Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Activates Browning of White Fat and Ameliorates Obesity.</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining metabolic, histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and metabolic phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874313>New therapeutic perspectives in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is focused on restitution of metabolic derangement,  loss and drugs able to improve steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis.
