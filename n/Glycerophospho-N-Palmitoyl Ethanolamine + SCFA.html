The reaction is believed to proceed via two successive single electron transfers to generate the fluorenyl anion which was able to react with different electrophiles.

To increase the knowledge on the biochemical composition of this type of tumor for better diagnosis and prognosis, we performed a molecular study using ex vivo high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) perfomed on HPC and peritumoral edematous tissues. Moreover, to help in the discrimination between HPC and meningothelial meningioma we compared the ex vivo HR-MAS spectra of samples from one patient with HPC and 5 patients affected by meningothelial meningioma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in vivo localized single voxel 1H-MRS was also performed on the same patients prior to surgery and the in vivo and ex vivo MRS spectra were compared. We observed the presence of OH-butyrate, together with glucose in HPC and a low amount of N-acetylaspartate in the edema, that may reflect neuronal alteration responsible for associated epilepsy. Many differences between HPC and meningothelial meningioma were identified. The relative ratios of myo-inositol, glucose and gluthatione with respect to glutamate are higher in HPC compared to meningioma; whereas the relative ratios of creatine, glutamine, alanine, glycine and choline-containing compounds with respect to glutamate are lower in HPC compared to meningioma. These data will be useful to improve the interpretation of in vivo MRS spectra resulting in a more accurate diagnosis of these rare tumors.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27885204>GENETIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ADRB2 AND PTGER4 ON RESPONSES TO SALMETEROL OR MONTELUKAST IN JAPANESE PATIENTS WITH MILD PERSISTENT ASTHMA.</a></h2><p>Long-acting β-agonists (LABA) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are two principal agents that can be added to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with asthma that is not adequately controlled by ICS alone. In our previous study, the Gly16Arg genotype of the β-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene did not influence the differential bronchodilator effect of salmeterol versus montelukast as an add-on therapy to ICS within 16 weeks of follow-up (the J-Blossom study).We examined if genes encoding CYSLTR1, CYSLTR2, PTGER2 or PTGER4 could explain differential responses to salmeterol versus montelukast using the participants of the J-Blossom study. This study included 76 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. The difference in peak expiratory flow (PEF) (ΔPEF, l/min) after 16 weeks of treatment with salmeterol (ΔPEFsal) versus montelukast (ΔPEFmon) was associated with the genotypes at each of 4 genes. In addition, multivariate analyses were used to identify a gene-gene interaction between ADRB2 gene and each of these 4 genes.Although none of 4 genes were associated with ΔPEFsal-ΔPEFmon in the univariate analyses, multivariate analysis showed that PTGER4 gene, interacting with ADRB2 Gly16Arg, was associated with ΔPEFsal-ΔPEFmon (p=0.0032).Our findings suggested that the interactions between two genetic loci at ADRB2 and PTGER4 is important in determining the differential response to salmeterol versus montelukast in patients with chronic adult asthma.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423076>Evidence in support of using a neurochemistry approach to identify therapy for both epilepsy and associated depression.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to develop a neurochemistry-based single or adjuvant therapy approach for comprehensive management of epilepsy and associated depression employing pentylenetetrazole-kindled animals. Kindling was induced in two-month-old male Swiss albino mice by administering a subconvulsant pentylenetetrazole dose (35mg/kg, i.p.) at an interval of 48±2h. These kindled animals were treated with saline and sodium valproate (300mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 15days. Except for the naïve group, all other groups were challenged with pentylenetetrazole (35mg/kg, i.p.) on days 5, 10, and 15 to evaluate the seizure severity. Depression was evaluated in all experimental groups after normalization of locomotor activity, using tail suspension and forced swim test on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Four hours after behavioral evaluations on day 15, all animals were euthanized to collect their serum and discrete brain parts. Corticosterone levels were estimated in all the experimental groups as a marker of a dysregulated hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis. Neurochemical alterations (norepinephrine, dopamine, tryptophan, kynurenine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, and total nitrate levels) were also estimated in the cortical and hippocampal areas of the mouse brain. Results revealed that saline-treated kindled animals were associated with significant depression and altered neurochemical milieu in comparison with naïve animals. Chronic valproate treatment in kindled animals significantly reduced seizure severity score bud did not ameliorate associated depression or completely restore altered biochemical and neurochemical milieu. Based on the observation of neurochemical changes in all the groups, we propose that restoration of altered neurochemical milieu, elevated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme activity, and corticosterone levels using pharmacological tools with/out valproic acid may be explored for management of both epilepsy and comorbid depression.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The role of imaging in prostate cancer should include diagnosis, localization, and characterization (indolent vs. lethal) of the primary tumor, determination of extracapsular spread, guidance and evaluation of local therapy in organ-confined disease, staging of locoregional lymph nodes, detection of locally recurrent and metastatic disease in biochemical relapse, planning of radiation treatment, prediction and assessment of tumor response to salvage and systemic therapy, monitoring of active surveillance and definition of a trigger for definitive therapy, and prognostication of time to hormone refractoriness in castrate disease and overall survival. To address these tasks effectively, imaging needs to be tailored to the specific phases of the disease in a patient-specific, risk-adjusted manner. In this article, I review the preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential and emerging role of PET with the 3 most commonly studied radiotracers in prostate cancer, namely 18F-FDG, 18F- or 11C-acetate, and 18F- or 11C-choline.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28028814>Choline and acetylcholine: what a difference an acetate makes!</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22974973>Metabolic response to green tea extract during rest and moderate-intensity exercise.</a></h2><p>Green tea catechins have been hypothesized to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation by inhibiting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and thus promoting more sustained adrenergic stimulation. Metabolomics may help to clarify the mechanisms underlying their putative physiological effects.The study investigated the effects of 7-day ingestion of green tea extract (GTE) on the plasma metabolite profile at rest and during exercise.In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel study, 27 healthy physically active males consumed either GTE (n=13, 1200 mg catechins, 240 mg caffeine/day) or placebo (n=14, PLA) drinks for 7 days. After consuming a final drink (day 8), they rested for 2 h and then completed 60 min of moderate-intensity cycling exercise (56% ± 4% VO(2)max). Blood samples were collected before and during exercise. Plasma was analyzed using untargeted four-phase metabolite profiling and targeted profiling of catecholamines.Using the metabolomic approach, we observed that GTE did not enhance adrenergic stimulation (adrenaline and noradrenaline) during rest or exercise. At rest, GTE led to changes in metabolite concentrations related to fat metabolism (3-β-hydroxybutyrate), lipolysis (glycerol) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle intermediates (citrate) when compared to PLA. GTE during exercise caused reductions in 3-β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations as well as increases in pyruvate, lactate and alanine concentrations when compared to PLA.GTE supplementation resulted in marked metabolic differences during rest and exercise. Yet these metabolic differences were not related to the adrenergic system, which questions the in vivo relevance of the COMT inhibition mechanism of action for GTE.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, its role in 6 Hz induced psychomotor seizures is not known. The present study was, therefore, designed to investigate the role of noradrenaline (NA) in 6 Hz-induced psychomotor seizures in Swiss albino mice using N-2-Chloroethyl-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride (DSP-4), a well-known depletor of NA. The vehicle and DSP-4 treated mice were given 6 Hz stimulation. A sham treatment was utilized as a comparator and sodium valproate (SVP) was utilized as a reference anti-epileptic medication. Behavioral changes instigated by 6 Hz stimulation were described as the increased duration of Straub's tail, stun position, twitching of vibrissae, forelimb clonus and increased rearing and grooming. DSP-4 administration further amplified the seizures and behavioral changes while pretreatment with SVP reduced the same in mice. Further, SVP pre-treatment also attenuated the ultra-structural changes observed in cortex and hippocampus of mice treated with DSP-4 and 6 Hz. Finally, the neurochemical estimation of NA in cortex and hippocampus confirmed the depletion of NA following DSP-4 and 6 Hz seizures. SVP pretreatment (but not post-treatment) protected the mice from 6 Hz seizures and attenuated the DSP-4 induced alterations of nor-adrenaline content in the mouse brain. The study indicates low brain NA content to enhance pharmacoresistant seizures in mice and demonstrates that SVP mediated protection against 6 Hz results possibly via modulation of NA content.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Lymph nodal dissection (LND) currently represents the gold standard for evaluating the presence of lymph nodal involvement. However, this procedure is invasive, associated with morbidity, and may fail in detecting all potential lymph nodal metastatic regions. Currently the criteria for lymph nodal detection using conventional imaging techniques mainly rely on morphological assessment with unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy. Positron emission tomography (PET) represents a helpful imaging technique for a proper staging of lymph nodal status. The most investigated PET radiotracer is choline, although many others have been explored as guide for both primary and salvage LND, such as fluorodeoxyglucose, acetate, fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid and prostate-specific membrane antigen. In the present review, a comprehensive literature review addressing the role of PET for LND in PCa patients is reported, with the use of the above-mentioned radiotracers.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28736253>Selective ER-α agonist alleviates vascular endothelial dysfunction in ovariectomized type 2 diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Postmenopausal diabetic women represent a specific risk group with a greater incidence of vascular deficits as compared with age-matched men or non-diabetic women. 17β-estradiol is the mainstay therapy for menopause and associated complications; however, its vasculoprotective effect is lost in women with diabetes. Although, exact mechanism of dichotomous effect of estrogen has not been delineated but it may be due to, differential activation of ER-α and β during disease conditions such as diabetes. Thus main objective of our study was to characterize the specific estrogen receptor which could be selectively targeted to achieve vasculoprotection in postmenopausal diabetic situation. A significant impairment in glycemic and lipid profile, decreased ACh-induced endothelium dependent relaxation, impaired endothelial integrity, and rise in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were observed in ovariectomized type 2 diabetic rats as compared to sham rats. These markers were further correlated with aortic eNOS levels. Treatment with selective ER-α receptor agonist markedly while 17β-estradiol partially ameliorated these alterations along with enhanced aortic eNOS levels. However, ER-β agonist did not show any effect. Our data suggests that selective ER-α activation could be an important pharmacological target, to mimic the beneficial effect of estradiol in cardiovascular disorders, especially in postmenopausal diabetic state.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

According to clinical signs and 3-hydroxybutyrate plasma levels, 81 multiparous Holstein cows were selected from a dairy farm 7 to 21 d after calving. The cows were divided into 3 groups: cows with clinical ketosis, cows with subclinical ketosis, and healthy control cows. (1)H-Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was used to assess the plasma metabolic profiles of the 3 groups. The data were analyzed by principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis. The differences in metabolites among the 3 groups were assessed. The orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis model differentiated the 3 groups of plasma samples. The model predicted clinical ketosis with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%. In the case of subclinical ketosis, the model had a sensitivity of 97.0% and specificity of 95.7%. Twenty-five metabolites, including acetoacetate, acetone, lactate, glucose, choline, glutamic acid, and glutamine, were different among the 3 groups. Among the 25 metabolites, 4 were upregulated, 7 were downregulated, and 14 were both upregulated and downregulated. The results indicated that plasma (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics, coupled with pattern recognition analytical methods, not only has the sensitivity and specificity to distinguish cows with clinical and subclinical ketosis from healthy controls, but also has the potential to be developed into a clinically useful diagnostic tool that could contribute to a further understanding of the disease mechanisms.Copyright © 2014 American Dairy Science Association.

An isolated whole head and a whole young sheep from an abattoir with known time of death were stored at approximately 21°C, and localized (1)H-MRS (TR/TE 2,500/25 ms) of the brain was performed at various PMIs with a clinical 1.5 T whole-body scanner using a quadratur head coil.

In the head of the whole animal, especially fTMAs and lactate were found in the late PMI but no further metabolites of relevance. These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that in a whole-body corpse, the distribution of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract up to the brain in the late post-mortem interval can influence the metabolic decomposition of brain tissues.

To determine the impact acetate supplementation has on a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, we quantified the effect treatment had on injury progression, spinal cord lipid content, phospholipase levels, and myelin structure in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced by inoculating mice with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide fragment (MOG ), and acetate supplementation was maintained with 4 g/kg glyceryl triacetate by a daily oral gavage. Acetate supplementation prevented the onset of clinical signs in mice subject to EAE compared to control-treated mice. Furthermore, acetate supplementation prevented the loss of spinal cord  and choline glycerophospholipid and phosphatidylserine in mice subjected to EAE compared to EAE animals treated with water. Treatment increased saturated and monounsaturated  acid levels in phosphatidylserine compared to controls suggesting that acetate was utilized to increase spinal cord  acid content. Also, acetate supplementation prevented the loss of spinal cord cholesterol in EAE animals but did not change cholesteryl esters. Treatment significantly increased GD3 and GD1a ganglioside levels in EAE mice when compared to EAE mice treated with water. Treatment returned levels of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (cPLA ) levels back to baseline and based on FluoroMyelin™ histochemistry maintained myelin structural characteristics.

Physiologic and laboratory parameters were closely measured and the pigs divided into four groups: sham, control (injury protocol), VPA dosing before cross-clamp (VPA-B), and VPA dosing after cross-clamp (VPA-A).All animals developed significant coagulopathy, acidosis, and anemia. Animals receiving VPA-A had decreased acidosis and coagulopathy as measured by pH (P = 0.016) and international normalized ratio (P = 0.013) over the resuscitation. VPA-A pigs had a decreased requirement for crystalloid (P = 0.007) and epinephrine (P < 0.0001) during resuscitation. Pathologic analysis demonstrated decreased liver injury with VPA administration.

Major metabolites that could be interpreted as indicating host glutaminolysis were consistent with activated host immune cells encountering increasingly hypoxic conditions in the necrotic lung lesions. Moreover, glutathione levels were constantly elevated, probably in response to oxygen radical production in these lesions.

At present, the dietary requirement for biotin is unknown and intake recommendations are provided as Adequate Intakes (AIs). The biotin AI for adults and pregnant women is 30 μg/d, whereas 35 μg/d is recommended for lactating women. However, pregnant and lactating women may require more biotin to meet the demands of these reproductive states.The current study sought to quantify the impact of reproductive state on biotin status response to a known dietary intake of biotin.To achieve this aim, we measured a panel of biotin biomarkers among pregnant (gestational week 27 at study entry; n = 26), lactating (postnatal week 5 at study entry; n = 28), and control (n = 21) women who participated in a 10- to 12-wk feeding study providing 57 μg of dietary biotin/d as part of a mixed diet.Over the course of the study, pregnant women excreted 69% more (vs. control; P < 0.001) 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-HIA), a metabolite that accumulates during the catabolism of leucine when the activity of biotin-dependent methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase is impaired. Interestingly, urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleryl-carnitine (3-HIA-carnitine), a downstream metabolite of 3-HIA, was 27% lower (P = 0.05) among pregnant (vs. control) women, a finding that may arise from carnitine inadequacy during gestation. No differences (P > 0.05) were detected in plasma biotin, urinary biotin, or urinary bisnorbiotin between pregnant and control women. Lactating women excreted 76% more (vs. control; P = 0.001) of the biotin catabolite bisnorbiotin, indicating that lactation accelerates biotin turnover and loss. Notably, with respect to control women, lactating women excreted 23% less (P = 0.04) urinary 3-HIA and 26% less (P = 0.05) urinary 3-HIA-carnitine, suggesting that lactation reduces leucine catabolism and that these metabolites may not be useful indicators of biotin status during lactation.Overall, these data demonstrate significant alterations in markers of biotin metabolism during pregnancy and lactation and suggest that biotin intakes exceeding current recommendations are needed to meet the demands of these reproductive states.

The inhalation of allergens and pollutants promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness, and remodeling in allergic asthma. The effects of asthma medications on ROS production are unclear. The present study investigated the anti-ROS effects of current asthma medications including inhaled corticosteroid (ICS; budesonide and fluticasone), leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA; montelukast), long-acting β2 agonists (LABAs; salmeterol and formoterol), and a new extra-LABA (indacaterol).The human monocyte cell line THP-1 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of the asthma medications at different time points after hydrogen peroxide (HO) stimulation. HO production was measured with DCFH-DA by flow cytometry.Montelukast, fluticasone, and salmeterol suppressed HO-induced ROS production. Indacaterol enhanced HO-induced ROS production. Budesonide and formoterol alone had no anti-ROS effects, but the combination of these two drugs significantly suppressed HO-induced ROS production.Different asthma medications have different anti-ROS effects on monocytes. The combination therapy with LABA and ICS seemed not to be the only choice for asthma control. Montelukast may also be a good supplemental treatment for the poorly controlled asthma because of its powerful anti-ROS effects. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic view in asthma.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22673596>Glycerophosphocholine enhances growth hormone secretion and fat oxidation in young adults.</a></h2><p>α-Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) is a putative acetylcholine precursor that potentially increases growth hormone secretion through the action of acetylcholine-stimulated catecholamine. The aim of this study was to investigate acute physiologic responses to a single intake of GPC.Eight healthy male subjects (25 ± 1 y old) ingested GPC 1000 mg or a placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover study. Fasting blood samples were obtained before the administration of GPC (baseline) and 60 and 120 min after administration. All subjects repeated the identical protocol using the placebo.Plasma free choline levels significantly increased at 60 and 120 min after GPC administration. Plasma growth hormone secretion was increased significantly 60 min after taking GPC, whereas no significant change was observed with the placebo. In addition, the serum free  acid was increased 120 min after GPC ingestion, but no changes were seen with the placebo. Moreover, serum acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate levels, which are indices of hepatic fat oxidation, were increased at 120 min after taking GPC, whereas the placebo had no effect.These findings suggest that a single dose of GPC increases growth hormone secretion and hepatic fat oxidation, with concomitant increases in choline levels, in young adults.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the coefficient of variation of PEF (CVpef) and the scaling exponent α, reflecting self-similarity of PEF, in relation to treatment failure from the run-in period of open-label inhaled fluticasone, and the treatment periods for subjects randomized to (1) continued twice daily fluticasone (F), (2) once daily fluticasone plus salmeterol (F + S), or (3) once daily oral montelukast (M).The CVpef was higher in those with treatment failure in the F and F + S groups in the run-in phase, and all three groups in the treatment phase. α was similar between those with and without treatment failure in all three groups during the run-in phase but was higher among those with treatment failure in the F and F + S groups during the treatment phase. Participants in all three groups showed variable patterns of change in α leading up to treatment failure.We conclude that increased temporal self-similarity (α) of more variable lung function (CVpef) is associated with treatment failure, but the pattern of change in self-similarity leading up to treatment failure is variable across individuals.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20299466>Mechanisms of insulin resistance after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in humans: the role of lipolysis.</a></h2><p>Changes in glucose metabolism occurring during counterregulation are, in part, mediated by increased plasma free   (FFAs), as a result of hypoglycemia-activated lipolysis.

Insulin action was measured during a 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (plasma glucose [PG] 5.1 mmo/l) from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. or after a 3-h morning hyperinsulinemic-glucose clamp (from 10 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.), either euglycemic (study 1) or hypoglycemic (PG 3.2 mmol/l, studies 2-4), during which FFA levels were allowed to increase (study 2), were suppressed by acipimox (study 3), or were replaced by infusing lipids (study 4). [6,6-(2)H(2)]-Glucose was infused to measure glucose fluxes.Plasma adrenaline, norepinephrine, growth hormone, and cortisol levels were unchanged (P > 0.2).

A hydro-organic mixture, consisting of 100mM Tris-acetate buffer at pH 4.2 and acetonitrile (90:10, v/v), was selected as background electrolyte (BGE). The applied voltage was 30kV, and the sample injection was performed in the hydrodynamic mode.

Patients with severe asthma before pregnancy may experience more exacerbations, especially during late pregnancy. Prevention of the CAS includes excellent asthma control involving targeted early and regular medical care of the pregnant asthmatic, together with medication compliance. Spontaneous abortion risk is higher in pregnant women with uncontrolled asthma than in non-asthmatics. Should CAS occur during pregnancy, aggressive bronchodilator therapy, montelukast, and systemic corticosteroids can be used in the context of respiratory monitoring, preferably in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Systemic epinephrine should be avoided due to potential teratogenic side-effects and placental/uterine vasoconstriction. Non-invasive ventilation has been used in some cases. Intratracheal intubation can be hazardous and rapid-sequence intubation by an experienced physician is recommended. Mechanical ventilation parameters are adjusted based on changes to respiratory mechanics in the pregnant patient. An inhaled helium-oxygen gas admixture may promote laminar airflow and improve gas exchange. Permissive hypercapnea is controversial, but may be unavoidable. Sedation with propofol which itself has bronchodilating properties is preferred to benzodiazepines.

Reperfusion, although vital to organ survival, initiates an inflammatory response that may both aggravate local tissue injury and elicit remote organ damage. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) trafficking to remote organs following ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) is associated with the release of lipid mediators, including leucotriene (LT) B4 , cysteinyl-LTs (CysLTs) and platelet-activating factor (PAF). Yet, their potentially cooperative role in regulating I/R-mediated inflammation has not been thoroughly assessed. The present study aimed to determine the cooperative role of lipid mediators in regulating PMN migration, tissue oedema and injury using selective receptor antagonists in selected models of I/R and dermal inflammation. Our results show that rabbits, pre-treated orally with BIIL 284 and/or WEB 2086 and MK-0571, were protected from remote tissue injury following I/R or dermal inflammation in an additive or synergistic manner when the animals were pre-treated with two drugs concomitantly. The functional selectivity of the antagonists towards their respective agonists was assessed in vitro, showing that neither BIIL 284 nor WEB 2086 prevented the inflammatory response to IL-8, C5a and zymosan-activated plasma stimulation. However, these agonists elicited LTB4 biosynthesis in isolated rabbit PMNs. Similarly, a cardioprotective effect of PAF and LTB4 receptor antagonists was shown following myocardial I/R in mice. Taken together, these results underscore the intricate involvement of LTB4 and PAF in each other's responses and provide further evidence that targeting both LTs and PAF receptors provides a much stronger anti-inflammatory effect, regulating PMN migration and oedema formation.© 2013 The Authors.

However, dysfunctions of, for example, the glucose-insulin axis are not readily detectable by conventional tests early in life, making it difficult to identify individuals at risk. Thus, other methods are required. We hypothesised that prenatally undernourished individuals (but not postnatally overnourished ones) are adapted to a life with limited food availability, which would be evident under conditions reflecting starvation, stress and short-term abundance of food. In this study, twin-pregnant sheep were fed diets meeting 100% (NORM) or 50% (LOW) of energy and protein requirements during the last trimester. Twin offspring were fed either a normal moderate (CONV) diet or a high-carbohydrate-high-fat (HCHF) diet from 3 days to 6 months of age (approximately puberty) and the same moderate diet thereafter until 2 years of age (young adulthood; only females), resulting in four groups: NORM-CONV, LOW-CONV, NORM-HCHF and LOW-HCHF. At the age of 6 months and 2 years respectively, they were subjected to fasting and propionate (nutrient abundance) and adrenalin challenges. At 6 months of age, postnatal HCHF diet exposure caused metabolic alterations, reflecting hypertriglyceridaemia and altered pancreatic β-cell secretion. Irrespective of postnatal diet, prenatal undernutrition was found to be associated with unexpected endocrine responses of leptin, IGF1 and cortisol during fasting (lack of or the opposite response compared with the controls) in 2-year-old adults. In conclusion, a HCHF diet interfered with β-cell function, whereas maternal undernutrition did not lead to any changes in the LOW offspring, except to abnormal hormone responses, suggesting that fetal programming interferes with hypothalamic integration of important endocrine axis.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22552730>Bladder selectivity of the novel β₃-agonist ritobegron (KUC-7483) explored by in vitro and in vivo studies in the rat.</a></h2><p>We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the pharmacological profile of ritobegron and its effects on the bladder in rats. β(3)-AR selectivity was assessed using CHO cells expressing various subtypes of the human β-adrenoceptor (AR).

Ritobegron increased cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in CHO cells expressing any one of three human β-AR, its selectivity for β(3)-AR being 301-fold and 32-fold higher versus β(1)-AR and β(2)-AR, respectively. Ritobegron decreased the resting tension of the isolated bladder in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50), 7.7 × 10(-8) mol/L; maximal relaxation, 97.0 %), and the β(3)-AR antagonist SR58894A produced a parallel rightward-shift of this concentration-response curve without altering the maximal response [pK(B) value, 6.43].

After separation of the signals of Gln and Glu, a significant increase of Gln was observed in the parietal lobe in the patients' group. No significant differences in the occipital spectra could be observed between the groups.In VPA-treated patients the alteration of the Glu/Gln ratio differs from that in patients with CHE, where Glx is markedly increased because of an increase in Gln.

Some air pollutants, including sulfite, may play a role in the exacerbation of asthma. Sulfites are formed at bronchial mucosa from inhaled sulfur dioxide. It has been previously reported that sodium sulfite (Na(2)SO(3)) has pro-inflammatory properties and enhances neutrophil adhesion to A549 cells. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays a critical role in attracting inflammatory cells and is an excellent marker of pulmonary cell activation. To date, there have not been any reports on the effect of asthma drugs on the suppression of IL-8 production induced by sulfite in A549 cells or the involvement of specific signal transduction pathways. Thus, our study assessed the effects of salmeterol, fluticasone, and montelukast on human epithelial lung cell inflammation as well as the inhibitors in different signal transduction pathways.A549 human lung epithelial cells were cultured under the following conditions: (1) treated with sodium sulfite (0, 100, 500, 1000, 2500 uM) for 16 hours; (2) cultured for 1 hour in the presence of SB203580, PD98059, SP600125, or wedeloactone, then co-incubated with sodium sulfite for another 16 hours; (3) cultured for 4 hours in the presence of salmeterol, fluticasone, or montelukast, then stimulated with sodium sulfite at a concentration of 1000 uM for 16 hours. We collected the supernatants from the above conditions and performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the IL-8 concentration.IL-8 production increased after treatment with sodium sulfite at 1000 to 2500 uM (p <or= 0.001). SB203580, PD98059, and wedeloactone decreased IL-8 production stimulated by Na(2)SO(3) (p < 0.01). Salmeterol, fluticasone, and montelukast significantly suppressed IL-8 secretion from sodium sulfite-stimulated A549 cells (p < 0.01).Sodium sulfite has pro-inflammatory properties in vitro and can induce potent chemotactic factor IL-8 production. Possible signal transduction pathways required for IL-8 gene expression following exposure to sulfite are the NF-kappa B, ERK, and p-38-dependent pathways.

We therefore evaluated using montelukast as an alternative to salmeterol as tailored second-line asthma controller therapy in children expressing this susceptible genotype. A total of 62 persistent asthmatic children with the homozygous Arg16 genotype were randomized to receive salmeterol (50 μg, b.i.d.) or montelukast (5 or 10 mg, once daily) as an add-on to inhaled fluticasone for 1 year. School absences (the primary outcome) were reduced with montelukast compared with salmeterol {difference in score=-0.40 [95% CI (confidence interval), -0.22 to -0.58]; P=0.005}. Salbutamol use was also reduced with montelukast compared with salmeterol [difference in score=-0.47 (95% CI, -0.16 to -0.79); P<0.0001]. Greater improvements occurred in both symptom and quality of life scores with montelukast against salmeterol, whereas there was no difference in FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume in 1 s). In conclusion, montelukast may be suitable as tailored second-line controller therapy instead of salmeterol in asthmatic children expressing the susceptible Arg(16) genotype, a move towards a personalized medicine approach to management.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19070356>Impulse oscillometry versus spirometry in a long-term study of controller therapy for pediatric asthma.</a></h2><p>Determination of the benefits and limitations of specific physiologic tests has not been well studied in long-term clinical pediatric trials.We sought to determine the utility of impulse oscillometry in a long-term comparison of 3 controller regimens in children with persistent asthma.Children 6 to 14 years of age with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma were characterized with oscillometry and spirometry before entry into a clinical trial and then serially during 48 weeks of therapy with either an inhaled corticosteroid, a combination inhaled corticosteroid with a long-acting beta-agonist, or a leukotriene receptor antagonist.The FEV(1)/forced vital capacity ratio, as well as the forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity in terms of spirometric parameters and the reactance area (XA) from impulse oscillometry, appeared to complement information provided by FEV(1) when comparing the tests and factors that appeared to predict a response to treatment. XA was unique in that it, as distinct from spirometric variables, reflected ongoing improvement during the latter part of the trial. In general, improvements in XA during the latter part of the study occurred independently of indices of atopy and the level of airway responsiveness.Assessment of respiratory mechanics over time with oscillometry might offer additional insights into the response of asthmatic patients to therapy. In particular, the pattern of improvement seen in XA over the course of therapy suggests this test might detect alterations in airway mechanics not reflected by spirometry. The possibility that changes in XA reflect ongoing improvement in small airway function deserves additional study.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20832961>Measurement of lumefantrine and its metabolite in plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection.</a></h2><p>Artemether-lumefantrine (ARM-LUM) has in recent years become the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Vigorous monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment is needed. This requires high-quality studies following standard protocols; ideally, such studies should incorporate measurement of drug levels in the study patients to exclude the possibility that insufficient drug levels explain an observed treatment failure. Several methods for measuring lumefantrine (LUM) in plasma by HPLC are available; however, several of these methods have some limitations in terms of high costs and limited feasibility arising from large required sample volumes and demanding sample preparation. Therefore, we set out to develop a simpler reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method based on UV detection for simultaneous measurement of LUM and its major metabolite the desbutyl LUM (DL) in plasma. Halofantrine was used as an internal standard. Liquid-liquid extraction of samples was carried out using hexane-ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v). Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Synergi Polar-RP column (250 mm × 300 mm, particle size 4 μm). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-0.1M ammonium acetate buffer adjusted to pH 4.9 (85:15%, v/v). Absorbance of the compounds was monitored at 335 nm using a reference wavelength of 360 nm. Absolute extraction recovery for LUM and DL were 88% and 90%, respectively. Inter- and intraday coefficients of variation for LUM and DL were ≤ 10%. The lower limits of quantification for LUM and DL were 12.5 and 6.5 ng/ml, respectively. After validation, the methodology was transferred to a local laboratory in Tanga Tanzania and samples from a small subset of malaria patients were analysed for LUM. The method appears to be applicable in settings with limited facilities.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Thirty-two Holstein cows were allocated into two groups (RPC group with RPC supplementation and control group without RPC supplementation) 28 days before the expected calving. Cows were fed the experimental diet from 21 days before calving until day 60 of lactation. The diet of the RPC group was supplemented with 100 g/day of RPC from 21 days prepartum until calving and 200 g/day of RPC for 60 days postpartum, providing 25 and 50 g of choline, respectively. Liver samples were taken by percutaneous needle biopsy, then analysed for total lipid (TLl), triglyceride (TGl) and glycogen (GLYl) contents on days -21, +7, +35 and +60 relative to calving. Blood was collected on the same sampling days and 21 days after calving. Glucose, non-esterified  acid (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), triglyceride (TGp), total cholesterol (TCh), urea, ammonia and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined from blood samples. The TLl and TGl contents were 25.0 ± 4.3 g and 25.3 ± 3.8 g per kg wet weight (mean ± SEM), respectively, lower in the RPC group than in the control animals. No significant differences were observed in the GLYl concentrations between the two groups. However, a lower TGl: GLYl ratio was shown in the liver of cows fed the RPC diet as compared to the controls. RPC supplementation decreased BHBA while increasing TGp concentrations were shown in the blood of cows fed the RPC diet, possibly as a consequence of improved lipoprotein synthesis in, and triglyceride excretion from, the liver, together with a reduced rate of ketogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27707627>Sobetirome prodrug esters with enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability.</a></h2><p>There is currently great interest in developing drugs that stimulate myelin repair for use in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Thyroid hormone plays a key role in stimulating myelination during development and also controls the expression of important genes involved in myelin repair in adults. Because endogenous thyroid hormone in excess lacks a generally useful therapeutic index, it is not used clinically for indications other than hormone replacement; however, selective thyromimetics such as sobetirome offer a therapeutic alternative. Sobetirome is the only clinical-stage thyromimetic that is known to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and we endeavored to increase the BBB permeability of sobetirome using a prodrug strategy. Ester prodrugs of sobetirome were prepared based on literature reports of improved BBB permeability with other carboxylic acid containing drugs and BBB permeability was assessed in vivo. One sobetirome prodrug,  ester 11, was found to distribute more sobetirome to the brain compared to an equimolar peripheral dose of unmodified sobetirome. In addition to enhanced brain levels, prodrug 11 displayed lower sobetirome blood levels and a brain/serum ratio that was larger than that of unmodified sobetirome. Thus, these data indicate that an ester prodrug strategy applied to sobetirome can deliver increased concentrations of the active drug to the central nervous system (CNS), which may prove useful in the treatment of CNS disorders.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of the present study was to identify novel variants that associate with response to common asthma controllers: fluticasone, combination of fluticasone + salmeterol and montelukast with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in β2-adrenergic receptor, corticosteroid and leukotriene pathway candidate genes. Participants in a large clinical trial of step-down strategies volunteered for this pharmacogenetic study. A total of 169 SNPs in 26 candidate genes were genotyped in 189 Caucasian participants with asthma who took either fluticasone (100 μg bid), fluticasone propionate (100 μg) + salmeterol (50 μg) (FP/Salm) or montelukast (5 or 10 mg) each night for 16 weeks. Primary outcomes were the slopes of plots of Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores versus time following randomization; and the percent change in percent predicted FEV1 (ΔFEV1%pred) from enrollment to the end of the study. Associations between SNPs and outcomes were analyzed using general linear models. False discovery rate and Bonferroni corrections were used to correct for multiple comparisons. In all, 16 SNPs in seven genes were significantly associated with outcomes. For FP/Salm, three SNPs in CHRM2 associated with ACQ slope (P=2.8 × 10⁻⁵), and rs1461496 in HSPA8 associated with ΔFEV1%pred. For fluticasone, five SNPs in CRHR1 (P=1.9 × 10⁻⁴), and three SNPs in COL2A1 associated with ACQ slope and ΔFEV1%pred, respectively. For montelukast, four SNPs in CHRM2 associated with ΔFEV1%pred and predicted an opposite effect compared with fluticasone (P=9 × 10⁻³). The present study indentified several novel SNPs that associate with response to common asthma controllers, and support further pharmacogenomic study and the use of genetic variants to personalize asthma treatment.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019312>Autism and Allergy - Are They Linked?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24104592>First imaging results of an intraindividual comparison of (11)C-acetate and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer at early biochemical first or second relapse after prostatectomy or radiotherapy.</a></h2><p>(18)F-Fluorocholine (FCH) and (11)C-acetate (ACE) PET are widely used for detection of recurrent prostate cancer (PC).

FCH PET/CT was started at injection (307 ± 16 MBq) with a 10-min dynamic acquisition of the prostate bed, followed by a whole-body PET scan and late (45 min) imaging of the pelvis. ACE PET/CT was performed as a double whole-body PET scan starting 5 and 22 min after injection (994 ± 72 MBq), and a late view (45 min) of the prostate bed. PET/CT scans were blindly reviewed by two independent pairs of two experienced nuclear medicine physicians, discordant subgroup results being discussed to reach a consensus for positive, negative end equivocal results.PET results were concordant in 88 out of 92 local, regional and distant findings (Cohen's kappa 0.929).

EutD is composed only by this domain and belongs to the  operon. This enzyme has not been characterized yet, and its relationship to the multimodular E. coli phosphotransacetylase (Pta) remains unclear. In the present work, a detailed characterization of EutD from E. coli (EcEutD) was performed. The enzyme is a more efficient phosphotransacetylase than E. coli Pta (EcPta) in catalyzing its reaction in either direction and assembles as a dimer, being differentially modulated by EcPta effectors. When comparing EutD and Pta, both from E. coli, certain divergent regions of the primary structure responsible for their unique properties can be found. The growth on acetate of the E. coli pta acs double-mutant strain, was complemented by either introducing EcEutD or by inducing the eut operon with . In this case, the expression of a phosphotransacetylase different from Pta was confirmed by activity assays. Overall, the results indicate that EcEutD and Pta, although able to catalyse the same reaction, display differential efficiency and regulation, and also differ in the induction of their expression. However, under certain growth conditions, they can fulfil equal roles in E. coli metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766073>A metabolite of Danshen formulae attenuates cardiac fibrosis induced by isoprenaline, via a NOX2/ROS/p38 pathway.</a></h2><p>Cardiac fibrosis is a common feature of advanced coronary heart disease and is characteristic of heart disease. However, currently available drugs against cardiac fibrosis are still very limited. Here, we have assessed the role of isopropyl 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxylpropanoate (IDHP), a new metabolite of Danshen Dripping Pills, in cardiac fibrosis mediated by the β-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, and its underlying mechanisms.Identification of IDHP was identified by mass spectrometry, and proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Myocardial collagen was quantitatively assessed with Picrosirius Red staining. Expression of mRNA for collagen was evaluated with real-time PCR. Phosphorylated and total p38 MAPK, NADPH oxidase (NOX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were analysed by Western blot. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was evaluated by dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescent staining. NOX2 was knocked down using specific siRNA.IDHP attenuated β-adrenoceptor mediated cardiac fibrosis in vivo and inhibited isoprenaline-induced proliferation of neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) and collagen I synthesis in vitro. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which is an important mediator in the pathogenesis of isoprenaline-induced cardiac fibrosis, was inhibited by IDHP. This inhibition of phospho-p38 by IDHP was dependent on decreased generation of ROS. These effects of IDHP were abolished in NRCFs treated with siRNA for NOX2.IDHP attenuated the cardiac fibrosis induced by isoprenaline through a NOX2/ROS/p38 pathway. These novel findings suggest that IDHP is a potential pharmacological candidate for the treatment of cardiac fibrosis, induced by β-adrenoceptor agonists.© 2015 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20197426>Choosing asthma step-up care.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25243777>Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough.</a></h2><p>Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low-income countries. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 2014, Issue 2), accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to 30 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 30 January 2014), AMED (1985 to 30 January 2014), CINAHL (1980 to 30 January 2014) and LILACS (30 January 2014). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress.We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated searches in 2012 and 2014. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay. We included 12 trials of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135), mainly from high-income countries, including a total of 578 participants. Ten trials recruited children (N = 448 participants). Two trials recruited adolescents and adults (N = 130 participants). We considered only three trials to be of high methodological quality (one trial each of diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin and montelukast). Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials, including a total of 196 participants, reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 8.5 (N = 49 participants from one trial). One trial on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02, N = 47 participants) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4, N = 46 participants). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4, N = 11 participants from one trial) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per day (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7, N = 42 participants from two trials). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo (N = 47 participants) reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough.

Six multiparous (lactation number = 1.5 +/- 0.8 SD) Holstein dairy cows were at 41 d in milk (+/- 9 SD) at the start of the experiment. Propylene glycol used was a dry product containing 65% PG, and choline was a rumen-protected choline product (RPC; estimated to be 50% rumen-protected) containing 50% choline chloride. In comparison I, treatments compared were 1) control: no PG; 2) PG-TMR: 250 g/d of dry PG (corresponding to 162.5 g/d of PG) incorporated into the TMR; and 3) PG-top dress: 250 g/d of dry PG top-dressed onto the TMR. In comparison II, treatments compared were 1) control: no PG and no RPC; 2) PG: 250 g/d of dry PG incorporated into the TMR; 3) RPC: 50 g/d of RPC top-dressed onto the TMR; and 4) PG+RPC: combination of treatments 2 and 3. In comparison III, treatments compared were 0, 25, and 50 g/d of RPC top-dressed onto the TMR. Each experimental period lasted 10 d with 9 d of adaptation followed by 1 d of serial blood sampling. Dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily. During the serial blood sampling, jugular blood was sampled every 20 min for the first 4 h and at 8 and 12 h after treatment administration. Results obtained from comparison I showed that feeding 250 g/d of PG as a dry product decreased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration (mean +/- SEM) from 701 +/- 81 (control) to 564 +/- 76 micromol/L without affecting serum insulin, plasma glucose, or plasma nonesterified  acid concentrations. Top-dressing PG decreased plasma BHBA concentrations more than by incorporating it into the TMR [527 vs. 601 micromol/L (+/- 81 pooled SEM)]. Results obtained from comparison II showed that supplementing choline as RPC, PG, or both had no effect on dry matter intake, milk yield, or any of the blood parameters measured. Results obtained from comparison III showed that milk yield tended to increase linearly with increasing amounts of dietary choline as RPC. We concluded that feeding PG as a dry product reduced plasma BHBA concentration but top-dressing PG was more efficient at reducing plasma BHBA level than incorporating PG into the TMR. Dietary choline as RPC tended to increase milk yield linearly. However, a combined effect of dietary PG and choline was not evident and therefore not beneficial.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602583>Complementary and alternative medicine use and adherence to asthma medications among Latino and non-Latino white families.</a></h2><p>The current study sought to evaluate patterns of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in a sample of Latino and non-Latino white (NLW) children with asthma to determine whether parental beliefs about conventional medications and barriers to obtaining these medications were related to CAM use and to assess whether CAM use was associated with decreased adherence to controller medications.Participants included 574 families of children with asthma from NLW, Puerto Rican (PR), and Dominican backgrounds from Rhode Island (RI) and from Island PR. All parents completed a brief checklist of barriers to medication use and an assessment of CAM approaches. A subsample of 259 families had controller medication use monitored objectively for approximately 1 month by MDILog (fluticasone propionate), TrackCap (montelukast), or dosage counter (fluticasone/salmeterol combination).Prevalence of CAM use was high among Latino families. Perceived barriers to obtaining medication were related to increased CAM use in PR families from RI. Elevated medication concerns were positively associated with CAM use among NLW and Island PR families. CAM use was positively related to objective adherence within NLW families, and unrelated in other groups.CAM use is common among Latino families with asthma. Among some families, CAM use may be initiated as a way to cope with barriers to obtaining medication or when parents have concerns about conventional medications. Families who report CAM use do not appear to be substituting CAM for conventional asthma medication.Copyright © 2014 Academic Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of DVS on visceral hypersensitivity and solid gastric emptying in a rodent model of gastric hyperalgesia. Twenty-eight gastric hyperalgesia rats and 20 control rats were used. Visceral sensitivity during gastric distention (GD) was assessed by recording of electromyogram (EMG) at pressures of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mmHg. DVS with doses of 1, 10, and 30 mg/kg were administrated by gavage, 5-HT1A antagonist (WAY-100635, 0.3 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously, and 5-HT2A antagonist (ketanserin, 1 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally. The level of norepinephrine in plasma was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that 1) visceral hypersensitivity induced by acetic acid was validated. 2) DVS dose-dependently reduced visceral hypersensitivity in the gastric hypersensitivity rats. The EMG (% of baseline value without GD) during GD at 60 and 80 mmHg with DVS at a dose of 30 mg/kg were 119.4 ± 2.3% (vs. saline 150.9 ± 2.7%, P < 0.001) and 128.2 ± 3.2% (vs. saline 171.1 ± 2.4%, P < 0.001). Similar findings were observed at a dose of 10 mg/kg. DVS at a dose of 1 mg/kg reduced visceral hypersensitivity only during GD at 60 mmHg. 3) Neither WAY-100635 nor ketanserin blocked the effect of DVS on visceral sensitivity. 4) DVS at 30 mg/kg significantly increased plasma NE level (P = 0.012 vs. saline). 5) DVS at 30 mg/kg significantly delayed solid gastric emptying (P < 0.05 vs. saline). We conclude that DVS reduces visceral sensitivity in a rodent model of visceral hypersensitivity and delays solid gastric emptying.

The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites in mouse brain regions were also simultaneously determined by HPLC-ECD.It was observed that 13 compounds showed significant reductions in the immobility time in the FST at a concentration of 50 mg/kg. Compound 2b was found to have the most potent antidepressant activity in the FST and the TST for 30 min after treatment. Compound 2b significantly increased the concentrations of the main neurotransmitters 5-HT, NE and the metabolite (5-HIAA, suggesting that the effects of compound 2b may be mediated through these neurotransmitters.

In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities.We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles.All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review.Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials.Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross-over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight-reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence.Seven trials tested anti-diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc-aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified.There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses.Zinc-aluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group.It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta-analysis.The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well-designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19615730>Asthma morbidity among inner-city adolescents receiving guidelines-based therapy: role of predictors in the setting of high adherence.</a></h2><p>With the expanding effort to provide guidelines-based therapy to adolescents with asthma, attention must be directed to evaluating which factors predict future asthma control when guidelines-based management is applied.We evaluated the role of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in parts per billion, markers of allergic sensitization, airway inflammation, and measures of asthma severity in determining future risk of asthma symptoms and exacerbations in adolescents and young adults participating in the Asthma Control Evaluation study.Five hundred forty-six inner-city residents, ages 12 through 20 years, with persistent asthma were extensively evaluated at study entry for predictors of future symptoms and exacerbations over the subsequent 46 weeks, during which guidelines-based, optimal asthma management was offered. Baseline measurements included fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in parts per billion, total IgE, allergen-specific IgE, allergen skin test reactivity, asthma symptoms, lung function, peripheral blood eosinophils, and, for a subset, airway hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophils.The baseline characteristics we examined accounted for only a small portion of the variance for future maximum symptom days and exacerbations--11.4% and 12.6%, respectively. Future exacerbations were somewhat predicted by asthma symptoms, albuterol use, previous exacerbations, and lung function, whereas maximum symptom days were predicted, also to a modest extent, by symptoms, albuterol use, and previous exacerbations, but not lung function.Our findings demonstrate that the usual predictors of future disease activity have little predictive power when applied to a highly adherent population with persistent asthma that is receiving guidelines-based care. Thus, new predictors need to be identified that will be able to measure the continued fluctuation of disease that persists in highly adherent, well-treated populations such as the one studied.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464725>[Stimulation of gastric mucosa afferents by phenylephrine potentiates anticonvulsive and eliminates sedative action of sodium valproate in the pentylenetetrazol kindling model in rats].</a></h2><p>Sodium valproate after chronic intragastric administration in the high dose of 100-200 mg/kg eliminates generalized clonic-tonic pentylenetetrazol seizures in 100 % of rats, but only in 33-57 % of rats it prevents local clonic kindling seizures.

Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in CVA, but there are no reports on their effectiveness in AC. To evaluate the antitussive effect of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in CVA and AC.Seventy-five patients with chronic cough received diagnostic bronchodilator therapy with oral clenbuterol hydrochloride for 6 days. Of the 75 patients, 48 and 27 met the simplified diagnostic criteria for CVA and AC, respectively. Patients with CVA were randomly divided into 3 groups: montelukast, clenbuterol, and montelukast plus clenbuterol. Patients with AC were randomly divided into 2 groups: montelukast and placebo. The efficacy of cough treatment was assessed with a subjective cough symptom scale (0 meant "no cough" and 10 denoted "cough as bad as at first visit"). The cough scale, pulmonary function test, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) were evaluated before and after 2 weeks of treatment.In patients with CVA, 2-week treatment with montelukast, clenbuterol, and montelukast plus clenbuterol all significantly decreased cough scores and treatment with montelukast plus clenbuterol was superior to treatment with montelukast alone. In the montelukast plus clenbuterol group, PEF values in the morning and evening significantly increased after 2 weeks compared with values before treatment.

Samter's triad is a subset of AERD where adult patients develop nasal polyps, asthma, and sensitivity to aspirin. This condition is thought not to occur before the third decade of life. We report a 13-year-old boy with nasal polyps who suffered a life-threatening exacerbation of asthma during a graded aspirin challenge. Resuscitation required positive pressure ventilation and inotropic support. Our observations confirm that classical Samter's triad can occur in children. We suggest that graded aspirin challenges in children are undertaken in a facility with equipment and staff trained for resuscitation. Consideration should be given to this rare complication when prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the perioperative period.

However, this disease has not been adequately explored in the elderly. This study was performed to determine how the addition of montelukast to antiasthmatic therapy improves the control of severe asthma in elderly patients.Elderly patients (>60 years old) with diagnoses of severe asthma were observed over 24 months of therapy: the first 12 months using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and the second 12 months with oral montelukast added in two-thirds of the patients, with the remaining third representing the control group. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the percentage of days without asthma symptoms in the first 12 months of treatment compared with the percentage after adding montelukast therapy.A total of 512 elderly, asthmatic patients were included in the study: seventy-one (13.9%) patients had well-controlled asthma, 211 (41.2%) had partly controlled asthma, and 230 (44.9%) had uncontrolled asthma. During the first year of treatment using ICS and LABA, an increase in the median percentage of days without asthma was observed from 50.1% to 62.1%, as well as a decrease in the percentage of days with short beta-receptor agonist use, from 52.2% to 46.8%. These differences were significantly greater after 12 months, when montelukast was added to the therapy (78.4% and 39.5%, respectively). This improvement was not observed in the control group. After 2 years of observation, the median number of asthma exacerbation incidents per patient decreased from 1.6 per year to 1.2 per year when montelukast was added.Severe asthma in elderly patients is very poorly treated, with this population exhibiting very low compliance with antiasthmatic therapy.

Twenty-three nonlactating, multiparous, pregnant Holstein cows were ranked by BW and BCS 21 d before expected date of calving and immediately were assigned to receive (n = 12) or not receive (control; n = 11) RPC until 45 d in milk (DIM). Cows supplemented with RPC received (as-fed basis) 50 and 100 g/d of RPC (18.8% choline) before and after calving, respectively. Before calving, cows were maintained in 2 drylot pens according to treatment with ad libitum access to corn silage, and individually they received (as-fed basis) 3 kg/cow daily of a concentrate. Upon calving, cows were moved to 2 adjacent drylot pens according to treatment, milked twice daily, offered (as-fed basis) 35 kg/cow daily of corn silage, and individually received a concentrate formulated to meet their nutritional requirements after milking. The RPC was individually offered to cows as a topdressing into the morning concentrate feeding. Before calving, cow BW and BCS were recorded weekly, and blood samples were collected every 5 d beginning on d -21 relative to expected calving date. Upon calving and until 45 DIM, BW and BCS were recorded weekly, individual milk production was recorded daily, and milk samples were collected once a week and analyzed for fat, protein, and total solids. Blood samples were collected every other day from 0 to 20 DIM and every 5 d from 20 to 45 DIM. Based on actual calving dates, cows receiving RPC or control began receiving treatments 16.8 ± 1.7 and 17.3 ± 2.0 d before calving, respectively. No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.18) on postpartum concentrate intake, BW and BCS, or serum concentrations of cortisol, β-hydroxybutyrate, NEFA, glucose, and IGF-I. Cows supplemented with RPC had greater (P ≤ 0.01) mean serum haptoglobin and insulin concentrations compared with control. Cows supplemented with RPC had greater (P < 0.01) milk protein, total solids (P < 0.01), and milk fat concentrations (P = 0.09) compared with control. No treatment effects were detected (P ≥ 0.43) for milk yield parameters, such as fat-corrected or solids-corrected milk yield.

Like ghrelin, the glucotropic hormone glucagon increases in the fasting state and serves to normalize energy levels. We hypothesized that glucagon can directly stimulate stomach ghrelin production. To verify this hypothesis, we used a primary culture of dispersed rat stomach cells. We first demonstrated that stomach ghrelin cells express the glucagon receptor (GluR). Glucagon (1-100 nM) significantly stimulated ghrelin secretion and proghrelin mRNA expression, and co-incubation with a GluR inhibitor prevented glucagon's action. The MAP kinase inhibitor (PD98058) reduced the glucagon-stimulated ghrelin secretion and proghrelin mRNA expression. Furthermore, glucagon treatment increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Glucagon also increased intracellular cAMP levels, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase reduced glucagon's effect on ghrelin secretion. Surprisingly, inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) (using H89 and phosphorothioate [Rp]-cAMP) did not prevent glucagon-stimulated ghrelin secretion. Instead, inhibiting the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) with Brefeldin-A was able to significantly reduce glucagon-stimulated ghrelin secretion. Furthermore, the EPAC agonist (8-pCPT) significantly stimulated ghrelin secretion. Depleting endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores or blocking voltage-dependant calcium channels prevented glucagon stimulated ghrelin secretion. Finally, co-incubation with the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine potentiated the glucagon stimulation of ghrelin secretion. Our findings are the first to show a direct link between glucagon and stomach ghrelin production and secretion and highlight the role of MAPK, the PKA-independent EPAC pathway, and the synergy between norepinephrine and glucagon in ghrelin release.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27812898>Effective Biotransformation of Ethyl 4-Chloro-3-Oxobutanoate into Ethyl (S)-4-Chloro-3-Hydroxybutanoate by Recombinant E. coli CCZU-T15 Whole Cells in [ChCl][Gly]-Water Media.</a></h2><p>To increase the biocatalytic activity of Escherichia coli CCZU-T15 whole cells, choline chloride/glycerol ([ChCl][Gly]) was firstly used as biocompatible solvent for the effective biotransformation of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) into ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate [(S)-CHBE].

Lipid concentrations were measured in brains subjected to high-energy microwave fixation.The high-sucrose compared with control diet induced insulin resistance, and increased phosphorylated-cPLA2 protein, cPLA2 and iPLA2 activity and 12-lipoxygenase mRNA, but decreased BDNF mRNA and protein, and drebrin mRNA.

The reactor that was constructed with three phases to facilitate attached biofilm and suspended biomass retention for degradation of the complex and challenging MEAw performed well. A feed strategy of step-wise increasing organic loading rate (OLR) by either increasing feed MEAw concentration or the hydraulic loading rate was applied. The system performance was evaluated by chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, methane yield, MEA removal, and the accumulation of ammonia and   acid (VFA). The total COD removal efficiency initially was 93% when the feed was mainly easily degradable co-substrate. The total removal dropped to 75% at the end when MEAw constituted 60% of the feed COD. Ion chromatography results show that the MEA and some unidentified feed chemicals were almost completely consumed. The main products of MEAw degradation were ammonia, VFAs and biogas. The ammonia nitrogen concentration reached about 2.0 g/L, which may explain the observed inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis leading to acetate accumulation. Methane accounted for up to 80% of the biogas generated. The highest methane yield was 0.34 L/g-COD while the yield was 0.16 L/g-COD at the highest load.

In female rats, we found that AgNPs (4.5 and 9 mg AgNP/kg bw/day) and ionic silver (9 mg Ag/kg bw/day) increased the dopamine concentration in the brain following 28 days of oral administration. The concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the brain was increased only by AgNP at a dose of 9 mg Ag/kg bw/day. Only AgAc (9 mg Ag/kg bw/day) was found to increase noradrenaline concentration in the brain. In contrast to the results obtained from a 28-day exposure, the dopamine concentration in the brain was decreased by AgNPs (2.25 and 4.5mg/kg bw/day) following a 14-day exposure. These data suggest that there are differential effects of silver on dopamine depending on the length of exposure. In vitro, AgNPs, AgAc and a 12 kDa filtered sub-nano AgNP fraction were used to investigate cell death mechanisms in neuronal-like PC12 cells. AgNPs and the 12 kDa filtered fraction decreased cell viability to a similar extent, whereas AgAc was relatively more potent. AgNPs did not induce necrosis. However, apoptosis was found to be equally increased in cells exposed to AgNPs and the 12kDa filtered fraction, with AgAc showing a greater potency. Both the mitochondrial and the death receptor pathways were found to be involved in AgNP- and AgAc-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, 14 nm AgNPs and AgAc affected brain neurotransmitter concentrations. AgNP affected 5-HT, AgAc affected noradrenaline, whereas both silver formulations affected dopamine. Furthermore, apoptosis was observed in neuronal-like cells exposed to AgNPs, a 12 kDa filtered fraction of AgNP, and AgAc. These findings suggest that ionic silver and a 14 nm AgNP preparation have similar neurotoxic effects; a possible explanation for this could be the release and action of ionic silver from the surface of AgNPs.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Microorganisms are the only natural sources of B(12)-derivatives, and the latter are "vitamins" for other B(12)-requiring organisms. Some B(12)-dependent enzymes catalyze complex isomerisation reactions, such as methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. They need coenzyme B(12), an organometallic B(12)-derivative, to induce enzymatic radical reactions. Another group of widely relevant enzymes catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups, such as methionine synthase, which uses methylcobalamin as cofactor. This tutorial review covers structure and reactivity of B(12)-derivatives and structural aspects of their interactions with proteins and nucleotides, which are crucial for the efficient catalysis by the important B(12)-dependent enzymes, and for achieving and regulating uptake and transport of B(12)-derivatives.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19192994>Efficacy of add-on montelukast in patients with non-controlled asthma: a Belgian open-label study.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the efficacy of add-on montelukast on asthma control and allergic rhinitis symptoms in asthmatic patients still symptomatic with chronic treatment with inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta(2) agonist (ICS/LABA), irrespective of the dose.This 2-month, open-label, real-life, multicentre, observational study was undertaken by 499 general practitioners in Belgium. Patients (>or= 4 years old) with uncontrolled asthma despite fluticasone/salmeterol or budesonide/formoterol therapy had oral montelukast 4, 5, or 10 mg daily added to their therapy, depending on the registered dose for their age. Asthma control, assessed by the 6-item Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was recorded at baseline and after 2 months of treatment with montelukast and the patients' global evaluation of asthma was also recorded at the end of the study. Concomitant allergic rhinitis symptoms were evaluated according to the patients' perception.A total of 5769 patients were eligible for analysis. Addition of montelukast was associated with significant decrease in mean (SD) ACQ score (from 1.97 [0.77] at baseline to 1.05 [0.69] after add-on treatment, p < 0.001). There was also a significant improvement in all individual symptoms of the ACQ score (p < 0.001). After 2 months, 89% of the patients reported global improvement of their asthma, with a good correlation between patients' global evaluation and change in ACQ scores. Of the 2442 patients who reported allergic rhinitis symptoms at baseline, 91% showed a global improvement of their asthma symptoms and 82% in their rhinitis symptoms after adding montelukast.This open-label observational study showed an improvement, after 2 months of add-on therapy with montelukast, in both asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms in patients not adequately controlled on a fixed association of ICS/LABA.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28385597>Ester-to-amide rearrangement of -derived prodrugs of sobetirome with increased blood-brain barrier penetration.</a></h2><p>Current therapeutic options for treating demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) do not stimulate myelin repair, thus creating a clinical need for therapeutic agents that address axonal remyelination. Thyroid hormone is known to play an important role in promoting developmental myelination and repair, and CNS permeable thyromimetic agents could offer an increased therapeutic index compared to endogenous thyroid hormone. Sobetirome is a clinical stage thyromimetic that has been shown to have promising activity in preclinical models related to MS and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a genetic disease that involves demyelination. Here we report a new series of sobetirome prodrugs containing -based promoieties that were found to undergo an intramolecular O,N acyl migration to form the pharmacologically relevant amide species. Several of these systemically administered prodrugs deliver more sobetirome to the brain compared to unmodified sobetirome. Pharmacokinetic properties of the parent drug sobetirome and amidoalcohol prodrug 3 are described and prodrug 3 was found to be more potent than sobetirome in target engagement in the brain from systemic dosing.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Though the simultaneous presence of frost erythema, Wischnewski spots, hemorrhages into the synovial membrane, bloody discoloration of synovial fluid of the knee, and basal vacuolization of the renal tubular epithelial cells has been indicated as strongly supportive of fatal hypothermia, their absence does not allow the diagnosis of hypothermia to be ruled out. Postmortem biochemical investigations are valuable in detecting adaptation responses to cold stress and metabolic changes that occur following cold exposure. However, ethanol intoxication prevents appearance of adaptation responses to cold, rendering the diagnosis less obvious. Immunohistochemistry, postmortem imaging, and molecular pathology have shown promising results, although at present, they do not provide pathognomonic signs of fatal hypothermia. The aim of this article is to present a review of the literature covering the significance of different postmortem investigations that are associated with hypothermia fatalities.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21990055>[What helps for persistent symptoms of asthma during inhalative steroid therapy?].</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331777>Linear polymer separation using carbon-nanotube-modified centrifugal filter units.</a></h2><p>The separation of linear polymers such as polysaccharides and polyethylene glycol was performed with modified commercial centrifugal filter units. The deposition of a 0.16-0.35 μm layer of modified carbon nanotubes prevented permeation of linear polymers of molecular weight higher than 20 000 Da through the membrane. It allowed facile purification of solution of 0.1 g of polymer samples from small molecules within 25 min by using a bench-top centrifuge. The structure of modified carbon nanotubes was optimized in order to achieve good adhesion to the low binding regenerated cellulose surface and low solubility in aqueous solutions after deposition. The best modification of carbon nanotubes was oxidation and subsequent amide formation of diethanolamine. Introduction of acetic acid groups using sodium chloroacetate worked equally well. The modified filter could be used multiple times without the decrease of the efficiency. The carbon nanotubes layer was stable in aqueous solutions in a pH range of 1-7. The proposed method provides a convenient way of purification of modified polymers in research areas such as drug delivery or macromolecular probes synthesis.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The study design included the variables of the Stewart approach and focused on the effective strong ion difference. Because adverse hemodynamic effects have been reported when using acetate buffered solutions in hemodialysis, hemodynamics were also evaluated.Twenty-four women who had undergone abdominal gynecologic surgery and who had received either Ringer's lactate (Strong Ion Difference 28 mmol/L; n = 12) or an acetate-based solution (Strong Ion Difference 36.8 mmol/L; n = 12) according to an established clinical protocol and its precursor were included in the investigation. After induction of general anesthesia, a set of acid-base variables, hemodynamic values and serum electrolytes was measured three times during the next 120 minutes.Patients received a mean dose of 4,054 ± 450 ml of either one or the other of the solutions. In terms of mean arterial blood pressure and norepinephrine requirements there were no differences to observe between the study groups. pH and serum HCO3- concentration decreased slightly but significantly only with Ringer's lactate. In addition, the acetate-based solution kept the plasma effective strong ion difference more stable than Ringer's lactate.Both of the solutions provided hemodynamic stability. Concerning consistency of acid base parameters none of the solutions seemed to be inferior, either. Whether the slight advantages observed for the acetate-buffered solution in terms of stability of pH and plasma HCO3- are clinically relevant, needs to be investigated in a larger randomized controlled trial.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20651459>Increased noradrenergic activity in the ventromedial hypothalamus during treadmill running in rats.</a></h2><p>Physical exercise dramatically increases the energy expenditure of animals. In terms of energy substrate, at the onset of exercise, the contribution of carbohydrates to the energy expenditure is relatively predominant, and decreases gradually with the progression of exercise, while fat consumption increases progressively. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a nucleus in the hypothalamus that regulates whole body energy metabolism via the sympathetic nervous system. Some reports have indicated that noradrenergic projections to the VMH are involved in energy metabolism during exercise. However, it is not clear whether exercise influences the activity of noradrenergic projections to the VMH. We hypothesize that during exercise, noradrenergic neurons projecting to the VMH are activated, and play an important part in enhancing fat oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we used in vivo microdialysis to investigate the effect of exercise on the activity of monoaminergic (noradrenaline: NA, dopamine: DA, serotonin: 5-HT) neurons projecting to the VMH of rats. Rats were subjected to running at 15 m/min (incline 3 degrees) for 60 min. During treadmill running, noradrenergic and dopaminergic activities increased significantly in the VMH. Extracellular 5-HT concentrations in the VMH did not change during treadmill running at the exercise intensity. Given the known effects of NA in the VMH on energy metabolism, our results suggest that the increase in noradrenergic activity in the VMH is related to the enhancement of fat oxidation during exercise.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23442907>Energy for wild-type acetylcholine receptor channel gating from different choline derivatives.</a></h2><p>Agonists, including the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), bind at two sites in the neuromuscular ACh receptor channel (AChR) to promote a reversible, global change in protein conformation that regulates the flow of ions across the muscle cell membrane. In the synaptic cleft, ACh is hydrolyzed to acetate and choline. Replacement of the transmitter's ester acetyl group with a hydroxyl (ACh→choline) results in a + 1.8 kcal/mol reduction in the energy for gating generated by each agonist molecule from a low- to high-affinity change of the transmitter binding site (ΔG(B)). To understand the distinct actions of structurally related agonist molecules, we measured ΔG(B) for 10 related choline derivatives. Replacing the hydroxyl group of choline with different substituents, such as hydrogen, chloride, methyl, or amine, increased the energy for gating (i.e., it made ΔG(B) more negative relative to choline). Extending the ethyl hydroxide tail of choline to propyl and butyl hydroxide also increased this energy. Our findings reveal the amount of energy that is available for the AChR conformational change provided by different, structurally related agonists. We speculate that a hydrogen bond between the choline hydroxyl and the backbone carbonyl of αW149 positions this agonist's quaternary ammonium group so as to reduce the cation-π interaction between this moiety and the aromatic groups at the binding site.Copyright © 2013 Biophysical Society.

Results for growth of wild-type DOT-T1E on 90 different carbon sources revealed the existence of a number of previously uncharted catabolic pathways for compounds such as salicylate, quinate, phenylethanol, gallate, and hexanoate, among others. Subsequent screening on the subset of compounds on which wild-type DOT-TIE could grow with four knockout strains in the global regulatory genes Deltacrc, Deltacrp, DeltacyoB, and DeltaptsN allowed analysis of the global response to nutrient supply and stress. The data revealed that most global regulator mutants could grow in a wide variety of substrates, indicating that metabolic fluxes are physiologically balanced. It was found that the Crc mutant did not differ much from the wild-type regarding the use of carbon sources. However, certain pathways are under the preferential control of one global regulator, i.e., metabolism of succinate and d-fructose is influenced by CyoB, and l-arginine is influenced by PtsN. Other pathways can be influenced by more than one global regulator; i.e., l-valine catabolism can be influenced by CyoB and Crp (cyclic AMP receptor protein) while phenylethylamine is affected by Crp, CyoB, and PtsN. These results emphasize the cross talk required in order to ensure proper growth and survival. With respect to N sources, DOT-T1E can use a wide variety of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources. As with the carbon sources, more than one global regulator affected growth with some nitrogen sources; for instance, growth with nucleotides, dipeptides, d-amino , and  is influenced by Crp, CyoB, and PtsN. A surprising finding was that the Crp mutant was unable to flourish on ammonium. Results for assayed sulfur sources revealed that CyoB controls multiple points in methionine/cysteine catabolism while PtsN and Crc are needed for N-acetyl-l-cysteamine utilization. Growth of global regulator mutants was also influenced by stressors of different types (antibiotics, oxidative agents, and metals). Overall and in combination with results for growth in the presence of various stressors, these phenomics assays provide multifaceted insights into the complex decision-making process involved in nutrient supply, optimization, and survival.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27211628>Solid phase extraction of lead, cadmium and zinc on biodegradable polyhydroxybutyrate diethanol amine (PHB-DEA) polymer and their determination in water and food samples.</a></h2><p>A new biodegradable polyhydroxybutyrate diethanol amine (PHB-DEA) polymer was used as adsorbent for the sensitive and selective separation, preconcentration and determination of Pb(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) by using atomic absorption spectrometry.

Herein, we present interactions between sotalol and four conventional antiepileptic drugs: carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin and phenobarbital.Effects of sotalol and antiepileptics alone on seizures were determined in the electroconvulsive threshold test, while interactions between sotalol and antiepileptic drugs were estimated in the maximal electroshock test in mice. Motor coordination and long-term memory were evaluated, respectively, in the chimney test and passive-avoidance task. Brain concentrations of antiepileptics were determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay.Sotalol at doses up to 100mg/kg did not affect the electroconvulsive threshold. Applied at doses 60-100mg/kg, sotalol potentiated the antielectroshock action of valproate, while at doses 80-100mg/kg that of phenytoin. Sotalol (up to 100mg/kg) did not affect the action of carbamazepine or phenobarbital in the maximal electroshock. Sotalol alone and in combinations with antiepileptics impaired neither motor performance nor long-term memory in mice. Finally, sotalol did not change brain concentration of valproate and phenytoin, so pharmacokinetic interactions between the drugs are not probable.As far as obtained data may be extrapolated into clinical conditions, sotalol may be considered as an arrhythmic drug that does not reduce the action of classical antiepileptic drugs and thereby can be used in epileptic patients with cardiac arrhythmias.Copyright © 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Anesthetized male miniature pigs with complete obstruction of the left lower ureter were used to evaluate the effects of the cumulative intravenous drug administration on the elevated intraureteral pressure and mean blood pressure.The KCl-induced contractions in the isolated ureter were concentration-dependently attenuated by KUL-7211, isoproterenol, terbutaline, and CL-316243, with a rank order of potency of 6.26, 6.98, 5.41, and 5.41, respectively. In the anesthetized pigs, all 4 drugs reduced the unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced elevated intraureteral pressure in a dose-dependent manner, with KUL-7211 reducing it with a lower hypotensive effect than either isoproterenol or terbutaline. The ureteral selectivity (defined as the ratio of the effective dose to decrease the mean blood pressure by 25% to the effective dose to decrease the intraureteral pressure by 50%) of KUL-7211 (1.5) was significantly greater than that of isoproterenol (0.04) or terbutaline (0.43).The present results have demonstrated that in pigs, KUL-7211 is a potent ureteral relaxant with a relatively small hypotensive effect.

However, what happens when animals fail to get a reward is largely unknown, although this is commonly seen in behaviors such as predation. Here, we set up a behavioral model of repeated failure in reward pursuit (RFRP) in Drosophila larvae. In this model, the larvae were repeatedly prevented from reaching attractants such as yeast and butyl acetate, before finally abandoning further attempts. After giving up, they usually showed a decreased locomotor speed and impaired performance in light avoidance and sugar preference, which were named as phenotypes of RFRP states. In larvae that had developed RFRP phenotypes, the octopamine concentration was greatly elevated, while tβh mutants devoid of octopamine were less likely to develop RFRP phenotypes, and octopamine feeding efficiently restored such defects. By down-regulating tβh in different groups of neurons and imaging neuronal activity, neurons that regulated the development of RFRP states and the behavioral exhibition of RFRP phenotypes were mapped to a small subgroup of non-glutamatergic and glutamatergic octopaminergic neurons in the central larval brain. Our results establish a model for investigating the effect of depriving an expected reward in Drosophila and provide a simplified framework for the associated neural basis.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389904>Persistent febrile illness with  multisystem organ failure associated  with clozapine.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23306893>Metabolomic profilings of urine and serum from high fat-fed rats via 1H NMR spectroscopy and pattern recognition.</a></h2><p>(1)H NMR spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was applied to explore the metabolic variability in urine and serum of high fat-fed rats relative to normal chow-fed ones.

Lysis of growing cells was followed by measuring changes in turbidity and cell count. DDA promptly arrested oxygen uptake on pyruvate and acetate, due to cofactor loss rather than to enzyme denaturation, since cell-free glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and NADH dehydrogenases remained active. Formate and succinate oxidation by membrane-bound enzyme systems independent of cofactors was likewise unaffected. DDA lysed growing cells at rates related to drug concentration, pH, and the previous growth rate.Loss of cellular enzyme activity following addition of DDA is due to cofactor leakage and not to enzyme denaturation. Whereas nongrowing cells remain intact in the presence of DDA, actively-growing organisms undergo lysis, consistent with autolysin action.Cell lysis, not normally observed with membrane-active antimicrobials, also occurs with cetrimide, and may be dependent on the alkyl chain length in these compounds. The action on growing cells parallels that of penicillin and daptomycin, which bears a decanoyl residue that penetrates the cell membrane, causing leakage and membrane depolarization.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21046653>Urothelial beta-3 adrenergic receptors in the rat bladder.</a></h2><p>To investigate the distribution of beta-3 adrenergic receptors (β(3)ARs) in the rat bladder and to examine the contribution of urothelial β(3)ARs to agonist-induced suppression of bladder reflexes and relaxation of smooth muscle.Bladder tissue was collected from 8- to 10-month old female SD rats. In some samples, the urothelium was surgically separated from the smooth muscle. The expression and localization of βAR mRNA and β(3)AR protein were determined using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Contractile responses to the specific β(3)AR agonists TAK-677 and BRL37344 were measured in bladder strips with or without the urothelium. The contribution of urothelial β(3)ARs to the micturition reflex was assessed in continuous cystometry in urethane anesthetized rats using intravesical delivery of β(3)AR agonists.RT-PCR detected mRNA of all βARs in urothelium and smooth muscle. Immunostaining detected β(3)ARs throughout the urothelium, in the smooth muscle, myofibroblast-like cells, and in the peripheral nerves. Ovariectomy did not change the distribution of β(3)ARs in any bladder structure. Intravesical administration of TAK-677 and BRL37344 (1-5 × 10(-4) M) decreased voiding frequency and amplitude of bladder contractions.

Recently, hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA(2)) was found to be a receptor for a ketone body, β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), and is coupled with Gi-GTP binding protein. HCA(2) expression was reported in the guinea pig heart. Therefore, using guinea pig cardiac myocytes, we investigated effects of BHB on L-type Ca(2+) current pre-augmented with β-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol under the whole-cell voltage clamp. BHB significantly reduced the Ca(2+) current pre-augmented with isoproterenol. The effect of BHB was concentration dependent with IC(50) of 1.1 mM. Nicotinic acid (NA), another ligand for HCA(2), also exerted an effect on the Ca(2+) current similar to that of BHB. The effects of BHB and NA were reduced by a specific Gi inhibitor, pertussis toxin in the pipette solution. Our results suggest that BHB activates Gi-coupled signal transduction pathway via HCA(2) in guinea pig cardiac myocytes. The HCA(2)-mediated signal transduction may be associated with ketoacidosis-induced cardiac suppression.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19631127>Pupil size with and without adrenaline with diclofenac use before cataract surgery.</a></h2><p>To determine whether adrenaline in the irrigating solution is necessary when diclofenac eyedrops are used before cataract surgery.Pasqua Hospital, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.In this prospective randomized masked study, all patients used diclofenac eyedrops 2 days preoperatively.

One group had 0.5 mL of 1:1000 adrenaline in 500.0 mL of fortified balanced salt solution (BSS Plus) (adrenaline group). The other group did not (no-adrenaline group). The horizontal diameter of the pupils was measured with calipers.The study included 207 patients. There were no surgical complications. In the adrenaline group, the mean pupil size was 8.19 mm +/- 0.86 (SD) before the first incision, 8.14 +/- 0.87 mm after phacoemulsification, and 8.14 +/- 0.85 mm after cortical removal.

The mean pupil constriction was 0.05 +/- 0.21 mm in the adrenaline group and 0.33 +/- 0.43 mm in the no-adrenaline group. The difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test). Further analysis of preoperative pupil size showed a significant difference for smaller pupils only.When diclofenac eyedrops were used before cataract surgery, the smaller preoperative pupils constricted significantly less when adrenaline was added to the irrigating solution.

We sought to determine whether MK was able to prevent salbutamol-induced tolerance in airway smooth muscle. Homologous β2-adrenoceptor desensitisation models were established in guinea-pigs and in human bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC) by chronic salbutamol administration. Characterisation tools included measurement of the response of tracheal smooth muscle tissues to salbutamol, analysis of gene expression and receptor trafficking, evaluation of intracellular cAMP levels and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity in human bronchial smooth muscle cells. Salbutamol-induced β2-adrenoceptor desensitisation was characterised by β2-agonist hyporesponsiveness (-30%, p < 0.001) in desensitised tracheal smooth muscle, as compared to controls. MK, given intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg/day for 6 consecutive days, completely restored tissue responsiveness to salbutamol. Prolonged salbutamol treatment significantly decreased cAMP synthesis, induced a complete removal of the β2-adrenoceptor from plasma membrane with a parallel increase in the cytosol and increased PDE4D5 gene transcription and PDE activity in human bronchial smooth muscle cells. In homologously desensitised BSMC, MK 30 μM for 24 h was able to prevent salbutamol subsensitivity and such an effect was associated with inhibition of salbutamol-induced PDE4 activity and restoration of membrane β2-adrenoceptor expression and function. These findings suggest the presence of a favourable interaction between MK and β2-adrenoceptor agonists that might improve the therapeutic index of bronchodilators in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.Copyright © 2013.

Validation of the microchip method was performed using bufuralol 1-hydroxylation via CYP450 enzymes as the model reaction. The metabolite, 1-hydroxybufuralol, was easily separated from the substrate (R(s)=0.5) with very good detection sensitivity (LOD=9.3nM), linearity (range: 50-500nM, r(2)=0.9997), and repeatability (RSD(Area)=10.3%, RSD(Migrationtime)=2.5% at 80nM concentration without internal standard). The kinetic parameters of bufuralol 1-hydroxylation determined by the microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE)-ESI/mass spectrometry (MS) method, were comparable to the values presented in literature as well as to the values determined by in-house liquid chromatography (LC)-UV. In addition to enzyme kinetics, metabolic profiling was demonstrated using authentic urine samples from healthy volunteers after intake of either tramadol or paracetamol. As a result, six metabolites of tramadol and four metabolites of paracetamol, including both phase I oxidation products and phase II conjugation products, were detected and separated from each other within 30-35s. Before analysis, the urine samples were pre-treated with on-chip, on-line liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) and the results were compared to those obtained from urine samples pre-treated with conventional C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE, off-chip cartridges). On the basis of our results, the SU-8 CE-ESI/MS microchips incorporating on-chip sample pre-treatment, injection, separation, and ESI/MS detection were proven as efficient and versatile tools for drug metabolism research.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether it was associated with epigenetic histone modification and gene expression of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of norepinephrine and serotonin in rat depression model induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CUS over 28 days. It was shown that the CUS-induced rats displayed remarked anxiety- and depression-like behavior with weakened locomotor activity in open field test and prolonged immobility in forced swimming test. Western blot revealed that CUS led to significant decrease in acetylation of H3 at Lysine 9 (K9) and H4 at Lysine 12 (K12) with obviously increasing histone deacetylases 5 (HDAC5) expression in hippocampus of CUS-induced rats. Meanwhile, there was an obviously decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) both at protein and mRNA levels. Administration of sodium valproate (VPA), a histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) inhibitor, not only significantly relieved the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of CUS-induced rats but also clearly blunted decrease of H3(K9) and H4(K12) acetylation and expression of TH and TPH, and prevented increase of HDAC5 expression. The results indicate that there exists possible interrelation between TH and TPH gene expression and epigenetic histone acetylation in CUS-induced depressive rats, which at least partly contributes to the etiology of depression.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510145>Characterization of a Glycyl Radical Enzyme Bacterial Microcompartment Pathway in .</a></h2><p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are large (∼100-nm) protein shells that encapsulate enzymes, their substrates, and cofactors for the purposes of increasing metabolic reaction efficiency and protecting cells from toxic intermediates. The best-studied microcompartment is the carbon-fixing carboxysome that encapsulates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and carbonic anhydrase. Other well-known BMCs include the Pdu and Eut BMCs, which metabolize 1,2-propanediol and , respectively, with vitamin B-dependent diol dehydratase enzymes. Recent bioinformatic analyses identified a new prevalent type of BMC, hypothesized to utilize vitamin B-independent glycyl radical enzymes to metabolize substrates. Here we use genetic and metabolic analyses to undertake  characterization of the newly identified glycyl radical enzyme microcompartment 3 (GRM3) class of microcompartment clusters. Transcriptome sequencing analyses showed that the microcompartment gene cluster in the genome of the purple photosynthetic bacterium  was expressed under dark anaerobic respiratory conditions in the presence of 1,2-propanediol. High-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed that enzymes coded by this cluster metabolized 1,2-propanediol into propionaldehyde, propanol, and propionate. Surprisingly, the microcompartment pathway did not protect these cells from toxic propionaldehyde under the conditions used in this study, with buildup of this intermediate contributing to arrest of cell growth. We further show that expression of microcompartment genes is regulated by a two-component system located downstream of the microcompartment cluster. BMCs are protein shells that are designed to compartmentalize enzymatic reactions that require either sequestration of a substrate or the sequestration of toxic intermediates. Due to their ability to compartmentalize reactions, BMCs have also become attractive targets for bioengineering novel enzymatic reactions. Despite these useful features, little is known about the biochemistry of newly identified classes of BMCs. In this study, we have undertaken genetic and  metabolic analyses of the newly identified GRM3 gene cluster.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27416676>[EFFECT OF MEDIATOR-TYPE DRUGS ON HUMAN PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS DURING MODEL OPERATOR ACTIVITY].</a></h2><p>In a placebo-controlled study, changes in psychophysiological status of operators (38 healthy male volunteers aged 23-35 years) performing 4-hour model operator activity were evaluated after a single oral administration of typical representatives of the different classes of drugs (haloperidol, proroxan, yohimbine hydrochloride, propranolol, mesocarb, isoprenaline, Belladonna extract, anabasine hydrochloride, valproate sodium, and phenazepam), which are used for the treatment, rehabilitation and prophylaxis of common diseases.

Subsequently, soluble Aβ oligomers cause the loss of synaptic proteins from neurons, a histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease that correlates with the degree of dementia. In this study, the production of toxic forms of Aβ was examined in vitro using 7PA2 cells stably transfected with human APP. We show that conditioned media from 7PA2 cells containing Aβ oligomers caused synapse degeneration as measured by the loss of synaptic proteins, including synaptophysin and cysteine-string protein, from cultured neurons. Critically, conditioned media from 7PA2 cells treated with valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid (VPA)) or propylisopropylacetic acid (PIA) did not cause synapse damage. Treatment with VPA or PIA did not significantly affect total Aβ concentrations; rather these drugs selectively reduced the concentrations of Aβ oligomers in conditioned media. In contrast, treatment significantly increased the concentrations of Aβ monomers in conditioned media. VPA or PIA treatment reduced the concentrations of APP within lipid rafts, membrane compartments associated with Aβ production. These effects of VPA and PIA were reversed by the addition of platelet-activating factor, a bioactive phospholipid produced following activation of phospholipase A, an enzyme sensitive to VPA and PIA. Collectively these data suggest that VPA and PIA reduce Aβ oligomers through inhibition of phospholipase A and suggest a novel therapeutic approach to Alzheimer's treatment.Crown Copyright © 2017.

Histopathologic evaluation of naproxen-induced acute gastrointestinal damage in rats demonstrated a significant dose-dependent effect. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) of ¹H NMR from rat urine revealed a dose-dependent metabolic shift between the vehicle-treated control rats and rats treated with low-dose (10 mg/kg body weight), moderate-dose (50 mg/kg), and high-dose (100 mg/kg) naproxen, coinciding with their gastric damage scores after naproxen administration. The resultant metabolic profiles demonstrate that the naproxen-induced gastric damage exhibited energy metabolism perturbations that elevated their urinary levels of citrate, cis-aconitate, creatine, and creatine phosphate. In addition, naproxen administration decreased choline level and increased betaine level, indicating that it depleted the main protective constituent of the gastric mucosa. Moreover, naproxen stimulated the decomposition of tryptophan into kynurenate, which inhibits fibroblast growth factor-1 and delays ulcer healing.

MJ potentiated the toxic effect of yohimbine in the YLT, which further suggests antidepressant property and also indicates facilitatory effect on both serotonergic and noradrenergic systems respectively. However, MJ did not significantly alter the spontaneous motor activity of the animals, which indicates a lack of central nervous system stimulant effect.

Strategies to reduce blood loss and blood transfusion are warranted.To determine whether continuous norepinephrine administration combined with intraoperative restrictive hydration with Ringer's maleate solution can reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusion.This was a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, single-centre trial including 166 consecutive patients undergoing ORC with urinary diversion (UD). Exclusion criteria were severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and contraindications to epidural analgesia.Patients were randomly allocated to continuous norepinephrine administration starting with 2 μg/kg per hour combined with 1 ml/kg per hour until the bladder was removed, then to 3 ml/kg per hour of Ringer's maleate solution (norepinephrine/low-volume group) or 6 ml/kg per hour of Ringer's maleate solution throughout surgery (control group).Intraoperative blood loss and the percentage of patients requiring blood transfusions perioperatively were assessed.

National management guidelines have been available for many years but, unlike in adults, studies in children have been few, with their methodologies often based on inappropriate adult models. Sound medical evidence in support of the national guidelines for asthma management in children is lacking. The MASCOT study has been developed to address this need.To determine whether adding salmeterol or montelukast to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) can reduce the number of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids in children with uncontrolled asthma.A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 4-week run-in period on a fluticasone propionate inhaler (100 µg twice daily) with inhaler technique correction. Patients who met the post run-in period eligibility criteria were randomised in the ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 and were followed for 48 weeks.Secondary care hospitals based in England and Scotland with recruitment from primary and secondary care.Children aged 6-14 years with asthma requiring frequent short-acting beta-2 agonist relief, with symptoms of asthma resulting in nocturnal wakening and/or asthma that has interfered with usual activities.Three groups were compared: (1) inhaled fluticasone propionate 100 µg twice daily plus placebo tablet once daily; (2) inhaled fluticasone propionate 100 µg and salmeterol 50 µg twice daily (combination inhaler) plus placebo tablet once daily; and (3) inhaled fluticasone propionate 100 µg twice daily plus montelukast 5-mg tablet once daily.The primary outcome was the number of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids over 48 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life as measured by the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardised Activities [PAQLQ(S)] and the Paediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ); time from randomisation to first exacerbation requiring treatment with a short course of oral corticosteroids; school attendance; hospital admissions; amount of rescue beta-2 agonist therapy prescribed; time from randomisation to treatment withdrawal (because of lack of efficacy or side effects); lung function at 48 weeks (as assessed by spirometry); cost-effectiveness; adverse events.The study was closed prematurely because of poor recruitment and the target sample size of 450 was not achieved. In total, 898 children were screened to enter the trial, 166 were registered for the 4-week run-in period and 63 were randomised (group 1: 19, group 2: 23, group 3: 21), with 38 contributing data for the primary outcome analysis. There were no significant differences between groups for any of the outcomes. Adverse events were similar between the groups except for nervous system disorders, which were more frequently reported on fluticasone plus montelukast.Based on the results of the MASCOT study it is not possible to conclude whether adding salmeterol or montelukast to ICSs can reduce the number of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids in children with uncontrolled asthma.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN03556343.This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 17, No. 4.

At 47 ± 6 d before the expected calving date, 93 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Cows were fed energy to excess [EXE; 1.63 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter (DM)] or to maintenance (MNE; 1.40 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of DM) in ad libitum amounts throughout the nonlactating period. The RPC was top-dressed for 17 ± 4.6 d prepartum through 21 d postpartum (PP). After calving, cows were fed the same methionine-balanced diet, apart from RPC supplementation, through 15 wk PP. Liver was biopsied at -14, 7, 14, and 21 d relative to parturition. Cows fed EXE or MNE diets, respectively, consumed 40 or 10% more Mcal/d than required at 15 d before parturition. Cows fed the MNE compared with the EXE diet prepartum consumed 1.2 kg/d more DM postpartum but did not produce more milk (41.6 vs. 43.1 kg/d). Thus, PP cows fed the EXE diet prepartum were in greater mean negative energy balance, tended to have greater mean concentrations of circulating insulin,  , and β-hydroxybutyrate, and had greater triacylglycerol in liver tissue (8.3 vs. 10.7% of DM) compared with cows fed the MNE diet prepartum. Cows fed RPC in transition tended to produce more milk (43.5 vs. 41.3 kg/d) and energy-corrected milk (44.2 vs. 42.0 kg/d) without increasing DM intake (23.8 vs. 23.2 kg/d) during the first 15 wk PP, and tended to produce more milk over the first 40 wk PP (37.1 vs. 35.0 kg/d). Energy balance of cows fed RPC was more negative at wk 2, 3, and 6 PP, but mean circulating concentrations of   and β-hydroxybutyrate did not differ from those of cows not fed RPC. Despite differences in energy balance at 2 and 3 wk PP, mean concentration of hepatic triacylglycerol did not differ between RPC treatments. Feeding RPC reduced the daily prevalence of subclinical hypocalcemia from 25.5 to 10.5%, as defined by concentrations of total Ca of <8.0 mg/dL in serum in the first 7 d PP. Pregnancy at first artificial insemination tended to be greater for cows fed RPC (41.3 vs. 23.6%), but the proportion of pregnant cows did not differ by 40 wk PP. Heifers born from singleton calvings from cows fed RPC tended to experience greater daily gain between birth and 50 wk of age than heifers from cows not supplemented with RPC. Feeding RPC for approximately 38 d during the transition period tended to increase yield of milk for 40 wk regardless of amount of energy consumed during the pregnant, nonlactating period.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) modify genetic transcription and can diminish ROS and PIC escalation. They can also modulate levels of neurotransmitters such as catecholamines and serotonin (5-HT). Thus, this study sought to analyze the effects of the HDACi valproic acid (VA) on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotransmitter modulation via a predator exposure/psychosocial stress animal model of PTSD. PTSD-like effects were induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=6/group×4 groups). The rats were secured in Plexiglas cylinders and placed in a cage with a cat for 1h on days 1, 11, and 40 of a 40-day stress regimen. PTSD rats were also subjected to psychosocial stress via daily cage cohort changes. At the conclusion of the stress regimen, the treatment group (PTSD+VA) and control group (Control+VA) rats were given VA in their drinking water for 30 days. The rats were then euthanized and their brains were dissected to remove the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole blood was collected to assess systemic oxidative stress. ROS and PIC mRNA and protein elevation in the PTSD group were normalized with VA. Anxiety decreased in this group via improved performance on the elevated plus-maze (EPM). No changes were attributed to VA in the control group, and no improvements were noted in the vehicle groups. Results indicate VA can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation, enhance fear extinction, and correct neurotransmitter aberrancies in a rat model of PTSD.Copyright © 2014.

The Gly16Arg genotype of the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene may influence the bronchodilator effects of β2-agonists. We hypothesized that differential responses to long-acting β2-agonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists might be determined partly by the Gly16Arg polymorphism in Japanese asthma patients.This randomized, genotype-stratified, two-period crossover study included 80 patients with mild-to-moderate asthma (35 Arg/Arg and 45 Gly/Gly individuals). The primary study outcome was the difference in peak expiratory flow (ΔPEF) (ΔPEF, l/min) by genotype after 16 weeks of treatment with salmeterol (ΔPEFsal) or montelukast (ΔPEFmon). In addition, multivariate analyses were used to identify independent factors that were predictive of responses to each treatment.The mean ΔPEFsal-ΔPEFmon was 19.3±46.6 among Arg/Arg individuals and 16.8±51.5 among Gly/Gly individuals, indicating that the Gly16Arg genotype did not influence the differential bronchodilator effect of the two agents. Multivariate analysis showed that higher peripheral eosinophil counts were associated with better response to salmeterol (P<0.05).The Gly16Arg genotype did not influence the differential bronchodilator effect of salmeterol or montelukast as an add-on therapy to ICS within 16 weeks of follow-up. Higher peripheral eosinophil counts may be associated with better responses to salmeterol in combination with ICS.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406079>Characterization of A-935142, a hERG enhancer, in the presence and absence of standard hERG blockers.</a></h2><p>In a previous study we found that A-935142 enhanced hERG current in a concentration-dependent manner by facilitating activation, reducing inactivation, and slowing deactivation (Su et al., 2009). A-935142 also shortened action potential duration (APD90) in canine Purkinje fibers and guinea pig atrial tissue. This study focused on the combined effects of the prototypical hERG enhancer, A-935142 and two hERG current blockers (sotalol and terfenadine).The whole-cell voltage clamp method with HEK 293 cells heterologously expressing the hERG channel (Kv 11.1) was used.A-935142 did not compete with 3H-dofetilide binding, suggesting that A-935142 does not overlap the binding site of typical hERG blockers. In whole-cell voltage clamp studies we found: 1) 60 μM A-935142 enhanced hERG current in the presence of 150 μM sotalol (57.5±5.8%) to a similar extent as seen with A-935142 alone (55.6±5.1%); 2) 150 μM sotalol blocked hERG current in the presence of 60 μM A-935142 (43.5±1.5%) to a similar extent as that seen with sotalol alone (42.0±3.2%) and 3) during co-application, hERG current enhancement was followed by current blockade. Similar results were obtained with 60 nM terfenadine combined with A-935142.These results suggest that the hERG enhancer, A-935142 does not compete with these two known hERG blockers at their binding site within the hERG channel.

Decreased supply of plasmalogen precursors to the brain by the liver, as a result of peroxisomal deficits is a process that probably starts early in the AD disease process. To overcome this metabolic compromise, we have designed an orally bioavailable DHA-containing ether lipid precursor of plasmalogens. PPI-1011 is an alkyl-diacyl plasmalogen precursor with palmitic acid at sn-1, DHA at sn-2 and lipoic acid at sn-3. This study outlines the oral pharmacokinetics of this precursor and its conversion to PlsEtn and phosphatidylethanolamines (PtdEtn).Rabbits were dosed orally with PPI-1011 in hard gelatin capsules for time-course and dose response studies. Incorporation into PlsEtn and PtdEtn was monitored by LC-MS/MS. Metabolism of released lipoic acid was monitored by GC-MS. To monitor the metabolic fate of different components of PPI-1011, we labeled the sn-1 palmitic acid, sn-2 DHA and glycerol backbone with (13)C and monitored their metabolic fates by LC-MS/MS.PPI-1011 was not detected in plasma suggesting rapid release of sn-3 lipoic acid via gut lipases. This conclusion was supported by peak levels of lipoic acid metabolites in the plasma 3 hours after dosing. While PPI-1011 did not gain access to the plasma, it increased circulating levels of DHA-containing PlsEtn and PtdEtn. Labeling experiments demonstrated that the PtdEtn increases resulted from increased availability of DHA released via remodeling at sn-2 of phospholipids derived from PPI-1011. This release of DHA peaked at 6 hrs while increases in phospholipids peaked at 12 hr. Increases in circulating PlsEtn were more complex. Labeling experiments demonstrated that increases in the target PlsEtn, 16:0/22:6, consisted of 2 pools. In one pool, the intact precursor received a sn-3 phosphoethanolamine group and desaturation at sn-1 to generate the target plasmalogen. The second pool, like the PtdEtn, resulted from increased availability of DHA released during remodeling of sn-2. In the case of sn-1 18:0 and 18:1 plasmalogens with [(13)C(3)]DHA at sn-2, labeling was the result of increased availability of [(13)C(3)]DHA from lipid remodeling. Isotope and repeated dosing (2 weeks) experiments also demonstrated that plasmalogens and/or plasmalogen precursors derived from PPI-1011 are able to cross both the blood-retinal and blood-brain barriers.Our data demonstrate that PPI-1011, an ether lipid precursor of plasmalogens is orally bioavailable in the rabbit, augmenting the circulating levels of unesterified DHA and DHA-containing PlsEtn and PtdEtn. Other  plasmalogens were generated from the precursor via lipid remodeling (de-acylation/re-acylation reactions at sn-2) and phosphatidylethanolamines were generated via de-alkylation/re-acylation reactions at sn-1. Repeated oral dosing for 2 weeks with PPI-1011 resulted in dose-dependent increases in circulating DHA and DHA-containing plasmalogens. These products and/or precursors were also able to cross the blood-retinal and blood-brain barriers.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26017846>Modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by G protein-coupled receptors in celiac-mesenteric ganglion neurons of septic rats.</a></h2><p>Septic shock, the most severe complication associated with sepsis, is manifested by tissue hypoperfusion due, in part, to cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunction. In many cases, the splanchnic circulation becomes vasoplegic. The celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion (CSMG) sympathetic neurons provide the main autonomic input to these vessels. We used the cecal ligation puncture (CLP) model, which closely mimics the hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances observed in septic patients, to examine the properties and modulation of Ca2+ channels by G protein-coupled receptors in acutely dissociated rat CSMG neurons. Voltage-clamp studies 48 hr post-sepsis revealed that the Ca2+ current density in CMSG neurons from septic rats was significantly lower than those isolated from sham control rats. This reduction coincided with a significant increase in membrane surface area and a negligible increase in Ca2+ current amplitude. Possible explanations for these findings include either cell swelling or neurite outgrowth enhancement of CSMG neurons from septic rats. Additionally, a significant rightward shift of the concentration-response relationship for the norepinephrine (NE)-mediated Ca2+ current inhibition was observed in CSMG neurons from septic rats. Testing for the presence of opioid receptor subtypes in CSMG neurons, showed that mu opioid receptors were present in ~70% of CSMG, while NOP opioid receptors were found in all CSMG neurons tested. The pharmacological profile for both opioid receptor subtypes was not significantly affected by sepsis. Further, the Ca2+ current modulation by propionate, an agonist for the free  acid receptors GPR41 and GPR43, was not altered by sepsis. Overall, our findings suggest that CSMG function is affected by sepsis via changes in cell size and α2-adrenergic receptor-mediated Ca2+ channel modulation.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19168366>A simple, versatile, low-cost and remotely operated apparatus for [11C]acetate, [11C]choline, [11C]methionine and [11C]PIB synthesis.</a></h2><p>A simple, efficient and remotely operated synthesis apparatus for carrying out routine [(11)C]carboxylation, on-column and bubbling [(11)C]methylation was essential for reliable, day-to-day production of [(11)C]-labelled PET radiopharmaceuticals.

To this end, we developed a novel NMR-liquid chromatography/tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to directly assess pyruvate cycling relative to mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism (VPyr-Cyc/VMito) in vivo using [3-(13)C]lactate as a tracer. Using this approach, VPyr-Cyc/VMito was only 6% in overnight fasted rats. In contrast, when propionate was infused simultaneously at doses previously used as a tracer, it increased VPyr-Cyc/VMito by 20-30-fold, increased hepatic TCA metabolite concentrations 2-3-fold, and increased endogenous glucose production rates by 20-100%. The physiologic stimuli, glucagon and epinephrine, both increased hepatic glucose production, but only glucagon suppressed VPyr-Cyc/VMito These data show that under fasting conditions, when hepatic gluconeogenesis is stimulated, pyruvate recycling is relatively low in liver compared with VMito flux and that liver metabolism, in particular pyruvate cycling, is sensitive to propionate making it an unsuitable tracer to assess hepatic glycolytic, gluconeogenic, and mitochondrial metabolism in vivo.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24139497>Childhood asthma clusters and response to therapy in clinical trials.</a></h2><p>Childhood asthma clusters, or subclasses, have been developed by computational methods without evaluation of clinical utility.To replicate and determine whether childhood asthma clusters previously identified computationally in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) are associated with treatment responses in Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network clinical trials.A cluster assignment model was determined by using SARP participant data. A total of 611 participants 6 to 18 years old from 3 CARE trials were assigned to SARP pediatric clusters. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed by cluster in each trial.CARE participants were assigned to SARP clusters with high accuracy. Baseline characteristics were similar between SARP and CARE children of the same cluster. Treatment response in CARE trials was generally similar across clusters. However, with the caveat of a smaller sample size, children in the early-onset/severe-lung function cluster had best response with fluticasone/salmeterol (64% vs 23% 2.5× fluticasone and 13% fluticasone/montelukast in the Best ADd-on Therapy Giving Effective Responses trial; P = .011) and children in the early-onset/comorbidity cluster had the least clinical efficacy to treatments (eg, -0.076% change in FEV1 in the Characterizing Response to Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist and Inhaled Corticosteroid trial).In this study, we replicated SARP pediatric asthma clusters by using a separate, large clinical trials network.

Effective medication needs multiple drug therapy as recommended cholesterol and triglyceride levels are difficult to achieve by monotherapy and frequently require the use of more than one lipid-lowering medication. Gemfibrozil lowers plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins mainly VLDL and increases HDL. It is associated with short plasma half-life (1.5h) and GIT distress on long term use. In a study it was found that  decreases serum cholesterol, especially VLDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in rats fed an HF/HC diet. In the present work, we thought of exploring the effect of co-drug of gemfibrozil with  (GE-I) as a potential combination therapy for the management of mixed hyperlipidemia. Synthesis of GE-I was effected by CDI coupling. Structure was confirmed spectrally. Interestingly kinetic studies revealed that GE-I resisted chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis.

An amide analogue of DEVA (DEVAMIDE) was also synthesized and evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of DEVA and DEVAMIDE was comparatively evaluated in rats.In rats DEVA acted as a prodrug of VPA and had ED(50) values of 73 mg/kg and 158 mg/kg in the MES and the hippocampal kindling models, respectively. At these two anticonvulsant models DEVA was seven-times more potent than VPA. DEVAMIDE was active in the MES test at doses of 100 mg/kg (mice) and its rat-MES-ED(50)=38.6 mg/kg however, its protective index (PI=TD(50)/ED(50)) was twice lower than DEVA's PI. The TMCA analogues were inactive at the mice MES and scMet models. DEVA underwent rapid metabolic hydrolysis to VPA and consequently, in its pharmacokinetic analysis only VPA plasma levels were monitored. In contrast, DEVAMIDE was stable in whole blood.DEVA acts in rats as a prodrug of VPA yet shows a more potent anticonvulsant activity than VPA. DEVAMIDE acted as the drug on its own and was more potent than DEVA at the rat-MES test.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Male albino Wistar rats were pretreated with p-coumaric acid (8 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 7 days after which isoproterenol (100mg/kg body weight) was injected subcutaneously into rats twice at an interval of 24h (8th and 9th day).The activity/levels of serum cardiac diagnostic markers, heart lysosomal lipid peroxidation products and the activities of lysosomal enzymes (β-glucuronidase, β-galactosidase, cathepsin-B and cathepsin-D) were significantly (P<0.05) increased in the serum and heart of isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats. Isoproterenol also lowered the activities of β-glucuronidase and cathepsin-D in the lysosomal fraction.

In addition, p-coumaric acid greatly reduced myocardial infarct size. p-Coumaric acid pretreatment (8 mg/kg body weight) to normal rats did not show any significant effect. Thus, this study showed that p-coumaric acid prevents lysosomal dysfunction against cardiac damage induced by isoproterenol and brings back the levels of lipid peroxidation products and activities of lysosomal enzymes to near normal levels.

In this study we determined whether the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) interplays with other vasopressor pathways in mediating the CSA actions.Whole animal and isolated vascular preparations were employed to determine the effects of pharmacologic interruption of angiotensin II (Ang II), endothelin (ET), or thromboxane (TXA2) signaling on the adverse cardiovascular effects of CSA.CSA (25mg/kg/day i.p. for 7days) caused significant increases in BP that were paralleled with (i) reduced BRS measured by phenylephrine (BRSPE) or sodium nitroprusside (BRSSNP), (ii) enhanced aortic contractile responses to Ang II and U-46619 (thromboxane analogue), and (iii) reduced aortic eNOS expression and acetylcholine, but not SNP, vasorelaxations. Except for the reduced BRSSNP, the CSA effects disappeared upon concurrent administration of losartan (angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist), captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), or their combination. Moreover, CSA augmentation of Ang II contractions was abolished after cyclooxygenase inhibition (indomethacin) or endothelin ETA/ETB receptor blockade (atrasentan/BQ788). By contrast, the blockade of thromboxane receptors (terutroban) failed to alter the CSA-evoked facilitation of Ang II responsiveness.The facilitation of baroreflex control and inhibition of vascular responsiveness to Ang II and thromboxane contribute to the BP lowering effect of RAS inhibitors in CSA-treated rats. Further, endothelin receptors and vasoconstrictor prostanoids contribute to the CSA-evoked exaggeration of Ang II vascular responsiveness and hypertension.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric  composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer's Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and , this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system diseases. A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut  through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut , is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain,  and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24874879>Facile pulping of lignocellulosic biomass using choline acetate.</a></h2><p>Treating ground bagasse or Southern yellow pine in the biodegradable ionic liquid (IL), choline acetate ([Cho][OAc]), at 100°C for 24h led to dissolution of hemicellulose and lignin, while leaving the cellulose pulp undissolved, with a 54.3% (bagasse) or 34.3% (pine) reduction in lignin content.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is a naturally occurring lipid amide that, when administered as a drug, inhibits inflammatory responses by engaging peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha). PEA is preferentially hydrolyzed by the cysteine amidase N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA), which is highly expressed in macrophages. Here we report the discovery of a potent and selective NAAA inhibitor, N-[(3S)-2-oxo-3-oxetanyl]-3-phenylpropanamide [(S)-OOPP], and show that this inhibitor increases PEA levels in activated leukocytes and blunts responses induced by inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. These effects are stereoselective, mimicked by exogenous PEA, and abolished by PPAR-alpha deletion. (S)-OOPP also attenuates inflammation and tissue damage and improves recovery of motor function in mice subjected to spinal cord trauma. The results suggest that PEA activation of PPAR-alpha in leukocytes serves as an early stop signal that contrasts the progress of inflammation. The PEA-hydrolyzing amidase NAAA may provide a previously undescribed target for antiinflammatory medicines.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841556>Development and validation of a ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method for the direct detection of formoterol in human urine.</a></h2><p>Formoterol is a long acting β(2)-agonist and has proven to be a very effective bronchodilating agent. Hence it is frequently applied therapeutically for the treatment of asthma. Because β(2)-agonists might be misused in sports for the stimulatory effects and for growth-promoting action their use is restricted. Since January 2012, formoterol is prohibited in urinary concentrations higher than 30 ng/mL. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a simple and robust ultra high performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the direct quantification of formoterol in urine. Sample preparation was limited to an enzymatic hydrolysis step after which 2 μL was injected in the chromatographic system. Chromatography was performed on a C(8)-column using gradient conditions. The mobile phase consisted of water/methanol (H(2)O/MeOH) both containing 0.1% acetic acid (HOAc) and 1mM ammonium acetate (NH(4)OAc). Calibration curve were constructed between 15 and 60 ng/mL. Validation data showed bias of 1.3% and imprecision of 5.4% at the threshold. Ion suppression/enhancement never exceeded 7%. Calculating measurement uncertainty showed proof of applicability of the method. Stability of formoterol was also investigated at 56 °C (accelerated stability test) at pH 1.0/5.2/7.0 and 9.5. At the physiological pH values of 5.2 and 7.0, formoterol showed good stability. At pH 1.0 and 9.5 significant degradation was observed.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to compare the addition of MON to patients receiving FSC on asthma control while experiencing asthma and allergy symptoms. Additionally, the effect of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (FPANS) and MON were assessed in allergic rhinitis control. Symptomatic patients (n = 1385) with asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis were randomized to receive FSC, 100/50 micrograms twice daily; FSC twice daily + FPANS, 200 micrograms once daily; FSC twice daily + MON, 10 mg once daily; or MON once daily for 4 weeks during the allergy pollen season. Patients recorded peak expiratory flow, rescue albuterol use, and asthma and rhinitis symptoms. No additional improvements in overall asthma control were seen when MON was added to FSC. Treatment with FSC produced significant (p < 0.001) improvements in all clinical and patient-reported measures versus MON. FSC + FPANS was superior to FSC + MON (p < or = 0.001) in improving daytime and nighttime total nasal symptom scores. Adverse events were similar. In patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis, adding MON to FSC provided no additional benefit in asthma control. FSC resulted in superior improvement in asthma control compared with MON. FPANS also provided superior nasal symptom control versus MON in allergic patients treated with FSC for asthma.

Predictors of differential responses comparing ICS with LTRA step-up therapy were not apparent, probably because of suppression of allergic markers with low-dose ICS treatment. Minimal overlap was seen across FEV₁ and asthma control day predictors, suggesting distinct mechanisms related to lung function and asthma control day responses.Levels of impulse oscillometry reactance area indicating peripheral airway obstruction and urinary leukotriene E₄ levels indicating cysteinyl leukotriene inflammation can differentiate LABA step-up responses from responses to LTRA or ICS step-up therapy. Further studies with physiologic, genetic, and biological markers related to these phenotypes will be needed to predict individual responses to LABA step-up therapy.Copyright © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis was used to correlate the chemical composition of extracts with their spasmolytic effects. Myometrial strips were obtained from hysterectomy specimens of premenopausal women. Longitudinal muscle strips were mounted vertically in tissue baths under physiological conditions to record their isometric contraction. The responses of cumulative concentrations of valerian extracts on spontaneous contractions in the presence and absence of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indometacin, and on agonist-induced contractions, were investigated.Valerian extracts and valepotriates inhibited uterine contractility in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment with either atenolol or indometacin did not affect the uterine responses to valerian extracts. Valerian extract reduced the maximal contractile response induced by acetylcholine, phenylephrine and histamine independent of the stimulus.Valerian extracts may have direct inhibitory effects on the contractility of the human uterus and this justifies the traditional use of this plant in the treatment of uterine cramping associated with dysmenorrhoea.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22967815>NMR-based metabolomics study of canine bladder cancer.</a></h2><p>Bladder cancer is one of the leading lethal cancers worldwide. With the high risk of recurrence for bladder cancer following the initial diagnoses, lifelong monitoring of patients is necessary. The lack of adequate sensitivity and specificity of current noninvasive monitoring approaches including urine cytology, other urine tests, and imaging, underlines the importance of studies that focus on the detection of more reliable biomarkers for this cancer. The emerging area of metabolomics, which deals with the analysis of a large number of small molecules in a single step, promises immense potential for discovering metabolite markers for screening and monitoring treatment response and recurrence in patients with bladder cancer. Since naturally-occurring canine transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder is very similar to human invasive bladder cancer, spontaneous canine transitional cell carcinoma has been applied as a relevant animal model of human invasive transitional cell carcinoma. In this study, we have focused on profiling the metabolites in urine from dogs with transitional cell carcinoma and healthy control dogs combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and statistical analysis methods. (1)H NMR-based metabolite profiling analysis was shown to be an effective approach for differentiating samples from dogs with transitional cell carcinoma and healthy controls based on a partial least square-discriminant analysis of the NMR spectra. In addition, there were significant differences in the levels of six individual metabolites between samples from dogs with transitional cell carcinoma and the control group based on the Student's t-test. These metabolites were selected to build a separate partial least square-discriminant analysis model that was then used to test the classification accuracy. The result showed good classification between transitional cell carcinoma and control groups with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 86% and 78%, respectively. These results suggest that urine metabolic profiling may have potential for early detection of bladder cancer and of bladder cancer recurrence following treatment, and may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

But the recently reported NAAA inhibitors suffer from the chemical and biological unstable properties, which restrict functions of NAAA inhibition in vivo. It is still unrevealed whether systematic inhibition of NAAA could modulate PEA-mediated pain signalings. Here we reported an oxazolidinone imide compound 3-(6-phenylhexanoyl) oxazolidin-2-one (F96), which potently and selectively inhibited NAAA activity (IC50 = 270 nM). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of F96 (3-30 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced ear edema and restored PEA levels of ear tissues in 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced ear edema models.

Isolated human blood neutrophils were activated with the chemoattractant N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) (1 μM) in combination with cytochalasin B (CB; 3 μM). Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester-based spectrofluorimetry, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, colorimetric and flow cytometric procedures were used to measure cytosolic Ca²(+) fluxes, production of superoxide, elastase release and beta-2 integrin (CR3) expression, respectively, while cyclic AMP and leukotriene (LT)B₄ were assayed using competitive binding ELISA procedures. Activation of the cells with fMLP/CB resulted in abrupt and sustained increases in cytosolic Ca²(+), as well as release of elastase and production of superoxide and LTB₄, and expression of CR3, all of which were attenuated by formoterol and montelukast individually, and especially by the combination of these agents.

According to Hofmeister series, a kosmotropic anion and/or a chaotropic cation could stabilize an enzyme, thereby facilitating the retention of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In this work, we first report the influence of choline acetate on the activity and stability of lipase in AOT/water/isooctane reverse micelles. The indicator reaction is the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl butyrate. The results show that a low level of choline acetate does not affect the microstructure of the AOT reverse micelles, but the ionic liquid can improve the catalytic efficiency of lipase. Fluorescence spectra show that a high level of choline acetate has an impact on the conformation of lipase, so the activation is mainly due to the influence of choline acetate on the nucleophilicity of water. Infrared spectra demonstrate that choline acetate can form stronger hydrogen bonds with water surrounding lipase, and therefore enhance the nucleophilicity of the water, which makes it easier to attack the acyl enzyme intermediate, thereby increasing the activity of the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester. A study on the stability of lipase in AOT reverse micelles indicates that the ionic liquid is able to maintain the activity of lipase to a certain extent. The effect of choline acetate is consistent with that predicted based on Hofmeister series.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In humans, UCP1 activation in BAT seems involved in body weight maintenance. BAT type 2 deiodinase (D2) increases in response to adrenergic agents, producing the T3 required for UCP1 expression. T3 actions are mediated by thyroid hormone nuclear T3 receptors (TR), TRα and TRβ. Studies in mice suggest that TRβ is required for UCP1 induction, whereas TRα regulates body temperature and adrenergic sensitivity. In the present study, we compare the effects of T3 vs. specific TRβ1 and TRα1 agonists [GC-1 and CO23] on the adrenergic induction of UCP1 and D2 in cultured rat brown adipocytes. T3 and GC-1 produced similar increases on UCP1, whereas CO23 increased UCP1 only at high doses (50 nm). GC-1 at low doses (0.2-10 nm) was less potent than T3, increasing the adrenergic stimulation of D2 activity and mRNA. At higher doses, GC-1 further stimulated whereas T3 inhibited D2 activity but not D2 mRNA, suggesting posttranscriptional effects. CO23 had no effect on D2 activity but increased D2 mRNA. T3, GC-1, or CO23 by themselves did not increase UCP1 or D2 mRNA. High T3 doses shortened D2 half-life and increased D2 turnover via proteasome, whereas GC-1 did not change D2 stability.

Outcome measures were visual acuity, amount of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, and achievement of predetermined target IOP.Treatment group 2 had a greater number of eyes with acuity decline of two or more lines relative to group 3 (P=0.04). Group 1 had more eyes with acuity decline of two or more lines relative to group 3, but this was not significant (P>0.05).For grade II FACs because of overfiltration in the early postoperative period after trabeculectomy, reformation of the anterior chamber with drainage of choroidal effusion may be associated with greater long-term trabeculectomy success, but is associated with greater visual acuity loss relative to medicinal therapy alone.

One novel step of the exfoliated accompanying carboxylated graphene sheet from pristine is achieved via Friedel-Crafts acylation. By electrophilic aromatic substitution, the succinic anhydride ring is opened and attaches covalently to the graphene sheet (Gs) to form exfoliated graphene with grafted 1-one-butyric acid (Gs-BA). The grafting chain converts anions in aqueous solution to maintain Gs-BA in a stable dispersion and noticeably decreases the π-π stacking of the exfoliated Gs during the drying process. The analytical results of the absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that the conjugation of Gs-BA is not significantly destroyed by this chemical modification; Gs-BA retains the Gs electrical properties favorable for developing electrochemical sensors. When polyamic acid-benzoxazole (PAA-BO), a hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-sensitive probe, hybridizes with Gs-BA to form Gs-BA-PAA-BO, the electron transfer rate relating to the response time improves markedly from 1.09 s(-1) to 38.8 s(-1). Additionally, it offers a high performance for H₂O₂ sensing in terms of sensitivity and response time, making this method applicable for developing glucose and choline biosensors.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, sample formulation for dissolution-DNP is often difficult, as concentration and viscosity must be optimized to yield a dissolved sample with sufficient concentration, while maintaining polarization during the dissolution process. The unique chemical properties of choline permit the generation of highly soluble salts as well as deep eutectic mixtures with carboxylic  and urea. We describe the formulation of these samples and compare their performance to more traditional sample formulations.

Asthma-related medication, unscheduled physician contacts and hospitalizations were collected prospectively. The main effectiveness measure was percentage of asthma-controlled week with no short-acting β2-agonist use during the study period. The analysis was conducted from the Mexican healthcare perspective using 2010 unit cost prices, and only direct costs were considered, all costs are reported in US dollar. . The model was made fully probabilistic to reflect the joint uncertainty in the model parameters.Over the whole treatment period, the median percentages of asthma-controlled weeks were 83.3% in the SFC group and 66.7% in the MON group (SFC-MON difference, 16.7%; 95% CI, 8.3-16.7; P < 0.001 in favor of SFC). The mean total cost of the SFC regimen was $ 2,323 compared with $ 3,230 for the MON regimen. The SFC was the dominant strategy (both more effective and less expensive) using the SFC was associated with an incremental cost per additional asthma-controlled of $ (5,467). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis tested numerous assumptions about the model cost and efficacy parameters and found that the results were robust to most changes.This analysis demonstrates that, compared with MON, SFC may be cost saving from the Mexican health care perspective for the treatment of pediatric patients with asthma. SFC provided a reduction in the number of severe exacerbations, frequent asthma symptoms and rescue medication use. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis indicated the dominance of SFC because of both lower costs and greater efficacy.Copyright © 2011 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

Interestingly, they also decrease systemic arterial pressure, despite recent evidence that PPAR alpha may contribute to expression of renin and related hypertension. Yet, mechanisms responsible for their potential antihypertensive activity remain unresolved. Rapid decreases in arterial pressure following bolus intravenous injections of bezafibrate strongly suggest they may relax arterial smooth muscle directly. But since bezafibrate is highly susceptible to photodegradation in aqueous media, it has never been critically tested for this possibility in vitro with isolated arterial smooth muscle preparations. Accordingly, we tested gemfibrozil which is resistant to photodegradation. We examined it over a therapeutically-relevant range (50-400 microM) for both acute and delayed relaxant effects on contractions of the isolated rat tail artery; contractions induced by either depolarizing its smooth muscle cell membranes with high potassium or stimulating its membrane-bound receptors with norepinephrine and arginine-vasopressin. We also examined these same gemfibrozil levels for effects on spontaneously-occurring phasic rhythmic contractile activity, typically not seen in arteries under in vitro conditions but commonly exhibited by smooth muscle of uterus, duodenum and bladder. We found that gemfibrozil significantly relaxed all induced forms of contraction in the rat tail artery, acutely at the higher test levels and after a delay of a few hours at the lower test levels. The highest test level of gemfibrozil (400 microM) also completely abolished spontaneously-occurring contractile activity of the isolated uterus and duodenum and markedly suppressed it in the bladder. This is the first evidence that a fibrate drug can directly relax smooth muscle contractions, either induced by various contractile agents or spontaneously-occurring. These findings are particularly relevant to both the recently renewed concern over the impact of fibrates on hypertension and a new understanding of their gastrointestinal side effects.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100025>Body mass index and response to asthma therapy: fluticasone propionate/salmeterol versus montelukast.</a></h2><p>We studied the relationship between body mass index (BMI) on responses to asthma therapy using a retrospective analysis of four previously reported clinical trials.

Gestational intake of valproic acid (VPA) is linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by impaired sociability and stereotypies. VPA effects on the neurochemistry and functional morphology of the histaminergic system in ASD are unclear. Zebrafish are highly social, and given the similarities between zebrafish and human neurotransmitter systems, we have studied the effects of VPA on histamine in zebrafish.Histaminergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems of larval and adult zebrafish exposed to VPA from the end of gastrulation until neural tube formation were studied using HPLC, quantitative PCR, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Sociability, dark-flash response and locomotion were also studied.Zebrafish larvae exposed to VPA showed decreased locomotion and an abnormal dark-flash response. Additionally, a reduced number of histaminergic neurons, low histamine and altered mRNA expression of key genes of the monoaminergic systems were also detected. The reduced mRNA expression of genes of the studied systems persisted until adulthood. Furthermore, adult VPA-exposed animals presented lower brain levels of noradrenaline and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, along with impaired sociability.VPA exposure in early development causes molecular and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish, which persist into adulthood and accompany impaired sociability. These findings will highlight the possible involvement of the histaminergic system in outcomes related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it supports zebrafish as a tool to investigate mechanisms underlying these disorders.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23579863>18F-Choline, 11C-choline and 11C-acetate PET/CT: comparative analysis for imaging prostate cancer patients.</a></h2><p>Prostate cancer (PCA) is the second most common tumour in men worldwide. Whereas prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an established biochemical marker, the optimal imaging method for all clinical scenarios has not yet been found. With the rising number of PET centres there is an increasing availability and use of (18)F-/(11)C-choline or (11)C-acetate for staging of PCA. However, to date no final conclusion has been reached as to whether acetate or choline tracers should be preferred. In this review we provide an overview of the performance of choline and acetate PET for staging the primary and recurrent disease and lymph nodes in PCA, based on the literature of the last 10 years. Although predominantly choline has been used rather than acetate, both tracers performed in a similar manner in published studies. Choline as well as acetate have insufficient diagnostic accuracy for the staging of the primary tumour, due to a minimum detectable tumour size of 5 mm and inability to differentiate PCA from benign prostate hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Regarding lymph node staging, choline tracers have demonstrated a high specificity. Unfortunately, the sensitivity is only moderate. For staging recurrent disease, sensitivity depends on the level of serum PSA (PSA should be >2 ng/ml). This applies to both choline and acetate. However, despite these limitations, a significant number of patients with recurrent disease can benefit from PET imaging by a change in treatment planning.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20337988>Exercise-induced wheeze: Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide-directed management.</a></h2><p>Exercise-induced wheeze (EIW) is common.

Those with low F(E)NO (n = 19) received cromoglycate (20 mg inh. bd + before challenge tests), formoterol (12 microg inh. bd + before challenge tests) and montelukast (10 mg p.o. od), each for 2 weeks. Those with high F(E)NO (n = 20) took inhaled fluticasone (500 microg) daily for 4 weeks. Primary end-points were: 50% reduction in maximum FEV(1) %fall (clinical protection) and decrease in AHR to mannitol.In patients with low F(E)NO, cromoglycate, formoterol and montelukast significantly decreased AHR to mannitol in 63%, 61% and 47% of patients, respectively. In this group, the magnitude of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) was significantly reduced with montelukast and formoterol; between-treatment differences were not significant.

Oleuropein aglycone (OA) is a major phenolic compound in extra virgin olive oil and the absorbed form of oleuropein. We aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the nutritional effects of oleuropein and OA on interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) in rats with high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity by examining the agonistic activity of oleuropein and OA toward the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HF (palm oil 30% wt:wt) diet alone or with oleuropein (HF-O, 1 g/kg diet) for 28 days. In rats fed HF-O compared to HF, urinary noradrenaline, adrenaline and UCP1 levels in IBAT were significantly higher, whereas plasma leptin levels and the total weight of the abdominal cavity adipose tissue were significantly lower. In anaesthetized 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, the OA (3.8 mg of intravenous injection)-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline secretion was suppressed by TRPA1 or TRPV1 antagonist and by a β2- or β3-adrenoceptor antagonist. Furthermore, OA-activated rat and human TRPV1s expressed on HEK293 cells at the same level as zingerone (pungent component in ginger). OA also activated humanTRPA1, and its potency was approximately 10-fold stronger than that for TRPV1. These findings suggest that OA is the agonist of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 and that OA enhances UCP1 expression in IBAT with a concomitant decrease in the visceral fat mass of HF-diet-induced obese rats through enhanced noradrenaline secretion via β-adrenergic action following TRPA1 and TRPV1 activation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a member of the -acid ethanolamide family, acts peripherally as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist, exerting analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Both PPAR-alpha and PEA are present in the CNS, but the specific functions of this lipid and its receptor remain to be clarified. Using the carrageenan-induced paw model of hyperalgesia in mice, we report here that intracerebroventricular administration of PEA (0.1-1 microg) 30 min before carrageenan injection markedly reduced mechanical hyperalgesia up to 24 h following inflammatory insult. This effect was mimicked by GW7647 (1 microg), a synthetic PPAR-alpha agonist. The obligatory role of PPAR-alpha in mediating PEA's actions was confirmed by the lack of anti-hyperalgesic effects in mutant mice lacking PPAR-alpha. PEA significantly reduced the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in sciatic nerves and restored carrageenan-induced reductions of PPAR-alpha in the L4-L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). To investigate the mechanism by which PEA attenuated hyperalgesia, we evaluated inhibitory kB-alpha (IkB-alpha) degradation and p65 nuclear factor kB (NF-kappaB) activation in DRG. PEA prevented IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, confirming the involvement of this transcriptional factor in the control of peripheral hyperalgesia.

Base diets without MDS were formulated for gestation (15.4% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.25; 1.44 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter) and lactation (16.6% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.36; 1.64 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter). Blood sampling occurred from d -28 relative to expected calving through d 14 postpartum. Liver tissue was biopsied at d -28 relative to expected calving and on d 5 and 14 postpartum. In addition to routine analyses, serum AA concentrations on d 10 and 12 were quantified using mass spectrometry. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) were qualitatively measured using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures. Dry matter intake and milk yield were not modified by MDS. The transition from d -28 relative to expected parturition to d 14 postpartum was characterized by increased plasma  acid (0.15 to 0.71 mmol/L) and β-hydroxybutyrate (0.34 to 0.43 mmol/L) levels and liver lipid content (3.91 to 9.16%). Methyl donor supplementation increased the serum Met level by 26% and decreased the serum Lys-to-Met ratio by 21% on d 10 and 12, respectively. Moreover, the increase in hepatic lipid content from d 5 through 14 postpartum was suppressed with MDS relative to control (3.57 vs. -0.29%). Dietary MDS modified the TAG and CE lipidome. For example, MDS increased plasma TAG 46:3 (carbon number:double bond) by 116% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. Moreover, MDS tended to increase plasma CE 34:6. In contrast, MDS lowered plasma TAG 54:8 by 39% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. We concluded that in the absence of gains in dry matter intake and milk and milk protein yields, dietary MDS slows the progression of hepatic lipid accumulation and modifies the plasma TAG lipidome in transition cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

The study aimed to test if histone deacetalyase inhibitor treatment lead to increased t-PA release or reduced exhaustion in t-PA release in response to stimulation, as well as change in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in subjects with coronary disease. In this clinical study, 16 post-myocardial infarction subjects, the perfused forearm model was used with isoprenaline provocation during 20 minutes, to stimulate local t-PA release. Each subject was measured twice on the same day (repeated stimuli sequences) as well as on two different occasions, without treatment and after four weeks of treatment with valproic acid (500 mg, twice daily). Net forearm release for t-PA in response to isoprenaline at minutes 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 was measured, allowing assessment of cumulative t-PA release. There was a reduction in the exhaustion of cumulative t-PA release during repeated and prolonged stimulation with valproic acid treatment compared to non-treatment. Plasma PAI-1 antigen was decreased following treatment compared to non-treatment (18.4 ± 10.0 vs. 11.0 ± 7.1 nanograms/ml respectively, mean with 95% confidence interval). These findings demonstrate that histone deacetylation inhibition increases the capacity for endogenous t-PA release in subjects with vascular disease. Furthermore, the fibrinolytic balance is favored with suppressed PAI-1 levels. More studies are needed to establish the clinical relevance of these findings.EU Clinical Trials Register 2012-004950-27.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714434>Improvement by methylphenidate and atomoxetine of social interaction deficits and recognition memory impairment in a mouse model of valproic acid-induced autism.</a></h2><p>Rodents exposed prenatally to valproic acid (VPA) show autism-related behavioral abnormalities. We recently found that prenatal VPA exposure causes a reduction of dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex of male, but not female, mice. This suggests that reduced prefrontal dopaminergic activity is associated with behavioral abnormalities in VPA-treated mice. In the present study, we examined whether the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs methylphenidate and atomoxetine (which increase dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, but not striatum, in mice) could alleviate the behavioral abnormalities and changes in dendritic spine morphology induced by prenatal VPA exposure. We found that methylphenidate and atomoxetine increased prefrontal dopamine and noradrenaline release in VPA-treated mice. Acute treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine did not alleviate the social interaction deficits or recognition memory impairment in VPA-treated mice, while chronic treatment for 2 weeks did. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine for 2 weeks also improved the prenatal VPA-induced decrease in dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex. The effects of these drugs on behaviors and dendritic spine morphology were antagonized by concomitant treatment with the dopamine-D1 receptor antagonist SCH39166 or the dopamine-D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, but not by the α2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine improves abnormal behaviors and diminishes the reduction in spine density in VPA-treated mice via a prefrontal dopaminergic system-dependent mechanism.

This epithelial acetylcholine then induces anion secretion via stimulation of acetylcholine receptors. The key enzyme responsible for acetylcholine synthesis, choline acetyltransferase, is known to be unselective as regards the  acid used for esterification of choline. As the colonic epithelium is permanently exposed to high concentrations of different SCFAs produced by bacterial fermentation, we investigated whether choline esters other than acetylcholine, propionylcholine and butyrylcholine, are produced by the colonic epithelium, too, and whether these 'atypical' esters are able to stimulate the acetylcholine receptors involved in the regulation of colonic ion transport.Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (DESI-MS), Ussing chamber and Ca(2+) -imaging experiments were performed on rat distal colon.DESI-MS analyses revealed the production of acetylcholine, propionylcholine and butyrylcholine in the surface epithelium. Relative expression rates were 2-3% in comparison with acetylcholine. In Ussing chamber experiments, both atypical choline esters caused a concentration-dependent increase in short-circuit current, that is, stimulated anion secretion. Inhibitor experiments in the absence and presence of the submucosal plexus revealed the involvement of neuronal and epithelial acetylcholine receptors. While butyrylcholine obviously stimulated both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, propionylcholine predominantly acted on muscarinic receptors.These results suggest a novel pathway for communication between intestinal microbes producing  and the host via modification of epithelial production of choline esters involved in the paracrine regulation of the colonic epithelium.© 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23669407>Preventive effects of p-coumaric acid on cardiac hypertrophy and alterations in electrocardiogram, lipids, and lipoproteins in experimentally induced myocardial infarcted rats.</a></h2><p>The present study evaluated the preventive effects of p-coumaric acid on cardiac hypertrophy and alterations in electrocardiogram, lipids, and lipoproteins in experimentally induced myocardial infarcted rats. Rats were pretreated with p-coumaric acid (8 mg/kg body weight) daily for a period of 7 days and then injected with isoproterenol (100mg/kg body weight) on 8th and 9th day to induce myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol was indicated by increased level of cardiac sensitive marker and elevated ST-segments in the electrocardiogram. Also, the levels/concentrations of serum and heart cholesterol, triglycerides and free   were increased in myocardial infarcted rats. Isoproterenol also increased the levels of serum low density and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased the levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. It also enhanced the activity of liver 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl-Coenzyme-A reductase. p-Coumaric acid pretreatment revealed preventive effects on all the biochemical parameters and electrocardiogram studied in myocardial infarcted rats.

In humans and rodents, SCFAs modulate inflammatory responses in the gut via free  acid receptor 2 (FFA2). In bovines, butyric acid is one of the most potent FFA2 agonists. Its expression in bovine neutrophils has recently been demonstrated, suggesting a role in innate immune response in cattle. This study aimed to evaluate if butyric acid modulates oxidative and non-oxidative functions or if it can potentiate other inflammatory mediators in bovine neutrophils. Our results showed that butyric acid can activate bovine neutrophils, inducing calcium (Ca(2+)) influx and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, two second messengers involved in FFA2 activation. Ca(2+) influx induced by butyric acid was dependent on the extracellular and intracellular Ca(2+) source and phospholipase C (PLC) activation. Butyric acid alone had no significant effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and chemotaxis; however, a priming effect on platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent inflammatory mediator, was observed. Butyric acid increased CD63 expression and induced the release of neutrophil granule markers matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and lactoferrin. Finally, we observed that butyric acid induced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation without affecting cellular viability. These findings suggest that butyric acid, a component of the ruminal fermentative process, can modulate the innate immune response of ruminants.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Systematic review of studies published during the 2000-2009 period.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to analyse inter-and intra-country quantitative and qualitative differences in anti-asthmatic prescriptions to children and adolescents.A literature search was performed in EMBASE and MEDLINE to identify pharmaco-epidemiological studies published from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2008 in which anti-asthmatic prescription prevalence in out-hospital children was measured. A meta-analytic weighted average and 95% confidence intervals of prescription prevalences were calculated using a random-effect(s) model. Inter- and intra-country quantitative and, where possible, qualitative prescribing patterns were compared and assessed.Twelve studies were identified (ten from Europe, one from Canada and one from the USA), but epidemiological indicators varied widely, and only eight were suitable for meta-analysis. The data from these studies revealed inter-country quantitative differences in prescription prevalences in the overall population <or=19 years, with Italy having a prescription prevalence of 19.0%, Canada, 18.0%, USA, 14.6%, Denmark, 13.9%, Norway, 9.1% and the Netherlands, 6.2%. The overall prevalence was 13.3%. The analysis of qualitative inter-country differences revealed that, except for Italy, inhalatory short-acting beta-agonists were the most prescribed, followed by inhalatory corticosteroids.This first overall analysis of anti-asthmatic utilization studies in out-of-hospital children indicates a wide variability in anti-asthmatic prescription prevalence. It also reveals that epidemiological evaluations should be improved by using homogeneous indicators and, in order to validate the use of anti-asthmatic prescription as a proxy of disease, the diagnosis of asthma should accompany the data of prescriptions within the same population.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29345423>Deep Eutectic Solvent Aqueous Solutions as Efficient Media for the Solubilization of Hardwood Xylans.</a></h2><p>This work contributes to the development of integrated lignocellulosic-based biorefineries by the pioneering exploitation of hardwood xylans by solubilization and extraction in deep eutectic solvents (DES). DES formed by choline chloride and urea or acetic acid were initially evaluated as solvents for commercial xylan as a model compound. The effects of temperature, molar ratio, and concentration of the DES aqueous solutions were evaluated and optimized by using a response surface methodology. The results obtained demonstrated the potential of these solvents, with 328.23 g L of xylan solubilization using 66.7 wt % DES in water at 80 °C. Furthermore, xylans could be recovered by precipitation from the DES aqueous media in yields above 90 %. The detailed characterization of the xylans recovered after solubilization in aqueous DES demonstrated that 4-O-methyl groups were eliminated from the 4-O-methylglucuronic  moieties and uronic  (15 %) were cleaved from the xylan backbone during this process. The similar M values of both pristine and recovered xylans confirmed the success of the reported procedure. DES recovery in four additional extraction cycles was also demonstrated.

Tracer uptake was assessed under androgen ablation. Results of the cancer cell lines were normalized to those of BPH-1. To evaluate the effect of androgen on the uptake of 18F-FDG, 11C-choline and 11C-acetate in PCa cell lines, 10(-8) M R1881, 10(-10) M R1881, the combination of 10(-10) M R1881 plus 10(-6) M Casodex or 10(-6) M Casodex alone were added in parallel cell cultures 1 day before uptake experiments. Uptake in androgen-supplemented cell cultures was compared to the uptake under androgen deprivation. Uptake was corrected for cell number using protein content.Compared to BPH-1, a higher 18F-FDG uptake was observed only in PC346C cells, whereas a higher 11C-choline and markedly increased 11C-acetate uptake was seen in all cancer cell lines. Androgens significantly modulated the uptake of 18F-FDG in LNCaP, PC346C and 22Rv1 cells, and of 11C-choline in the PC346C and 22Rv1 cell line. No androgenic effect on 11C-choline and 18F-FDG uptake was observed in PC-3 and PC346DCC cells. 11C-Acetate uptake was independent of androgen status in all PCa cell lines studied.18F-FDG uptake in PCa cell lines showed the highest variability and strongest androgen effect, suggesting its poor potential for metabolic imaging of advanced PCa.

We analyzed the effect of chronic ouabain (approximately 8.0 microg/day, 5 weeks) treatment on the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats and the contribution of vascular mechanisms.Responses to acetylcholine and phenylephrine were analyzed in isolated tail arteries. Protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were also investigated.Ouabain treatment enhanced blood pressure only in SHRs. The pD2 for acetylcholine was decreased in arteries from SHRs compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats, and ouabain did not change this parameter. However, ouabain was able to increase the pD2 to phenylephrine in SHRs. Nitric oxide synthase inhibition with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or potassium channel blockade by tetraetylamonium increased the response to phenylephrine in SHRs, with a smaller increase in response observed in ouabain-treated SHRs. In addition, indomethacin (a COX inhibitor) and ridogrel (a thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitor and prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist) decreased contraction to phenylephrine in tail rings from ouabain-treated SHRs. Protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was unaltered following ouabain treatment in SHRs, whereas COX-2 expression was increased.Chronic ouabain treatment further increases the raised blood pressure of SHRs. This appears to involve a vascular mechanism, related to a reduced vasodilator influence of nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor and increased production of vasoconstrictor prostanoids by COX-2. These data suggest that the increased plasma levels of ouabain could play an important role in the maintenance of hypertension and the impairment of endothelial function.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935397>A randomized, open labeled, comparative study to assess the efficacy and safety of controller medications as add on to inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist in the treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent asthma.</a></h2><p>The goal of asthma therapy is to achieve clinical control and near normal lung functions.

Oral administration of AM803 (1 mg/kg) resulted in sustained inhibition of ex vivo ionophore-challenged whole blood LTB4 biosynthesis with >90% inhibition for up to 12 h and an EC50 of approximately 7 nM. When rat lungs were challenged in vivo with calcium-ionophore, AM803 inhibited LTB4 and cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) production with ED50s of 0.12 mg/kg and 0.37 mg/kg, respectively. The inhibition measured 16 h following a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg was 86% and 41% for LTB4 and CysLTs, respectively. In an acute inflammation setting, AM803 dose-dependently reduced LTB4, CysLTs, plasma protein extravasation and neutrophil influx induced by peritoneal zymosan injection. Finally, AM803 increased survival time in mice exposed to a lethal intravenous injection of platelet activating factor (PAF). The magnitude of effect was similar to that of an inhibitor of five-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and LTA4 hydrolase but superior to a leukotriene CysLT1 receptor antagonist. In summary, AM803 is a novel, potent and selective FLAP inhibitor that has excellent pharmacodynamic properties in vivo and is effective in animal models of acute inflammation and in a model of lethal shock.Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In senescent rats, inhibition of MRP4 by MK571 restored the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol in vivo (143 ± 11%, n = 8 rats). In vitro in senescent cardiomyocytes pretreated with MK571, both sarcomere shortening (161 ± 45% vs. 129 ± 37%, P = 0.007, n = 41 cells per group) and calcium transient amplitude (132 ± 25% vs. 113 ± 27%, P = 0.007) increased significantly.MRP4 overexpression contributes to the reduction of the positive inotropic response to β-adrenoceptor stimulation in the senescent heart.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19997594>Therapeutic and adverse effects of a non-steroidal glucocorticoid receptor ligand in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Dissociating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligands hold great promise for treating inflammatory disorders since it is assumed that they exert beneficial activities mediated by transrepression but avoid adverse effects of GR action requiring transactivation. Here we challenged this paradigm by investigating 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methyl-ethylammonium chloride (CpdA), a dissociating non-steroidal GR ligand, in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).CpdA inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators in myelin-specific T cells and fibroblasts in a GR-dependent manner while gene activation was abolished. However, it also induced massive apoptosis in various cell types even in the absence of the GR by engaging a Bcl-2- and caspase-dependent pathway. (1)H NMR spectroscopy corroborated these findings by revealing that CpdA dissolved in buffered solutions rapidly decomposes into aziridine intermediates known to act as alkylating pro-apoptotic agents. Importantly, the dichotomy of CpdA action also became evident in vivo. Administration of high-dose CpdA to mice was lethal while treatment of EAE with low to intermediate amounts of CpdA dissolved in water significantly ameliorated the disease. The beneficial effect of CpdA required expression of the GR in T cells and was achieved by down regulating LFA-1 and CD44 on peripheral Th cells and by repressing IL-17 production.CpdA has significant therapeutic potential although adverse effects severely compromise its application in vivo. Hence, non-steroidal GR ligands require careful analysis prior to their translation into new therapeutic concepts.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21218500>Study of acute biochemical effects of thallium toxicity in mouse urine by NMR spectroscopy.</a></h2><p>Thallium (Tl) is a toxic heavy metal and its exposure to the human body causes physiological and biochemical changes due to its interference with potassium-dependent biological reactions. A high-resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy based metabonomic approach has been applied for investigating acute biochemical effects caused by thallium sulfate (Tl(2)SO(4)). Male strain A mice were divided in three groups and received three doses of Tl(2)SO(4) (5, 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) b.w., i.p.). Urine samples collected at 3, 24, 72 and 96 h post-dose time points were analyzed by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectral data were processed and analyzed using principal components analysis to represent biochemical variations induced by Tl(2)SO(4). Results showed Tl-exposed mice urine to have distinct metabonomic phenotypes and revealed dose- and time-dependent clustering of treated groups. The metabolic signature of urine analysis from Tl(2)SO(4)-treated animals exhibited an increase in the levels of creatinine, taurine, hippurate and β-hydroxybutyrate along with a decrease in energy metabolites trimethylamine and choline. These findings revealed Tl-induced disturbed gut flora, membrane metabolite, energy and protein metabolism, representing physiological dysfunction of vital organs. The present study indicates the great potential of NMR-based metabonomics in mapping metabolic response for toxicology, which could ultimately lead to identification of potential markers for Tl toxicity.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27348536>Acetylcholine suppresses shoot formation and callusing in leaf explants of in vitro raised seedlings of tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Miller var. Pusa Ruby.</a></h2><p>We present experimental evidence to show that acetylcholine (ACh) causes decrease in shoot formation in leaf explants of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller var Pusa Ruby) when cultured on shoot regeneration medium. The optimum response was obtained at 10(-4) M ACh-enriched medium. ACh also causes decrease in percentage of cultures forming callus and reduces the callus mass. Inhibitors of enzymatic hydrolysis of ACh, neostigmine and physostigmine, also suppresses callogenesis and caulogenesis. On the other hand, the breakdown products of Ach, choline and acetate, do not alter the morphogenic response induced on the shoot regeneration medium. Neostigmine showed optimal reduction in shoot formation at 10(-5) M. The explants cultured on neostigmine augmented medium showed decline in the activity of ACh hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase. ACh and neostigmine added together showed marked reduction in callus mass. These results strongly support the role of ACh as a natural regulator of morphogenesis in tomato plants.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19159337>New urea-based surfactants derived from alpha,omega-amino .</a></h2><p>New anionic urea-based surfactants derived from alpha,omega-amino  and in particular from beta-alanine were synthesized and their solution properties characterized by electrical conductivity, equilibrium surface tension, and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Double-chain surfactants and the single-chain surfactant containing a sulfate head group exhibited the lowest critical micelle concentration (cmc) values and superior efficiency in lowering surface tension. All surfactants promoted adsorption relative to micellization, and micellar parameters were sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residue.

Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value (PPV) for each symptom leading to wheezing during that RTI were calculated.The most commonly reported first symptom categories during the first RTI were "nose symptoms" (41%), "significant cough" (29%), and "insignificant cough" (13%). The most reliable predictor of subsequent wheezing was significant cough, which had a specificity of 78% and a PPV of 74% for predicting wheezing.Significant cough is the most reliable antecedent of wheezing during an RTI. It may be useful to consider individualized symptom patterns as a component of management plans intended to minimize wheezing episodes.</p><p>Keyword: SCFA</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22890958>CuInSe₂ thin-film solar cells with 7.72 % efficiency prepared via direct coating of a metal salts/alcohol-based precursor solution.</a></h2><p>A simple direct solution coating process for forming CuInSe₂ (CIS) thin films was described, employing a low-cost and environmentally friendly precursor solution.

Recent prevalence, heritability, and genetic studies are suggestive that epigenetic and, therefore, environmental factors are important in autism pathogenesis. Among the environmental factors, only some uncommon viral infections and certain drugs have been conclusively linked to autism causation. Thalidomide, valproate, terbutaline and, most recently, antidepressants are the main drugs reported to elevate autism risk. This article discusses a phenomenal relationship between the drugs reported to elevate autism risk and the antiproliferative effects of the same drugs and/or analogs of the drugs in cancer cells. Cancer treatment has entered a new era-epigenetic therapy. In cancer cell lines, thalidomide is antiangiogenic and antiproliferative via suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and downstream effects on the nuclear factor (NFκB) cascade. Valproate shares similar mechanisms with thalidomide, but is best known in cancer therapy for its epigenetic effects as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, acts via adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-PKA signal transduction. Current cancer therapy aims to exploit this epigenetic pathway by developing site-selective cAMP analogs. Last, it has long been noted in preclinical studies that some antidepressants are antiproliferative in cancer cells but the mechanisms remain unclear. Based on a systematic review of these drugs, it is hypothesized that all central nervous system-acting drugs, which show antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines, share the potential to elevate autism risk when administered prenatally. It is further posited that, in autism, the drugs act as "triggers" that disturb the pro-proliferative fetal milieu using the same, mainly epigenetic, mechanisms that they demonstrate in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. In addition to their direct antiproliferative effects, evidence is suggestive that the drugs may lock in the pro-inflammatory bias of the prenatal immune system by preventing normal perinatal dendritic cell maturation. This unifying hypothesis for how structurally different drugs elevate autism risk could help focus research on other drugs, or other xenobiotics, that may elevate autism risk. For example, there is evidence that an old class of drugs, the phenothiazines, is antiproliferative in cancer cell lines via inhibition of calmodulin and/or histaminic pathways. Promethazine, one of the first heterocyclic phenothiazines synthesized, is commonly prescribed during pregnancy; however, its role in elevating the risk of autism has not been investigated. Based on the anti-proliferation hypothesis, more studies of promethazine and other similar drugs are suggested to evaluate their potential to elevate autism risk following prenatal exposures.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
