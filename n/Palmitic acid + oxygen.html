Gonzales. Association between plasma N-acylethanolamides and high hemoglobin concentration in Southern Peruvian highlanders. High Alt Med Biol 18:322-329, 2017.-High-altitude (HA) hypoxia is a stressful condition endured by organisms through different mechanisms. Failing to adapt to chronic HA exposure leads to a disease called chronic mountain sickness (CMS) characterized by excessive erythrocytosis (hemoglobin [Hb] ≥19 g/dL for women and ≥21 g/dL for men). Genes encoding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subunits α and γ have been proposed as candidate genes for HA adaptation. N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) are endogenous fatty  substances that bind to PPAR-α and -γ. NAEs are also able to modulate the endocannabinoid system, a signaling pathway activated in physiological stressful conditions. In the frame of a metabolomic study, we measured plasma levels of four NAEs: palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), stearoyl ethanolamide (SEA), and linoleoyl ethanolamide (LEA) in natives from Puno (3830 m), a city located in the Peruvian Southern Andes, and Lima (150 m). All NAEs were significantly higher in the HA population (p < 0.001, q < 0.001). Subjects with higher NAE values were those with higher Hb concentration and lower pulse  saturation. However, there was no association between NAEs and CMS score. Our results suggest that PEA and OEA could be involved in physiological regulation following long-term HA exposure.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26353385>Cytochrome c release from rat liver mitochondria is compromised by increased saturated cardiolipin species induced by sucrose feeding.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome c release from mitochondria has been described to be related to reactive  species (ROS) generation. With ROS generation being increased in fatty liver from sucrose-fed (SF) rats, we hypothesized that cytochrome c release might be positively associated with H2O2 generation from SF mitochondria. Surprisingly, cytochrome c release from mitochondria of SF liver was found to be significantly lower compared with control (C) mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate/malate or succinate. Exposure of mitochondria to exogenous superoxide radical generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system elicits a dose-response cytochrome c release in both control and SF mitochondria, but cytochrome c release remains lower in SF mitochondria compared with C mitochondria. Furthermore, the addition of ebselen, PEG-catalase, or catalase, a H2O2 scavenger, significantly reduces cytochrome c release from C and SF mitochondria. Our results suggest that both intra- and extramitochondrial H2O2 are involved in cytochrome c release, but the persisting difference between C and SF levels can be attributed to the differences in cardiolipin compositions. Indeed, the ratio of -rich cardiolipin species was found to be increased in lipid membrane from SF mitochondria compared with C mitochondria, whereas that of linoleic -rich cardiolipin species was found decreased. In addition, the content of tafazzin, a protein responsible for cardiolipin remodeling, was decreased in SF mitochondria. Therefore, we conclude that the changes observed in the composition of cardiolipin molecular species in SF mitochondria may be involved in cytochrome c interaction with mitochondrial inner membrane lipid and in its reduced release from SF mitochondria.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490300>-Induced Podocyte Apoptosis via the Reactive  Species-Dependent Mitochondrial Pathway.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often accompanied by hyperlipidemia, which accelerates progression of the disease. Podocyte injury can lead to dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier, which is associated with proteinuria, a risk marker for the progression of CKD. Our previous studies demonstrated that  (PA) can induce podocyte apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we investigated the specific molecular mechanisms of PA-induced apoptosis in cultured podocytes.We cultured mouse podocytes and treated them with PA. Then, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay, lipid uptake was assessed by Oil Red O staining and boron-dipyrromethene staining, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, mitochondrial injury was assessed by JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy, and mitochondrial production of reactive  species (ROS) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using the MitoSOX Red reagent. The effects of PA on the mitochondria-mediated caspase activation pathway were investigated by examining the expression of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, Bid, cytochrome c, and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) using western blotting. The translocation of Bax and cytochrome c were detected by immunofluorescence.PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation and induced podocyte apoptosis. We investigated whether the two primary apoptosis signaling pathways (death receptor-mediated pathway and mitochondria-mediated pathway) were involved in the execution of PA-induced podocyte apoptosis, and found that the levels of FADD, caspase-8, and Bid did not significantly change during this process. Meanwhile, PA treatment induced an increase in Bax protein expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression, with Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Furthermore, PA treatment induced mitochondrial impairment, and triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, with a concomitant dose-dependent increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. Meanwhile, PA treatment increased mitochondrial production of ROS, and the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO significantly ameliorated PA-induced podocyte apoptosis.Our findings indicated that PA induced caspase-dependent podocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and mitochondrial ROS production participated in this process, thus potentially contributing to podocyte injury.© 2018 The Author(s).

Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse liver has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.

The aim of this study was to identify the active compounds in extracts from two species of cinnamon responsible for the pancreatic β-cell protection in vitro.Cinnamon extracts were prepared from Cinnamomum tamala (CT-E) and Cinnamomum cassia (CC-E). Six compounds procyanidin B2 (cpd1), (-)-epicatechin (cpd2), cinnamtannin B1 (cpd3), procyanidin C1 (cpd4), parameritannin A1 (cpd5) and cinnamtannin D1 (cpd6) were isolated from the extracts. INS-1 pancreatic β-cells were exposed to  (PA) or H2O2 to induce lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Cell viability and apoptosis as well as ROS levels were assessed. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was examined in PA-treated β-cells and murine islets.CT-E, CC-E as well as the compounds, except cpd5, did not cause cytotoxicity in the β-cells up to the maximum dosage using in this experiment. CT-E and CC-E (12.5-50 μg/mL) dose-dependently increased cell viability in both PA- and H2O2-treated β-cells, and decreased ROS accumulation in H2O2-treated β-cells. CT-E caused more prominent β-cell protection than CC-E. Furthermore, CT-E (25 and 50 μg/mL) dose-dependently increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PA-treated β-cells and murine islets, but CC-E had little effect. Among the 6 compounds, trimer procyanidins cpd3, cpd4 and cpd6 (12.5-50 μmol/L) dose-dependently increased the cell viability and decreased ROS accumulation in H2O2-treated β-cells. The trimer procyanidins also increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in PA-treated β-cells.Trimer procyanidins in the cinnamon extracts contribute to the pancreatic β-cell protection, thus to the anti-diabetic activity.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730133>Cytotoxic effect of Kalanchoe flammea and induction of intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic signaling in prostate cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Kalanchoe flammea Stapf (Crassulaceae) is a medicinal plant grown in the South of Mexico (State of Tabasco), which is commonly used in traditional medicine for the treatment of fever, wounds, inflammation, and cancer.To establish the potential of K. flammea for the treatment of prostate cancer, evaluating its cytotoxic activity, its probable mechanism of action, and carrying out some toxicological safety studies.The cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate extract of K. flammea (Kf-EtOAc) was evaluated in several cell lines of prostate cancer by MTT viability assay. The cellular death mechanism was studied by evaluating the translocation of phosphatidylserine (Annexin V); overproduction of reactive  species [2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay]; release of Cytochrome C; activation of caspase-3 and -9, and regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε proteins by Western Blot analysis. For the evaluation of the safety of Kf-EtOAc, the Ames test, Micronucleus assay, and acute toxicity study were determined.Kf-EtOAc exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against prostate cell lines as follows: PC-3, LNCaP, and PrEC (IC = 1.36 ± 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.02, and 127.05 ± 0.07 μg/mL, respectively). The F82-P2 fraction (rich in coumaric  and ) obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation of Kf-EtOAc also demonstrated selective cytotoxic activity against PC-3 cells (IC = 1.05 ± 0.06 μg/mL). Kf-EtOAc induces apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; this mechanism of cell death was confirmed after observing that the extract produces phosphatidylserine translocation, overproduction of reactive  species, release of Cytochrome C at mitochondrial level, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. It was also observed that Kf-EtOAc produces significant downregulation of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε and induces DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest. In addition, Kf-EtOAc is non-genotoxic in vitro by Ames test and non-genotoxic in vivo by Micronucleus assay, and no signs of toxicity or death were reported after the administration of a single acute exposure of 2000 mg/kg.K. flammea is a potential candidate for the development of new drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, to propose their use in clinical trials, additional studies are required to understand their pharmacokinetic behavior, as well as the development of a suitable pharmaceutical form.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Antisteatotic effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs) have recently been shown in animal models of liver disease. However, it is unclear whether the activity of CeONPs is related solely to the decrease in oxidative stress or, in addition, they directly decrease liver fatty  accumulation. To address this question, in this work, we used an in vitro model of hepatocellular steatosis, exposing HepG2 cells to oleic and . Cell uptake of CeONPs and their effect on oxidative stress and viability of hepatic cells cultured with HO were also evaluated. Results show that CeONPs were uptaken by HepG2 cells and reduced oxidative stress and improved cell viability. Treatment with oleic and  increased lipogenesis and the content of different fatty acids. CeONPs reduced  and stearic  and most fatty acids consisting of more than 18 carbon atoms. These effects were associated with significant changes in elongase and desaturase activity. In conclusion, CeONPs directly protected HepG2 cells from cell injury in oxidative stress conditions and reduced fatty  content in steatotic conditions by inducing specific changes in fatty  metabolism, thus showing potential in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30816667>The Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidant MitoQ Modulates Mitochondrial Function and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pancreatic β Cells Exposed to Hyperglycaemia.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants such as mitoquinone (MitoQ) have demonstrated protective effects against oxidative damage in several diseases. The increase in reactive  species (ROS) production during glucose metabolism in β cells can be exacerbated under hyperglycaemic conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), thus contributing to β cell function impairment. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the effect of MitoQ on insulin secretion, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) signalling in a pancreatic β cell line under normoglycaemic (NG, 11.1 mM glucose), hyperglycaemic (HG, 25 mM glucose) and lipidic ( (PA), 0.5mM) conditions.We incubated the pancreatic β cell line INS-1E with or without MitoQ (0.5µM) under NG, HG and PA conditions. We then assessed the following parameters: glucose-induced insulin secretion, O₂ consumption (with a Clark-type electrode); mitochondrial function, oxidative stress parameters and calcium levels (by fluorescence microscopy); ER stress markers and NFκB-p65 protein levels (by western blotting).MitoQ increased insulin secretion and prevented the enhancement of ROS production and O₂ consumption and decrease in GSH levels that are characteristic under HG conditions. MitoQ also reduced protein levels of ER stress markers (GRP78 and P-eIF2α) and the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor NFκB-p65, both of which increased under HG. MitoQ did not significantly alter ER stress markers under lipidic conditions.Our findings suggest that treatment with MitoQ modulates mitochondrial function, which in turn ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress and NFκB activation, thereby representing potential benefits for pancreatic β cell function.© Copyright by the Author(s).

(PA), a common saturated fatty  found in mammals, induces the generation of reactive  species (ROS) and elicits apoptotic cell death, known as lipotoxicity. However, protective mechanisms against PA-induced lipotoxicity have not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of p62, an adapter protein in the autophagic process, as well as the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) pathway, in protecting cells from PA-induced lipotoxicity. The Nrf2-Keap1 pathway is essential for the protection of cells from oxidative stress. p62 enhances its binding to Keap1 and leads to Nrf2 activation. Here, we show that PA potentiates Keap1 degradation and thereby activates the transcription of Nrf2 target genes partially through autophagy. Furthermore, this PA-mediated Keap1 degradation depends on p62. Correspondingly, a lack of p62 attenuates the PA-mediated Nrf2 activation and increases the susceptibility of cells to oxidative stress. These results indicate that p62 plays an important role in protecting cells against lipotoxicity through Keap1 degradation-mediated Nrf2 activation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ER and mitochondria interact through Mitofusin 2 (MTF2), which anchors in the outer mitochondrial and ER membranes regulating energy metabolism. Ablation of MTF2 leads to ER stress activation and insulin resistance. Here we determine whether lipotoxic insult induced by saturated lipids decreases MTF2 expression leading to ER stress response in hypothalamus and its effects on insulin sensitivity using in vitro and in vivo models. We found that lipotoxic stimulation induced by , but not the monounsaturated palmitoleic , decreases MTF2 protein levels in hypothalamic mHypoA-CLU192 cells. Also,  incubation activates ER stress response evidenced by increase in the protein levels of GRP78/BIP marker at later stage than MTF2 downregulation. Additionally, we found that MTF2 alterations induced by , but not palmitoleic, stimulation exacerbate insulin resistance in hypothalamic cells. Insulin resistance induced by  is prevented by pre-incubation of the anti-inflammatory and the ER stress release reagents, sodium salicylate and 4 phenylbutirate, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that lipotoxic insult induced by high fat feeding to mice decreases MTF2 proteins levels in arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus. Our data indicate that saturated lipids modulate MTF2 expression in hypothalamus coordinating the ER stress response and the susceptibility to insulin resistance.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

High glucose and  remarkably impaired cell viability and tube formation capacity, as well as increased the mRNA expression of inflammatory factors, ROS levels, and cell apoptosis in HUVECs. MSC co-cultivation ameliorated these detrimental effects in HUVECs, but no effect on ROS production. Moreover, TSG-6 was dramatically up-regulated by high glucose and fatty  stimulation in both MSCs and HUVECs. TSG-6 knockdown partially abolished the protection mediated by MSCs.

However, its exact role is only partly known. To elucidate how CsrA impacts  metabolism we analysed the CsrA depended regulation of metabolic functions by comparative C-isotopologue profiling and  consumption experiments of a  wild-type (wt) strain and its isogenic  mutant. We show that a  mutant has significantly lower respiration rates when serine, alanine, pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate or palmitate is the sole carbon source. By contrast, when grown in glucose or glycerol, no differences in respiration were detected. Isotopologue profiling uncovered that the transfer of label from [U-C]serine via pyruvate into the citrate cycle and gluconeogenesis was lower in the mutant as judged from the labelling patterns of protein-derived amino acids, cell-wall-derived diaminopimelate, sugars and amino sugars and 3-hydroxybutyrate derived from polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Similarly, the incorporation of [U-C]glucose via the glycolysis/Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway but not via the pentose phosphate pathway was repressed in the  mutant. On the other hand, fluxes due to [U-C]glycerol utilization were increased in the  mutant. In addition, we showed that exogenous [1,2,3,4-C] is efficiently used for PHB synthesis via C-acetyl-CoA. Taken together, CsrA induces serine catabolism via the tricarboxylic  cycle and glucose degradation via the ED pathway, but represses glycerol metabolism, fatty  degradation and PHB biosynthesis, in particular during exponential growth. Thus, CsrA has a determining role in substrate usage and carbon partitioning during the  life cycle and regulates a switch from amino  usage in replicative phase to glycerolipid usage during transmissive growth.© 2017 The Authors.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084524>Palmitate is not an effective fuel for pancreatic islets and amplifies insulin secretion independent of calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to determine the acute contribution of fuel oxidation in mediating the increase in insulin secretion rate (ISR) in response to fatty acids. Measures of mitochondrial metabolism, as reflected by  consumption rate (OCR) and cytochrome c reduction, calcium signaling, and ISR by rat islets were used to evaluate processes stimulated by acute exposure to  (PA). The contribution of mitochondrial oxidation of PA was determined in the presence and absence of a blocker of mitochondrial transport of fatty acids (etomoxir) at different glucose concentrations. Subsequent to increasing glucose from 3 to 20 mM, PA caused small increases in OCR and cytosolic calcium (about 20% of the effect of glucose). In contrast, the effect of PA on ISR was almost 3 times that by glucose, suggesting that the metabolism of PA is not the dominant mechanism mediating PA's effect on ISR. This was further supported by lack of inhibition of PA-stimulated OCR and ISR when blocking entry of PA into mitochondria (with etomoxir), and PA's lack of stimulation of reduced cytochrome c in the presence of high glucose. Consistent with the lack of metabolic stimulation by PA, an inhibitor of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, but not a blocker of L-type calcium channels, abolished the PA-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium. Notably, ISR was unaffected by thapsigargin showing the dissociation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and second phase insulin secretion. In conclusion, stimulation of ISR by PA was mediated by mechanisms largely independent of the oxidation of the fuel.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274380>The NOX1 isoform of NADPH oxidase is involved in dysfunction of liver sinusoids in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The increased production of reactive  species (ROS) has been postulated to play a key role in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the source of ROS and mechanisms underlying the development of NAFLD have yet to be established. We observed a significant up-regulation of a minor isoform of NADPH oxidase, NOX1, in the liver of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients as well as of mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet for 8 weeks. In mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1KO), increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly attenuated. Concomitantly, increased protein nitrotyrosine adducts, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury detected in hepatic sinusoids of WT, were significantly suppressed in Nox1KO. The expression of NOX1 mRNA was much higher in the fractions of enriched liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) than in those of hepatocytes. In primary cultured LSECs,  (PA) up-regulated the mRNA level of NOX1, but not of NOX2 or NOX4. The production of nitric oxide by LSECs was significantly attenuated by PA-treatment in WT but not in Nox1KO. When the in vitro relaxation of TWNT1, a cell line that originated from hepatic stellate cells, was assessed by the gel contraction assay, the relaxation of stellate cells induced by LSECs was attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, the relaxation effect of LSECs was preserved in cells isolated from Nox1KO. Taken together, the up-regulation of NOX1 in LSECs may elicit peroxynitrite-mediated cellular injury and impaired hepatic microcirculation through the reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide. ROS derived from NOX1 may therefore constitute a critical component in the progression of NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods - EndoC-βH1 cells were cultured at standard conditions in either DMEM or DMEM/F12 culture medium. Cell death was analyzed using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Insulin release and content was quantified using a human insulin ELISA. Results - We presently observe that substitution of DMEM for a DMEM/Ham's F12 mixture (50%/50% vol/vol) renders the cells sensitive to the apoptotic effects of sodium palmitate and sodium palmitate + high glucose leading to an increased cell death. Supplementation of the DMEM culture medium with linoleic  partially mimicked the effect of DMEM/F12. Culture of EndoC-βH1 cells in DMEM/F12 resulted also in increased proliferation, ROS production and insulin contents, but markers for metabolic stress, autophagy or amyloid deposits were unaffected. Conclusions - The culture conditions for EndoC-βH1 cells can be modified so these cells display signs of lipotoxicity in response to sodium palmitate.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27051238>The Glucotoxicity Protecting Effect of Ezetimibe in Pancreatic Beta Cells via Inhibition of CD36.</a></h2><p>Inhibition of CD36, a fatty  transporter, has been reported to prevent glucotoxicity and ameliorate high glucose induced beta cell dysfunction. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor that blocks Niemann Pick C1-like 1 protein, but may exert its effect through suppression of CD36. We attempted to clarify the beneficial effect of ezetimibe on insulin secreting cells and to determine whether this effect is related to change of CD36 expression. mRNA expression of insulin and CD36, intracellular peroxide level and glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) under normal (5.6 mM) or high glucose (30 mM) condition in INS-1 cells and primary rat islet cells were compared. Changes of the aforementioned factors with treatment with ezetimibe (20 μM) under normal or high glucose condition were also assessed. mRNA expression of insulin was decreased with high glucose, which was reversed by ezetimibe in both INS-1 cells and primary rat islets. CD36 mRNA expression was increased with high glucose, but decreased by ezetimibe in INS-1 cells and primary rat islets. Three-day treatment with high glucose resulted in an increase in intracellular peroxide level; however, it was decreased by treatment with ezetimibe. Decrease in GSIS by three-day treatment with high glucose was reversed by ezetimibe. Palmitate uptake following exposure to high glucose conditions for three days was significantly elevated, which was reversed by ezetimibe in INS-1 cells. Ezetimibe may prevent glucotoxicity in pancreatic β-cells through a decrease in fatty  influx via inhibition of CD36.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30823378>The Ethanol Extract of  Larvae, Containing Fatty acids and Amino acids, Exerts Anti-Asthmatic Effects through Inhibition of the GATA-3/Th2 Signaling Pathway in Asthmatic Mice.</a></h2><p> larvae (HD), a natural product from an insect resource, possesses many pharmacological properties, including anticoagulant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activity. The major bioactive ingredients include oleic , , palmitoleic , linoleic , proline, and glutamic . Although HD is associated with immunoregulatory activities in allergic diseases, the therapeutic mechanisms of the action of HD in allergic diseases have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-asthmatic potential of HD in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mouse model of allergic asthma. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential of HD was examined to identify a plausible mechanism of action of HD in vitro. HD strongly reduced goblet cell hyperplasia, eosinophil infiltration, and reactive  species (ROS), which reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), inflammation, and the expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The expression of IL-5, IL-4, eotaxin-2, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (loxl2), and GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was attenuated in the lungs. In an in vitro assay, HD exerted immunomodulatory effects through the suppression of Th2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13), IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production through downregulation of GATA-3 expression in EL-4 T cells. These findings suggest that the anti-asthmatic activity of HD may occur through the suppression of Th2 cytokines and total Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production by inhibition of the GATA-3 transcription pathway. Our results suggest that HD may be a potential alternative therapy, or a novel therapeutic traditional medicine, for the treatment of allergic asthma.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26621874>Palmitate-induced impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion precedes mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse pancreatic islets.</a></h2><p>It has been well established that excessive levels of glucose and palmitate lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by pancreatic β-cells. This β-cell 'glucolipotoxicity' is possibly mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, but involvement of bioenergetic failure in the pathological mechanism is the subject of ongoing debate. We show in the present study that increased palmitate levels impair GSIS before altering mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that GSIS defects arise from increased insulin release under basal conditions in addition to decreased insulin secretion under glucose-stimulatory conditions. Real-time respiratory analysis of intact mouse pancreatic islets reveals that mitochondrial ATP synthesis is not involved in the mechanism by which basal insulin is elevated. Equally, mitochondrial lipid oxidation and production of reactive  species (ROS) do not contribute to increased basal insulin secretion. Palmitate does not affect KCl-induced insulin release at a basal or stimulatory glucose level, but elevated basal insulin release is attenuated by palmitoleate and associates with increased intracellular calcium. These findings deepen our understanding of β-cell glucolipotoxicity and reveal that palmitate-induced GSIS impairment is disconnected from mitochondrial dysfunction, a notion that is important when targeting β-cells for the treatment of diabetes and when assessing islet function in human transplants.© 2016 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185389> stimulates interleukin-8 via the TLR4/NF-κB/ROS pathway and induces mitochondrial dysfunction in bovine oviduct epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effect of  (PA), a major saturated fatty  in NEFA, on bovine oviduct epithelial cells (OECs) during in vitro cell culture.Bovine oviductal tissues ipsilateral to the corpus luteum were collected 1-3 days after ovulation; the OECs were isolated and cultured.PA increased lipid accumulation and activated caspase-3 in OECs, resulting in decreased cell proliferation.

However, the implication of dysregulated FFA on semen quality and the involvement of Sertoli cells remain unclear. In the present study, we report obesity decreased Sertoli cell viability through dysregulated FFAs. We observed an increased rate of apoptosis in Sertoli cells, accompanied with elevated FFA levels, in the testes of obese mice that were provided a high-fat diet (HFD). Moreover, the levels of reactive  species were elevated. Furthermore, we demonstrated by in vitro assays that saturated  (PA), which is the most common saturated FFA in plasma, led to decreased cell viability of TM4 Sertoli cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A similar finding was noted in primary mouse Sertoli cells. In contrast to saturated FFA, omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protected Sertoli cells from PA-induced lipotoxicity at the physiologically relevant levels. These results indicated that the lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids might be the cause of obesity-induced Sertoli cell apoptosis, which leads to decreased semen quality.

The cardiomyoblasts were treated in 24 or 96-well plates (according to the test being performed) and maintaining the treatment until the end of hypoxia induction. The molecules were tested at concentrations of 10 and 100μM, cells were treated 24h after assembling the experimental plates and immediately before the I/R. Cell viability, apoptosis and necrosis, and generation of reactive  species were evaluated. Nifedipine and 3,5-dipalmitoyl-nifedipine were used to assess radical scavenging potential and metal chelation. All tested molecules managed to reduce the levels of reactive  species compared to the starvation+vehicle group. In in vitro assays, 3,5-dipalmitoyl-nifedipine showed more antioxidant activity than nifedipine. These results indicate the ability of this molecule to act as a powerful ROS scavenger. Cell viability was highest when cells were induced to I/R by both concentrations of anandamide and the higher concentration of DPN. These treatments also reduced cell death. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the process of hybridization of nifedipine with two  chains assigns a greater cardioprotective effect to this molecule, thereby reducing the damage caused by hypoxia and reoxygenation in cardiomyoblast cultures.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the regulator of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of NASH is still largely unclear. CXCR3 is an essential pro-inflammatory factor in chronic liver diseases. We explored the significance of CXCR3 in regulating mitochondrial function during NASH development in animal models and cultured hepatocytes.The effects of CXCR3 on mitochondrial function were evaluated by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mouse models and . The ultrastructural changes of mitochondria were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Hepatic levels of mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS), DNA damage, membrane potential and ATP were examined.CXCR3 ablation by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mice protected against NASH development by influencing mitochondrial function. Similarly, depletion of CXCR3 reduced steatohepatitis injury in cultured hepatocytes. TEM analysis revealed that liver mitochondrial integrity was much improved in CXCR3 knockout (CXCR3) compared to wildtype (WT) mice. In agreement with this, impaired mitochondrial function was pronounced in WT mice compared to CXCR3 mice, evidenced by increased protein expression of dynamic-related protein-1 (DRP1) and fission-1 (FIS1) and decreased protein expression of mitofusin-1 (MFN1). Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced in AML-12 hepatocytes by methionine and choline deficient medium and in HepG2 cells by . The impaired mitochondrial function in both cell lines was evidenced by reduced membrane potential and ATP content, and by increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation and DNA damage. However, CXCR3 knockdown by siCXCR3 significantly diminished the mitochondrial dysfunction in both AML-12 and HepG2 hepatocytes. In addition, inhibition of CXCR3 by CXCR3 specific antagonists SCH546738 and AMG487 restored mitochondrial function and inhibited mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in the liver of WT mice fed with methionine and choline deficient diet.CXCR3 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis.

Overexpression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic malignancy, correlates to tumor size, lymph node involvement, venous invasion and pathological stage. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are natural TLR4 ligands that have been shown to increase the invasive ability of PC cells. However, rapid inactivation of circulating LPS and low systemic absorption of inhaled LPS from the bronchoalveolar compartment make other agonists such as saturated fatty acids more suitable to be considered for TLR4-related cell invasiveness. Interestingly, PC risk was strongly associated to intake of saturated fat from animal food sources, in particular to consumption of saturated  (PA). In the present study, we investigated the influence of PA on the invasive capacity of human PC cells AsPC-1. Using specific inhibitors, we found that PA stimulation of these tumor cells induced a TLR4-mediated cell invasion. Our results also indicate that the signaling events downstream of TLR4 involved generation of reactive  species, activation of nuclear factor-kappa beta, and secretion and activation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). Furthermore, PA stimulation decreased the levels of the micro RNA 29c (miR-29c). Of note, while inhibition of miR-29c increased MMP-9 mRNA levels, MMP-9 secretion and activation, and invasiveness, miR-29c mimic abrogated all these PA-stimulated effects.

This study examined the effects of omega-3 alpha-linolenic  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive  species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

However, it remains largely unknown whether PPARγ sumoylation inhibits the transactivation effect, leading to endothelium insulin resistance (IR). To test this possibility, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) with a 90% confluence were randomly allocated to two batches. One batch was first pretreated with or without vitamin E for 24 hr and the other infected with adenoviruses containing either PIAS1-shRNA (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1-short hairpin RNA) or scramble shRNA. Cells were suffered from high glucose and  (PA) exposure for further 48 hr. The levels of PPARγ, p-IKK, IKK, and NcoR (nuclear corepressors) were measured by western blot analysis. The interaction of IKK and PIAS1, as well as the PPARγ sumoylation, were examined by coimmunoprecipitation. The results showed that the exposure of high glucose and PA induced reactive  species (ROS) production and IKK activation in HUVECs, promoting the interaction of IKK and PIAS1 and the sumoylation of PPARγ. However, vitamin E and PIAS1-shRNA partially decreased ROS production and IKK activation induced by high glucose and PA exposure. These data indicate that ROS-IKK-PIAS1 pathway mediates PPARγ sumoylation, leading to endothelium IR via stabilizing PPARγ-NcoR complex.

Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic liver injury. CD36 is known to mediate long-chain fatty  (LCFA) uptake and lipid metabolism. However, it is unclear whether LCFA directly promotes hepatocyte activation and the involved mechanisms have not been fully clarified.Mice were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) and normal hepatocyte cells (Chang liver cells) were treated with  (PA) in vivo and in vitro. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to examine the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and hepatocyte activation. CD36 was knocked down by transfecting CD36 siRNA into hepatocyte cells. Hydrogen peroxide (HO) and reactive  species (ROS) levels were detected using commercial kits.HFD induced a profibrogenic response and up-regulated CD36 expression in vivo. Analogously, PA increased lipid accumulation and induced human hepatocyte activation in vitro, which was also accompanied by increased CD36 expression. Interestingly, knockdown of CD36 resulted in a reduction of hepatocyte lipid deposition and decreased expression of Acta2 (34% decrease), Vimentin (29% decrease), Desmin (60% decrease), and TGF-β signaling pathway related genes. In addition, HFD and PA increased the production of HO in vivo (48% increase) and in vitro (385% increase), and the antioxidant, NAC, ameliorated PA-induced hepatocyte activation. Furthermore, silencing of CD36 in vitro markedly attenuated PA-induced oxidative stress (HO: 41% decrease; ROS: 39% decrease), and the anti-activation effects of CD36 knockdown could be abolished by pretreatment with HO.Our study demonstrated that LCFA facilitates hepatocyte activation by up-regulating oxidative stress through CD36, which could be an important mechanism in the development of hepatic fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907023>Telmisartan protects against high glucose/high lipid-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion by reducing the oxidative and ER stress.</a></h2><p>Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, has been widely used for hypertension. It has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of obesity and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high lipid (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of insulin secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM ) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an obesity rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662. In conclusion, the protective effect of telmisartan was mediated by an anti-ER stress-induced apoptotic and anti-oxidative pathway. SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder worldwide pathologically characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high lipid-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the insulin secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29800607>Adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate in IC/BPS or conditions associated to chronic urothelial inflammation.

The production of reactive species and calcium overload are the main contributors to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I / R) injury. We investigated the ability of novel dihydropyridines (DHPs) to improve the effect of protecting against the injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in cardioblasts when compared to nifedipine. Forty three DHPs were created varying the fatty chains derived from , stearic  and oleic acids and aromatic moiety in addition to the addition of chemical elements such as chlorine, nitrogen dioxide, furfural, hydroxyl and methoxy. Cytotoxicity and inhibition of linoleic oxidation were evaluated for all new DHPs and also for nifedipine. The alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were used as antioxidants controls. The compounds with the best antioxidant potential were used in the ischemia and reperfusion (I / R) induction test in cardioblasts (H9c2). Cardioblasts were treated 24 h after assembly of plates and submitted to the ischemia simulation (30 min), after which, normoxia and cellular nutrition conditions were reestablished, simulating reperfusion (additional 30 min). Right after, cell viability, apoptosis, necrosis, and the generation of reactive  species (ROS) were evaluated. Cell viability during I / R was not altered in cells treated with nifedipine, BHT and the new DHP composed of  with hydroxyl group in the aromatic substituent. The other new DHPs increased cell viability during I / R simulation and reduced levels of reactive species compared to the I / R group, demonstrating the antioxidant capacity of the new DHPs. Therefore, DHPS with  and oleic acids in the C3 and C5 position with NO2 or Cl in aromatic moiety, presented the highest antioxidant potential (linoleic oxidant test). The new DHPs increased cell viability during I / R simulation and reduced levels of reactive species compared to the ischemia and reperfusion group, demonstrating the antioxidant capacity of the new DHPs.

In particular, saturated fatty acids such as  (PA) have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. However, how neurons develop insulin resistance in response to lipid overload is not fully understood. Here, we used cultured rat cortical neurons and differentiated human neuroblastoma cells to demonstrate that PA blocks insulin-induced metabolic activation, inhibits the activation of the insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway and activates mTOR kinase downstream of Akt. Despite the fact that fatty acids are not normally used as a significant source of fuel by neural cells, we also found that short-term neuronal exposure to PA reduces the NAD/NADH ratio, indicating that PA modifies the neuronal energy balance. Finally, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production with mitoTEMPO prevented the deleterious effect of PA on insulin signaling. This work provides novel evidence of the mechanisms behind saturated fatty -induced insulin resistance and its metabolic consequences on neuronal cells.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Further investigations demonstrated that the protection of MBD was attributed to two aspects. On the one hand, MBD could attenuate PA-induced oxidative stress by suppressing ROS accumulation, regulating intracellular glutathione and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, MBD could promote PA incorporation into inert triglycerides (TG) to deal with the acute lipid overload, reducing the lipotoxicity caused by PA.

Adiponectin (APN), an adipocyte-secreted hormone from adipose tissues, showed cardioprotective effects. Here, the protective effect of APN on  (PA)-induced endothelial inflammation and IR was investigated. Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with PA without or without APN pretreatment. The expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, adhesion molecule ICAM-1 were determined by western blotting, ELISA, and real-time PCR. The protein expression and protein-protein interaction were determined by western blotting and immunoprecipitation. The intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production were monitored with fluorescence probes. PA-induced secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, and expression of ICAM-1 at protein and mRNA levels, which was significantly inhibited by APN. PA treatment caused increase of ROS generation, NOX2, p-IKKβ, p-IκBα, p-p65 expression, and p-IκBα-IKKβ interaction, which were all partly reversed by APN. ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and NF-κB inhibitor PDTC showed similar effect on PA-induced secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, and expression of ICAM-1. Furthermore, APN and NAC pretreatment restored PA-induced increase of p-IRS-1(S307), decrease of p-IRS-1(Tyr). In addition, insulin-triggered expression of p-IRS-1(Tyr), p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-eNOS and NO generation were inhibited by PA, which were also restored by both APN and NAC. These results suggested that APN ameliorated endothelial inflammation and IR through ROS/IKKβ pathway. This study shed new insights into the mechanisms of APN's cardiovascular protective effect.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The wax esters synthesized are composed of saturated fatty acids and alcohols with chain lengths of 10-18, and the major constituents are myristic  and myristyl alcohol. Since the anaerobic cells gain ATP through the conversion of paramylon to wax esters, the phenomenon is named "wax ester fermentation". The wax ester fermentation is quite unique in that the end products, i.e. wax esters, have relatively high molecular weights, are insoluble in water, and accumulate in the cells, in contrast to the common fermentation end products such as lactic  and ethanol.A unique metabolic pathway involved in the wax ester fermentation is the mitochondrial fatty  synthetic system. In this system, fatty  are synthesized by the reversal of β-oxidation with an exception that trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase functions instead of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Therefore, acetyl-CoA is directly used as a C donor in this fatty  synthesis, and the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which requires ATP, is not necessary. Consequently, the mitochondrial fatty  synthetic system makes possible the net gain of ATP through the synthesis of wax esters from paramylon. In addition, acetyl-CoA is provided in the anaerobic cells from pyruvate by the action of a unique enzyme,  sensitive pyruvate:NADP oxidoreductase, instead of the common pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex.Wax esters produced by anaerobic Euglena are promising biofuels because myristic  (C) in contrast to other algal produced fatty acids, such as  (C) and stearic  (C), has a low freezing point making it suitable as a drop-in jet fuel. To improve wax ester production, the molecular mechanisms by which wax ester fermentation is regulated in response to aerobic and anaerobic conditions have been gradually elucidated by identifying individual genes related to the wax ester fermentation metabolic pathway and by comprehensive gene/protein expression analysis. In addition, expression of the cyanobacterial Calvin cycle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase/sedohepturose-1,7-bisphosphatase, in Euglena provided photosynthesis resulting in increased paramylon accumulation enhancing wax ester production. This chapter will discuss the biochemistry of the wax ester fermentation, recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of the wax ester fermentation and genetic engineering approaches to increase production of wax esters for biofuels.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28665143>Suppression of Lipogenesis via Reactive  Species-AMPK Signaling for Treating Malignant and Proliferative Diseases.</a></h2><p>Systemic diseases often have common characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of targeting common pathological metabolism to inhibit the progression of malignant and proliferative diseases.Gefitinib-resistant (G-R) nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were studied as conditions representative of malignant and proliferative diseases, respectively. Strong lipogenic activity and high expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) were found in both G-R NSCLC cells and synovial fibroblasts from RA patients (RASFs). Berberine (BBR), an effective suppressor of SREBP1 and lipogenesis regulated through reactive  species (ROS)/AMPK pathway, selectively inhibited the growth of G-R NSCLC cells and RASFs but not that of normal cells. It effectively caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activated ROS/AMPK pathway, and finally suppressed cellular lipogenesis and cell proliferation. Addition of ROS blocker, AMPK inhibitor, and  significantly reduced the effect of BBR. In an in vivo study, treatment of BBR led to significant inhibition of mouse tumor xenograft growth and remarkably slowed down the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Innovation and Conclusion: Targeting ROS/AMPK/lipogenesis signaling pathway selectively inhibited the growth of G-R NSCLC cells and the progress of RASFs in vitro and in vivo, which provides a new avenue for treating malignancies and proliferative diseases.

We identified a novel homozygous missense LONP1 variant, c.2282 C > T, (p.Pro761Leu), by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing in two siblings born to healthy consanguineous parents. Both siblings presented with stepwise regression during infancy, profound hypotonia and muscle weakness, severe intellectual disability and progressive cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging. Muscle biopsy revealed the absence of ragged-red fibers, however, scattered cytochrome c oxidase-negative staining and electron dense mitochondrial inclusions were observed. Primary cultured fibroblasts from the siblings showed normal levels of mtDNA and mitochondrial transcripts, and normal activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I through V. Interestingly, fibroblasts of both siblings showed glucose-repressed  consumption compared to their mother, whereas galactose and  utilization were similar. Notably, the siblings' fibroblasts had reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and elevated intracellular lactate:pyruvate ratios, whereas plasma ratios were normal. We demonstrated that in the siblings' fibroblasts, PDH dysfunction was caused by increased levels of the phosphorylated E1α subunit of PDH, which inhibits enzyme activity. Blocking E1α phosphorylation activated PDH and reduced intracellular lactate concentrations. In addition, overexpressing wild-type LonP1 in the siblings' fibroblasts down-regulated phosphoE1α. Furthermore, in vitro studies demonstrated that purified LonP1-P761L failed to degrade phosphorylated E1α, in contrast to wild-type LonP1.

The aim of this study is to analyze the consequences of long-term feeding with a sucrose-rich diet (SRD) on Pomc/ACTH production, define the underlying cellular processes, and determine the effects of moderate exercise (ME) on these parameters. Animals fed a standard chow with or without 30% sucrose in the drinking water were subjected to ME. Circulating hormone levels were determined, and pituitary tissues were processed and analyzed by immunobloting and quantitative real-time PCR. Parameters of oxidative stress (OxS), endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy were also determined. Rats fed SRD developed a decrease in pituitary Pomc/ACTH expression levels, increased expression of antioxidant enzymes, and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy. ME prevented pituitary dysfunction as well as induction of antioxidant enzymes and autophagy. Reporter assays were performed in AtT-20 corticotroph cells incubated in the presence of . Pomc transcription was inhibited by -dependent induction of OxS and autophagy, as judged by the effect of activators and inhibitors of both processes. Long-term feeding with SRD triggers the generation of OxS and autophagy in the pituitary gland, which could lead to a decline in Pomc/ACTH/glucocorticoid production. These effects could be attributed to an increase in fatty acids availability to the pituitary gland. ME was able to prevent these alterations, suggesting additional beneficial effects of ME as a therapeutic strategy in the management of IR.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29161719> Curcumin Ester Facilitates Protection of Neuroblastoma against Oligomeric Aβ40 Insult.</a></h2><p>The generation of reactive  species (ROS) caused by amyloid-β (Aβ) is considered to be one of mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease. Curcumin can attenuate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through ROS scavenging, but the protective effect of intracellular curcumin on neurocyte membranes against extracellular Aβ may be compromised. To address this issue, we synthesized a  curcumin ester (P-curcumin) which can be cultivated on the cell membrane and investigated the neuroprotective effect of P-curcumin and its interaction with Aβ.P-curcumin was prepared through chemical synthesis. Its structure was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). An MTT assay was used to assess Aβ cytotoxicity and the protective effect of P-curcumin on SH-SY5Y cells. The effect of P-curcumin on Aβ-induced ROS production in vitro and in vivo were assessed based on changes in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. A spectrophotometric method was employed to detect lipid peroxidation. To mimic the interaction of P-curcumin on cell membranes with Aβ, liposomes were prepared by thin film method. Finally, the interactions between free P-curcumin and P-curcumin cultivated on liposomes and Aβ were determined via spectrophotometry.A novel derivative,  curcumin ester was prepared and characterized. This curcumin, cultivated on the membranes of neurocytes, may prevent Aβ-mediated ROS production and may inhibit the direct interaction between Aβ and the cellular membrane. Furthermore, P-curcumin could scavenge Aβ-mediated ROS as curcumin in vitro and in vivo, and had the potential to prevent lipid peroxidation. Morphological analyses showed that P-curcumin was better than curcumin at protecting cell shape. To examine P-curcumin's ability to attenuate direct interaction between Aβ and cell membranes, the binding affinity of Aβ to curcumin and P-curcumin was determined. The association constants for free P-curcumin and curcumin were 7.66 × 104 M-1 and 7.61 × 105 M-1, respectively. In the liposome-trapped state, the association constants were 3.71 × 105 M-1 for P-curcumin and 1.44× 106 M-1 for curcumin. With this data, the thermodynamic constants of P-curcumin association with soluble Aβ (ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG) were also determined.Cultivated curcumin weakened the direct interaction between Aβ and cell membranes and showed greater neuroprotective effects against Aβ insult than free curcumin.© 2017 The Author(s).

Free fatty acids (FFAs) induce IR by various mechanisms. A surfeit of circulating FFA leads to intra-myocellular lipid accumulation that induces mitochondrial ROS generation and worsens IR. However, the molecular mechanisms behind are unclear. We identified thioredoxin interacting protein (TxNIP), which is overexpressed in T2DM, to be a promoter of ROS-induced IR. We observed upregulation of TxNIP upon palmitate treatment in skeletal muscle cells that led to ROS generation and Glut-4 downregulation resulting in impaired glucose-uptake. FFA-induced overexpression of TxNIP gene was mediated through the activation of its bona-fide trans activator, ChREBP. Further, Palmitate-induced impairment in AMPK-SIRT-1 pathway resulted in overexpression of ChREBP. While Fenofibrate, abrogated PA-induced TxNIP expression and ROS generation in skeletal muscle cells, Saroglitazar, a dual PPARα/γ-agonist, not only inhibited PA-induced TXNIP expression but also led to greater improvement in glucose uptake. Taken together, TxNIP appears to be an important factor in FFA-induced ROS generation and IR in skeletal muscle cells, which can be modulated for the management of this complex disorder.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The goals of this study were to assess the influence of chronic exposure to high  (PAL) levels on mitochondrial respiratory functions in endothelial cells and isolated mitochondria. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EA.hy926 line) were grown for 6 days in a medium containing either 100 or 150 μM PAL. Growth at high PAL concentrations induced a considerable increase in fatty -supplied respiration and a reduction of mitochondrial respiration during carbohydrate and glutamine oxidation. High PAL levels elevated intracellular and mitochondrial superoxide generation; increased inflammation marker, acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and superoxide dismutase 2 expression; and decreased hexokinase I and pyruvate dehydrogenase expression. No change in aerobic respiration capacity was observed, while fermentation was decreased. In mitochondria isolated from high PAL-treated cells, an increase in the oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine, a decrease in the oxidation of pyruvate, and an increase in UCP2 activity were observed. Our results demonstrate that exposure to high PAL levels induces a shift in endothelial aerobic metabolism toward the oxidation of fatty acids. Increased levels of PAL caused impairment and uncoupling of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Our data indicate that FFAs significantly affect endothelial oxidative metabolism, reactive  species (ROS) formation, and cell viability and, thus, might contribute to endothelial and vascular dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28463985> is a toll-like receptor 4 ligand that induces human dendritic cell secretion of IL-1β.</a></h2><p> (PA) and other saturated fatty acids are known to stimulate pro-inflammatory responses in human immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, the molecular mechanism responsible for fatty  stimulation of TLR4 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PA functions as a ligand for TLR4 on human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Hydrophobicity protein modeling indicated PA can associate with the hydrophobic binding pocket of TLR4 adaptor protein MD-2. Isothermal titration calorimetry quantified heat absorption that occurred during PA titration into TLR4/MD2, indicating that PA binds to TLR4/MD2. Treatment of human MoDCs with PA resulted in endocytosis of TLR4, further supporting the function of PA as a TLR4 agonist. In addition, PA stimulated DC maturation and activation based on the upregulation of DC costimulatory factors CD86 and CD83. Further experiments showed that PA induced TLR4 dependent secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Lastly, our experimental data show that PA stimulation of NF-κB canonical pathway activation is regulated by TLR4 signaling and that reactive  species may be important in upregulating this pro-inflammatory response. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that PA activation of TLR4 occurs in response to direct molecular interactions between PA and MD-2. In summary, our findings suggest a likely molecular mechanism for PA induction of pro-inflammatory immune responses in human dendritic cells expressing TLR4.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240928>Protocatechuic -Ameliorated Endothelial Oxidative Stress through Regulating Acetylation Level via CD36/AMPK Pathway.</a></h2><p>As one of the main metabolites of anthocyanin, protocatechuic  (PCA) possesses strong antioxidant activity.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor-containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and pyroptosis play crucial roles in the progression of NASH. Our team has provided clinical evidence of the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on the improvement in liver function and histological resolution of NAFLD. Preliminary work has demonstrated that GLP-1 inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a mouse model of NAFLD. We further explored the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 analog, in the treatment of NASH. We established a HepG2 cell model of NASH using double stimulation with  and lipopolysaccharide to assess NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptotic cell activity and to evaluate mitochondrial function and mitophagy. Liraglutide reduced lipid accumulation, inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis activation, attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive  species generation, augmented mitophagy in hepatocytes. Mitophagy inhibition with 3-methyladenine/PINK1-directed siRNA weakened the liraglutide-mediated suppression of inflammatory injury.

Hydrogen sulphide (H S) has antioxidative effect, but its regulation on mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in aortic endothelial cells under hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia is unclear. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were treated with 40 mM glucose and 200 μM palmitate to imitate endothelium under hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, and 100 μM NaHS was used as an exogenous H S donor. Firstly, we demonstrated that high glucose and palmitate decreased H S production and CSE expression in RAECs. Then, the antioxidative effect of H S was proved in RAECs under high glucose and palmitate to reduce mitochondrial ROS level. We also showed that exogenous H S inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in RAECs under high glucose and palmitate. Using Mito Tracker and transmission electron microscopy assay, we revealed that exogenous H S decreased mitochondrial fragments and significantly reduced the expression of p-Drp-1/Drp-1 and Fis1 compared to high-glucose and high-palmitate group, whereas it increased mitophagy by transmission electron microscopy assay. We demonstrated that exogenous H S facilitated Parkin recruited by PINK1 by immunoprecipitation and immunostaining assays and then ubiquitylated mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), which illuminated the mechanism of exogenous H S on mitophagy. Parkin siRNA suppressed the expression of Mfn2, Nix and LC3B, which revealed that it eliminated mitophagy. In summary, exogenous H S could protect RAECs against apoptosis under high glucose and palmitate by suppressing oxidative stress, decreasing mitochondrial fragments and promoting mitophagy.

Hypothetically, impaired MetFlex-lip in skeletal muscle induces accumulation of lipid metabolites that interfere with insulin signaling. Our aim was to compare MetFlex-lip during exercise in subjects with low (Low_IS) vs. high (High_IS) insulin sensitivity. Twenty healthy men were designated as Low_IS or High_IS on the basis of the median of the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index. Groups had similar age, body mass index, and maximum  uptake (V̇o). Subjects cycled at 50% V̇o until expending 650 kcal. Adaptation in lipid oxidation was calculated as the drop in respiratory quotient (RQ) at the end of exercise vs. the maximum RQ (ΔRQ). Lipid availability was calculated as the increase in circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) at the end of exercise vs. the minimum NEFA (ΔNEFA). ΔRQ as a function of ΔNEFA was used to determine MetFlex-lip. On average, RQ and circulating NEFA changed similarly in both groups. However, ΔRQ correlated with ΔNEFA in High_IS ( r = -0.83, P < 0.01) but not in Low_IS ( r = -0.25, P = 0.48) subjects. Thus the slope of the ΔRQ vs. ΔNEFA relationship was steeper in High_IS vs. Low_IS subjects (-0.139 ± 0.03 vs. -0.025 ± 0.03 RQ·mmol·l, respectively; P < 0.05), with similar intercepts. We conclude that in subjects with High_IS lipid-to-carbohydrate oxidation ratio adapts to the increased circulating NEFA availability during exercise. Such MetFlex-lip appears impaired in subjects with Low_IS.

The present study therefore investigated the effect of geraniol on endothelial function in HFD mice and its underlying mechanisms. C57 BL/6 mice were fed an HFD (n = 40) or a normal diet (n = 20) for 8 weeks. HFD fed mice then were randomized to intraperitoneal treatment with geraniol (n = 20) or vehicle (n = 20) for another 6 weeks. Acetylcholine (Ach)-induced endothelial dependent vasorelaxation was measured on wire myography; reactive  species (ROS) generation was assessed by fluorescence imaging, and NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and adhesive molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein expression by western blotting. Geraniol improved endothelial function in HFD fed mice, as evidenced by its: 1. restoring endothelial dependent vasorelaxation induced by Ach, and reversing increased VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression; 2. attenuating HFD induced increased serum TBARS and aortic ROS generation; and 3. downregulating aortic NOX-2 expression in both HFD fed mice and in  treated endothelial cells.

Indirect findings suggest that the two molecules can reduce the activation of mastocytes in brain ischemia, thus modulating crucial cells that trigger the inflammatory cascade. Though, no evidence exists about a direct effect of PEA and luteolin on mast cells in experimental models of brain ischemia, either used separately or in combination. In order to fill this gap, we developed a novel cell-based model of severe brain ischemia consisting of primary mouse cortical neurons and cloned mast cells derived from mouse fetal liver (MC/9 cells) subjected to  and glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD exposure promoted both mast cell degranulation and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a time-dependent fashion. MC/9 cells exacerbated neuronal damage in neuron-mast cells co-cultures exposed to OGD. Likewise, the conditioned medium derived from OGD-exposed MC/9 cells induced significant neurotoxicity in control primary neurons. PEA and luteolin pre-treatment synergistically prevented the OGD-induced degranulation of mast cells and reduced the neurotoxic potential of MC/9 cells conditioned medium. Finally, the association of the two drugs promoted a direct synergistic neuroprotection even in pure cortical neurons exposed to OGD. In summary, our results indicate that mast cells release neurotoxic factors upon OGD-induced activation. The association PEA-luteolin actively reduces mast cell-mediated neurotoxicity as well as pure neurons susceptibility to OGD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Increased production of reactive  species (ROS) as a result of PA exposure contributes to the onset of neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, high fat diets lead to changes in hypothalamic gene expression profiles including suppression of the anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax). Orexin A (OXA), a hypothalamic peptide important in obesity resistance, also contributes to neuroprotection. Prior studies have demonstrated that OXA attenuates oxidative stress induced cell death. We hypothesized that OXA would be neuroprotective against PA induced cell death. To test this, we treated an immortalized hypothalamic cell line (designated mHypoA-1/2) with OXA and PA. We demonstrate that OXA attenuates PA-induced hypothalamic cell death via reduced caspase-3/7 apoptosis, stabilization of Bcl-2 gene expression, and reduced Bax/Bcl-2 gene expression ratio. We also found that OXA inhibits ROS production after PA exposure. Finally, we show that PA exposure in mHypoA-1/2 cells significantly reduces basal respiration, maximum respiration, ATP production, and reserve capacity. However, OXA treatment reverses PA-induced changes in intracellular metabolism, increasing basal respiration, maximum respiration, ATP production, and reserve capacity. Collectively, these results support that OXA protects against PA-induced hypothalamic dysregulation, and may represent one mechanism through which OXA can ameliorate effects of obesogenic diet on brain health.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31223033>Pterostilbene reverses  mediated insulin resistance in HepG2 cells by reducing oxidative stress and triglyceride accumulation.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) is known to precede onset of type 2 diabetes and increased oxidative stress appears to be a deleterious factor leading to IR. In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse  (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive  species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria.

EDL fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice had enhanced mitochondrial oxidation capacity under FCCP-induced maximal respiration, when compared to control chow-fed mice.Metabolic dysfunction in skeletal muscle contributes to the aetiology and development of muscle diseases and metabolic diseases. As such, assessment of skeletal muscle cellular bioenergetics provides a powerful means to understand the role of skeletal muscle metabolism in disease and to identify possible therapeutic targets. Here, we developed a method that allows for the real-time assessment of cellular respiration in intact skeletal muscle fibre bundles obtained from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of adult mice. Using this method, we assessed the contribution of ATP turnover and proton leak to basal mitochondrial  consumption rate (OCR). Our data demonstrate that the mitochondria in EDL fibres are loosely coupled. Moreover, in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), we show that palmitate exposure induced comparable peak OCR and higher total OCR in EDL fibre bundles when compared to pyruvate exposure, suggesting that fatty acids might be a more sustainable fuel source for skeletal muscle when mitochondria are driven to maximal respiration. Application of this method to EDL fibre bundles obtained from chronic high-fat diet fed mice revealed lower basal OCR and enhanced mitochondrial oxidation capacity in the presence of FCCP when compared to the chow-diet fed control mice. By using a 96-well microplate format, our method provides a flexible and efficient platform to investigate mitochondrial parameters of intact skeletal muscle fibres obtained from adult mice.© 2016 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA promotes brown adipogenesis by modulating miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, murine brown preadipocytes were induced to differentiate the fatty acids of , oleate, or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA). The increases of brown-specific signature genes and  consumption rate by EPA were concurrent with up-regulation of miR-30b and 378 but not by oleate or . Next, we hypothesize that free fatty  receptor 4 (Ffar4), a functional receptor for n-3 PUFA, modulates miR-30b and 378. Treatment of Ffar4 agonist (GW9508) recapitulated the thermogenic activation of EPA by increasing  consumption rate, brown-specific marker genes, and miR-30b and 378, which were abrogated in Ffar4-silenced cells. Intriguingly, addition of the miR-30b mimic was unable to restore EPA-induced Ucp1 expression in Ffar4-depleted cells, implicating that Ffar4 signaling activity is required for up-regulating the brown adipogenic program. Moreover, blockage of miR-30b or 378 by locked nucleic  inhibitors significantly attenuated Ffar4 as well as brown-specific signature gene expression, suggesting the signaling interplay between Ffar4 and miR-30b/378. The association between miR-30b/378 and brown thermogenesis was also confirmed in fish oil-fed C57/BL6 mice. Interestingly, the Ffar4 agonism-mediated signaling axis of Ffar4-miR-30b/378-Ucp1 was linked with an elevation of cAMP in brown adipocytes, similar to cold-exposed or fish oil-fed brown fat. Taken together, our work identifies a novel function of Ffar4 in modulating brown adipogenesis partly through a mechanism involving cAMP activation and up-regulation of miR-30b and miR-378.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27371118>Disturbance of mitochondrial functions provoked by the major long-chain 3-hydroxylated fatty acids accumulating in MTP and LCHAD deficiencies in skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of the muscular symptoms and recurrent rhabdomyolysis that are commonly manifested in patients with mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) and long-chain 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiencies is still unknown. In this study we investigated the effects of the major long-chain monocarboxylic 3-hydroxylated fatty acids (LCHFA) accumulating in these disorders, namely 3-hydroxytetradecanoic (3HTA) and 3-hydroxypalmitic (3HPA) acids, on important mitochondrial functions in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria. 3HTA and 3HPA markedly increased resting (state 4) and decreased ADP-stimulated (state 3) and CCCP-stimulated (uncoupled) respiration. 3HPA provoked similar effects in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers, validating the results obtained in purified mitochondria. Furthermore, 3HTA and 3HPA markedly diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD(P)H content and Ca(2+) retention capacity in Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondria. Mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) induction probably underlie these effects since they were totally prevented by cyclosporin A and ADP. In contrast, the dicarboxylic analogue of 3HTA did not alter the tested parameters. Our data strongly indicate that 3HTA and 3HPA behave as metabolic inhibitors, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and mPT inducers in skeletal muscle. It is proposed that these pathomechanisms disrupting mitochondrial homeostasis may be involved in the muscle alterations characteristic of MTP and LCHAD deficiencies.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, there are great potential clinical implications in developing pharmacological interventions targeting endothelial insulin resistance. Our previous studies indicated that argirein which was developed by combining rhein with L-arginine by a hydrogen bond, could substantially relieved stress related exacerbation of cardiac failure and alleviated cardiac dysfunction in T2DM, which was associated with suppressing NADPH oxidase activity. However, it is unclear whether argirein treatment attenuates the vascular lesion and dysfunction in T2DM and its underlying mechanisms.The rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were used to treat with  (PA), a most common saturated free fatty , which could induce insulin resistance. It was showed that argirein increased glucose uptake and glucose transporter-4 (Glut4) expression and reversed the phosphorylation of IRS-1-ser307 and AKT-ser473, consequently resulting in the increase of the production of eNOS and NO in PA-induced RAECs. We further found that argirein blocked the Nox4-dependent superoxide (O) generation, which regulated glucose metabolism in RAECs during PA stimulation. In vitro, argirein increased the release of endothelial NO to relieve the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and insulin, and restored the expression of Nox4 and pIRS-1-ser307 in the aorta endothelium of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats following an injection of streptozocin (STZ).These results suggested that argirein could improve endothelial insulin resistance which was attributed to inhibiting Nox4-dependent redox signaling in RAECs. These studies thus revealed the novel effect of argirein to prevent the vascular complication in T2DM.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Prior studies indicate that RNASET2 is induced in response to oxidative stress and that overexpression of RNASET2 sensitizes cells to reactive  species (ROS)-induced cell death through a mechanism that is independent of catalytic activity. Herein, we report a loss-of-function genetic screen that identified RNASET2 as an essential gene for lipotoxic cell death. Haploinsufficiency of RNASET2 confers increased antioxidant capacity and generalized resistance to oxidative stress-mediated cell death in cultured cells. This function is critically dependent on catalytic activity. Furthermore, knockdown of RNASET2 in the Drosophila fat body confers increased survival in the setting of oxidative stress inducers. Together, these findings demonstrate that RNASET2 regulates antioxidant tone and is required for physiological ROS responses.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220103>Metabolic modulation predicts heart failure tests performance.</a></h2><p>The metabolic changes that accompany changes in Cardiopulmonary testing (CPET) and heart failure biomarkers (HFbio) are not well known. We undertook metabolomic and lipidomic phenotyping of a cohort of heart failure (HF) patients and utilized Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) to identify associations to CPET and HFBio test performance (peak  consumption (Peak VO2),  uptake efficiency slope (OUES), exercise duration, and minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production slope (VE/VCO2 slope), as well as the established HF biomarkers of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP), beta-galactoside-binding protein (galectin-3), and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)). A cohort of 49 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, predominantly males African American, presenting a high frequency of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were used in the study. MRA revealed that metabolic models for VE/VCO2 and Peak VO2 were the most fitted models, and the highest predictors' coefficients were from Acylcarnitine C18:2, , citric , asparagine, and 3-hydroxybutiric . Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) used predictors to identify the most relevant metabolic pathways associated to the study, aminoacyl-tRNA and amino  biosynthesis, amino  metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, sphingolipid and glycerolipid metabolism, fatty  biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) found associations of our findings with pre-existing biological knowledge from studies of human plasma metabolism as brain dysfunction and enzyme deficiencies associated with lactic acidosis. Our results indicate a profile of oxidative stress, lactic acidosis, and metabolic syndrome coupled with mitochondria dysfunction in patients with HF tests poor performance.

In normoxia cells can generate unsaturated FA from saturated stearic and  by desaturation. However, since the desaturation step is -dependent hypoxic cancer cells display an increased dependence on the uptake of unsaturated FA. Up to now the mechanism of increased FA uptake in hypoxia is largely unknown. Here we aimed to study the role of human serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) in the regulation of FA uptake in cancer cells exposed to acute or chronic cycling hypoxia and explore its use as target for the radiosensitization of hypoxic cancer cells.The effect of SGK1-inhibition (GSK650394) on NCI-H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to normoxia, acute or chronic cycling hypoxia was analyzed under standard and serum-deprived conditions by short-term proliferation, apoptosis and cell death assays. The impact of SGK1-inhibition on radiation sensitivity was determined by standard colony formation assays. The effect of GSK650394 on FA uptake was quantified by measuring intracellular accumulation of fluorescent FA (C1-BODIPY®-C12).Exposure to acute or chronic cycling hypoxia was associated with up-regulated expression of SGK1 in NCI-H460 cells, increased uptake of FA from the culture medium, and increased sensitivity to serum deprivation. Survival of serum-deprived hypoxic NCI-H460 cells was rescued by the addition of the unsaturated FA, oleic , whereas the saturated FA,  was highly toxic to the hypoxic cancer cells. Interestingly, SGK1 inhibition abrogated the rescue effect of oleic  in serum-deprived hypoxic cancer cells and this effect was associated with a reduction in FA uptake particularly in anoxia-tolerant cancer cells exposed to severe hypoxia. Finally, SKG1 inhibition decreased long-term survival and potently sensitized the parental and anoxia-tolerant NCI-H460 cells to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation in normoxia as well as the anoxia-tolerant cancer cells in severe hypoxia.Our data suggest that SGK1 plays a role in the regulation of FA uptake that becomes essential under conditions of acute or chronic cycling hypoxia.

Resveratrol (RSV) attenuates the oxidative injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Autophagy is critical for the RSV-induced protective effects. However, the exact underlying mechanisms haven't been completely elucidated. Thus, we aimed to explore the role of autophagy of the anti-oxidation of RSV and the underlying mechanism in  (PA)-stimulated HUVECs.HUVECs were pretreated with 10 μM of RSV for 2 h and treated with 200 μM of PA for an additional 24 h. Cell viability, intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were estimated with a microplate reader and confocal microscope. Autophagosomes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, while lysosomes by confocal microscopy. The expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and related genes were quantified by qRT-PCR assay. Furthermore, TFEB levels, autophagy, and lysosomes were examined by western blot assay.RSV pretreatment suppressed the PA-induced decline in cell viability and elevation in ROS and MDA levels in HUVECs. RSV pretreatment also increased LC3 production and P62 degradation while promoted the autophagosomes formation. However, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) treatment attenuated RSV-induced autophagy. RSV pretreatment upregulated the TFEB and TFEB-modulated downstream genes expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, in cells transfected with TFEB small interfering RNA, RSV-induced TFEB expression and subsequent autophagy were abolished. Meanwhile, the TFEB-modulated genes expression, the lysosomes formation and the RSV-induced anti-oxidation were suppressed.In HUVECs, RSV attenuates endothelial oxidative injury by inducing autophagy in a TFEB-dependent manner.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768267>Type 2 Diabetes Promotes Cell Centrosome Amplification via AKT-ROS-Dependent Signalling of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes is associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage which can cause centrosome amplification. Thus, the study investigated centrosome amplification in type 2 diabetes and the underlying mechanisms.Centrosome numbers in human peripheral blood mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes were compared to access the association between type 2 diabetes and centrosome amplification. Colon cancer cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the centrosome amplification triggered by high glucose, insulin and . Western blot analysis was used to quantify the level of protein and protein phosphorylation. Immunofluorescent staining was performed to detect centrosomes. ROS was quantified using flow cytometry technique.

High glucose, insulin and , alone or in combinations, induced ROS production and centrosome amplification. Together, they increased AKT activation as well as the expression, binding and centrosome translation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ. Results from further analyses showed that AKT-ROS-dependent upregulations of expression, binding and centrosome translocation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ was the molecular pathway underlying the centrosome amplification in vitro triggered by high glucose, insulin and . Moreover, the key in vitro molecular signalling events activated by high glucose, insulin and  were verified in PBMC from the patients with type 2 diabetes.Our results show that type 2 diabetes promotes cell centrosome amplification, and suggest that the diabetic pathophysiological factors-activated AKT-ROS-dependent signalling of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ is the underlying molecular mechanism.© 2018 The Author(s).

Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrially localized member of NAD -dependent deacetylase has been shown to protect hepatocytes against the oxidative stress. The role of SIRT3 on the cytotoxicity caused by fatty acids in liver cells is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression level of SIRT3, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial impairments in human hepatoma HepG2 cells exposed to  (PA). Our results showed that PA treatment caused the deposition of lipid droplets and resulted in an increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-α in a dose-dependent manner. Excessive accumulation of PA induces the reactive  species formation and apoptosis while dissipating the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The level of SIRT3 expression in both nuclear and mitochondrial fractions in HepG2 cells was decreased with the increase in PA concentrations. However, in the cytosolic fraction, the SIRT3 was undetectable. In conclusion, our results showed that PA caused an increase in inflammation and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. The exposure of PA also resulted in the decline in transmembrane potential and an increase in apoptosis. The underexpression of nuclear and mitochondrial SIRT3 by PA suggests that the PA target the process that regulates the stress-related gene expression and mitochondrial functions.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005715>Rare ginsenosides ameliorate lipid overload-induced myocardial insulin resistance via modulating metabolic flexibility.</a></h2><p>Rare ginsenosides are found in ginseng and notoginseng, two medicinal plants widely used in China for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes.

In vivo, mice were fed with HFD and received RGSE, metformin or DCA for 6 weeks. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), glucose uptake and reactive  species (ROS) production were measured by fluorescence labeling. Other assessments including  consumption rate (OCR) were also performed.RGSE prevented PA-induced decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) expression, and ameliorated insulin-mediated glucose uptake and utilization in H9c2 cells. Metformin and mildronate exhibited similar effects. In vivo, RGSE counteracted HFD-induced increase in myocardial expression of p-PDH and CPT1 and ameliorated cardiac insulin signaling. Metformin and DCA also showed beneficial effects. Further study showed that RGSE decreased OCR and mitochondrial complex I activity in PA-treated H9c2 cells, reduced ROS production and relieved mitochondrial oxidative stress, thus decreased serine phosphorylation in IRS-1.RGSE ameliorated myocardial insulin sensitivity under conditions of lipid overload, which was tightly associated with the decrease in mitochondrial oxidative stress via modulating glucose and fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2018.

Recently, it has also been reported that PA is an autophagy inducer. However, the causal association and underlying mechanism of induced autophagy and ROS in PA toxicity remain unclear. The present study demonstrates for the first time that PA-induced autophagy enhances ROS generation via activating the calcium ion/protein kinase Cα/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (Ca/PKCα/NOX4) pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It was revealed that PA treatment resulted in a significant increase in ROS generation and autophagic activity, leading to endothelial dysfunction as indicated by downregulated nitric oxide synthesis, decreased capillary-like structure formation and damaged cell repair capability. Furthermore, PA effectively activated the Ca/PKCα/NOX4 pathway, which is indicative of upregulated cytosolic Ca levels, activated PKCα and increased NOX4 protein expression. 3-Methyladenine was then used to inhibit autophagy, which significantly reduced PA-induced ROS generation and blocked the Ca/PKCα/NOX4 pathway. The endothelial dysfunction caused by PA was ameliorated by downregulating ROS generation using a NOX4 inhibitor.

Previously, we found that a 5/6th nephrectomy model of CKD leads to an upregulation of miR-21-5p in the left ventricle, targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and altering the expression of numerous transcripts involved with fatty  oxidation and glycolysis. In the present study, we evaluated the potential for knockdown or overexpression of miR-21-5p to regulate lipid content, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial respiration in H9C2 cells. Cells were transfected with anti-miR-21-5p (40 nM), pre-miR-21-5p (20 nM), or the appropriate scrambled oligonucleotide controls before lipid treatment in culture or as part of the Agilent Seahorse XF fatty  oxidation assay. Overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuated the lipid-induced increase in cellular lipid content, whereas suppression of miR-21-5p augmented it. The abundance of malondialdehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased with lipid treatment in control cells but attenuated in pre-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. This suggests that miR-21-5p reduces oxidative stress. The cellular  consumption rate (OCR) was increased in both pre-miR-21-5p- and anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells. Levels of intracellular ATP were significantly higher in anti-mR-21-5p-transfected cells. Pre-miR-21-5p blocked additional increases in OCR in response to etomoxir and . Conversely, anti-miR-21-5p-transfected cells exhibited reduced OCR with both etomoxir and , and the glycolytic capacity was concomitantly reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuates both lipid content and lipid peroxidation in H9C2 cells. This likely occurs by reducing cellular lipid uptake and utilization, shifting cellular metabolism toward reliance on the glycolytic pathway.

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in innate immunity and inflammation although its role in high fat diet-induced obesity cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. This study was designed to examine the effect of TLR4 ablation on high fat diet intake-induced cardiac anomalies, if any, and underlying mechanism(s) involved. Wild-type (WT) and TLR4 knockout mice were fed normal or high fat (60% calorie from fat) diet for 12weeks prior to assessment of mechanical and intracellular Ca properties. The inflammatory signaling proteins (TLR4, NF-κB, and JNK) and autophagic markers (Atg5, Atg12, LC3B and p62) were evaluated. Our results revealed that high fat diet intake promoted obesity, marked decrease in fractional shortening, and cardiomyocyte contractile capacity with dampened intracellular Ca release and clearance, elevated ROS generation and oxidative stress as measured by aconitase activity, the effects of which were significantly attenuated by TLR4 knockout. In addition, high fat intake downregulated levels of Atg5, Atg12 and LC3B, while increasing p62 accumulation. TLR4 knockout itself did not affect Atg5, Atg12, LC3B and p62 levels while it reconciled high fat diet intake-induced changes in autophagy. In addition, TLR4 knockout alleviated high fat diet-induced phosphorylation of IKKβ, JNK and mTOR. In vitro study revealed that  suppressed cardiomyocyte contractile function, the effect of which was inhibited the TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095, the JNK inhibitor AS601245 or the NF-κB inhibitor Celastrol.

Therefore, we sought to explore active, naturally occurring compounds that promote the recovery of HMW adiponectin secretion suppressed by  in our model. A total of 90 crude drug extracts were screened for the ability to augment HMW adiponectin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with . Panaxynol was isolated from Saposhnikovia divaricata as an active compound with HMW adiponectin promoting properties. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists are reported to increase the secretion of HMW adiponectin, although the effects of panaxynol were found to be independent of PPARγ activation. When the underlying mechanisms were further examined, panaxynol was found to inhibit the -induced downregulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) protein, and the anti-lipotoxic effects were abolished by a FoxO1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) mRNA levels were also increased by panaxynol. Reactive  species have critical roles in the reduction in HMW adiponection secretion by ; however, panaxynol reduced this increase in reactive  species generation, followed by reductions in markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation. Taken together, these findings suggest that panaxynol ameliorates the impaired HMW adiponection secretion in adipocytes treated with  by restoring FoxO1 expression, owing to inhibition of reactive  species generation, in a PPARγ-independent manner.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the protective role and the potential mechanisms of a traditional Chinese medicine ShenFu (SF) preparation in an in vitro hepatic steatosis model.In  (PA)-induced murine hepatic AML12 cell injury, effects of SF preparation on cellular apoptosis and intracellular triglyceride (iTG) level were assessed using TUNEL and TG Colorimetric Assay. Reactive  species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) levels were measured using DCF and JC-1 assay. Cytokine levels were evaluated using ELISA assay. Immunoblot was used to compare the activation level of c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK), NADPH oxidase (Nox4), and NFκB pathways.Addition of SF preparation prevented PA-mediated increase of apoptosis and iTG as well as IL-8 and IL-6. In PA-treated cell, SF preparation reduced the level of Nox4 and ROS, while increasing the level of MMP and the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase, indicating emendation of mitochondrial dysfunction. Nox4 inhibitor GKT137381 prevented PA-induced increase of ROS and apoptosis, while decreasing iTG slightly and not influencing the level of IL-8 and IL-6. SF preparation prevented PA-induced upregulation of phospho-JNK. JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevented PA-mediated increase of Nox4, IL-8, IL-6 and iTG. Nuclear translocation of NFκB/p65 was detected in PA-treated cells, which was prevented by SF preparation. An IκB degradation inhibitor, BAY11-7082, prevented PA-induced increase of IL-8 and IL-6 as well as iTG, whereas it only decreased ROS levels slightly and showed no influence on cellular apoptosis.SF preparation shows a beneficial role in prevention of hepatocyte injury by attenuating oxidative stress and cytokines production at least partially through inhibition of JNK/Nox4 and JNK/NFκB pathway, respectively.© 2018 The Author(s).

However, therapies that can modulate the function of beta cells and thus prevent their failure have not been well explored. In this study, beta cell injury model was established with  (PA) to simulate the lipotoxicity (high-fat diet) found in T2DM. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a novel physicochemical treatment, was applied to treat injured beta cells. We found that SDT had specific effects on mitochondria and induced transient large amount of mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production in beta cells. SDT also improved the morphology and function of abnormal mitochondria, inhibited inflammatory response and reduced beta cell dysfunction. The improvement of mitochondria was mediated by PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Additionally, SDT rescued the transcription of PINK1 mRNA which was blocked by PA treatment, thus providing abundant PINK1 for mitophagy. Moreover, SDT also increased insulin secretion from beta cells. The protective effects of SDT were abrogated when mitophagy was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA). In summary, SDT potently inhibits lipotoxicity-induced beta cell failure via PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, providing theoretical guidance for T2DM treatment in aspects of islet protection.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31034903>Polysaccharide from Rubus chingii Hu affords protection against -induced lipotoxicity in human hepatocytes.</a></h2><p> (PA) is known to induce lipotoxicity, a metabolic syndrome as a result of lipid accumulation in multiple cell lines. Bioactive phytochemicals derived from vegetables and fruits have gained increasing attention owing to their potential on suppressing the detrimental effect of excessive PA accumulation. However, the protective effect of natural phytochemicals derived from Rubus chingii Hu, a kind of fruit widely grown in China, against PA-induced lipotoxicity is still uncleared. In the present study, we therefore extracted the polysaccharide from Rubus chingii Hu, and identified its chemical structure. Structural characterization by HPLC, HPGPC, IR spectroscopy and GC indicated that the polysaccharide mainly consists of galacturonic  and arabinose with copious 1 → 2 glycosidic linkages in its backbone. In addition, our results showed the cytoprotective effect of the polysaccharide against PA-induced lipotoxicity in normal human hepatocyte cell line L02. Further study indicated that the polysaccharide mitigated oxidative stress through impeding cellular reactive  species (ROS) accumulation, alleviating mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse and attenuating glutathione (GSH) reduction. Overall, this study revealed that Rubus chingii Hu polysaccharide was capable of effectively alleviating -induced lipotoxicity, which provided a novel perspective of the health-promoting potential of isolated polysaccharide.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of stable overexpression of γ-synuclein (γ-syn), a neuronal protein recently recognized as a novel regulator of lipid handling in adipocytes, and transient overexpression of Parkinson's disease (PD) α-synuclein [α-syn; wild-type (wt) and its pathogenic mutants A53T, A30P and E46K] in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, were also evaluated. The effects of co-treatment of PA with paraquat (PQ), a Parkinsonian pesticide, and leptin, a hormone involved in the brain-adipose axis, were also assessed. Cell death mode and cell cycle were analyzed by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. Reactive  species (ROS) level was determined using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescien diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and lipid peroxidation level was determined using thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) assay.MTT assay revealed dose- and time-dependent PA cytotoxicity on SH-SY5Y and T98G cells, but not OA and LA. The cytotoxicity was significantly lower in SH-SY5Y-γ-syn cells, while transient overexpression of wt α-syn or its PD mutants (A30P and E46K, but not A53T) modestly (but still significantly) rescued the cytotoxicity of PA in SH-SY5Y and T98G cells. Co-treatment of increasing concentrations of PQ exacerbated PA's neurotoxicity. Pre-treatment of leptin, an anti-apoptotic adipokine, did not successfully rescue SH-SY5Y cells from PA-induced cytotoxicity-suggesting a mechanism of PA-induced leptin resistance. Annexin V/PI flow cytometry analysis revealed PA-induced increase in percentages of cells in annexin V-positive/PI-negative quadrant (early apoptosis) and subG-G fraction, accompanied by a decrease in G-M phase cells. The PA-induced ROS production and lipid peroxidation was at greater extent in T98G as compared to that in SH-SY5Y.In conclusion, PA induces apoptosis by increasing oxidative stress in neurons and astrocytes.

In order to deal with these complications, we designed a new therapeutic strategy, i.e. coculture system containing human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HAMSCs) and human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). Two in vitro coculture models, transwell and mixed cocultures, were proposed for 7 days with variable HAMSCs: HBMSCs ratios. Then, supernatant from each coculture was used to reverse the deficiency of HBMSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired by high glucose and  (GP). We found that glucolipotoxicity caused by GP remarkably inhibited cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as induced the reactive  species (ROS) level in HBMSCs. Meanwhile, glucolipotoxicity suppressed cell proliferation, tube formation capacity and angiogenic potential of HUVECs. Though, HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture system reduced HBMSCs dysfunction by antioxidant properties and promoted angiogenesis in HUVECs. The mixed HAMSCs/HBMSCs coculture at the optimal ratio of 3/1 showed significantly greater cell proliferation, antioxidant properties, osteogenic and angiogenic differentiation than HBMSCs or HUVECs alone. In conclusion, the current coculture system of HAMSCs/HBMSCs can be a potential therapeutic material for advancing bone and vascular regeneration against DM-induced glucolipotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Hypothalamic inflammation has also been related to oxidative stress.  (PA) is the most abundant free fatty  found in food, and in vitro studies indicate that it triggers a pro-inflammatory response in the brain. Melanocortins are neuropeptides with proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective action mediated by melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), but little is known about the effect of melanocortins on oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether melanocortins could alleviate oxidative stress induced by a high fat diet (HFD) model. We found that NDP-MSH treatment decreased PA-induced reactive  species production in astrocytes, an effect blocked by the MC4R inhibitor JKC363. NDP-MSH abolished nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by PA and blocked the inhibitory effect of PA on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione levels while it also per se increased activity of SOD and γ-glutamate cysteine ligase (γ-GCL) antioxidant enzymes.

The aim of this study is to examine whether MD2 participates in reactive  species increase and vascular remodeling.Male MD2 mice and wild-type littermates with a C57BL/6 background were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish obesity-induced vascular remodeling. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated with PA to induce oxidative stress and injury.In vivo, MD2 deficiency significantly reduced HFD-induced vascular oxidative stress, fibrosis, and remodeling, accompanied with AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation and nuclear factor erythroid (Nrf2) upregulation. In VSMCs and RAECs, inhibition of MD2 by neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MD2 or small interfering RNA knockdown significantly activated the AMPK/Nrf2-signaling pathway and reduced PA-induced oxidative stress and cell injury.It was demonstrated that the deletion or inhibition of MD2 protects against HFD/FFA-induced vascular oxidative stress and remodeling by activating the AMPK/Nrf2-signaling pathway.© 2017 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222180>[ induces hepatocellular oxidative stress and activation of inflammasomes].</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of  (PA) on oxidative stress and activation of inflammasomes in hepatocytes.To test the dose-dependent effect of PA on normal murine hepatocytes AML12, the cells were treated with 0, 0.15, 0.25 and 0.4 mmol/L of  (PA).

We have investigated the potential role of Gal-3 in the cardiac metabolic disturbances associated with obesity. In addition, we have explored whether this participation is, at least partially, acting on mitochondrial damage. Gal-3 inhibition in rats that were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks with modified citrus pectin (MCP; 100 mg/kg/day) attenuated the increase in cardiac levels of total triglyceride (TG). MCP treatment also prevented the increase in cardiac protein levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase IA, mitofusin 1, and mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive  species accumulation and decrease in those of complex V but did not affect the reduction in F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake observed in HFD rats. The exposure of cardiac myoblasts (H9c2) to  increased the rate of respiration, mainly due to an increase in the proton leak, glycolysis, oxidative stress, β-oxidation and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Gal-3 activity was unable to affect these changes. Our findings indicate that Gal-3 inhibition attenuates some of the consequences of cardiac lipotoxicity induced by a HFD since it reduced TG and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) levels. These reductions were accompanied by amelioration of the mitochondrial damage observed in HFD rats, although no improvement was observed regarding insulin resistance.

Evaluation of mitochondrial function and the production of reactive  species confirmed the deleterious effects of palmitate. Also, the microplate PI assay demonstrated high sensitivity, as indicated by the detection of modest fluctuations in cell viability in response to catalase overexpression in palmitate-treated cells.

Free fatty acids (FFAs) are known to cause damage in various tissues by inducing inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether a FFA (palmitate) induces inflammation in zebrafish embryos. Nitrous oxide (NO) production and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression were increased in palmitate-treated zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner. mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α), were also increased. Additionally, the mRNA expression of p65 nuclear factor-kB and I-kB-α were significantly increased after palmitate-treatment. Increased reactive  species (ROS) expression was observed in palmitate-treated zebrafish embryos as well as pericardial edema. Additionally, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in zebrafish liver and pancreas fed with palmitate-contained diet. Taken together, these results indicated that palmitate increases pro-inflammatory mediators in zebrafish embryos, suggesting that zebrafish could be an alternative animal model for inflammatory disease including diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, glycomimetics represent a unique source of novel therapies to target aberrant signaling and protein interactions in a wide range of diseases. We investigated the protective effects of four newly synthesized small molecule glycomimetics against lipid-induced endothelial dysfunction, with an emphasis on nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress.Four aromatic sugar mimetics were synthesized by the stepwise transformation of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic  to derivatives (C1-C4) incorporating sulfate groups to mimic the structure of heparan sulfate.Glycomimetic-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to  to model lipid-induced oxidative stress. Palmitate-induced impairment of NO production was restored by the glycomimetics, through activation of Akt/eNOS signaling. Furthermore, C1-C4 significantly inhibited palmitate-induced reactive  species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation, and activity and expression of NADPH oxidase. These effects were attributed to activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway and downstream activation of cellular antioxidant and cytoprotective proteins. In ex vivo vascular reactivity studies, the glycomimetics (C1-C4) also demonstrated a significant improvement in endothelium-dependent relaxation and decreased ROS production and NADPH oxidase activity in isolated mouse thoracic aortic rings exposed to palmitate.The small molecule glycomimetics, C1-C4, protect against lipid-induced endothelial dysfunction through up-regulation of Akt/eNOS and Nrf2/ARE signaling pathways. Thus, carbohydrate-derived therapeutics are a new class of glycomimetic drugs targeting endothelial dysfunction, regarded as the first line of defense against vascular complications in cardiovascular disease.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Reduction of intracellular oxidative stress may attenuate these pathogenic processes. The dietary polyphenol resveratrol reportedly exerts potential protective effects against endothelial injury. This study determined whether resveratrol can reduce the  (PA)-induced generation of reactive  species (ROS) and further explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that resveratrol significantly reduced the PA-induced endothelial ROS levels in human aortic endothelial cells. Resveratrol also induced endothelial cell autophagy, which mediated the effect of resveratrol on ROS reduction. Resveratrol stimulated autophagy via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mTOR pathway.

To address this, 19 older males (≥60 years) were randomized to a RET (n = 11) or to a waitlist control group (n = 8) that remained sedentary for 12 weeks. RET was comprised of three upper body and four lower body movements on resistance machines. One set of 8-12 repetitions to failure of each movement was performed on three nonconsecutive days/week. Improvements in chest press and leg press strength were assessed using a three-repetition maximum (3 RM). Body composition was assessed via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle at baseline and at both 3 weeks and 12 weeks. Palmitate and pyruvate oxidation rates were measured from the (14)CO2 produced from [1-(14)C]  and [U-(14)C] pyruvate, respectively, during incubation of muscle homogenates. PGC-1α, TFAM, and PPARδ levels were quantified using qRT-PCR Citrate synthase (CS) and β-HAD activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Mitochondrial production of reactive  species (ROS) were assessed using the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase assay. There were no significant changes in body weight or body composition following the intervention. Chest press and leg press strength (3RM) increased ~34% (both P < 0.01) with RET There were no significant changes in pyruvate or fatty  oxidation or in the expression of target genes with the intervention. There was a modest increase (P < 0.05) in βHAD activity with RET at 12 weeks but the change in CS enzyme activity was not significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in ROS production in either group following RET Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that 12 weeks of low volume RET does not increase skeletal muscle oxidative capacity or reduce ROS production in older adults.© 2016 The Authors.

As such, 4-HPR has garnered considerable interest as a chemotherapeutic. Cancer cells, however, via various metabolic routes, inactivate ceramide, and this can limit 4-HPR efficacy. As relatively little is known regarding 4-HPR-induced ceramide management in acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML), we undertook the present study to evaluate the impact of 4-HPR on ceramide production, metabolism, and cytotoxicity. In KG-1, HL-60, and HL-60/VCR (multidrug resistant) human leukemia cells, 4-HPR induced 15-, 2-, and 20-fold increases in ceramide (measured using [3H]), respectively. By use of specific inhibitors we show that ceramide was produced by sphingomyelinase and de novo pathways in response to 4-HPR exposure. HL-60/VCR cells metabolized ceramide to glucosylceramide (GC). 4-HPR exposure (1.25-10 μM) reduced viability in all cell lines, with approximate IC50's ranging from 1 to 8.0 μM. Reactive  species (ROS) were generated in response to 4-HPR treatment, and the concomitant cytotoxicity was reversed by addition of vitamin E. 4-HPR was not cytotoxic nor did it elicit ceramide formation in K562, a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line; however, K562 cells were sensitive to a cell-deliverable form of ceramide, C6-ceramide. Treatment of Molt-3, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, with 4-HPR revealed moderate ceramide production (5-fold over control), robust conversion of ceramide to GC and sphingomyelin, and resistance to 4-HPR and C6-ceramide. In conclusion, this work demonstrates diversity within and among leukemia in 4-HPR sensitivity and ceramide generation and subsequent metabolism. As such, knowledge of these metabolic pathways can provide guidance for enhancing ceramide-driven effects of 4-HPR in treatment of leukemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the effect of formulation variables (critical parameters) on the responses (critical quality attributes) of SLN, a 3-factor, 3-level Box-Behnken design, was explored to predict the responses such as particle size (Y1) and % entrapment efficiency (EE) (Y2) when concentration of surfactant (X1), amount of lipid (X2), and volume of solvent (X3) were selected as independent variables.

The present study was conducted to examine the effect of homoplantaginin, a main flavonoid from a traditional Chinese medicine Salvia plebeia R. Br., on PA-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells inflammation and the underlying molecular mechanism. Firstly, we found that homoplantaginin (0.1, 1, 10 μM) dose-dependently reduced expression of toll-like receptor-4 evoked by PA (100 μM). The inhibitory effect of homoplantaginin was further confirmed under lipopolysaccharide challenge. In addition, downstream adapted proteins including myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, toll/interleukin-1 receptor-domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β and tumor necrosis factors receptor associated factor-6 were successfully inhibited by homoplantaginin under PA treatment. Also, we found that homoplantaginin tightly controlled PA-induced reactive  species to prevent nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation by suppressing reactive  species-sensitive thioredoxin-interacting protein, NLRP3, and caspase-1. Meanwhile, protein and mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators (interleukin-1β, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) were decreased by homoplantaginin. Furthermore, homoplantaginin restored PA-impaired nitric oxide generation. Taken together, these results indicated that homoplantaginin protected endothelial cells from ameliorating PA-induced endothelial inflammation via suppressing toll-like receptor-4 and NLRP3 pathways, and restoring nitric oxide generation, suggesting it may be a potential candidate for further development in the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30585412>Pex11a deficiency causes dyslipidaemia and obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes play a central role in lipid metabolism.

The role of Pex11a in dyslipidaemia and obesity is investigated here with Pex11a knockout mice (Pex11a ). Metabolic phenotypes including tissue weight, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol levels, fatty  profile,  consumption, physical activity were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Pex11a fed with a high-fat diet. Molecular changes and peroxisome abundance in adipose tissue were evaluated through qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence. Pex11a showed increased fat mass, decreased skeletal muscle, higher cholesterol levels, and more severely impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Pex11a consumed less , indicating a decrease in fatty  oxidation, which is consistent with the accumulation of very long- and long-chain fatty acids. Adipose  (C16:0) levels were elevated in Pex11a , which may be because of dramatically increased fatty  synthase mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, Pex11a deficiency increased ventricle size and macrophage infiltration, which are related to the reduced physical activity.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis B, but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high-fat-diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in  (PA) induced L02 human liver cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic inflammation, lipid peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced lipid accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca]. By computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays, Mat was shown to influence [Ca] via direct inhibition of SERCA.The results showed that the bi-directional regulation of Mat to endoplasmic reticulum at different doses was based on the inhibition of SERCA.

Increasing evidence suggests that mitophagy, a process of autophagic turnover of damaged mitochondria, maintains mitochondrial integrity. PINK1 (phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1) and Parkin signaling is a key pathway in mitophagy control. In this study, we examined whether this pathway could protect mitochondria under metabolic stress. We found that  (PA) induced significant mitophagy and activated PINK1 and Parkin in endothelial cells. Knocking down PINK1 or Parkin reduced mitophagy, leading to impaired clearance of damaged mitochondria and intracellular accumulation of mitochondrial fragments. Furthermore, PINK1 and Parkin prevented PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production and apoptosis. Finally, we show that PINK1 and Parkin were up-regulated in vascular wall of obese mice and diabetic mice.

Our results showed that  (PA, 100 μM) increased the amplitudes of sarcomere shortening and intracellular ATP in sham but not in HTN despite  consumption rate (OCR) was increased by PA in both groups. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 inhibitor, etomoxir (ETO), reduced OCR and ATP with PA in sham and HTN but prevented PA potentiation of sarcomere shortening only in sham. PA increased nNOS-derived NO only in HTN. Inhibition of nNOS with S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (SMTC) prevented PA-induced OCR and restored PA potentiation of myocyte contraction in HTN. Mechanistically, PA increased intracellular Ca transient ([Ca]) without changing Ca influx via L-type Ca channel (I-) and reduced myofilament Ca sensitivity in sham. nNOS inhibition increased [Ca], I- and reduced myofilament Ca sensitivity prior to PA supplementation; as such, normalized PA increment of [Ca]. In HTN, PA reduced I- without affecting [Ca] or myofilament Ca sensitivity. However, PA increased I-, [Ca] and reduced myofilament Ca sensitivity following nNOS inhibition. Myocardial FA oxidation (F-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic , F-FTHA) was comparable between groups, but nNOS inhibition increased it only in HTN. Collectively, PA increases myocyte contraction through stimulating [Ca] and mitochondrial activity in healthy hearts.

One such influence is exemplified by the Crabtree effect (the glucose-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial respiration) as most  experiments are performed in glucose-containing media. Here, using high-resolution respirometry, we evaluated the oxidation of endogenous or exogenous substrates by cell lines harboring different metabolic profiles. We found that a 1-h deprivation of the main energetic nutrients is an appropriate strategy to abolish interference of endogenous or undesirable exogenous substrates with the cellular capacity of oxidizing specific substrates, namely glutamine, pyruvate, glucose, or palmitate, in mitochondria. This approach primed mitochondria to immediately increase their  consumption after the addition of the exogenous nutrients. All starved cells could oxidize exogenous glutamine, whereas the capacity for oxidizing palmitate was limited to human hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells and to C2C12 mouse myoblasts that differentiated into myotubes. In the presence of exogenous glucose, starvation decreased the Crabtree effect in Huh7 and C2C12 cells and abrogated it in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells. Interestingly, the fact that the Crabtree effect was observed only for mitochondrial basal respiration but not for the maximum respiratory capacity suggests it is not caused by a direct effect on the electron transport system.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168914>Attenuation of -Induced Lipotoxicity by Chlorogenic  through Activation of SIRT1 in Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) induce hepatocyte lipotoxicity, wherein oxidative stress-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is mechanistically involved. Chlorogenic  (CGA), a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound, protects against high-fat-diet-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in liver. This study investigates whether CGA protects against FFA-induced hepatocyte lipotoxicity via the regulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion and elucidates its underlying mechanisms.AML12 cell, a non-transformed hepatocyte cell line, is treated with palmitate. Here, it is shown that CGA prevents palmitate-induced lipotoxicity by activation of SIRT1 regulated mitochondrial morphology. CGA treatment mitigates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by a decrease in reactive  species (ROS) production, and an increase in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential. CGA also significantly decreases Bax expression and thereby reduces mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, CGA attenuates ROS-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by inhibiting dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and enhancing Mfn2 expression. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of CGA on the generation of mitochondrial ROS and Drp1 are blocked by siRNA knockdown of SIRT1.Collectively, these findings show that supplementation with CGA protects hepatocytes from FFA-induced lipotoxicity through activation of SIRT1, which reverses the oxidative stress and dysfunction of mitochondrial biogenesis directly.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

During a 63-day period, two homogeneous groups of eight lactating Brown cows were allocated to either housing (H) in a free-stall building for 24 h/day. Feeding was based on a total mixed ration or grazing (G) on barley grass for 5 h/day, and housing in a free-stall structure with feeding was based on the same total mixed ration offered to the H group. With regard to behaviour, H cows spent more time idling, walking, drinking, and self-grooming, whereas G cows showed a greater intent to eat and interact socially. Moreover, G cows exhibited slightly higher reactive  metabolites and similar biological antioxidant potential concentrations than the H group, which indicates that short grazing resulted in an almost negligible increase in oxidative stress and an unchanged antioxidant capacity. Skin tests, performed by injecting phytohemoagglutinin intradermally, indicated that G cows had thicker skin than H cows at the end of the trial, an index of a better cell-mediated immune response. Grazing did not affect milk yield but improved milk quality in terms of an increase in fat and a reduction in urea content, somatic cell count, and total microbial count. Milk from G cows was richer in saturated fatty acids, likely because of the contribution of  present in the grazed barley grass, and also showed higher contents of some healthy fatty acids, such as rumenic  and α-linolenic , and a lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio.

Although disruption of inter-organellar crosstalk via the MAM impairs cellular homeostasis, its pathological significance in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unclear. Here, we reveal the importance of reduced MAM formation in the induction of fatty -evoked insulin resistance in hepatocytes.  (PA) repressed insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in HepG2 cells within 12h. Treatment with an inhibitor of the ER stress response failed to restore PA-mediated suppression of Akt activation. Mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production did not increase in PA-treated cells. Even short-term exposure (3h) to PA reduced the calcium flux from ER to mitochondria, followed by a significant decrease in MAM contact area, suggesting that PA suppressed the functional interaction between ER and mitochondria. Forced expression of mitofusin-2, a critical component of the MAM, partially restored MAM contact area and ameliorated the PA-elicited suppression of insulin sensitivity with Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt selectively improved. These results suggest that loss of proximity between ER and mitochondria, but not perturbation of homeostasis in the two organelles individually, plays crucial roles in PA-evoked Akt inactivation in hepatic insulin resistance.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the lipid fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and oleic  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive  species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These findings are useful for understanding F-- and other fatty -induced NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for regulating diseases involving NET formation.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178133>Ablation of TMEM126B protects against heart injury via improving mitochondrial function in high fat diet (HFD)-induced mice.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of myocardial damage associated with high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity remains largely unknown. Transmembrane protein 126B (TMEM126B), as a complex I assembly factor, plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial function. In the present study, the effects of TMEM126B on mitochondrial function were investigated using genetic knockout approach in HFD-induced mouse models with obesity. We found that TMEM126B was significantly increased in HFD-treated cardiac samples. Genetic ablation of TMEM126B alleviated HFD-mediated metabolic disorder and heart injury. TEM results suggested that cardiac mitochondrial integrity was improved in TMEM126B knockout mice compared with the wild type (WT) mice after HFD challenge. Additionally, the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by HFD was alleviated in mice with TMEM126B knockout, as evidenced by the decreased protein expression levels of dynamic-related protein-1 (DRP1) and fission-1 (FIS1) and increased expression of mitofusin-1 (MFN1). The mitochondrial impairments were further confirmed in  (PA)-incubated cardiomyocytes, as evidenced by the down-regulated membrane potential and ATP levels, and by the up-regulated mitochondrial reactive  species (ROS) production and DNA damage, which were significantly reversed by TMEM126B knockdown in vitro. Finally, TMEM126B ablation suppressed mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic death in the hearts of HFD mice. Therefore, TMEM126B led to mitochondrial impairments, contributing to the pathogenesis of HFD-induced cardiac injury, and blockage of TMEM126B could inhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, paving the road to new therapeutic modalities for the prevention of obesity-associated heart injury.Copyright © 2019.

To date, little is known about whether fatty acids can affect HO-1 induction. Here, we report the induction of HO-1 by docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and the associated molecular mechanisms in human myelomonocytic lymphoma U937 cells. When U937 cells were treated with DHA, eicosapentaenoic ,  or oleic , DHA was the most effective inducer of HO-1. The activation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β did not significantly change after DHA treatment. However, DHA increased the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), but not of other mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p38 and JNK. The increase in HO-1 expression was significantly inhibited by U0126, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. Nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) and its binding to the HO-1 promoter significantly increased upon DHA treatment. An increase in intracellular reactive  species was detected by dichlorofluorescein diacetate, but not by hydroethidium or 2-[6-(4-hydroxy)phenoxy-3H-xanthen-3-on-9-yl] benzoic  after DHA treatment. Pretreatment with NAC dramatically inhibited the ERK1/2 activation, binding of Nrf-2 to antioxidant response elements (AREs) located in the HO-1 promoter and the induction of HO-1 by DHA. In conclusion, DHA increased HO-1 expression in U937 cells via activation of ERK1/2 and increased Nrf-2 binding to ARE in the HO-1 promoter. These findings will help develop better strategies for treating inflammatory disorders with DHA.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Withaferin A (WA), possesses both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and therefore would be a good strategy to suppress  (PA)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation and hence, insulin resistance and dysfunction in the endothelium. Effect of WA on PA-induced insulin resistance in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was determined by evaluating insulin signaling mechanisms whilst effect of this drug on PA-induced endothelial dysfunction was determined in acetylcholine-mediated relaxation in isolated rat aortic preparations. WA significantly inhibited ROS production and inflammation induced by PA. Furthermore, WA significantly decreased TNF-α and IL-6 production in endothelial cells by specifically suppressing IKKβ/NF-κβ phosphorylation. WA inhibited inflammation-stimulated IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and improved the impaired insulin PI3-K signaling, and restored the decreased nitric oxide (NO) production triggered by PA. WA also decreased endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 levels, and restored the impaired endothelium-mediated vasodilation in isolated aortic preparations. These findings suggest that WA inhibited both ROS production and inflammation to restore impaired insulin resistance in cultured endothelial cells and improve endothelial dysfunction in rat aortic rings.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922681>Exercise Training Protects Cardiomyocytes from Deleterious Effects of Palmitate.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of palmitate, a high saturated fat, on Ca, action potential and reactive  species dynamics in cardiomyocytes from untrained and trained mice. Male mice were subjected to moderate intensity exercise training on a treadmill. Cardiomyocytes of untrained and trained mice were isolated, treated for 30 min with palmitate and intracellular calcium transient and action potential duration were recorded. Additionally, we assessed reactive  species generation. Treatment of cardiomyocytes from untrained mice with palmitate induced a significant decrease in Ca transient magnitude by 34%. Exercise training did not change cardiomyocyte Ca dynamics in the control group. However, trained cardiomyocytes were protected from deleterious effects of palmitate. Action potential duration was not altered by palmitate in either untrained or trained cardiomyocytes. Moreover, palmitate treatment increased reactive  species generation in both untrained and trained cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, the levels of reactive  species in trained cardiomyocytes treated with palmitate were still 27% lower than those seen at basal conditions in untrained cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings indicate that exercise training protects cardiomyocytes from deleterious effects of palmitate possibly by inhibiting exacerbated ROS production.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28386901>Effect of salinity stress on growth, lipid productivity, fatty  composition, and biodiesel properties in Acutodesmus obliquus and Chlorella vulgaris.</a></h2><p>Two microalgae strains including Chlorella vulgaris and Acutodesmus obliquus were grown on BG11 medium with salinity stress ranging from 0.06 to 0.4 M NaCl.

The microalgal strains C. vulgaris and A. obliquus grow better at 0.06 M NaCl concentration than control condition. At 0.06 M NaCl, improved dry biomass content in C. vulgaris and A. obliquus was 0.92 and 0.68 gL, respectively.

Among them, miR-33a is supposed to modulate the cholesterol export and fatty  oxidation, but whether miR-33a involves in the process of fatty liver disease is unclear. To disclose the hypothesis, we utilized miR-33a mimic and antisense to explore their effects in primary hepatocytes or high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Treatment with  (PA) or HFD significantly increased the expression of miR-33a in hepatocytes or liver tissues. In primary hepatocytes, miR-33a mimic decreased mitochondrial function, including reduction of ATP production and  consumption, whereas miR-33a inhibition protected PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, miR-33a selectively suppressed mitochondrial complex I activity and protein expression, but not other complexes. Through bioinformatics prediction, we found miR-33a directly targeted on the 3'-UTR of NDUFA5. Dual-luciferase reporter analysis further confirmed the direct suppression of miR-33a on NDUFA5 expression. More importantly, administration of miR-33a antisense could effectively restore HFD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction through up-regulation of NDUFA5 levels. Mice treated with miR-33a antisense also exhibited improved liver function and structural disorders under obese status. Taken together, miR-33a was an important mediator of hepatocyte mitochondrial function, and the therapeutic benefits implied miR-33a antisense had the potential clinical application in combating the fatty liver disease.© 2018 The Authors.

Herein, we analyze the consequences of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)/metabolism disorder associated with the cell-specific hematopoietic ablation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). AIF-null (AIF ) mice developed pancytopenia that was associated with hypocellular bone marrow (BM) and thymus atrophy. Although myeloid cells were relatively spared, the B-cell and erythroid lineages were altered with increased frequencies of precursor B cells, pro-erythroblasts I, and basophilic erythroblasts II. T-cell populations were dramatically reduced with a thymopoiesis blockade at a double negative (DN) immature state, with DN1 accumulation and delayed DN2/DN3 and DN3/DN4 transitions. In BM cells, the OXPHOS/metabolism dysfunction provoked by the loss of AIF was counterbalanced by the augmentation of the mitochondrial biogenesis and a shift towards anaerobic glycolysis. Nevertheless, in a caspase-independent process, the resulting excess of reactive  species compromised the viability of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitors. This led to the progressive exhaustion of the HSC pool, a reduced capacity of the BM progenitors to differentiate into colonies in methylcellulose assays, and the absence of cell-autonomous HSC repopulating potential in vivo. In contrast to BM cells, AIF thymocytes compensated for the OXPHOS breakdown by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation. By over-expressing CPT1, ACADL and PDK4, three key enzymes facilitating fatty  β-oxidation (e.g.,  assimilation), the AIF thymocytes retrieved the ATP levels of the AIF  cells. As a consequence, it was possible to significantly reestablish AIF thymopoiesis in vivo by feeding the animals with a high-fat diet complemented with an antioxidant. Overall, our data reveal that the mitochondrial signals regulated by AIF are critical to hematopoietic decision-making. Emerging as a link between mitochondrial metabolism and hematopoietic cell fate, AIF-mediated OXPHOS regulation represents a target for the development of new immunomodulatory therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29310441>Dihydromyricetin Ameliorates Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease by Improving Mitochondrial Respiratory Capacity and Redox Homeostasis Through Modulation of SIRT3 Signaling.</a></h2><p> Our previous clinical trial indicated that the flavonoid dihydromyricetin (DHM) could improve hepatic steatosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), altough the potential mechanisms of these effects remained elusive. Here, we investigated the hepatoprotective role of DHM on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD.  DHM supplementation could effectively ameliorate the development of NAFLD by inhibiting hepatic lipid accumulation both in HFD-fed wild-type mice and in -induced hepatocytes. We reveal for the first time that mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by ATP depletion and augmented oxidative stress could be reversed by DHM treatment. Moreover, DHM enhanced the mitochondrial respiratory capacity by increasing the expression and enzymatic activities of mitochondrial complexes and increased mitochondrial reactive  species scavenging by restoring manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) activity. Interestingly, the benefits of DHM were abrogated in  knockout (SIRT3KO) mice and in hepatocytes transfected with  siRNA or treated with an SIRT3-specific inhibitor. We further showed that DHM could increase SIRT3 expression by activating the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1α)/estrogen-related receptor-α (ERRα) signaling pathway.  Our work indicates that SIRT3 plays a critical role in the DHM-mediated beneficial effects that include ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in a nutritional NAFLD model both  and   Our results suggest that DHM prevents NAFLD by improving mitochondrial respiratory capacity and redox homeostasis in hepatocytes through a SIRT3-dependent mechanism.

Many current and potential products of this yeast require acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a precursor and pathways towards these products are generally expressed in its cytosol. The native S. cerevisiae pathway for production of cytosolic acetyl-CoA consumes 2 ATP equivalents in the acetyl-CoA synthetase reaction. Catabolism of additional sugar substrate, which may be required to generate this ATP, negatively affects product yields. Here, we review alternative pathways that can be engineered into yeast to optimize supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA as a precursor for product formation. Particular attention is paid to reaction stoichiometry, free-energy conservation and redox-cofactor balancing of alternative pathways for acetyl-CoA synthesis from glucose. A theoretical analysis of maximally attainable yields on glucose of four compounds (n-butanol, citric ,  and farnesene) showed a strong product dependency of the optimal pathway configuration for acetyl-CoA synthesis. Moreover, this analysis showed that combination of different acetyl-CoA production pathways may be required to achieve optimal product yields. This review underlines that an integral analysis of energy coupling and redox-cofactor balancing in precursor-supply and product-formation pathways is crucial for the design of efficient cell factories.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

To clarify the source of ROS, we examined the expression of superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase isoforms in the liver of high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet-fed mice. The mRNA expression of NOX1 was significantly elevated in mice on HFC diet for 8 weeks. Increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly ameliorated in mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1-KO). Increased nitrotyrosine adduct formation, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury, was observed in hepatic sinusoids of WT, which was significantly suppressed in NOX1-KO. NOX1 mRNA was mainly expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and it was significantly up-regulated in primary cultured LSECs treated with  (PA). The production of nitric oxide by LSECs and LSECs-dependent relaxation of hepatic stellate cells were significantly attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, these effects of PA were not observed in cells isolated from Nox1-KO.

The hypothesis that metabolites of blueberry anthocyanins attenuate lipotoxicity-induced endothelial dysfunction was tested.Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were treated for 6 h with either: (i) the parent anthocyanins (malvidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside); or (ii) the blueberry metabolites (hydroxyhippuric , hippuric , benzoic -4-sulfate, isovanillic -3-sulfate, and vanillic -4-sulfate), at concentrations known to circulate in humans following blueberry consumption. For the last 5 h HAECs were treated with palmitate or vehicle. HAECs treated with palmitate displayed elevated reactive  species generation, increased mRNA expression of NOX4, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and IκBα, exaggerated monocyte binding, and suppressed nitric oxide production. Of note, the damaging effects of palmitate were ameliorated in HAECs treated with blueberry metabolites but not parent anthocyanins. Further, important translational relevance of these results was provided by our observation that palmitate-induced endothelial dysfunction was lessened in arterial segments that incubated concurrently with blueberry metabolites.The presented findings indicate that the vascular benefits of blueberry anthocyanins are mediated by their metabolites.

Studies have shown that knockdown of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) causes oxidative stress and mitophagy. In db/db mice, PINK1 protein level is down-regulated. However, little is known regarding the mechanism by which PINK1 modulates IR in response to reactive  species (ROS) induced stress. In our study, PINK1 expression decreased during palmitate (PA) induced IR in HepG2 cells and the hepatic tissues of high fat diet (HFD) fed mice. Additionally, free fatty acids (FFAs) could increase ROS and suppress insulin signaling pathway, which was indicated by reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). In addition, insulin induced glucose uptake decreased and the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), two key gluconeogenic enzymes, was up-regulated after PA treatment. Intriguingly, PINK1 overexpression could lead to opposite results. Moreover, PA induced hepatic IR through C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, which were rescued by PINK1 overexpression.

High fat diet (HFD)-fed ApoE mice were randomized into control, metformin, liraglutide, and combination treatment groups. Results showed that in PA-treated HUVECs and HFD-fed ApoE mice, combination of metformin and liraglutide at lower dose significantly improved endothelial dysfunction compared with the single treatment. Metformin upregulated GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) level and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation.

To explore the entry mechanisms of the lipid ligands into myoglobin, we conducted molecular dynamic simulations of murine Oxy- and Deoxy-Mb structures with palmitate or palmitoylcarnitine starting at different positions near the protein surface. The simulations indicated that both ligands readily (under ∼10-20 ns) enter the Oxy-Mb structure through a dynamic area ("portal region") near heme, known to be the entry point for small molecule gaseous ligands like O, CO and NO. The entry is not observed with Deoxy-Mb where lipid ligands move away from protein surface, due to a compaction of the entry portal and the heme-containing crevice in the Mb protein upon O removal.

Extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)/nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a ROS response pathway. Therefore, high ROS is always accompanied by increase of HO-1, an anti-oxidative enzyme; but it remains unknown why there is no significant reduction of ROS with the increase of HO-1 in SFAs-treated neurons. We hypothesized that the up-regulation of HO-1 is compensatory for response to fatty -induced oxidative stress but not enough to reduce ROS levels. We evaluated the anti-ROS effect of HO-1 and the involved pathway in  (PA)-treated human neuroblastoma BE(2)-M17 cells. As expected, PA-induced ROS increase was accompanied by activation of the ERK-Nrf2-HO-1 pathway, as demonstrated by an increase in ERK phosphorylation, Nrf2 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation, and HO-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels, in a PA-dose-dependent manner. In contrast, administration of the ROS scavenger NAC significantly reduced the levels of PA-regulated ROS and HO-1 protein. However, the ERK inhibitor U0126 not only reversed the activating effect of PA on the ERK-Nrf2-HO-1 pathway but also aggravated PA-induced ROS. Furthermore, the Nrf2-specific activator NK-252 significantly increased PA-up-regulated HO-1 protein and alleviated PA-induced ROS. Therefore, our results suggest that up-regulation of HO-1 in PA-treated neurons is a compensatory response to ROS increase and that increasing HO-1 expression by Nrf2 activation can prevent the process of ROS production in PA-treated neurons.Copyright © 2018.

HBOT increased plasma levels of individual FAs:  (p<0.05), palmitoleic  (p<0.05), docosapentaenoic  (p<0.05) and docosahexaenoic  (p<0.01), and decreased levels of stearic  (p<0.05), alpha linolenic  (p<0.05) and linoleic  (p<0.01). Expression of IGFBP-1 (p<0.01) was increased, whereas the level of insulin (p<0.001) was decreased in the serum after HBOT.Our results indicate that HBOT exerts beneficial effects in IDDM patients by improving the lipid profile and altering FA composition.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Free fatty acids (FFAs)-associated lipotoxicity contributes to injury of proximal renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells in diabetes.  (PA) which is the most abundant saturated fatty  in FFAs is closely associated with the gradual decline of renal function. Astragalosides IV (AS-IV) has a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. In the current study, we investigated the effects of AS-IV on PA-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells and the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that AS-IV (10, 20, 40 μmol/L) could alleviate PA-induced apoptosis of HK-2 cells. We found that AS-IV reduced the expression of Bax and cleaved-caspase3, but increased the expression of Bcl-2 and phosphorylated Nrf2 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, AS-IV reduced the level of reactive  species (ROS) in the cells. Our study suggests that AS-IV could protect against PA-induced apoptosis in HK-2 cells by inhibiting ROS generation and apoptotic protein expression. This study may provide a new theoretical option for the patients with type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018.

These nutritious seeds also have been used in popular medicine to treat several diseases. Nevertheless, the nutritional and functional potential of monguba seed is still underexploited. In this sense, we investigated the nutritional and functional components of monguba seeds. These seeds showed high total content of sugars, mainly sucrose, whereas the content of the raffinose family oligosaccharides was low. The mineral assay showed high amount of minerals, namely potassium, calcium, magnesium and zinc, which indicate that monguba seeds can be a new source of these minerals. UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed caffeic, ferulic and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids as the main phenolic compounds, mainly in the esterified form, in these seeds. Monguba seed showed high lipid content, in which the main compounds were  and γ-tocopherol. The soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions from monguba seeds showed high antioxidant activity measured by the  radical absorption capacity (ORAC) and the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays. Therefore, the monguba seeds have great potential to be explored by food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries due to their chemical composition.Copyright © 2019.

To address this, the deep photochemical processes were evaluated by Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry coupled with a discrimination of its leaf fatty  profile. Plants exposed to 125-250 mm NaCl showed higher photochemical light harvesting efficiencies and lower energy dissipation rates. under higher NaCl exposure, there is evident damage of the  evolving complexes (OECs). On the other hand, Reaction Centre (RC) closure net rate and density increased, improving the energy fluxes entering the PS II, in spite of the high amounts of energy dissipated and the loss of PS II antennae connectivity. Energy dissipation was mainly achieved through the auroxanthin pathway. Total fatty  content displayed a similar trend, being also higher under 125-250 mm NaCl with high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The increase in oleic  and  allows the maintenance of the good functioning of the PS II. Also relevant was the high concentration of chloroplastic C16:1t in the individuals subjected to 125-250 mm NaCl, related with a higher electron transport activity and with the organization of the Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC) and thus reducing the activation of energy dissipation mechanisms.

HepG2 cells were treated with free fatty  (FFA) mixture (oleic : , 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro fatty liver. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce fatty liver in vivo. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and fatty  transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and fatty  synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW.

Using stable isotopomer MS analysis in a mouse model with a myeloid cell-specific  deletion, we show here that this deletion increases the proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Incubation of LPS-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with [U-C]glucose revealed reduced C labeling of citrate and malate and increased C labeling of lactate in Pck1-deleted bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also found that the Pck1 deletion in the myeloid cells increases reactive  species (ROS).

In the present study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on palmitate-induced inflammation and elucidated the underlying mechanisms in skeletal muscle cells. The results showed that palmitate significantly enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression and protein secretion from C2C12 cells at 12, 24, and 36 h treatments. Increased expression of cytokines was accompanied by an enhanced phosphorylation of JNK, P38, ERK1/2, and IKKα/IKKβ. In addition, JNK and P38 inhibitors could significantly attenuate palmitate-induced mRNA expression of TNF-α and IL-6, respectively, whereas NF-κB inhibitor reduced the expression of both cytokines in palmitate-treated cells. Resveratrol pretreatment significantly prevented palmitate-induced TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression and protein secretion in C2C12 cells. Importantly, pre-treatment of the cells with resveratrol completely abrogated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and IKKα/IKKβ in palmitate treated cells. The protection from palmitate-induced inflammation by resveratrol was accompanied by a decrease in the generation of reactive  species (ROS). N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a known scavenger of ROS, could protect palmitate-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-6. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by shRNA or sirtinol demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effect of resveratrol in muscle cells is mediated through a SIRT1-independent mechanism. Taken together, these findings suggest that resveratrol may represent a promising therapy for prevention of inflammation in skeletal muscle cells. J. Cell.

Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a natural flavonoid, was reported to exert anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. However, the effect of DHM on atherosclerosis-related pyroptosis has not been studied. In the present study,  (PA) treatment led to pyroptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), as evidenced by caspase-1 activation, LDH release, and propidium iodide-positive staining; enhanced the maturation and release of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and markedly increased intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) levels. Moreover, NLRP3 siRNA transfection or treatment with inhibitors efficiently suppressed PA-induced pyroptosis, and pretreatment with total ROS scavenger or mtROS scavenger attenuated PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis. However, DHM pretreatment inhibited PA-induced pyroptotic cell death by increasing cell viability, decreasing LDH and IL-1β release, improving cell membrane integrity, and abolishing caspase-1 cleavage and subsequent IL-1β maturation. We also found that DHM pre-treatment remarkably reduced the levels of intracellular ROS and mtROS and activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA abrogated the inhibitory effects of DHM on ROS generation and subsequent PA-induced pyroptosis. Together, these results indicate that the Nrf2 signaling pathway plays a role, as least in part, in the DHM-mediated improvement in PA-induced pyroptosis in vascular endothelial cells, which implies the underlying medicinal value of DHM targeting immune/inflammatory-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis.© 2017 BioFactors, 44(2):123-136, 2018.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30372936>The use of stable isotope ratio analysis to characterise saw palmetto (Serenoa Repens) extract.</a></h2><p>Saw palmetto extract (SPE) has many pharmacological effects.

In this study, PC-functionalized selenium nanoparticles (PC-SeNPs) were synthesized to investigate the in vitro protective effects on INS-1E rat insulinoma β cells against PA-induced cell death. A potent protective effect was achieved by regulation of particle size and PC content. Among three PC-SeNPs (165, 235, and 371 nm), PC-SeNPs-235 nm showed the highest cellular uptake and the best protective activities. For cell cycle analysis, PC-SeNPs showed a better protective effect on PA-induced INS-1E cell apoptosis than PC or SeNPs, and PC-SeNPs-235 nm exhibited the best effect. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that PA induced overproduction of intracellular ROS, mitochondria fragmentation, activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and cleavage of PARP. However, pretreatment of the cells with PC-SeNPs effectively blocked these intracellular events, which suggests that PC-SeNPs could protect INS-1E cells against PA-induced cell apoptosis via attenuating oxidative stress and downstream signaling pathways.

The protein levels of NOX4 and cleaved-caspase3 were detected using Western blot assay. O/P significantly decreased cell viability at 10, 100, 500 μM, and 5 mM in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the cell viability was reduced by 500 μM O/P mixture at 6, 24, and 48 h in a time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with 500 μM O/P significantly enhanced ROS production and cell apoptosis in chondrocytes. Furthermore, treatment with O/P mixture significantly enhanced the expression of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in a dose- and time- dependent manner. More importantly, inhibition of NOX4 could partially eliminate O/P-induced chondrocytes apoptosis by reducing ROS production. To conclude, O/P treatment enhances ROS production and cell apoptosis mainly by upregulating the protein levels of NOX4 and caspase3 activation in chondrocytes, indicating a potential therapeutic target of OA in obesity patients.© 2016 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408938>Resveratrol Maintains Lipid Metabolism Homeostasis via One of the Mechanisms Associated with the Key Circadian Regulator Bmal1.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol (RES) possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, and it can prevent liver lipid metabolism disorders in obese and diabetic individuals. This study elucidated the mechanisms of brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (Bmal1) in the protective effects of RES against liver lipid metabolism disorders. The results indicated that RES ameliorated free fatty  (FFA)-induced (oleic  (OA):  (PA) = 2:1) glycolipid metabolic disorders in hepatocytes. Simultaneously, RES partially reverted the relatively shallow daily oscillations of FFA-induced circadian clock gene transcription and protein expression in HepG2 cells. RES also attenuated FFA-triggered reactive  species (ROS) secretion and restored mitochondrial membrane potential consumption, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. This study provides compelling evidence that RES controls intracellular lipid metabolic imbalance in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, RES may serve as a promising natural nutraceutical for the regulation of lipid metabolic disorders relevant to the circadian clock.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27991906>Hepatic stimulator substance inhibits calcium overflow through the mitochondria-associated membrane compartment during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a disorder of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Recent studies have shown that the ER and mitochondrial membranes overlap by 15-20%, a region referred to as the 'mitochondria-associated ER membrane' (MAM). Some proteins, including sarco/ER calcium ATPase (SERCA), are located in the MAM and have an important role in Ca signaling and homeostasis between the ER and the mitochondria. Our previous study showed that hepatic stimulator substance (HSS) inhibits the ER stress induced by reactive  species, thus reducing mitochondrial damage. However, the mechanism underlying the protective effect of HSS on the ER and ER-mitochondrial interaction remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that the exogenous expression of HSS protected the liver from steatosis in mice with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. More importantly, the protection provided by HSS allowed SERCA in the MAM compartment to function well, preventing the extensive influx of cytosolic free Ca to the mitochondria, thus preserving the mitochondrial functions from calcium overload and relieving -induced hepatocyte steatosis. Our results suggest that the protective effect of HSS on SERCA expression is associated with the maintenance of calcium homeostasis within the MAM, thus ameliorating the disordered Ca communication between the ER and mitochondria.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525573>Activation of Nrf2 by Phloretin Attenuates -Induced Endothelial Cell Oxidative Stress via AMPK-Dependent Signaling.</a></h2><p>Phloretin, a dihydrochalcone structural flavonoid compound, possesses antioxidant activity. In this study, we conducted studies to explore the function of phloretin on high -induced oxidative stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and investigated the potential mechanism using ribonucleic  sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our findings reveal that phloretin significantly decreased the levels of intracellular reactive  species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase-1 (Gpx-1) activity, and restored the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Next, whole transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA-Seq The results indicated more than 3000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the DEGs were categorized functionally, mainly by the biological processes, cell metabolism, and cellular response to chemical stimulus. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes indicated that they were mainly enriched in cAMP, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal regulation signaling pathways. Furthermore, on the basis of the results of RNA-Seq and Western blotting, our study verified that phloretin upregulated the expression of p-Nrf2 and HO-1 by promoting the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr through activation of liver kinase B1.

Furthermore, the mechanism of DSG on oxidative stress, lipid consumption and lipid synthesis in LO2 cells was investigated.The results indicated that  induced obvious lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that DSG treatment significantly reduced the intracellular lipid content. DSG treatment upregulated expression of lipolysis proteins, including phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), phospho-acetyl-coA carboxylase (p-ACC) and carnitine acyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), and inhibited expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) and fatty  synthase (FAS). Additionally, DSG-treated cells displayed a marked improvement in mitochondrial function, with less production of reactive  species and a higher mitochondrial membrane potential compared with the model group.This study suggests that DSG can reduce intracellular lipid accumulation in LO2 cells and that the underlying mechanism may be related to the improving oxidative stress, increasing fatty  β-oxidation and decreasing lipid synthesis.

Whether serine supplementation has any beneficial effects on the prevention of NAFLD remains unknown. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of serine supplementation on hepatic oxidative stress and steatosis and its related mechanisms. Forty male C57BL/6J mice (9week-old) were randomly assigned into four groups (n=10) and fed: i) a low-fat diet; ii) a low-fat diet supplemented with 1% (wt:vol) serine; iii) a high-fat (HF) diet; and iv) a HF diet supplemented with 1% serine, respectively.  (PA)-treated primary hepatocytes separated from adult mice were also used to study the effects of serine on oxidative stress. The results showed that serine supplementation increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and protected mice from hepatic lipid accumulation, but did not significantly decreased HF diet-induced weight gain. In addition, serine supplementation protected glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system and prevented hypermethylation in the promoters of glutathione synthesis-related genes, while decreasing reactive  species (ROS) in mice fed a HF diet. Moreover, we found that serine supplementation increased phosphorylation and S-glutathionylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α subunit (AMPKα), and decreased ROS, malondialdehyde and triglyceride contents in PA-treated primary hepatocytes. However, while AMPK activity or GSH synthesis was inhibited, the abovementioned effects of serine on PA-treated primary hepatocytes were not observed. Our results suggest that serine supplementation could prevent HF diet-induced oxidative stress and steatosis by epigenetically modulating the expression of glutathione synthesis-related genes and through AMPK activation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Resveratrol (RSV) exerts beneficial effects against endothelial oxidative injury, while the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we aimed to explore the role of mitochondria dynamics during the anti-oxidative activities of RSV in  (PA)-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to verify whether tyrosyl transfer- RNA synthetase (TyrRS) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) are targeted during this process.HUVECs were exposed to 200 μM of PA for 16 h before treated with 10 μM of RSV for 8 h. Cell viability was detected using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The intracellular ROS level and mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) were measured using microplate reader and flow cytometry. The malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were measured using the microplate reader. The mitochondrial morphology and fusion process was observed under transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. TyrRS and PARP1 were knocked down with the specific small interference RNAs (siRNA), and the protein expressions of TyrRS, PARP1, and mitochondrial fusion proteins (MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1) were measured by western blot.RSV treatment suppressed the PA-induced injuries in HUVECs, including the damage to cell viability, oxidative stress, and loss of MMP. Additionally, RSV improved the protein levels of MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 as well as inhibited the PA-induced fragmentation of mitochondria.

Signal transduction pathways in HTR8/SVneo cells in response to fatty acids were determined by Western blot analyses. Regulation of fatty acids on oxidative conditions in EVTs were determined and validated by measurement of production of cellular reactive  species, intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+and lipid peroxidation assays.In present study, we confirmed different effects of oleic  and elaidic  on migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis of the EVT cell line, HTR8/SVneo. We also investigated stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) to determine if its activity contributed to oleic -induced migration of HTR8/SVneo cells. Next, we analyzed cell signaling molecules mediated by oleic  and elaidic  treatment, including MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways in HTR8/SVneo cells.

Even if previous studies show reproductive toxicity in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the mechanisms of reproductive toxicity by GO are poorly understood. To understand the underlying mechanisms of GO-induced reproductive toxicity, we investigated the interaction between GO and C. elegans using Raman spectroscopy, sperm counts produced by spermatogenesis, progeny and analyzed the fatty  metabolism using molecular techniques. GO-characteristic Raman spectral bands measured throughout C. elegans, brood size and Hoecst staining of dissected gonads clearly showed GO accumulation in the reproductive organs, reduced progeny and low sperm counts, which are possibly direct results of the reproductive toxicity from GO exposure. Interestingly, reduced fatty  metabolites, such as stearic, oleic, palmitoleic, and  acids, were found with GO exposure. We found that GO increased intestinal fat accumulation in wild type N2, fat-5(tm420), and fat-7(wa36) mutants, whereas it decreased fat storage in the fat-6(tm331) and nhr-49(nr2041) mutants. GO exposure affected C. elegans fat accumulation and consumption, which was possibly regulated by daf-16 and nhr-80 gene activity. Also, GO exposure suppressed the survival of long-lived fat-5(tm420) mutants, whereas it increased the survival of short-lived nhr-49(nr2041) mutants. Hence, our studies collectively indicated that GO accumulation in reproductive organs, suppression of spermatogenesis, and the alteration of fatty  metabolism play critical roles in understanding mechanisms of toxicity in C. elegans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent reports indicate that these two pathways act synergistically. Still it remains unclear how they interrelate. Taking into account the key role of mitochondria in insulin secretion, we attempted to dissect the metabolic and FFAR1-mediated effects of fatty acids on mitochondrial function. One-hour culture of MIN6 cells with palmitate significantly enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Antagonism or silencing of FFAR1 prevented the palmitate-induced rise in respiration. On the other hand, in the absence of extracellular palmitate FFAR1 agonists caused a modest increase in respiration. Using an agonist of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and PKC inhibitor we found that in the presence of the fatty  mitochondrial respiration is regulated via Gαq protein-coupled receptor signaling. The increase in respiration in palmitate-treated cells was largely due to increased glucose utilization and oxidation. However, glucose utilization was not dependent on FFAR1 signaling. Collectively, these results indicate that mitochondrial respiration in palmitate-treated cells is enhanced via combined action of intracellular metabolism of the fatty  and the Gαq-coupled FFAR1 signaling. Long-term palmitate exposure reduced ATP-coupling efficiency of mitochondria and deteriorated insulin secretion. The presence of the FFAR1 antagonist during culture did not improve ATP-coupling efficiency, however, it resulted in enhanced mitochondrial respiration and improved insulin secretion after culture. Taken together, our study demonstrates that during palmitate exposure, integrated actions of fatty  metabolism and fatty -induced FFAR1 signaling on mitochondrial respiration underlie the synergistic action of the two pathways on insulin secretion.Copyright © 2015.

Glucose fluctuation, more pronounced in patients with diabetes, has been recognized as an even stronger oxidative stress inducer than the sustained hyperglycemia. Here, we investigated the role of glucose variability in the development of the NAFLD based on hepatocyte apoptosis and possible mechanisms. To achieve this goal we studied C57BL/6J mice that were maintained on a high fat diet (HFD) and injected with glucose (3 g/kg) twice daily to induce intermittent high glucose (IHG). We also studied hepatic L02 cells incubated with  (PA) to induce steatosis. The following experimental groups were compared: normal glucose (NG), sustained high glucose (SHG) and IHG with or without PA. We found that, although hepatic enzyme levels and liver lipid deposition were comparable between HFD mice injected with glucose or saline, the glucose injected mice displayed marked hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammation, accompanied by increased lipid peroxide in liver. In vitro, in the presence of PA, IHG increased L02 cell apoptosis and oxidative stress and produced pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction relative to the NG and SHG groups. Furthermore, treatment with the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor, cyclosporin A (1.5 μmol/l), prevented mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Our data suggests that IHG under lipotoxicity might contribute to the development of NAFLD by increasing oxidative stress and hepatocyte apoptosis via MPT and its related mitochondrial dysfunction.© 2015 Society for Endocrinology.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26483519>Protein Analysis of Sapienic -Treated Porphyromonas gingivalis Suggests Differential Regulation of Multiple Metabolic Pathways.</a></h2><p>Lipids endogenous to skin and mucosal surfaces exhibit potent antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, an important colonizer of the oral cavity implicated in periodontitis.

In contrast to , unsaturated fatty acids produced significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both cell types. Increases were fatty  specific, dose-dependent and different for each cell type. The arachidonic  effects on [Ca2+]i were higher in spermatids than in spermatocytes and persisted when residual extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by EGTA, indicating that the increase in [Ca2+]i originated from release of intracellular calcium stores. At the concentrations required for these increases, unsaturated fatty acids produced no significant changes in the plasma membrane potential of or non-specific permeability in spermatogenic cells. For the case of arachidonic , the [Ca2+]i increases were not caused by its metabolic conversion to eicosanoids or anandamide; thus we attribute this effect to the fatty  itself. As estimated with fluorescent probes, unsaturated fatty acids did not affect the intracellular pH but were able to induce a progressive decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. The association of this decrease with reduced reactive  species (ROS) production strongly suggests that unsaturated fatty acids induced mitochondrial uncoupling. This effect was stronger in spermatids than in spermatocytes. As a late event, arachidonic  induced caspase 3 activation in a dose-dependent manner both in the absence and presence of external Ca2+.

Our results showed that PA, a predominant metabolic substrate for cardiac β-oxidation, significantly increased contraction and  consumption rate (OCR) in LV myocytes from sham. Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) or eNOS gene deletion prevented PA regulation of the myocyte contraction or OCR, indicating the pivotal role of eNOS in mediating the effects of PA in cardiac myocytes. PA increased the palmitoylation of eNOS in LV myocytes and depalmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate (2BP; 100 μM) abolished the increment. Furthermore, although PA did not increase eNOS-Ser, 2BP reduced eNOS-Ser with and without PA. Intriguingly, PA-induced increases in contraction and OCR were unaffected by 2BP treatment. In HTN, PA did not affect eNOS palmitoylation, eNOS-Ser, or myocyte contraction. However, 2BP diminished eNOS palmitoylation and eNOS-Ser in the presence and absence of PA but did not change myocyte contraction. Collectively, our results confirm eNOS palmitoylation in LV myocytes from sham and HTN rats and its upregulation by PA in sham.

Moreover, we also found that PA stimulation decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in podocytes and induced podocyte apoptosis, while the inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) enhanced -induced apoptosis accompanied by increased ROS generation, and the stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin (Rap) remarkably suppressed -induced ROS generation and apoptosis.

Dietary saturated fats activate microglia via a nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) mediated pathway to release pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in dysfunction or death of surrounding neurons. Fatty  binding proteins (FABPs) are lipid chaperones regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways in response to fatty acids. Loss of FABP4 in peripheral macrophages via either molecular or pharmacologic mechanisms results in reduced obesity-induced inflammation via a UCP2-redox based mechanism. Despite the widespread appreciation for the role of FABP4 in mediating peripheral inflammation, the expression of FABP4 and a potential FABP4-UCP2 axis regulating microglial inflammatory capacity is largely uncharacterized. To that end, we hypothesized that microglial cells express FABP4 and that inhibition would upregulate UCP2 and attenuate  (PA)-induced pro-inflammatory response. Gene expression confirmed expression of FABP4 in brain tissue lysate from C57Bl/6J mice and BV2 microglia. Treatment of microglial cells with an FABP inhibitor (HTS01037) increased expression of Ucp2 and arginase in the presence or absence of PA. Moreover, cells exposed to HTS01037 exhibited attenuated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) compared to PA alone indicating reduced NFκB signaling. Hypothalamic tissue from mice lacking FABP4 exhibit increased UCP2 expression and reduced iNOS, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1; microglial activation marker) expression compared to wild type mice. Further, this effect is negated in microglia lacking UCP2, indicating the FABP4-UCP2 axis is pivotal in obesity induced neuroinflammation.

Both OA and PA caused a dose-dependent increase in triacylglycerol content in hepatocytes. PA was more steatogenic at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/l while OA at 0.75 and 1 mmol/l. PA exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect associated with ROS production, present markers of apoptosis and necrosis and a decrease in albumin production. OA induced a damage of the cytoplasmic membrane from 1 mM concentration. Mixture of OA and PA induced lower cytotoxicity with less weakened functional capacity than did PA alone.

Our aim was to investigate whether the protective effects of DJC by oral administration on high-fat diet (HFD) and -induced damages of endothelial cells are related to oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into standard chow diet (SCD), HFD, HFD plus DJC-low dose (HFD + DJCL) and HFD plus DJC-high dose treatment groups (HFD + DJCH). The latter three groups were given HFD feeding for three months, then the HFD + DJCL and HFD + DJCH rats were treated with DJC (500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) via gavage for another two months respectively. Endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by acetylcholine were observed in isolated rat thoracic aortic ring preparation. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total-antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), free fatty acids (FFA), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in serum were assayed. The pathological changes, protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) and ER stress-related genes in the thoracic aorta were measured. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with serum-medicated DJC and then with  to detect the reactive  species (ROS) levels and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) distribution, expression of p-eNOS and ER stress-related genes. DJC therapy exhibited a potent antioxidant activity and effectively prevented the endothelial dysfunction (ED) manifested by promoting p-eNOS expression and enhancing NO release, decreasing lipid deposition (Oil-red O staining, CPT1b and ACC) and inflammation (IL-1β, TNFα, CD68 and p-JNK), alleviating oxidative and ER stress, and decreasing the apoptosis of endothelial cells (TUNEL, BCL-2 and BAX) induced by HFD and  respectively. These findings suggest that the administration of DJC had endothelial protective effects against HFD-induced ED, inflammation and apoptosis by alleviating lipid deposition, oxidative and ER stress.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a principle intracellular energy sensor exerting protective effect against T2D. Strikingly, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, considerably inhibited the secretion of IL-1β when THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS plus  (PA). The underlying mechanism was examined with respect to the effect of compound C on NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex which controls the processing and production of IL-1β. Interestingly, compound C significantly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This phenomenon was reproduced in AMPK siRNA-transfected THP-1 cells, indicating that compound C exerts this function despite AMPK knockdown. Also, it significantly suppresses the mitochondria-generated reactive  species (ROS) required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In conclusion, compound C was shown to significantly attenuate the NLRP3 inflammasome despite AMPK knockdown, rendering it as the novel target of compound C. Potentially, compound C attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome through the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production. These findings offer initial evidence into compound C as a novel pharmacological agent with significant therapeutic potential in NLRP3 inflammasome-related disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and T2D. Thus, further studies are essential to identify the effect of compound C on these diseases in vitro.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385411> induces ceramide accumulation, mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in porcine oocytes.</a></h2><p>Low oocyte quality is a possible causal factor of obesity-induced infertility. High  (PA) concentration in follicular fluid is a crucial feature noted in obese women. This study examined how high PA concentration reduced mitochondrial quality in oocytes and investigated a possible countermeasure against mitochondrial dysfunction. Cumulus cell-oocyte complexes were obtained from the ovaries of gilts, and incubated in medium containing PA (0.5 mM) or vehicle (BSA) for 44 h. Culturing oocytes at high PA concentration induced mitochondrial dysfunction determined by high reactive  species and low ATP content in oocytes. Furthermore, high PA levels increased mitochondrial acetylation levels determined by a high degree of co-localization of TOMM20 and acetylated-lysine. In addition, high PA levels reduced the expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), while the AMPK activator, AICAR, restored mitochondrial function as well as oocyte ability and reduced the acetylation of mitochondrial protein. Supplementation of culture medium with dorsomorphin dihydrochloride (an AMPK inhibitor) reduced mitochondrial function and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation. Treatment of oocytes with LB100 (an inhibitor of AMPK dephosphorylation) reduced mitochondrial acetylation levels and restored mitochondrial function. Furthermore, high PA levels increased ceramide accumulation in oocytes, and addition of ceramide to the culture medium also induced mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial acetylation. This detrimental effect of ceramide was diminished by AICAR treatment of oocytes. Our results indicated that PA induces ceramide accumulation and downregulates the AMPK/SIRT3 pathway causing mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation and dysfunction in oocytes.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241083>Metabolic responses of Ulva compressa to single and combined heavy metals.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of metals and metabolic responses were studied for two Cd and Cu concentrations (1 and 10 μM) either alone or as a combination in marine macroalga after 7 days of exposure. Cd accumulated more at a low dose (115 μg of Cd/g DW) but Cu at a high dose (378 μg of Cu/g DW); Cu suppressed Cd accumulation (by 57%). Na and Zn levels were unaffected, but higher metal doses depleted K and Ca levels. Higher metal concentrations strongly stimulated reactive  species and depleted nitric oxide (NO) formation, but differences between the action of Cd and Cu were not extensive. Higher metal doses increased cell wall thickness with a potential relation to NO signal that is visible mainly in the apoplast in those treatments. A higher Cu dose depleted proline, ascorbic , and phenol levels more than Cd, whereas Cd elevated nonprotein thiols and ascorbic  in combined treatments. An eventual role of malic or citric  in metal chelation was not evident: malic  level decreased in all treatments.

Benzimidazole and imidazopyridine compounds are a class of compounds with a variety of activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-cancer. X22 is an imidazopyridine derivative we synthesized and evaluated previously for anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. However, its ability to alleviate obesity-induced heart injury via its anti-inflammatory actions was unclear. This study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of X22 using cell culture studies and a high-fat diet rat model. We observed that  treatment in cardiac-derived H9c2 cells induced a significant increase in reactive  species, inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis and hypertrophy. All of these changes were inhibited by treatment with X22. Furthermore, oral administration of X22 suppressed high-fat diet-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, hypertrophy and fibrosis in rat heart tissues and decreased serum lipid concentration. We also found that the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative actions of X22 were associated with Nrf2 activation and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) inhibition, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. The results of this study indicate that X22 may be a promising cardioprotective agent and that Nrf2 and NF-κB may be important therapeutic targets for obesity-related complications.© 2016 The Authors.

We aimed to investigate the role of necroptosis in human and experimental NAFLD and its association with tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and oxidative stress. Serum markers of necrosis, liver receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) were evaluated in control individuals and patients with NAFLD. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or RIP3-deficient (RIP3(-/-)) mice were fed a high-fat choline-deficient (HFCD) or methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, with subsequent histological and biochemical analysis of hepatic damage. In primary murine hepatocytes, necroptosis and oxidative stress were also assessed after necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) treatment or RIP3 silencing. We show that circulating markers of necrosis and TNF-α, as well as liver RIP3 and MLKL phosphorylation were increased in NAFLD. Likewise, RIP3 and MLKL protein levels and TNF-α expression were increased in the liver of HFCD and MCD diet-fed mice. Moreover, RIP3 and MLKL sequestration in the insoluble protein fraction of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) mice liver lysates represented an early event during stetatohepatitis progression. Functional studies in primary murine hepatocytes established the association between TNF-α-induced RIP3 expression, activation of necroptosis and oxidative stress. Strikingly, RIP3 deficiency attenuated MCD diet-induced liver injury, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress. In conclusion, necroptosis is increased in the liver of NAFLD patients and in experimental models of NASH. Further, TNF-α triggers RIP3-dependent oxidative stress during hepatocyte necroptosis. As such, targeting necroptosis appears to arrest or at least impair NAFLD progression.© 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031535>Baicalin protects AML-12 cells from lipotoxicity via the suppression of ER stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</a></h2><p>Baicalin (BA) is an active flavonoid compound originating from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi that has been reported to exert anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant effects in liver diseases with a long history. However, its protective and regulatory mechanisms on  (PA) induced hepatocyte lipotoxicity remain elusive. In the present work, we investigated the cytoprotective effects of BA in AML-12 hepatocytes against lipotoxicity by inhibiting ER stress, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that ER stress was induced by 400 μM PA in AML-12 cells with elevated expression of ER stress marker IRE1α hyperphosphorylation. BA at 12.5 μM and 25 μM effectively inhibited the expression of p-IRE1α as TUDCA. Flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that PA-induced ROS and cell apoptosis were reversed by BA. Furthermore, western blotting revealed that PA-challenged expressions of TXNIP and NLRP3 were dramatically suppressed by BA and TUDCA, suggesting that BA inhibited ER stress through a TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway. Overall, our results indicate that BA alleviates PA-induced cytotoxicity in AML-12 cells via suppression of ER stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Here, we further revealed the effects of the hepatocellular 5-HT system in diabetes-related disorders.Studies were conducted in male ICR mice, human HepG2 cells, and primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) under gene or chemical inhibition of the 5-HT system, key lipid metabolism, and inflammation-related factors. Protein and messenger RNA expression and levels of the factors were determined via western blotting, reverse transcription PCR, and quantitative assay kits, respectively. Hepatic steatosis with inflammation and fibrosis, intracellular lipid droplet accumulation (LDA), and reactive  species (ROS) location were determined via hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, Oil red O, and fluorescent-specific staining, respectively. induced the activation of the 5-HT system: the activation of 5-HT2R, primarily 5-HT2AR, in addition to upregulating monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) expression and 5-HT synthesis, by activating the G protein/ phospholipase C pathway modulated PKCε activation, resulting in ELS with LDA; the activation of NF-κB, which mediates the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, was primarily due to ROS generation in the mitochondria induced by MAO-A-catalyzed 5-HT degradation, and secondarily due to the activation of PKCε. These effects of the 5-HT system were also detected in - or high glucose-treated PMHs and regulated multiple inflammatory signaling pathways. In diabetic mice, co-treatment with antagonists of both 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT2R significantly abolished hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis as well as hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia.Activation of the hepatocellular 5-HT system plays a crucial role in inducing diabetes-related hepatic dysfunction and is a potential therapeutic target.© 2018 The Author(s).

Western blot analyses were performed to examine the expression of LC3-II/LC3-I, p62, mTOR and PI3K, while mitochondrial integrity and oxidative stress were observed by fluorescence staining of JC-1 and reactive  species. C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control group ( = 10), high fat (HF) group ( = 13) and JZG group ( = 13); and, histological staining was carried out to detect inflammation and lipid content in the liver.The cell trauma induced by PA was aggravated in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and hepatic function was improved by JZG. PA had dual effects on autophagy by activating autophagy induction and blocking autophagic flux. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and the fusion of isolated hepatic autophagosomes and lysosomes were critically involved in this process. JZG activated autophagy progression by either induction of autophagosomes or co-localization of autophagosomes and lysosomes as well as degradation of autolysosomes to protect against PA-induced hepatocyte injury, and protected mitochondrial integrity against oxidative stress in PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, JZG ameliorated lipid droplets and inflammation induced by HF diet , leading to improved metabolic disorder and associated liver injury in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Metabolic stress-induced hepatocyte injury exhibited dual effects on autophagy and JZG activated the entire process, resulting in beneficial effects in NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26539645>Myristic  potentiates -induced lipotoxicity and steatohepatitis associated with lipodystrophy by sustaning de novo ceramide synthesis.</a></h2><p> (PA) induces hepatocyte apoptosis and fuels de novo ceramide synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Myristic  (MA), a free fatty  highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and tauroursodeoxycholic  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415760>Oxidative stress induced by  modulates K2.3 channels in vascular endothelium.</a></h2><p>Elevated plasma free fatty acids level has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain to be defined. Herein, we investigated the effect of  (PA), the most abundant saturated fatty  in the human body, on small-conductance Ca-activated potassium channels (K2.3)-mediated relaxation in rodent resistance arteries and the underlying molecular mechanism. The effect of PA on K2.3 in endothelium was evaluated using real-time PCR, Western blotting, whole-cell patch voltage-clamp, wire and pressure myograph system, and reactive  species (ROS) were measured by using dihydroethidium and 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. K2.3-mediated vasodilatation responses to acetylcholine and NS309 (agonist of K2.3 and K3.1) were impaired by incubation of normal mesenteric arteries with 100 μM PA for 24 h. In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), PA decreased K2.3 current and expression at mRNA and protein levels. Incubation with the NADPH oxidase (Nox) inhibitor dibenziodolium (DPI) partly inhibited the PA-induced ROS production and restored K2.3 expression. Inhibition of either p38-MAPK or NF-κB using specific inhibitors (SB203580, SB202190 or Bay11-7082, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate) attenuated PA-induced downregulation of K2.3 and inhibition of p38-MAPK also attenuated PA-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, DPI reversed the increment of phospho-p38-MAPK by PA. These results demonstrated that PA downregulated K2.3 expressions via Nox/ROS/p38-MAPK/NF-κB signaling leading to endothelial vasodilatory dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, cell culture media typically contain supraphysiological levels of glucose to stimulate cellular growth, which also desensitizes cells to elevated glucose levels.

In this study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on the development of experimental colitis in mice. Relative to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD), HFD feeding for 4 wk increased the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and free fatty acids in the plasma as well as within the colonic mucosa. In an experimental colitis model induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic  (TNBS), mice on 4-wk HFD exhibited more severe colonic inflammation and developed more severe colitis compared with the LFD counterparts. HFD feeding resulted in higher production of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines, greater activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) tight junction regulatory pathway, and greater increases in mucosal barrier permeability in mice following TNBS induction. HFD feeding also induced gp91, an NADPH oxidase subunit, and promoted reactive  species (ROS) production in both colonic epithelial cells and lamina propria cells. In HCT116 cell culture,  or  and TNF-α combination markedly increased ROS production and induced the MLCK pathway, and these effects were markedly diminished in the presence of a ROS scavenger. Taken together, these data suggest that HFD promotes colitis by aggravating mucosal oxidative stress, which rapidly drives mucosal inflammation and increases intestinal mucosal barrier permeability. This study demonstrates high-fat diet feeding promotes colitis in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic -induced experimental colitis model in mice. The underlying mechanism is that high-fat diet induces oxidative stress in the colonic mucosa, which increases colonic epithelial barrier permeability and drives colonic mucosal inflammation.

SalA treatment significantly attenuated HFD-induced obesity and liver injury, and markedly decreased lipid accumulation in HFD-fed rat livers.

Importantly, SalA reversed the HFD- or  (PA)-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the nuclear translocation of ChREBP and the up-regulation of FAS, and these effects were accompanied by TXNIP down-regulation. However, TXNIP siRNA treatment partially abrogated the above-mentioned effects of SalA in PA-treated HepG2 cells.

On the other hand, trace elements function as essential cofactors that are involved in various biochemical processes in mammals, including metabolic homeostasis. Notably, clinical and animal studies suggest that the plasma levels of bromide negatively correlate with those of TG, total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). However, the effect of bromide on lipid accumulation and the direct molecular target responsible for its action remains unknown. Oil red O (ORO) and Nile red staining were used to detect the effect of bromide on lipid accumulation in mouse primary hepatocytes (PHs) treated with different doses of sodium bromide (NaBr) in the presence of FFAs (0.4 mM oleate/ 1:1). Spectrophotometric and fluorometric analyses were performed to assess cellular TG concentrations and rates of fatty  oxidation (FAO), respectively, in mouse PHs. We found that bromide decreased FFA-induced lipid accumulation and increased FFA-inhibited  consumptions in mouse PHs in a dose-dependent manner via activation of PPARα. Mechanical studies demonstrated that bromide decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK. More importantly, the PPARα-specific inhibitor GW6471 partially abolished the beneficial effects of bromide on mouse PHs. Bromide alleviates FFA-induced excessive lipid storage and increases rates of FAO through the activation of PPARα/JNK signals in mouse PHs. Therefore, bromide may serve as a novel drug in the treatment of hepatic steatosis.© 2019 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of EGCG in alleviating IR in HepG2 cells.HepG2 cells were treated with 25 mM glucose, 0.25 mM  (PA), or 50 μM EGCG for 24 h.EGCG increased glucose uptake and decreased glucose content. EGCG markedly decreased the levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress factors including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, reactive  species, malondialdehyde and p53 protein, and markedly increased superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione peroxidase and SOD2 protein. EGCG significantly downregulated the levels of FFAs, triacylglycerol and cholesterol in HepG2 cells. The glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) protein and its downstream proteins peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC)-1β were significantly increased, and sterol regulatory element-binding-1c (SREBP-1c) protein, and fatty  synthase (FAS) were significantly decreased by EGCG in HepG2. Moreover, the foregoing effects were reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GLUT2.Our data demonstrated that EGCG improved IR, possibly through ameliorating glucose (25 mM) and PA (0.25 mM)-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and FFAs via the GLUT2/PGC-1β/SREBP-1c/FAS pathway in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed and compared the results of studies that support and that deny the involvement of uncoupling protein-2 in this impairment. We observed that this impairment could occur in multiple stages. We provide a model in which palmitate-induced impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is proposed to occur in two stages, early stage and late stage, depending on the integrity of electron supply (glycolysis and Krebs cycle) and transport system through electron transport chain after palmitate treatment. Prolonged exposure of β-cells to palmitate can impair this system. Early-stage impairment occurs due to uncoupling by uncoupling protein-2 when this system is still intact. When this system becomes impaired, late-stage impairment occurs mainly due to reduced glucose-stimulated adenosine triphosphate production independent of uncoupling by uncoupling protein-2. The change in glucose-stimulated  uptake after palmitate treatment reflects the integrity of this system and can be used to differentiate between the two stages. Some β-cells lines and islets appear to be more resistant to palmitate-induced impairment of electron supply and transport system than others, and therefore early stage is prominent in the more resistant cell lines and less prominent or absent in the less resistant cell lines. This may help to resolve the pathogenesis of diabetes and to monitor the progression of palmitate-induced β-cell dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27337687>Autophagy deficiency in myeloid cells increases susceptibility to obesity-induced diabetes and experimental colitis.</a></h2><p>Autophagy, which is critical for the proper turnover of organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, affects diverse aspects of metabolism, and its dysregulation has been incriminated in various metabolic disorders. However, the role of autophagy of myeloid cells in adipose tissue inflammation and type 2 diabetes has not been addressed. We produced mice with myeloid cell-specific deletion of Atg7 (autophagy-related 7), an essential autophagy gene (Atg7 conditional knockout [cKO] mice). While Atg7 cKO mice were metabolically indistinguishable from control mice, they developed diabetes when bred to ob/w mice (Atg7 cKO-ob/ob mice), accompanied by increases in the crown-like structure, inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammasome activation in adipose tissue. Mφs (macrophages) from Atg7 cKO mice showed significantly higher interleukin 1 β release and inflammasome activation in response to a  plus lipopolysaccharide combination. Moreover, a decrease in the NAD(+):NADH ratio and increase in intracellular ROS content after treatment with  in combination with lipopolysaccharide were more pronounced in Mφs from Atg7 cKO mice, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction in autophagy-deficient Mφs leads to an increase in lipid-induced inflammasome and metabolic deterioration in Atg7 cKO-ob/ob mice. Atg7 cKO mice were more susceptible to experimental colitis, accompanied by increased colonic cytokine expression, T helper 1 skewing and systemic bacterial invasion. These results suggest that autophagy of Mφs is important for the control of inflammasome activation in response to metabolic or extrinsic stress, and autophagy deficiency in Mφs may contribute to the progression of metabolic syndrome associated with lipid injury and colitis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27340432>Enhanced lipid production by Rhodosporidium toruloides using different fed-batch feeding strategies with lignocellulosic hydrolysate as the sole carbon source.</a></h2><p>Industrial biotechnology that is able to provide environmentally friendly bio-based products has attracted more attention in replacing petroleum-based industries. Currently, most of the carbon sources used for fermentation-based bioprocesses are obtained from agricultural commodities that are used as foodstuff for human beings. Lignocellulose-derived sugars as the non-food, green, and sustainable alternative carbon sources have great potential to avoid this dilemma for producing the renewable, bio-based hydrocarbon fuel precursors, such as microbial lipid. Efficient bioconversion of lignocellulose-based sugars into lipids is one of the critical parameters for industrial application. Therefore, the fed-batch cultivation, which is a common method used in industrial applications, was investigated to achieve a high cell density culture along with high lipid yield and productivity.In this study, several fed-batch strategies were explored to improve lipid production using lignocellulosic hydrolysates derived from corn stover. Compared to the batch culture giving a lipid yield of 0.19 g/g, the dissolved--stat feeding mode increased the lipid yield to 0.23 g/g and the lipid productivity to 0.33 g/L/h. The pulse feeding mode further improved lipid productivity to 0.35 g/L/h and the yield to 0.24 g/g. However, the highest lipid yield (0.29 g/g) and productivity (0.4 g/L/h) were achieved using an automated online sugar control feeding mode, which gave a dry cell weight of 54 g/L and lipid content of 59 % (w/w). The major fatty acids of the lipid derived from lignocellulosic hydrolysates were predominately  and oleic , which are similar to those of conventional oilseed plants.Our results suggest that the fed-batch feeding strategy can strongly influence the lipid production. The online sugar control feeding mode was the most appealing strategy for high cell density, lipid yield, and lipid productivity using lignocellulosic hydrolysates as the sole carbon source.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732887>Fatty  levels alterations in THP-1 macrophages cultured with lead (Pb).</a></h2><p>As cardiovascular events are one of the main causes of death in developed countries, each factor potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease deserves special attention.

Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Thermally reversible light scattering (TRLS) films were obtained by visible-light photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate-ester blends (50 wt %) in the gel state at room temperature. The reaction was very fast and not inhibited by . TRLS films consisted of a cross-linked methacrylic network interpenetrated by the supramolecular network formed by the esters. Above the melting temperature of crystallites formed by alkyl chains, the film was transparent due to the matching between refractive indices of the methacrylic network and the amorphous ester. Below the crystallization temperature, the film was opaque because of light dispersion produced by the organic crystallites uniformly dispersed in the material.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid metabolism, antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of NASH. The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As, mitochondria are intracellular source of reactive  species (ROS) and important sites of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti-NASH potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of oleic  (OA) or  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive  species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of mitochondria, immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

This study was designed to investigate precise effects of antioxidant N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) in alleviating diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Echocardiography and histologic studies were performed 12 weeks after streptozocin injection. Protein levels involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting in diabetic hearts or high-glucose (HG, 30 mM)- and  (PA, 300 μM)-cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). ROS generation and structural alterations of mitochondria were also assessed. We report that NAC alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac abnormality, including restored ejection fraction (EF %), fraction shortening (FS %), peak E to peak A ratio (E/A) and reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. These effects were concomitant with blocked ERS and apoptosis, as evidenced by inactivation of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α)/spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), phosphorylated protein kinase-like kinase (PERK)/phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)/activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6α)/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) pathways, as well as suppressed Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and cleaved caspase 3 expressions. Mechanistically, PA mediated excessive mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress, which were antagonized by NAC and Mito-TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS inhibitor. No effects were noted by addition of apocynin, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX 4) and NOX 2 expressions were not altered, indicating that PA-induced ROS generation is independent of NADPH oxidases. Most intriguingly, HG failed to promote ROS production despite its ability to promote ERS and apoptosis in NRCMs. Collectively, these findings indicate that NAC primarily abrogates PA-mediated mitochondrial ROS through ERS and therefore alleviates myocardial apoptosis but has little effect on HG-induced cardiac injury. This uncovers a potential role for NAC in formulating novel cardioprotective strategies in DCM patients.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651333>Hepatic FTO expression is increased in NASH and its silencing attenuates -induced lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most common causes of liver failure worldwide.

Currently, there are limited treatment options for NASH due to lack of understanding of its molecular etiology. In the present study, we demonstrate that the expression of fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) is significantly increased in the livers of NASH patients and in a rodent model of NASH. Furthermore, using human hepatic cells, we show that genetic silencing of FTO protects against palmitate-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and apoptosis in vitro. Taken together, our results show that FTO may have a deleterious role in hepatic cells during lipotoxic conditions, and strongly suggest that up-regulation of FTO may contribute to the increased liver damage in NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, we have recently shown that improved insulin action is associated with increased FMO expression in livers of protein kinase C-deficient mice. Here, we investigated whether FMO3 expression affected insulin signaling, glucose metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes. HepG2 and IHH hepatocytes were transfected with FMO3 cDNA for overexpression, or small interfering RNA for knockdown. Cells were treated with palmitate to induce insulin resistance and insulin signaling, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene expression and ER stress markers were examined by immunoblotting and RT-PCR. Glycogen synthesis was measured using [(14)C]glucose. Palmitate treatment reduced insulin signaling at the level of Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, which were little affected by FMO3 overexpression. However, the fatty  also increased the levels of several ER stress markers and activation of caspase 3, which were counteracted by FMO3 overexpression and exacerbated by FMO3 knockdown. Although FMO3 expression did not reverse lipid effects on protein thiol redox in hepatocytes, it did prevent up-regulation of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK by pharmacological ER stress inducers or by palmitate. ER stress and PEPCK levels were also reduced in livers of fat-fed protein kinase Cδ-deficient mice.
