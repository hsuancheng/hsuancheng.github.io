There were four treatment groups. Each group of these rats received rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, L. acidophilus, or S. faecalis (30 g/kg) along with a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 wk. The serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at the end of the 4-wk feeding period (P<0.05). The proportion of  in the serum phosphatidylcholine (PC) for the control group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of arachidonic  in the serum PC for the mixed-organism group was also significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of arachidonic  in the liver PC for the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the control and S. faecalis groups. The ratio of arachidonic /linoleic  was significantly higher in the liver PC of rats fed the mixed organisms compared with the control group (P<0.05). The delta6-desaturase activity in the liver microsomal fraction of the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The delta6-desaturase activity correlated positively with the ratio of arachidonic /linoleic  of liver PC, the correlation coefficient (r) being 0.819 (P<0.001). The results indicate that the effect of the mixture of organisms was to increase delta6-desaturase activity and serum arachidonic  and decrease cholesterol compared to the other organisms and control, but the mechanism whereby the enzyme activity was related to serum cholesterol does not appear to have been explored.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431181>Brain and liver fatty  composition changes upon consumption of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA68.</a></h2><p>Recent reports suggest that the metabolic activity of the enteric microbiota may influence the fatty  composition of the host tissue. There are many studies dealing with the influence of lactobacilli on various pathological conditions, and some of the effects are strain-specific. This study was designed to test the effects of a particular Lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA68 on fatty  composition of the liver and the brain of C57BL/6 mice in the absence of an underlying pathological condition. Female mice were supplemented with live L. rhamnosus LA68 bacteria for the duration of 1 month. Serum biochemistry was analyzed and liver and brain fatty  composition was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. Significant changes in liver and brain fatty  composition were detected. In the liver tissue we detected an increase in palmitoleic  (p = 0.038), while in the brain compartment we found an increase in  (p = 0.042), stearic (p = 0.017), arachidonic  (p = 0.009) and docosahexaenoic  (p = 0.004) for control versus experimental group. These results show discrete changes caused by LA68 strain consumption. Even short duration of administration of LA68 influences the fatty  composition of the host which adds to the existing knowledge about Lactobacillus host interaction, and adds to the growing knowledge of metabolic intervention possibilities.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21929698>Effect of dietary Rhodobacter capsulatus on lipid fractions and egg-yolk fatty  composition in laying hens.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary Rhodobacter capsulatus on lipid fractions and egg-yolk fatty  composition in laying hens. Thirty-six laying hens (30 weeks old) were randomly assigned into two dietary groups fed diets with (0.04%) or without (control) R. capsulatus for a 60-day feeding trial. Dietary R. capsulatus decreased (p < 0.05) serum and hepatic cholesterol and increased (p < 0.05) the excreta cholesterol, and resultant lower (p < 0.05) cholesterol contents in egg yolk. The concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ratio to saturated fatty acids in egg yolk was improved (p < 0.05) by dietary R. capsulatus. The concentration of hepatic bile  was increased (p < 0.05) and excreta bile  was decreased (p < 0.01) in the laying hens fed R. capsulatus diet. The incorporation of 1-(14) C- into hepatic lipids and lipid fractions was increased (p < 0.05) in laying hens fed R. capsulatus diet. Moreover, dietary R. capsulatus did not appear to cause any adverse effects on laying hen performances. Therefore, dietary supplementation of R. capsulatus in layer diets may be a feasible means of producing eggs with lower cholesterol and higher PUFA contents for health conscious consumers.© 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886317>Potential of Laurencia obtusa as a substrate for the development of a probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h2><p>Laurencia obtusa (Ceramiales, Rhodophyta) has tremendous nutritional value, being high in proteins, oligosaccharides, vitamins, essential minerals, and fatty acids, and it is a rich source of amino acids and trace elements. In this study, L. obtusa was extracted and subjected to phenolic, sugar and flavonoid analyses.The fatty , vitamin and phytosterol contents in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evaluated when it was incubated with L. obtusa dry biomass. The fatty acids in the lipid extract were analysed after converting them into methyl esters using gas chromatography, and vitamin concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). According to the achieved results, the total fatty  levels and vitamin contents of the S. cerevisiae prepared with algal extract increased at different rates. Our results showed that α-tocopherol decreased in the group in which the S. cerevisiae was added the algal extract. When compared to the control group, ergesterol increased in the group in which L. obtusa extract was added. Additionally, when compared to the control group in which L. obtusa extract was added, stearic  (18:0), oleic  (18:1) and linoleic  (18:2) increased in the other groups. Palmitoleic  (16:1) increased in the L. obtusa culture medium, but  decreased in the L. obtusa culture medium. In conclusion, it was determined that the L. obtusa extract added to the development medium of S. cerevisiae caused differences in the synthesis of some vitamins and fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29685707>Supplemental flaxseed modulates ovarian functions of weanling gilts via the action of selected fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine the influence of dietary flaxseed on the endocrine and ovarian functions of weanling gilts challenged with E. coli and Coronavirus infections treated with dietary probiotic cheeses and to understand the possible mechanisms of its effects on ovarian function.  were used as a natural substitution for antibiotics and 10% dietary flaxseed is an effective prebiotic which supports the action of  and has other beneficial effects on the organism.  with or without flaxseed were fed to weanling gilts starting 10 days before and lasting up until 14 days after weaning. The ovaries were measured and histologically analysed. The blood samples for the levels of steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were assessed using immunoassays and the levels of fatty acids were assessed using gas chromatography. All samples were collected on the day of weaning and 14 days after weaning. On the day of weaning, increased levels of linoleic  and IGF-I was associated with higher body weight. The steroid hormones were not affected by the diet. The conversion of alpha-linolenic  (ALA) to timodonic (EPA) and cervonic (DHA) acids were lower compared to controls, and together with high levels of myristic,  and palmitoleic acids was associated with the higher proliferation and lower apoptosis in the primordial, primary and secondary follicles; although the inhibition of the cell cycle was observed in relation to the low level of eicosadienoic . The high levels of ALA, EPA and DHA and the low levels of myristic,  and palmitoleic acids may have been the effect of flaxseed feeding 14 days post-weaning and may have had a reverse effect on the proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian follicles. These data suggest that flaxseed may suppress the follicle development in weanlings via the stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation via the modulation of the metabolism of selected fatty acids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present study is aimed at determining the antifungal activity of Lactobacillus plantarum MYS6 against a fumonisin producing fungus, Fusarium proliferatum MYS9. The isolate was subjected to standard tests for determining its probiotic attributes and antifungal properties. L. plantarum MYS6 thrived well at pH 3.0 and 6.0, and exhibited strong resistance up to 3% bile. The isolate showed a high degree of cell surface hydrophobicity corresponding to its strong adhesion to chicken crop epithelial cells. Co-inoculation with the fungus on modified de Man Rogosa Sharpe medium revealed the inhibitory effect of L. plantarum MYS6 on fungal growth and biomass. Observation using scanning electron microscopy showed distortion of hyphal structures, swollen tips and disrupted conidia. Conidia germination inhibition assay restrained germination and showed deformed hyphae. The bioprotective feature of the isolate was evident by the inhibition of fungal development in maize-kernel treated with the cell free supernatant of L. plantarum MYS6. Both the isolate and its extracellular metabolites lowered fumonisin content in feed model up to 0.505 mg/Kg of feed and 0.3125 mg/Kg of feed respectively when compared to the level of 0.870 mg/Kg of feed in control. The major antifungal compounds produced by the isolate were 10-Octadecenoic , methyl ester; , methyl ester; heptadecanoic , 16-methyl ester; stearic  and lauric . L. plantarum MYS6 reduced 61.7% of fumonisin possibly by a binding mechanism. These findings suggest the application of L. plantarum MYS6 as an efficient probiotic additive and biocontrol agent in feed used in poultry industry. Additionally, the antifungal metabolites pose a conspicuous inhibition of Fusarium growth and fumonisin production.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17263042>[Breast milk: biological constituents for health and well-being in infancy].</a></h2><p>Many factors are involved in infants' health; one of the most important of them may be the kind of early feeding. Recent evidences suggest that breastfeeding, in addition to its well-established beneficial effects during lactation period, provides also beneficial long-term effects, like the protection against infectious and immune-related diseases, a better cognitive development, a decreased risk of metabolic syndrome and of obesity. It has been reported that the early feeding mode affects growth and body composition and it could be considered a critical factor for metabolic development. Human milk is a source of different nutrients and bioactive factors, especially hormones and growth factors like leptin, ghrelin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) playing a role in food intake regulation, metabolism and body composition. In particular breast milk leptin may provide a physiological explanation for a number of advantages seen in reaching proper growth and energy balance in breast-fed infants compared with formula fed ones. Etiopathogenesis and therapeutic approach in common minor gastrointestinal diseases in infants are important subject of study for pediatricians. Colic, constipation and regurgitation can be considered feeding problems and they might benefit from dietary treatment. Regarding infantile colic, dietary modifications seem to be more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms; also prebiotics and  are useful for this aim. The occurence of constipation is related to the kind of feeding and it is lower in breastfed infants. Moreover formulas with  and beta- could promote a regression of symptoms. A dietary approach may be useful also in regurgitation. Anyway we have to remember that breastfeeding require a supplementation of vitamin D and K for some months and a correct weaning program is needed from the 5th-6th months of life to prevent iron deficiency.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23201699>Effect of high β-palmitate content in infant formula on the intestinal microbiota of term infants.</a></h2><p> (PA) constitutes 17% to 25% of the human milk fatty acids, and ~70% is esterified in the sn-2 position of triglycerides (β-palmitate). In the sn-2 position, PA is not hydrolyzed and thus is efficiently absorbed. The PA in palm oils, commonly used in infant formulas, is esterified in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions. In these positions, PA is hydrolyzed and forms poorly absorbed calcium complexes. The present study assessed whether high β-palmitate in infant formulas affects the intestinal flora.Thirty-six term infants were enrolled: 14 breast-fed (BF group) and 22 formula-fed infants who were randomly assigned to receive formula containing high β-palmitate (HBP group, n=14), or low β-palmitate (LBP group, n=8), where 44% and 14% of the PA was β-palmitate, respectively.

On the hypothesis that certain extracellular proteins and peptides from gut bacteria may mediate part of this immunomodulation and assuming they are able to diffuse through the mucus layer and interact with immune cells we have developed this work. Our study attempts to understand the immunomodulatory mechanisms of (i) Pext, the extracellular protein fraction of  DSM20079, (ii) HM14, a peptide encrypted in an extracellular glycoside hydrolase from  NCIMB 8809 and (iii)  O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-known pro-inflammatory molecule, over human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). An untargeted LC-ESI-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach was applied to reveal intracellular changes in treated-PBMCs isolated from healthy donors. Differences in NADH arrest, NAD concentration reduction, as well as increases in  and methanephrin were observed in HM14 and Pext treated-cells compared to those stimulated with LPS. This would support an anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism of action of such proteinaceous molecules.

Six strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and one strain of Lactobacillus paracasei were selected and identified. In the co-cultivation assay, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum I62 showed the strongest and broadest antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella Paratyphi A, and Salmonella Typhimurium SA 2093 under the mimicked proximal colon condition, in which glucose and other nutrients were limited. According to GC-MS analysis, the major antibacterial contribution of organic acids secreted by L. plantarum I62 grown in the presence of glucose was dramatically reduced from 95.8 to 41.9 % under glucose-limited niche. The production of low-pK a acids, such as lactic, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic, and 3-phenyllactic acids, was remarkably dropped.
