A propos of a case of malignant biliary obstruction.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the first choice medication for most cholestatic hepatopathies, due to its capability to counteract  and bile--induced liver damage, two common features in cholestasis. However, UDCA is usually contraindicated in obstructive cholestasis, due to the alleged risk of biliary integrity disruption due to its choleretic effect. We report on an 83-year-old man with an unsuspected malignant biliary obstruction who received moderate doses of UDCA (8-12 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks, because the preliminary evidence suggested he had chemotherapy-induced cholestasis. Liver integrity was extensively protected by UDCA, as indicated by a marked decrease in serum liver enzymes, despite a steady increase in the levels of bilirubin and serum bile acids due to the obstructive process. In conclusion, this report shows, for the first time in humans, that moderate UDCA doses can reduce liver injury associated with complete biliary obstruction. This may contribute to a better understanding of the risk-benefit ratio of the use of UDCA in obstructive cholangiopathies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26817117>[COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT REGIMENS IN PATIENTS WITH NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE].</a></h2><p>To compare the effectiveness of different treatment strategies of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.51 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were included in an open randomized prospective comparative study with no control. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the chosen treatment strategy. Group 1 (n = 25) had been receiving standard treatment of NASH (Ursodeoxycholic  15 mg/kg once a day, per os divided into 3 doses, Atorvastatin 20 mg per os at night, Vitamin E 800 IU/day per os for 12 months); Group 2 (n = 26) had been receiving losartan 50 mg/day per os for 12 months in addition to the above mentioned standard treatment of NASH.In overall, the results of this work suggest that long-term, for 12 months, losartan usage in a daily dose of 50 mg in the complex therapy of patients with NASH is followed by a significant decrease in the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in serum and improvement in 13C-metathetin breath test results. These results indicate a decrease in  and slowing of formation and regression of liver fibrosis. Absence of progress in liver fibrosis in patients on losartan treatment was revealed.Additional inclusion of losartan in the standard therapy of NASH has a positive therapeutic effect on the process of fibrogenesis in the liver, so it is advisable to appoint losartan in a daily dose of 50 mg for 1 year to these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242240>NorUrsodeoxycholic  ameliorates cholemic nephropathy in bile duct ligated mice.</a></h2><p>Severe cholestasis may cause cholemic nephropathy that can be modeled in common bile duct ligated (CBDL) mice. We aimed to explore the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of norursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA) in cholemic nephropathy.In 8-week CBDL mice fed with norUDCA (prior or post CBDL) or chow we evaluated serum urea levels, urine cytology and urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (uNGAL), kidney and liver tissue quantification of fibrosis by hydroxyproline content and gene chip expression looking at key genes of  and fibrosis. Moreover, we comprehensively analysed bile  profiles in liver, kidney, serum and urine samples.NorUDCA-fed CBDL mice had significantly lower serum urea and uNGAL levels and less severe cholemic nephropathy as demonstrated by normal urine cytology, significantly reduced tubulointerstitial nephritis, and renal fibrosis as compared to controls. NorUDCA underwent extensive metabolism to produce even more hydrophilic compounds that were significantly enriched in kidneys.NorUDCA ameliorates cholemic nephropathy due to the formation of highly hydrophilic metabolites enriched in kidney. Consequently, norUDCA may represent a medical treatment for cholemic nephropathy.The term cholemic nephropathy describes renal dysfunction together with characteristic morphological alterations of the kidney in obstructive cholestasis that can be mimicked by ligation of the common bile duct in mice. Feeding the hydrophilic bile  norUDCA to bile duct ligated mice leads to a significant amelioration of the renal phenotype due to the formation of highly hydrophilic metabolites enriched in the kidney and may therefore represent a medical treatment for cholemic nephropathy.Copyright © 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

We first constructed drug-target ischemic networks in baicalin, jasminoidin, ursodeoxycholic , and their combinations baicalin and jasminoidin as well as jasminoidin and ursodeoxycholic  groups and identified modules using the entropy-based clustering algorithm. The modules 11, 7, 4, 8 and 3 were identified as baicalin, jasminoidin, ursodeoxycholic , baicalin and jasminoidin and jasminoidin and ursodeoxycholic -emerged responsive modules, while 12, 8, 15, 17 and 9 were identified as disappeared responsive modules based on variation of topological similarity, respectively. No overlapping differential biological processes were enriched between baicalin and jasminoidin and jasminoidin and ursodeoxycholic  pure emerged responsive modules, but two were enriched by their co-disappeared responsive modules including nucleotide-excision repair and epithelial structure maintenance. We found an additive effect of baicalin and jasminoidin in a divergent pattern and a synergistic effect of jasminoidin and ursodeoxycholic  in a convergent pattern on "central hit strategy" of regulating  against cerebral ischemia. The proposed module-based approach may provide us a holistic view to understand multiple pharmacological mechanisms associated with differential phenotypes from the standpoint of modular pharmacology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197565>Nonsteroidal FXR Ligands: Current Status and Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>FXR agonists have demonstrated very promising clinical results in the treatment of liver disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH, in particular, is one of the last uncharted white territories in the pharma landscape, and there is a huge medical need and a large potential pharmaceutical market for a NASH pharmacotherapy. Clinical efficacy superior to most other treatment options was shown by FXR agonists such as obeticholic  (OCA) as they improved various metabolic features including liver steatosis as well as liver  and fibrosis. But OCA's clinical success comes with some major liabilities such as pruritus, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) lowering, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) increase, and a potential for drug-induced liver toxicity. Some of these effects can be attributed to on-target effects exerted by FXR, but with others it is not clear whether it is FXR- or OCA-related. Therefore a quest for novel, proprietary FXR agonists is ongoing with the aim to increase FXR potency and selectivity over other proteins and to overcome at least some of the OCA-associated clinical side effects through an improved pharmacology. In this chapter we will discuss the historical and ongoing efforts in the identification and development of nonsteroidal, which largely means non-bile -type, FXR agonists for clinical use.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236688>UDCA, NorUDCA, and TUDCA in Liver Diseases: A Review of Their Mechanisms of Action and Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are key molecules in generating bile flow, which is an essential function of the liver. In the last decades, there have been great advances in the understanding of BA physiology, and new insights have emerged regarding the role of BAs in determining cell damage and death in several liver diseases. This new knowledge has helped to better delineate the pathophysiology of cholestasis and the adaptive responses of hepatocytes to cholestatic liver injury as well as of the mechanisms of injury of biliary epithelia. In this context, therapeutic approaches for liver diseases using hydrophilic BA (i.e., ursodeoxycholic , tauroursodeoxycholic, and, more recently, norursodeoxycholic ), have been revamped. In the present review, we summarize current experimental and clinical data regarding these BAs and its role in the treatment of certain liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669332>Spirulina Liquid Extract Protects against Fibrosis Related to Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis and Increases Ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by an excess of lipids and oxidative stress in the liver. Spirulina was reported to possess hypolipemic and antioxidative effects and might counteract NASH development. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a western diet (WD) during 25 weeks with or without spirulina liquid extract (SLE) at 2 different doses (WDS1 and WDS2 groups) in drinking water. Liver histology, inflammation, and oxidative stress were assessed as well as glucose tolerance status, lipid metabolism, and gallbladder bile  profile. WDS2 gained significantly less weight than WD. Liver weight-to-body weight ratio and plasma alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in WDS2 mice. A reduced liver fibrosis and NFκBp65 protein expression were measured in the supplemented group as a lower accumulation of superoxide anion, nitric oxide, and thiobarbituric reactive substances. WDS2 mice showed also a preserved glucose tolerance, a strong decrease of plasma cholesterol, and a significant increase of gallbladder ursodeoxycholic  and β-muricholic . Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of SLE against WD induced NASH that is related to less inflammation and oxidative stress, a preserved glucose tolerance, and less hepatotoxic bile  profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28001263>Current management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic accumulation of lipid in patients who do not consume alcohol in amounts generally considered harmful to the liver. NAFLD is becoming a major liver disease in Eastern countries and it is related to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Treatment has focused on improving insulin sensitivity, protecting the liver from oxidative stress, decreasing obesity and improving diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hepatic  and fibrosis. Lifestyle modification involving diet and enhanced physical activity associated with the treatment of underlying metabolic are the main stain in the current management of NAFLD. Insulin-sensitizing agents and antioxidants, especially thiazolidinediones and vitamin E, seem to be the most promising pharmacologic treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but further long-term multicenter studies to assess safety are recommended.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28994348>From pathogenesis to novel therapies in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an immune-mediated liver disease characterized by chronic  of the intrahepatic bile ducts, causing progressive ductopenia, cholestasis and fibrosis, and leading to liver failure. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the first-line therapy for the treatment of PBC patients. This is effective in majority of patients; however, up to 20 percent of patients have an incomplete response to UDCA therapy and have a reduced prognosis as compared to healthy individuals. Obeticholic  (OCA) has been recently registered as second-line therapy for patients with incomplete response to UDCA, with plans to demonstrate the long-term clinical efficacy. Areas covered: Recent evolution in our understanding of disease mechanisms is leading to the advent of new and re-purposed therapeutic agents targeting key processes in the etiopathogenesis. Several therapeutic targets have been proposed which can be categorized into three compartments: immune, biliary and fibrosis. In this review we describe the main biological mechanisms underpinning disease development and progression in PBC and the new targeted therapies on the horizon. Expert commentary: Testing new drugs towards hard clinical endpoints is challenging in PBC due to its low prevalence and the slow progression of the disease. Novel promising biomarkers are under study and should be evaluated as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883481>Histological Analysis of the Effect of ATX-101 ( Injection) on Subcutaneous Fat: Results From a Phase 1 Open-Label Study.</a></h2><p>ATX-101 is approved for submental fat reduction.To characterize the histological effect of ATX-101 injection into subcutaneous fat.This Phase 1 open-label study enrolled 14 adults to receive injections of ATX-101 into abdominal fat at varying concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, or 4.0%), volumes (0.2 or 0.4 mL), spacing (0.7, 1.0, or 1.5 cm), and time points before scheduled abdominoplasty (1, 3, 7, or 28 days). During abdominoplasty, tissue was excised and preserved for histology.All injection paradigms resulted in histological changes confined to the subcutaneous layer, which were more prominent at higher concentrations and independent of volume and spacing.

Liver function tests abnormalities are a common therapy-related complication, thus configuring the so-called Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) or cholestasis (PNAC). Although the damage is frequently mild, and resolves after discontinuation of parenteral nutrition, in some cases it progresses into cirrhotic changes, especially in neonates and infants. We present a literature review focusing on the pathogenetic mechanisms-driven prevention and therapies for the cases where parenteral nutrition cannot be discontinued. Ursodeoxycholic  has been proposed in patients with cholestatic hepatopathy, but its efficacy needs to be better established. Little evidence is available on efficacy of anti-oxidants, antibiotics, probiotics and anti TNFα. Lipid emulsions based on fish oil with a high content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ω-3 appear effective both in decreasing intrahepatic  and in improving biliary flow. Most recent promising variations such as soybean/MCT/olive/fish oil emulsion [third generation lipid emulsion (SMOFlipid)] are under investigation. In conclusion, we remark the emergence of a number of novel pathomechanisms underlying the severe liver impairment damage (PNALD and PNAC) in patients treated with parenteral nutrition. Only few traditional and innovative therapeutic strategies have hitherto been shown promising.Copyright © 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanisms for the protection of cholangiocytes against bile  cytotoxicity include negative feedback loops via farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR) activation, the bicarbonate umbrella, cholehepatic shunting and anti-inflammatory signalling, among others. By altering or overwhelming these defence mechanisms, cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) can further progress to biliary cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and death or liver transplantation. While PBC is currently treated with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA), many fail treatment, and we have yet to find an effective therapy for PSC. Novel therapies under evaluation target nuclear and surface receptors including FXR, transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Modulation of these receptors leads to altered bile composition, decreased cytotoxicity, decreased  and improved metabolism. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of bile acids in the pathophysiology of cholestatic liver diseases, presents the rationale for already approved medical therapies and discusses novel pharmacologic therapies under investigation.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ER stress induces the unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway.  is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear which PRRs have a major role in inducing  during ER stress. Here we show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are important mediators of ER-stress-induced  in mouse and human cells. The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion.  and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor.

In the present opinion article, we review and discuss the putative role of liver AP in health and in cholestatic diseases. In inflammatory cholestatic conditions, loss of activity of liver AP (resulting from its relocation from canaliculi and the acidic milieu) might promote hyper-adenosine triphosphate-bilia, lipopolysaccharide overload, and subsequent exacerbation and perpetuation of . Drugs that can restore the polarity of hepatocytes and canalicular export of bile acids or act as bile alkalinity modifiers are predicted to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to benefit both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

As effective anti-fibrogenic agents are lacking, we investigated ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE), a synthetic bile -phospholipid conjugate with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties for tis effects on hepatic fibrogenesis.To stimulate fibrogenesis, LX2 hepatic stellate cells were cultured with conditioned medium from CL48 liver cells after exposure to stress-inducing conditions - methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) medium or TNFα/cycloheximide (CHX) - with or without UDCA-LPE preincubation. Anti-fibrogenic effects of UDCA-LPE were further studied in CL48 and LX2 cells and in primary human hepatic stellate cells (HHStec) directly exposed to TGF-β1. To test UDCA-LPE in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were fed a MCD diet for 11 weeks followed by 30 mg·kg(-1) UDCA-LPE 3× per week for 2.5 weeks.Expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), α1-collagen, vimentin and TGF-β1 was down-regulated by up to 93% by UDCA-LPE in LX-2 cells cultured with conditioned medium. Also, UDCA-LPE inhibited Smad3 phosphorylation in CL48 cells incubated with MCD medium or TNFα/CHX and in LX2 cells exposed to conditioned medium. UDCA-LPE also decreased phosphorylated Smad3 and Smad2 directly induced by TGF-β1. Inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signalling with down-regulation of target genes was confirmed in HHStec. In vivo, UDCA-LPE decreased hepatic α-SMA, α1-collagen and TGF-β1 expression and markedly lowered α-SMA protein and collagen deposition in MCD mice.By blocking TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signalling, UDCA-LPE suppressed key mediators of hepatic fibrogenesis.

To enhance solubility and exploit specific transporters in liver, we synthesized a new galactosyl pro-drug of UDCA (UDCAgal). Ethinylestradiol (EE)-induced cholestasis was used to study and compare the effects of UDCAgal with UDCA on bile flow, hepatic canalicular efflux transporter expression, and . UDCAgal resulted quite stable both at pH 7.4 and 1.2 and regenerated the parent drug after incubation in human plasma. Its solubility, higher than UDCA, was pH- and temperature-independent. UDCAgal displayed a higher cell permeation compared to UDCA in liver HepG2 cells. Moreover, in cholestatic rats, UDCAgal showed a higher potency compared to UDCA in reducing serum biomarkers (AST, ALT, and ALP) and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β). The higher effect of UDCAgal on the increase in bile salt export pump and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 transcription indicated an improved spillover of bile acids from the liver. UDCAgal showed a reduction in CCL2, as well as TNF-α, IL-1β, and cyclooxygeanse-2 mRNAs, indicating a reduction in hepatic neutrophil accumulation and . Moreover, UDCAgal, similarly to UDCA, heightens bile flow and modulates biliary acids secretion.

In the present study, we fabricated the scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) targeted-photoactivatable nanoagents (termed as Ce6/DS-DOCA) by entrapping chlorin e6 (Ce6) into the amphiphilic dextran sulfate- (DS-DOCA) conjugates via physically hydrophobic interactions. Insoluble Ce6 was easily encapsulated into DS-DOCA nanoparticles by a dialysis method and the loading efficiency was approximately 51.7%. The Ce6/DS-DOCA formed nano-sized self-assembled aggregates (28.8±5.6nm in diameter), confirmed by transmission electron microscope, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometer. The Ce6/DS-DOCA nanoagents could generate highly reactive singlet oxygen under laser irradiation. Also, in vitro studies showed that they were more specifically taken up by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activated macrophages (RAW 264.7) via a SR-A-mediated endocytosis, relative to by non-activated macrophages, and notably induced cell death of activated macrophages under laser irradiation. Therefore, SR-A targetable and photoactivatable Ce6/DS-DOCA nanoagents with more selective targeting to the activated macrophages will have great potential for treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite existence of several interventions, there remains unclear which interventions work the best.A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing efficacy of all treatment options in NAFLD were performed to determine comparative efficacy and safety of interventions in the management of NAFLD. Several electronic databases were searched up to Nov 15, 2015. Outcomes include liver histological outcomes (i.e., fibrosis), all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, and safety. A network meta-analysis was applied to estimate pooled risk ratios (RR). Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria.A total of 44 studies (n = 3802) were eligible. When compared with placebo, obeticholic  (OCA) was the only intervention that significantly improved fibrosis with RR (95% CI) of 1.91 (1.15, 3.16), while pentoxyfylline (PTX) demonstrated improved fibrosis without statistical significance with RR (95% CI) of 2.27 (0.81, 6.36). Only thiazolidinedione (TZD) and vitamin E use resulted in significant increase in resolution of NASH, while OCA, TZD, and vitamin E significantly improved other outcomes including NAS, steatosis, ballooning, and  outcomes. Quality of evidence varied from very low (i.e., metformin, PTX on mean change of ballooning grade) to high (OCA, TZD, vitamin E on improving histological outcomes).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of major hydrophobic bile acids lithocholic  (LCA) and  (DCA) and hydrophilic bile acids cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on angiogenesis. We employed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and zebrafish embryos as model systems for studying the role of bile acids in angiogenesis. Our studies revealed that the hydrophilic CDCA enhanced ectopic vessel formation as observed by the increase in the number of sub-intestinal vessels (SIVs) in the zebrafish embryos. The pro-angiogenic role of CDCA was further corroborated by  vessel formation studies performed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas the hydrophobic LCA reduced tubulogenesis and was toxic to the zebrafish embryos. We validated that CDCA enhances angiogenesis by increasing the expression of vascular growth factor receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9) and by decreasing the expression of adhesion protein vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin).

Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue  in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D.

The Farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) antagonizes  through NF-κB inhibition. We investigated preventive and therapeutic effects of FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) on hepatic  and fibrosis in toxic cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis was induced by thioacetamide (TAA) intoxication. OCA was given during or after intoxication with vehicle-treated rats as controls. At sacrifice, fibrosis, hemodynamic and biochemical parameters were assessed. HSC activation, cell turn-over, hepatic NF-κB activation, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines were determined. The effect of OCA was further evaluated in isolated HSC, Kupffer cells, hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). OCA decreased hepatic  and fibrogenesis during TAA-administration and reversed fibrosis in established cirrhosis. Portal pressure decreased through reduced intrahepatic vascular resistance. This was paralleled by decreased expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines (transforming growth-factor β, connective tissue growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor) as well as markers of hepatic cell turn-over, by blunting effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1). In vitro, OCA inhibited both LSEC and Kupffer cell activation; while HSC remained unaffected. This related to NF-κB inhibition via up-regulated IκBα. In conclusion, OCA inhibits hepatic  in toxic cirrhotic rats resulting in decreased HSC activation and fibrosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581663>Undernourishment in utero Primes Hepatic Steatosis in Adult Mice Offspring on an Obesogenic Diet; Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the possible involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the developmental origins of hepatic steatosis associated with undernourishment in utero, we herein employed a fetal undernourishment mouse model by maternal caloric restriction in three cohorts; cohort 1) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 9 weeks of age (wks) before a high fat diet (HFD), cohort 2) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks, cohort 3) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 22 wks on a HFD after the alleviation of ER stress with a chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), from 17 wks to 22 wks. Undernourishment in utero significantly deteriorated hepatic steatosis and led to the significant integration of the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks. The alleviation of ER stress by the TUDCA treatment significantly improved the parameters of hepatic steatosis in pups with undernourishment in utero, but not in those with normal nourishment in utero at 22 wks. These results suggest the pivotal involvement of the integration of ER stress in the developmental origins of hepatic steatosis in association with undernourishment in utero.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27428727>Combination Therapy of All-Trans Retinoic  With Ursodeoxycholic  in Patients With Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: A Human Pilot Study.</a></h2><p>To perform an exploratory pilot study of all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) combined with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).PSC is a progressive disorder for which there is no accepted therapy. Studies in human hepatocyte cultures and in animal models of cholestasis indicate that ATRA might have beneficial effects in cholestatic disorders.ATRA (45 mg/m/d, divided and given twice daily) was combined with moderate-dose UDCA in patients with PSC who had incomplete response to UDCA monotherapy. The combination was administered for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week washout in which patients returned to UDCA monotherapy. We measured alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, cholesterol, bile acids, and the bile  intermediate 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) at baseline, week 12, and after washout.Fifteen patients completed 12 weeks of therapy. The addition of ATRA to UDCA reduced the median serum ALP levels (277±211 to 243±225 U/L, P=0.09) although this, the primary endpoint, did not reach significance. In contrast, median serum ALT (76±55 to 46±32 U/L, P=0.001) and C4 (9.8±19 to 7.9±11 ng/mL, P=0.03) levels significantly decreased. After washout, ALP and C4 levels nonsignificantly increased, whereas ALT levels significantly increased (46±32 to 74±74, P=0.0006), returning to baseline.In this human pilot study, the combination of ATRA and UDCA did not achieve the primary endpoint (ALP); however, it significantly reduced ALT and the bile  intermediate C4.

The mechanism for the onset of depression remains largely unknown. Recently, more and more attention is being given to the role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in depression. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a clinically available agent used to treat cholesterol gallstone and protect neurons against neurodegeneration, has been reported to prevent neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of TUDCA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior, neuroinflammation, and oxido-nitrosative stress in mice. Results showed that TUDCA pretreatment (once daily for 7 consecutive days) at the dosage of 200 and 400 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg, markedly attenuated LPS (0.83 mg/kg)-induced behavioral abnormalities in the tail suspension test, forced swim test, and sucrose preference test. Further analysis showed that the TUDCA pretreatment (200, 400 mg/kg) not only inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines induced by LPS stimulation, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, but attenuated LPS-triggered oxido-nitrosative stress in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our results provide evidence to show that the TUDCA could be a potential antidepressant, and its antidepressive mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of the neuroinflammatory response and oxido-nitrosative stress in the brain.© 2018 S.

Secondary bile acids are emerging as attractive candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Although bile acids may affect the intestinal microbial community structure, which significantly contributes to the course of these inflammatory disorders, the impact of bile  therapy on the fecal microbiota during colitis has not yet been considered.

Therefore, inhibiting these enzymes offer the potential to block production of more inflammatory substances and decrease the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate some potent, bioavailable and selective inhibitors of some catalytic proteins implicated to metabolic syndrome and their antioxidant effects from various solvent extracts of R. frangula leaves. The anti-inflammatory, obesity, diabete and XO potentials were evaluated through analyses of inhibition activities of corresponding metabolites.The water extract exhibited an important inhibitory effect on human, dromedary and stingray sPLA2-G IIA achieved an IC50 of 0.16±0.06, 0.19±0.05 and 0.07±0.01 mg/mL, respectively. Likewise, the same fraction demonstrated the highest pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity using two different substrates. Indeed, 50% of dromedary pancreatic lipase inhibition was demonstrated for 5 min and 15 min using olive oil and TC4 substrates, respectively. Besides, it was established that methanolic extract had more effective inhibitory lipase activity than ORLISTAT used as a specific inhibitor of gastric, pancreatic and carboxyl ester lipase for treating obesity, with an IC50 of 5.51±0.27 and 91.46±2.3 µg/mL, respectively.

However, it is still unclear how FXR agonists protect against NASH and which cell type is the main target of FXR agonists.

Treatment with OCA effectively prevented chronic  and liver fibrosis in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice with only marginal effect on body weight and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic crown-like structure (hCLS) is a unique histological structure characteristic of NASH, which triggers hepatocyte death-induced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, treatment with OCA markedly reduced hCLS formation even after MC4R-KO mice developed NASH, thereby inhibiting the progression of liver fibrosis. As its mechanism of action, OCA suppressed metabolic stress-induced p53 activation and cell death in hepatocytes. Our findings in this study highlight the role of FXR in hepatocytes in the pathogenesis of NASH.

This treatment slows the progress of the disease, but approximatively 30-40% of patients fail to respond to UDCA. A number of options are under investigation as second line treatment. Obeticholic  (OCA), a Farnesoid X Receptor agonist, has been approved in May 2017 by FDA for patients non responders or intolerant to UDCA. The results of a randomized, double blind, phase 3 study of OCA (mg or 10mg) compared to placebo, showed that approximatively 50% of patients reached a significant reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a marker predictive of disease progression, liver transplantation or death. Other emerging therapies include: agents targeting fibrosis, , or immunological response.

Secondary aims were to determine factors that would influence the duration and severity of this biochemical elevation. The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of all infants receiving TPN for ≥ 21 days and with elevated conjugated bilirubin (CB) ≥3 mg/dL upon TPN cessation in a tertiary care NICU from January 1, 2008 to December 1, 2010. Patients with known causes of liver disease or without laboratory values at least four weeks after PN cessation were excluded. Time to maximum conjugated bilirubin (maxCB) post TPN cessation and normalization were the primary outcomes. Secondary factors including number/timing of sepsis events, ethnicity, and ursodiol use were also evaluated.Forty three infants met inclusion criteria. The majority of patients had increased CB post TPN cessation ("up" group; 27/43, 63%) with maxCB reached 13 days (SD ± 10.3) after TPN cessation. The majority of the cohort achieved normalization of the bilirubin prior to discharge (28/43, 65%). There was no difference in rate of normalization (p = 0.342) between the "up" group (59%) and the group of patients whose bilirubin trended downward following PN cessation ("down" group, 75%). There were no differences between the two groups with respect to gestational age at birth, birth weight, number of sepsis events, gram negative sepsis events, or intestinal resection. Only 30% of Hispanic patients had increased CB post TPN cessation compared to the majority (71%) of non-Hispanic patients. The maxCB of those that had complete normalization was significantly lower value than the maxCB of those that did not normalize (p = 0.016).Nearly two-thirds of infants experience a rise in serum bilirubin following PN cessation that can last for weeks, but cholestasis generally improves with time in the majority of infants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895119>FXR controls CHOP expression in steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) have critical functions in hepatic lipid metabolism. Here, we aimed to explore a potential relationship between FXR and CHOP. We fed wild-type (WT) and FXR KO mice a MCD diet (model of steatohepatitis) and found that Chop mRNA expression is upregulated in WT but not FXR KO mice. The absence of FXR aggravates hepatic  after MCD feeding. In HepG2 cells, we found that Chop expression is regulated in a FXR/Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-dependent manner.

In vitro, MCs were treated with UDCA (40 μM) prior to HA secretion evaluation and coculturing with cholangiocytes or HSCs. BrDU incorporation and fibrosis by qPCR was performed.

In vitro, UDCA decreases MC-histamine release, which was restored by blocking ASBT and FXRβ. Proliferation and fibrosis decreased after treatment with UDCA-treated MCs.

Here, we report that intravenous infusion of taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) decreases serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, normalizes hypotension, protects against renal injury, and prolongs mouse survival during sepsis. TDCA increases the number of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) distinctive from MDSCs obtained without TDCA treatment (MDSC) in the spleen of septic mice. FACS-sorted MDSC cells suppress T-cell proliferation and confer protection against sepsis when adoptively transferred better than MDSC. Proteogenomic analysis indicated that TDCA controls chromatin silencing, alternative splicing, and translation of the immune proteome of MDSC, which increases the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules such as oncostatin, lactoferrin and CD244. TDCA also decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules such as neutrophil elastase.

Here, we show that UDCA-LPE increased the viability of mouse hepatocytes by activating the Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3β survival signaling pathways. We further tested whether UDCA-LPE could protect hepatic I/R injury in mice by clamping liver lobes of C57/BL6 mice for 90 min of ischemia followed by unclamping and reperfusion for 2 h. Two regimens for UDCA-LPE treatment were carried out; with a single dose of 100 mg/kg UDCA-LPE intraperitoneally injected 30 min prior to ischemia and a double dose of 50 mg/kg UDCA-LPE given 30 min prior to ischemia and just prior to reperfusion. Using histology and liver enzyme determination, we observed that hepatic I/R caused significant hepatic necrosis, which was decreased in UDCA-LPE-treated mice undergoing I/R. Ursodeoxycholyl LPE concomitantly protected against I/R-induced apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3, cleaved poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1),  (IL-1β, CD11b, chemokine ligands 2 and 3, chemokine receptor 2), and portal fibrogenesis (α-smooth muscle actin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), as determined by Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical analyses. The protection by UDCA-LPE was found to be better in the double-dose than in the single-dose regimen. Thus, UDCA-LPE promoted the survival of mouse hepatocytes and protected against hepatic I/R injury and thus may be of therapeutic use in liver transplantation settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129514>Epithelial-derived nuclear IL-33 aggravates  in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis.</a></h2><p>IL-33 is a new tissue-derived cytokine constitutively expressed in epithelial cells and plays a role in sensing damage caused by inflammatory diseases.

We showed recently using in vitro studies that when PB was incorporated with stabilising lipophilic bile acids and microencapsulated using the polymer sodium alginate, the microcapsules showed good stability but poor and irregular PB release. This suggests that PB microcapsules may exhibit better release profile and hence better absorption, if more hydrophilic bile acids were used, such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). Accordingly, this study aimed to produce PB-UDCA microcapsules and examine PB absorption and antidiabetic effects in our mouse-model of insulin-resistance and diabetes (fed high-fat diet; HFD). The study also aimed to examine the effects of the microcapsules on the bile  profile. Healthy mice (fed low-fat diet; LFD) were used as control.

In the injured cholestatic liver, apoptosis has long been recognized as a direct consequence of bile -mediated injury. It is now apparent that  and necrosis play an equal or even more prevalent role. Ursodeoxycholic  is the mainstream treatment for several cholestatic syndromes, but has limited efficacy in certain circumstances.

Given their importance in liver biology, bile  therapy enables therapeutic applications beyond the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. However, predicting hepatotoxicity of bile acids in humans is obscured due to inconsistent extrapolations of animal data to humans.To review the evidence that could explain discordant bile acids hepatotoxicity observed in humans and animals.Literature search was conducted in PubMed using keywords "bile ," "transporter," "hepatotoxicity," "clinical study," "animal study," "species difference," "mechanism," "genetic disorder." Relevant articles were selected for review.Clinically significant hepatotoxicity was reported in response to certain bile acids, namely chenodeoxycholic , which was given a boxed warning for potential hepatotoxicity. The chemical structure, specifically the number and orientation of hydroxyl groups, significantly affects their hydrophobicity, an important factor in bile  toxicity. Experimental studies show that hydrophobic bile acids can lead to liver injury through various mechanisms, such as death receptor signalling, mitochondrial dysfunction and . Although animal studies play a central role in investigating bile  safety, there are considerable differences in bile  composition, metabolism and hepatobiliary disposition across species. This does not allow appropriate safety inference, especially for predicting hepatotoxicity in humans. Exploring evidences stemming from inborn errors, genetic models of disease and toxicology studies further improves an understanding of bile  hepatotoxicity.Species differences should be considered in the development of bile  related therapeutics. Although the mechanism of bile  hepatotoxicity is still not fully understood, continued mechanistic studies will deepen our understanding.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297533>Deciphering the mechanism for induction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and its role in aging and cancer development.</a></h2><p>Cellular senescence is an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest that can be induced by persistent DNA damage, and is well known to function as an important tumor suppression mechanism. Cellular senescence is detected in aged organisms; thus, it is also recognized as a hallmark of organismal aging. Unlike apoptotic cells, senescent cells can survive for long periods of time. Recently, it has been shown that the late stage of senescent cells are capable of expressing a variety of secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and proteases, and this condition is now known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These secreted factors are involved in myriad of physiological functions including tissue repair and clearance of damaged cells. Alternatively, these factors may promote detrimental effects, such as chronic  or cancer progression, should the SASP phenotype persist. Recent scientific advances have indicated that innate immune responses, particularly involving the cGAS-STING pathway, trigger SASP induction. Therefore, developing a strategy to regulate SASP may provide scientific insights for the management of age-associated diseases and the implementation of healthy aging in the future.© The Author(s) 2019.

We aim to investigate the potential protective effect of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) against GNT-induced nephrotoxicity. In this study, 24 male Wistar rats were used and randomly divided into four groups of six animals each. Control group received 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose orally for 15 days, GNT group received GNT 100 mg/kg/day i.p. for 8 days, UDCA group received UDCA orally for 15 consecutive days at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose and UDCA-pretreated group received UDCA orally for 7 days then co-administered with GNT i.p. for 8 days at the same fore-mentioned doses. Serum levels of kidney function parameters (urea, creatinine, uric  and albumin) were measured. Renal tissues were used to evaluate oxidative stress markers; malonaldehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and the anti-oxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) mRNA levels. Immunohistochemical expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and caspase-3 and histological and ultrastructural examination were performed. Treatment with GNT increased the serum levels of renal function parameters and renal MDA, NF-κB and KIM-1 mRNA levels, while it decreased GSH and SOD activities. Marked immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 was observed after GNT administration while it decreased eNOS expression. Histological and ultrastructural alterations were also evident in renal corpuscles and tubules. In contrast, pretreatment with UDCA reversed changes caused by GNT administration. These results suggest that UDCA ameliorates GNT-induced kidney injury via inhibition of oxidative stress,  and apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26644386>Decreased expression of TIPE2 contributes to the hyperreactivity of monocyte to Toll-like receptor ligands in primary biliary cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown differential TIPE2 expression in several autoimmune diseases. However, the expression levels of TIPE2 in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) remained unclear. The purposes of this study were to evaluate TIPE2 expression levels in patients with PBC and further investigate its role in PBC pathogenesis.A total of 40 PBC patients and 44 healthy controls were included in the present study. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to determine the differences in mRNA and protein expression levels of TIPE2. The correlations of TIPE2 expression levels and clinical characteristics, inflammatory cytokines, and ursodeoxycholic  treatment were also assessed. Besides, the influence of TIPE2 on the reactivity of monocyte to Toll-like receptor ligands was further analyzed.The expression levels of TIPE2 were significantly decreased in PBC patients compared with normal controls (P < 0.01). The expression levels of TIPE2 were negatively correlated with alanine aminotransferase (r = -0.40, P = 0.01), alkaline phosphatase (r = -0.36, P = 0.02), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (r = -0.53, P < 0.01), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (r = -0.332, P = 0.03), interleukin (IL)-1β (r = -0.386, P = 0.01), and IL-8 (r = -0.366, P = 0.02) levels in sera from PBC patients. TIPE2 expression level could be significantly increased after ursodeoxycholic  treatment (P < 0.01). The production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-8 by monocytes from PBC patients after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic  was significantly increased when TIPE2 was knocked down. Furthermore, TIPE2 knockdown could promote activation of nuclear factor-κB pathways through increasing phosphorylation and degradation of IκB in peripheral blood monocytes from PBC patients.The present study reported that insufficient expression of TIPE2 might be involved in the hyperreactivity of monocyte to Toll-like receptor ligands in PBC.© 2015 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27727520>The therapeutic landscape of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by lobular  and hepatocellular ballooning, and may be associated with liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis and its complications. A pharmacological approach is necessary to treat NASH because of failure to change dietary habits and lifestyle in most patients. Insulin resistance with an increased release of free fatty acids, oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory cytokines seem to be key features for disease progression. Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and antioxidant agents, such as vitamin E, were the first pharmacological options to be evaluated for NASH. In recent years, several new molecules that target different pathways related to NASH pathogenesis, such as liver metabolic homeostasis, , oxidative stress and fibrosis, have been developed. Obeticholic  (INT-747) and elafibranor (GFT-505) have provided promising results in phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and they are being evaluated in ongoing phase III studies. Most of the potential treatments for NASH are under investigation in phase II studies, with some at phase I. This diversity in possible treatments calls for a better understanding of NASH in order to enrich trial populations with patients more susceptible to progress and to respond.

This chronic progressive disease, characterised by , fibrosis and strictures of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts, leads to cirrhosis. There is a strong association between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).A 10-year-old boy presented at the accident and emergency department with fever, episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and hepatomegaly. Blood tests, pathology investigations, liver biopsy and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) led to the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic  and later, because of unbearable itching, sequentially with lidocaine 3% ointment, rifampicin, an endoprosthesis in the common bile duct and glucocorticoids. One year later he returned to the paediatrician with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. Endoscopy revealed features of indeterminate colitis. Remission of the disease was achieved quickly after treatment with mesalazine.Primary sclerosing cholangitis can develop in childhood and is often associated with IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26005208>The exacerbating roles of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and the preventive effects of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) against pulmonary fibrosis in mice.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), an important transcription factor that regulates the inflammatory reaction during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, in the development of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM) in mice. An intratracheal injection of BLM transiently increased the expression of CHOP mRNA and protein in an early phase (days 1 and 3) in mice lungs. BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis was significantly attenuated in Chop gene deficient (Chop KO) mice, compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, the inflammatory reactions evaluated by protein concentration, the total number of leucocytes and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), the mRNA expression of interleukin 1b and caspase 11, and the apoptotic cell death were suppressed in Chop KO mice compared with those in WT mice. In addition, administration of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a pharmacological agent that can inhibit CHOP expression, inhibited the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and , and the increase in Chop mRNA expression in WT mice in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the ER stress-induced transcription factor, CHOP, at least in part, plays an important role in the development of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and that the inhibition of CHOP expression by a pharmacological agent, such as TUDCA, may be a promising strategy for the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by ischemia in the area of application limits the integration and survival of MSCs in patients. In our study, we generated ER stress-induced conditions in MSCs using -cresol. As -cresol is a toxic compound accumulated in the body of CKD patients and induces apoptosis and  through reactive oxygen species (ROS), we observed ER stress-induced MSC apoptosis activated by oxidative stress, which in turn resulted from ROS generation. To overcome stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated the protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a bile , on ER stress in MSCs. In ER stress, TUDCA treatment of MSCs reduced ER stress-associated protein activation, including GRP78, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, IRE1α, and CHOP. Next, to explore the protective mechanism adopted by TUDCA, TUDCA-mediated cellular prion protein (PrP) activation was assessed. We confirmed that PrP expression significantly increased ROS, which was eliminated by superoxide dismutase and catalase in MSCs. These findings suggest that TUDCA protects from  and apoptosis in ER stress via PrP expression.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

In that regard, nuclear receptors are arising as key molecular targets for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Here we show that, in a typical model of NASH-associated liver damage, microRNA-21 (miR-21) ablation results in a progressive decrease in steatosis,  and lipoapoptosis, with impairment of fibrosis. In a complementary fast food (FF) diet NASH model, mimicking features of the metabolic syndrome, miR-21 levels increase in both liver and muscle, concomitantly with decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a key miR-21 target. Strikingly, miR-21 knockout mice fed the FF diet supplemented with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA) display minimal steatosis, , oxidative stress and cholesterol accumulation. In addition, lipoprotein metabolism was restored, including decreased fatty  uptake and polyunsaturation, and liver and muscle insulin sensitivity fully reinstated. Finally, the miR-21/PPARα axis was found amplified in liver and muscle biopsies, and in serum, of NAFLD patients, co-substantiating its role in the development of the metabolic syndrome. By unveiling that miR-21 abrogation, together with FXR activation by OCA, significantly improves whole body metabolic parameters in NASH, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of nuclear receptor multi-targeting therapies for NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30954082>Impact of ursodeoxycholic  on circulating lipid concentrations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.</a></h2><p>The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials was to examine whether ursodeoxycholic  treatment is an effective lipid-lowering agent.PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched in order to find randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of ursodeoxycholic  on lipid profile. A random-effect model and the generic inverse variance weighting method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A random-effects meta-regression model was performed to explore the association between potential confounders and the estimated effect size on plasma lipid concentrations.Meta-analysis of 20 treatment arms revealed a significant reduction of total cholesterol following ursodeoxycholic  treatment (WMD: - 13.85 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.45, - 6.25, p < 0.001).

Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing.In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic  [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, , and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of :CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study.

Although a clear correlation between the elevated levels of maternal serum bile acids and deficient fetal outcome has been established in clinical practice, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we report that bile acids induce NF-κB pathway activation via G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (Gpbar1), with consequent upregulation of inflammatory genes in trophoblasts, leading to aberrant leukocyte infiltration and  in placenta. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a drug used clinically to treat ICP, competes with other bile acids for binding with Gpbar1 and thus inhibits bile -induced inflammatory response in trophoblasts and improves fetal survival in pregnant rats with obstructive cholestasis. Notably, inhibition of NF-κB by andrographolide is more effective than UDCA in benefiting placentas and fetuses. Thus, anti- therapy targeting Gpbar1/NF-κB pathway could be effective in suppressing bile -induced  and alleviating ICP-associated fetal disorders.© The Author (2016).

The present study investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on renal  and oxidative stress in a model of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2.0 mg/kg). In the OCA + LPS group, mice were orally pretreated with three doses of OCA (5 mg/kg) at 48, 24 and 1 h before LPS injection. Interestingly, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced renal dysfunction and pathological damage. Moreover, OCA pretreatment repressed renal inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In addition, OCA blocked nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and p50 subunits in tubular epithelial cells of renal cortex. Additional experiment showed that OCA pretreatment attenuated LPS-induced renal glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and protein nitration. Moreover, OCA pretreatment inhibited the upregulation of renal NADPH oxidase and inos genes during LPS-induced acute kidney injury. In conclusion, OCA pretreatment protects against sepsis-induced acute kidney injury through inhibiting renal  and oxidative stress.

Recently, bile  aspiration has emerged as a major comorbidity associated with a range of lung diseases, shaping the lung microbiome and promoting colonisation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. In order to uncover the molecular mechanism through which bile modulates the respiratory microbiome, a combination of global transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses of the P. aeruginosa response to bile was undertaken. Bile responsive pathways responsible for virulence, adaptive metabolism, and redox control were identified, with macrolide and polymyxin antibiotic tolerance increased significantly in the presence of bile. Bile acids, and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in particular, elicited chronic biofilm behaviour in P. aeruginosa, while induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lung epithelial cells by CDCA was Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) dependent. Microbiome analysis of paediatric CF sputum samples demonstrated increased colonisation by P. aeruginosa and other Proteobacterial pathogens in bile aspirating compared to non-aspirating patients.

Liver sections were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E). Orally OCA pretreatment stimulated the expression of FXR and BSEP in livers and protected mice from LPS-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammatory infiltration. Consistently, LPS-induced higher serum levels of ALT, AST, TBA and TBIL were significantly reversed by OCA administration. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-6 were decreased in livers of mice in LPS + OCA group compared with LPS group. Further investigation indicated that the higher expression of ATF4 and LC3II/I were associated with the protective effect of OCA on LPS-induced liver injury.Orally OCA pretreatment protects mice from LPS-induced liver injury possibly contributed by improved bile  homeostasis, decreased inflammatory factors and ATF4-mediated autophagy activity in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD; however, its effect in PD motor symptoms has never been addressed. In the present work, an extensive behavior analysis was performed to better characterize the MPTP model of PD and to evaluate the effects of TUDCA in the prevention/improvement of mice phenotype. MPTP induced significant alterations in general motor performance paradigms, including increased latency in the motor swimming, adhesive removal and pole tests, as well as altered gait, foot dragging, and tremors. TUDCA administration, either before or after MPTP, significantly reduced the swimming latency, improved gait quality, and decreased foot dragging. Importantly, TUDCA was also effective in the prevention of typical parkinsonian symptoms such as spontaneous activity, ability to initiate movement and tremors. Accordingly, TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced decrease of dopaminergic fibers and ATP levels, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Overall, MPTP-injected mice presented motor symptoms that are aggravated throughout time, resembling human parkinsonism, whereas PD motor symptoms were absent or mild in TUDCA-treated animals, and no aggravation was observed in any parameter.

OCA also inhibits liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients. FXR activation has also been demonstrated to suppress the inflammatory response and to promote lung repair after lung injury. This study investigated the effects of OCA treatment (3, 10 or 30mg/kg, daily for 5days a week, for 7 and/or 28 days) on , tissue remodeling and fibrosis in the monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) rat model. Treatment with OCA attenuated MCT-induced increased pulmonary arterial wall thickness and right ventricular hypertrophy, by i) blunting pathogenic inflammatory mechanisms (downregulation of interleukin 6, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MCP-1) and ii) enhancing protective mechanisms counteracting fibrosis and endothelial/mesenchymal transition. MCT-injected rats also showed a marked decrease of pulmonary artery responsiveness to both endothelium-dependent and independent relaxant stimuli, such as acetylcholine and a nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside. Administration of OCA (30mg/kg) normalized this decreased responsiveness. Accordingly, OCA treatment induced profound beneficial effects on lung histology. In particular, both OCA doses markedly reduced the MCT-induced medial wall thickness increase in small pulmonary arteries. To evaluate the objective functional improvement by OCA treatment of MCT-induced PAH, we performed a treadmill test and measured duration of exercise. MCT significantly reduced, and OCA normalized treadmill endurance. Results with OCA were similar, or even superior, to those obtained with tadalafil, a well-established treatment of PAH. In conclusion, OCA treatment demonstrates cardiopulmonary protective effects, modulating lung vascular remodeling, reducing right ventricular hypertrophy and significantly improving exercise capacity. Thus, OCA can restore the balance between relaxant and contractile pathways in the lung, promoting cardiopulmonary protective actions.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our focus revolves around the interaction of the gut microbiota with liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. The bile  pool size has recently been shown to be a function of microbial metabolism of bile , and regulation of the microbiota by bile acids is important in the development and progression of several liver diseases. Humans produce a large, conjugated hydrophilic bile  pool, maintained through positive-feedback antagonism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine and liver. Microbes use bile acids, and via FXR signaling this results in a smaller, unconjugated hydrophobic bile  pool. This equilibrium is critical to maintain health. The challenge is to examine the manifold functions of gut bile acids as modulators of antibiotic, probiotic, and disease progression in cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, and alcohol use. Recent studies have shown potential mechanisms explaining how perturbations in the microbiome affect bile  pool size and composition. With advancing liver disease and cirrhosis, there is dysbiosis in the fecal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, in addition to a decrease in bile  concentration in the intestine due to the liver problems. This results in a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa, and increasing production of . Alcohol intake speeds up these processes in the subjects with and without cirrhosis without significant FXR feedback. Taken together, these pathways can impact intestinal and systemic  while worsening dysbiosis. The interaction between bile acids, alcohol, cirrhosis, and dysbiosis is an important relationship that influences intestinal and systemic , which in turn determines progression of the overall disease process.

(DCA)-induced  and apoptotic resistance play an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression from BE to EAC. Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is a garlic-derived natural organosulfur compound. This study investigated whether DADS has chemopreventive effects against BE and the potentially related signaling pathway. BAR-T cells were treated with DCA in the presence or absence of DADS. An MTT assay was used to detect the viability of the cells. The apoptosis rate of the cells was measured by light microscopy and flow cytometry. ROS levels were determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to detect mRNA and protein levels, respectively. The levels of target proteins were also determined by western blot analysis. DADS did not inhibit cell viability in a certain concentration range. DADS, similar to the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, inhibited the DCA-induced ROS production, inflammatory factors, IκBα phosphorylation, and expression of p50 in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. DADS also increased the cell apoptosis rate through down-regulating the level of Bcl-2. DADS has low cytotoxicity in BAR-T cells. It has an anti-inflammatory effect in BAR-T cells through inhibiting ROS and the NF-κB signaling pathway. Further, it abolishes the apoptotic resistance induced by DCA in an NF-κB/Bcl-2 dependent manner. DADS may be a good candidate for BE and EAC chemical prevention and therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637104>[Treatment Options in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease].</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has sharply increased over the past several decades in Korea. In most cases of NAFLD, metabolic stress and cellular apoptosis are often driven by metabolic abnormality, eventually leading to  and fibrosis . Along with a dramatic surge in the obesity epidemic, 10-20% of NAFLD patients ultimately progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as multi-organ systemic diseases. Currently, diet and exercise are chiefly recommended to achieve significant weight loss and improve metabolic dysfunction in patients with NAFLD. However, weight loss remains to be an elusive goal for both clinical practitioners and NAFLD patients. To date, although there has not been any proven pharmacotherapy against NAFLD, numerous promising pipelines with good target engagement are under development. Moreover, given the global landmark phase 3 trials using obeticholic  (a farnesoid X receptor agonist, REGENERATE trial) and elafibranor (a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist, RESOLVE-IT trial), the era of specific target therapies focusing on molecular and metabolic pathogenesis of NASH and fibrosis is near at hand. In this paper, we briefly cover the current and future therapeutic options in patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25034655>Chemoprevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma in a rat model by ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Reflux of bile  into the esophagus induces esophagitis, -stimulated hyperplasia, metaplasia such as Barrett's esophagus (BE), and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) via nuclear factor (NF)-κB induced by bile  is an important factor in the development of BE and EAC. In colorectal cancer, experimental data suggest a chemopreventive effect of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). We hypothesized that UDCA may protect against the esophageal -metaplasia-carcinoma sequence by decreasing the overall proportion of the toxic bile acids. Wistar male rats that underwent a duodenoesophageal reflux procedure were divided into two groups. One group was given commercial chow (control group), and the other was given experimental chow containing UDCA (UDCA group). The animals were killed at 40 weeks after surgery, and their bile and esophagus were examined. In the UDCA group, the esophagitis was milder and the incidence of BE was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in the control group, and EAC was not observed (p < 0.05). In analysis of the compartment of bile , UDCA was markedly increased in the UDCA group compared with the control group (32.7 ± 11.4 vs. 0.82 ± 0.33 mmol/L, p < 0.05) and cholic  was decreased (32.7 ± 4.05 vs. 60.9 ± 8.26 mmol/L, p < 0.05). Expression intensity of Cdx2 and NF-κB was greater in the control group than in the UDCA group (p < 0.05).

Nevertheless, its function remains obscure. This study investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on LPS-induced fetal death and intrauterine growth restriction. All pregnant mice except controls were i.p. injected with LPS (100 μg/kg) daily from gestational day (GD) 15 to GD17. Some pregnant mice were orally administered with OCA (5 mg/kg) daily from GD13 to GD17. As expected, placental FXR signaling was activated by OCA. OCA pretreatment protected against LPS-induced fetal death. In addition, OCA pretreatment alleviated LPS-induced reduction of fetal weight and crown-rump length. Additional experiments showed that OCA inhibited LPS-evoked TNF-α in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. Moreover, OCA significantly attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of placental proinflammatory genes including Tnf-α, Il-1β, IL-6, Il-12, Mip-2, Kc, and Mcp-1 By contrast, OCA elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and placenta. Further analysis showed that OCA blocked nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits in trophoblast giant cells of the labyrinth zone. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for placental FXR-mediated anti-inflammatory activity.

This study examined the effects of 3 high-fat diets (HFDs) composed of different fat sources (soybean oil and lard) on the intestinal permeability, tight junction (TJ) protein expression, and cecal bile  (BA) concentrations in mice, and then analyzed their interrelations. C57/BL6 mice were fed the control diet, HFD (soybean oil), HFD (lard), and HFD (mix; containing equal concentrations of soybean oil and lard) for 8 wk. Glucose tolerance, intestinal permeability, TJ protein expression, and cecal BA concentration were evaluated. Feeding with the 3 HDFs similarly increased body weight, liver weight, and fat pad weight, and induced glucose intolerance and intestinal hyperpermeability. The expression of TJ proteins, zonula occludens-2 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, were lower in the colons of the 3 HFD groups than in the control group (P < 0.05), and these changes appeared to be related to intestinal hyperpermeability. Feeding with HFDs increased total secondary BA (SBA) and total BA concentrations along with increases in some individual BAs in the cecum. Significant positive correlations between intestinal permeability and the concentrations of most SBAs, such as  and ω-muricholic acids, were detected (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the HFD-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased BA secretion. The abundance of SBAs in the large intestine may be responsible for the hyperpermeability.© 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354219>Vascular Bed Molecular Profiling by Differential Systemic Decellularization In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Objective- Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key component of several major human diseases, but the molecular basis of this complex disorder has been difficult to determine in vivo. Previous attempts to identify key mediators of vascular endothelial dysfunction in experimental models have been limited by the lack of suitable methods for system-wide analyses of vascular bed biology. Here, we aimed to develop a novel method for investigating vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis that enables system-wide analyses of molecular interactions between endothelial glycocalyx, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in murine. Approach and Results- We developed a new technique using whole-body differential perfusion with increasing concentrations of detergent buffer to selectively solubilize distinct layers of vascular bed tissue in rodents. When combined with proteomics techniques, our novel approach of differential systemic decellularization in vivo enabled quantitative profiling of vascular beds throughout the body. Initial perfusion with phosphate buffer was used to obtain the endothelial glycocalyx, followed by subsequent extraction of endothelial cell components, and finally by smooth muscle cell constituents with increasing concentrations of detergent. Differential systemic decellularization in vivo has also been successfully applied to characterize molecular events in the vascular bed pathology of lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice. Conclusions- Together, these data indicate that differential systemic decellularization in vivo permits system-wide molecular characterization of vascular bed proteomes in rodent models and can be used to advance our current understanding of vascular endothelial dysfunction pathogenesis and progression in a wide range of disease settings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26293671>Tauroursodeoxycholic  dampens oncogenic apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress during hepatocarcinogen exposure.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the role of ER stress in tumor initiation and progression is controversial. To determine the impact of ER stress, we applied tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a bile  with chaperone properties. The effects of TUDCA were assessed using a diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCC model in preventive and therapeutic settings. Cell metabolic activity, proliferation and invasion were investigated in vitro. Tumor progression was assessed in the HepG2 xenograft model. Administration of TUDCA in the preventive setting reduced carcinogen-induced elevation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, apoptosis of hepatocytes and tumor burden. TUDCA also reduced eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIf2α) phosphorylation, C/EBP homologous protein expression and caspase-12 processing. Thus, TUDCA suppresses carcinogen-induced pro-apoptotic UPR. TUDCA alleviated hepatic  by increasing NF-κB inhibitor IκBα. Furthermore, TUDCA altered the invasive phenotype and enhanced metabolic activity but not proliferation in HCC cells. TUDCA administration after tumor development did not alter orthotopic tumor or xenograft growth. Taken together, TUDCA attenuates hepatocarcinogenesis by suppressing carcinogen-induced ER stress-mediated cell death and  without stimulating tumor progression. Therefore, this chemical chaperone could represent a novel chemopreventive agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155143>Obeticholic  raises LDL-cholesterol and reduces HDL-cholesterol in the Diet-Induced NASH (DIN) hamster model.</a></h2><p>The use of rat and mouse models limits the translation to humans for developing novel drugs targeting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Obeticholic  (OCA) illustrates this limitation since its dyslipidemic effect in humans cannot be observed in these rodents. Conversely, Golden Syrian hamsters have a lipoprotein metabolism mimicking human dyslipidemia since it does express the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). We therefore developed a Diet-Induced NASH (DIN) hamster model and evaluated the impact of OCA. Compared with chow fed controls, hamsters fed for 20 weeks with a free-choice (FC) diet, developed obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and NASH (microvesicular steatosis, , hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal to bridging fibrosis). After 20 weeks of diet, FC fed hamsters were treated without or with obeticholic  (15mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. Although a non-significant trend towards higher dietary caloric intake was observed, OCA significantly lowered body weight after 5 weeks of treatment. OCA significantly increased CETP activity and LDL-C levels by 20% and 27%, and reduced HDL-C levels by 20%. OCA blunted hepatic gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and reduced fecal bile acids mass excretion by 64% (P < 0.05). Hamsters treated with OCA showed a trend towards higher scavenger receptor Class B type I (SR-BI) and lower LDL-receptor hepatic protein expression. OCA reduced NAS score for  (P < 0.01) and total NAS score, although not significantly. Compared to mouse and rat models, the DIN hamster replicates benefits and side effects of OCA as observed in humans, and should be useful for evaluating novel drugs targeting NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) is a key transcription regulator in hepatic and intestinal bile metabolism. We studied potential intestinal FXR dysfunction in a rat model of cholestatic liver injury and evaluated effects of obeticholic  (INT-747), an FXR agonist, on gut permeability, , and BTL. Rats were gavaged with INT-747 or vehicle during 10 days after bile-duct ligation and then were assessed for changes in gut permeability, BTL, and tight-junction protein expression, immune cell recruitment, and cytokine expression in ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Auxiliary in vitro BTL-mimicking experiments were performed with Transwell supports. Vehicle-treated bile duct-ligated rats exhibited decreased FXR pathway expression in both jejunum and ileum, in association with increased gut permeability through increased claudin-2 expression and related to local and systemic recruitment of natural killer cells resulting in increased interferon-γ expression and BTL. After INT-747 treatment, natural killer cells and interferon-γ expression markedly decreased, in association with normalized permeability selectively in ileum (up-regulated claudin-1 and occludin) and a significant reduction in BTL. In vitro, interferon-γ induced increased Escherichia coli translocation, which remained unaffected by INT-747. In experimental cholestasis, FXR agonism improved ileal barrier function by attenuating intestinal , leading to reduced BTL and thus demonstrating a crucial protective role for FXR in the gut-liver axis.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

Bile acids are produced in the liver from cholesterol and metabolized in the intestine by the gut microbiota. Gut dysbiosis has been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer. However, the interplay between bile  metabolism and the gut microbiota during intestinal carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles of bile acids and the gut microbiota in the cholic  (CA; a primary bile )-induced intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Apc  mice, which spontaneously develop intestinal adenomas, were fed a diet supplemented with 0.4% CA for 12 weeks. Mice that were fed a normal diet were regarded as untreated controls. In CA-treated Apc  mice, the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly altered, and CA was efficiently transformed into  (a secondary bile ) by the bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation reaction. The intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence was observed in CA-treated Apc  mice and was accompanied by an impaired intestinal   and IL-6/STAT3-related low-grade inflammation. More importantly, microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail globally compromised CA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, suggesting a leading role for the microbiota during this process. Overall, our data suggested that the crosstalk between bile acids and the gut microbiota mediated intestinal carcinogenesis, which might provide novel therapeutic strategies against intestinal tumor development.© 2019 The Authors.

Despite the need for pharmacological treatment and intense research in the field, there is currently no approved agent for NASH.There are medications shown to improve hepatic steatosis, including thiazolidinediones, vitamin E and pentoxifylline. However, hepatic fibrosis, the hard prognostic end-point for NASH, has shown little improvement with pharmaceutical intervention. Long-term use of thiazolidinediones has provided a marginal effect on fibrosis, whereas obeticholic , a farnesoid X receptor, showed to improve fibrosis, but further data are needed. There are currently many novel agents under investigation, including glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs, sodium glucose co-transporters and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ selective modulators, whose preliminary results have been promising.Given the multifactorial pathogenesis of NASH, it is rational to consider multiple treatments rather than monotherapy as a more promising approach. Although, it remains to be shown, targeting more than one pathogenetic 'hit' of the disease may provide more efficacious management. Furthermore, the establishment of a noninvasive index for long-term follow-up of NASH patients will facilitate treatment guidance by reducing the need for multiple liver biopsies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26190501>Beneficial effects of combined ursodeoxycholic  and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is considered to be effective in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), particularly in combination with other pharmacological agents. UDCA reportedly counteracts the effects of endotoxemia. Previously, we demonstrated attenuated hepatic fibrogenesis and suppression of activated hepatic stellate cells (Ac-HSC) with an angiotensin-II (AT-II) type 1 receptor blocker (ARB). Here we evaluated the simultaneous effect of both agents on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effect of UDCA and ARB was evaluated along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade, and intestinal barrier function. The direct inhibitory effect of both UDCA and ARB on Ac-HSC was assessed in vitro.Both UDCA and ARB had a potent inhibitory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis with suppression of the HSC activation and hepatic expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TLR4. UDCA decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating zonula occuludens-1 (ZO-1) disruption induced by the CDAA diet. ARB was found to directly suppress regulation of Ac-HSC.UDCA and ARB have a synergistic repressive effect on hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting endotoxemia induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing the activation of Ac-HSC. Because both agents are currently used in clinical practice, combined UDCA and ARB may represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642350>Therapy of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis: Novel Approaches for Patients with Suboptimal Response to Ursodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic disease of presumed autoimmune pathogenesis, characterized by the  and damage of the intrahepatic intermediate and small bile ducts, which eventually results in cirrhosis. A number of randomized and observational and pilot studies using several agents were carried out in the 80s, but no clear results or even harmful effects were reported. Over the past 2 decades, increasing evidence indicates that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) - 13 to 16 mg/kg/day--is the treatment of choice for patients with PBC. Biochemical response to UDCA, assessed at 1 year, clearly predicts the long-term outcome, since in UDCA, responders survival is similar to that estimated for the matched control population. However, about 40% of patients have incomplete biochemical response and increased risk of progression and decreased survival free of transplantation. Patients with suboptimal biochemical response to UDCA outline the group in whom further single or combined treatments with UDCA are needed. Accordingly, data on the effect of fibrates alone or in combination with UDCA, and budesonide in combination with UDCA have been reported. The combined treatment of UDCA and fibrates in patients without optimal biochemical response to UDCA improves the degree of cholestasis and may minimize the long-term management of these patients. The results of the combined therapy of UDCA with budesonide are appealing but they should be established in large randomized trials. The effect of new agents such obeticholic  are promising, since the addition of this farnesoide-X-receptor agonist bile  in patients with stable UDCA dosage and increased alkaline phosphatase levels results in an improvement of cholestasis as compared to placebo, with a parallel decrease of aminotransferases and immunoglobulin M, as well as one surrogate marker of bile  synthesis.

Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ . We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative, lithocholic  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial  resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing  dysfunction, while LCA restores  integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

However, whether or not FXR can prevent rise in blood pressure remains unknown. Here, we investigate the possibility of using chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a natural ligand of FXR, to attenuate elevated blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated with CDCA (30 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Compared with vehicle control, CDCA attenuated rise in blood pressure in SHR. In addition, CDCA improved vasorelaxation and diminished the contractile response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) in mesenteric arteries from SHR. CDCA also stimulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, repressed ET-1 levels, and inhibited NF-κB activities in mesenteric arteries of the SHR. Overall, we showed that CDCA treatment reduces systolic blood pressure, improves vascular relaxation, and inhibits vasoconstriction activity in SHR. The repressed ET-1 level, the raised eNOS expression, and the ameliorated  in mesenteric arteries could be responsible for the vasorelaxant and hypotensive effect of CDCA. These findings support a potential role for FXR as a regulator in vascular activities and in the development of treatment for hypertension.Copyright © 2015 American Society of Hypertension.

Small duct disease is diagnosed in the presence of histological features diagnostic of sclerosing cholangitis and normal cholangiography. Autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) is a form of sclerosing cholangitis with strong autoimmune features overlapping with those of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). It is a well-recognized nosological entity in paediatrics, where it accounts for the majority of sclerosing cholangitis cases. It is as prevalent as AIH in children, is equally frequent in males and females, half of the patients have concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, virtually all patients have raised immunoglobulin G levels and positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Half of the ASC patients respond well to standard immunosuppressive treatment for AIH with the addition of ursodeoxycholic , but the transplant rate is higher than in AIH, and post-transplant recurrence is frequent. A number of open questions remain: are ASC and AIH distinct entities or different manifestations of the same condition? What is the role of histology? Is small duct disease a specific entity? What is the relationship between ASC and adult primary sclerosing cholangitis? What is the role of inflammatory bowel disease? In addition, validated diagnostic criteria for ASC are needed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, no LXR agonists or antagonists can be used in clinics, emphasizing the importance for discovering new LXR modulators. Fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) is powerful for designing new scaffolds and new mechanistic drugs, but fragment screening has not been applied to LXRs yet, which might be due to the lack of a specific fragment screening method against the dynamic and hydrophobic ligand binding domain (LBD) of LXRs. Herein, a series of fluorescent tracers were designed, synthesized and tested. The tracer based on hyodeoxycholic  exhibited a good capability for competitively detecting the ligand binding of LXRβ using a fluorescence polarization approach. Then, 1074 fragments were screened against the LBD of LXRβ (LXRβ-LBD), resulting in 27 binding hits. These fragment hits were further tested using the co-activator recruitment assay and reporter gene assay, and efforts in X-ray crystallography fortunately solved a co-crystal structure of LXRβ-LBD with the fragment F3 (tert-butyl-7-amino-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate). The fluorescence-based fragment screening tool and the newly identified LXRβ binding fragments provide the basis for developing novel LXRβ modulators.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Obeticholic  (OCA) improves steatosis in patients but for unknown reasons does not resolve NASH pathology. This study therefore investigated OCA effects in Wt mice, which develop obesity with atherogenic dietary feeding, and appetite-dysregulated, Alms1 mutant foz/foz mice fed the same diet, which develop metabolic obesity and diabetes.OCA (1 mg/kg) was administered orally to female foz/foz mice and Wt littermates from weaning until 28 weeks. Adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and fatty liver pathology were studied. Experiments were repeated with OCA 10 mg/kg.OCA reduced body weight and hepatic lipids and improved glucose disposal only in Wt mice. OCA limited Wt adipose expansion, altered morphometry in favor of small adipocytes, enhanced expression of genes indicating adipose browning, and reduced crown-like structure number in visceral adipose tissue. foz/foz mice showed more crown-like structures in all compartments; OCA failed to alter adipose morphometry, browning, , or improve NASH severity, even at 10 mg/kg.OCA improved adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and steatosis in a milder metabolic phenotype but failed to improve these factors in morbidly obese diabetic mice. These results help explain OCA's limited efficacy to reverse human NASH.© 2016 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142143>A multidrug cocktail approach attenuates ischemic-type biliary lesions in liver transplantation from non-heart-beating donors.</a></h2><p>Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) are the most troublesome biliary complication after liver transplantation (LT) from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) and frequently result in death or re-transplantation. In transplantation process, warm ischemia (WI) in the donor, cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in the recipient altogether inducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is strongly associated with ITBL. This is a cascading injury process, involving in a complex series of inter-connecting events causing variety of cells activation and damage associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These damaged cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), coupled with immunological injury and bile salt toxicity altogether contribute to ITBL in NHBD LT. Developed therapeutic strategies to attenuate IRI are essential to improve outcome after LT. Among them, single pharmaceutical interventions blocking a specific pathway of IRI in rodent models play an absolutely dominant role, and show a beneficial effect in some given controlled experiments. But this will likely prove ineffective in complex clinical setting in which more risk parameters are involved. Therefore, we intend to design a multidrug cocktail approach to block different pathways on more than one stage (WI, cold ischemia and reperfusion) of the process of IRI-induced ITBL simultaneously. This multidrug cocktail will include six drugs containing streptokinase, epoprostenol, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDC). These drugs show protective effects by targeting the different key events of IRI, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and reduced bile salt toxicity. Ideally, the compounds, dosage, and method of application of drugs included in cocktail should not be definitive. We can consider removing or adding some drugs to the proposed cocktail based on further research. But given the multitude of different combinations, it is extremely difficult to determent which combination is the optimization design. Nevertheless, regardless of the difficulty, our multidrug cocktail approach designed to block different mechanisms on more than one stage of IRI simultaneously may represent a future preventive and therapeutic avenue for ITBL.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Prior to treatment, all mice underwent liver biopsy for confirmation and stratification of liver steatosis and fibrosis, using the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis staging system. The mice were kept on the diet and received vehicle, liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg, SC, BID), obeticholic  (OCA, 30 mg/kg PO, QD), or elafibranor (30 mg/kg PO, QD) for eight weeks. Within-subject comparisons were performed on changes in steatosis, , ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis scores. In addition, compound effects were evaluated by quantitative liver histology, including percent fractional area of liver fat, galectin-3, and collagen 1a1.Liraglutide and elafibranor, but not OCA, reduced body weight in both models. Liraglutide improved steatosis scores in DIO-NASH mice only. Elafibranor and OCA reduced histopathological scores of hepatic steatosis and  in both models, but only elafibranor reduced fibrosis severity. Liraglutide and OCA reduced total liver fat, collagen 1a1, and galectin-3 content, driven by significant reductions in liver weight. The individual drug effects on NASH histological endpoints were supported by global gene expression (RNA sequencing) and liver lipid biochemistry.DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models show distinct treatment effects of liraglutide, OCA, and elafibranor, being in general agreement with corresponding findings in clinical trials for NASH. The present data therefore further supports the clinical translatability and utility of DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models of NASH for probing the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634696>Calcium Pyruvate Exerts Beneficial Effects in an Experimental Model of Irritable Bowel Disease Induced by DCA in Rats.</a></h2><p>Pyruvate is a normal constituent of the body that participates in carbohydrate metabolism and functions as a scavenger of free radicals. Calcium pyruvate monohydrate (CPM) is a more stable derivative that has proved its anti-inflammatory effect in experimental colitis, among other disorders, and that could also be considered a source of calcium. Thus, it would be useful for the treatment of diseases with an inflammatory component and a high prevalence of osteoporosis like the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of CPM in a rat model of chronic post-inflammatory visceral pain induced by  (DCA) that resembles IBS. Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days. The treatments reduced the visceral hypersensitivity measured by response to colorectal distension and referred pain. DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug. Furthermore, it improved the immune status of the animals, which could contribute to the visceral analgesia and the regeneration of the intestinal epithelial  integrity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601882>Microbial metabolite  controls Clostridium perfringens-induced chicken necrotic enteritis through attenuating inflammatory cyclooxygenase signaling.</a></h2><p>Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics under consumer preferences and regulatory pressures. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into the relationship between NE pathogenesis, microbiome, and host responses. Here we showed that the microbial metabolic byproduct of secondary bile   (DCA), at as low as 50 µM, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenges significantly induced NE, severe intestinal , and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished (P < 0.05) by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and significantly reduced lamina propria cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into ileum (P < 0.05) without altering the bacterial ileal luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA significantly reduced inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, Il1β, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanism studies revealed that C. perfringens induced (P < 0.05) elevated expression of inflammatory mediators of Infγ, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (Cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin significantly attenuated INFγ-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistent with the in vitro assay, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet protected the birds against NE-induced BW loss, ileal , and intestinal cell apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal  through attenuating inflammatory response. These novel findings of microbiome protecting birds against NE provide new options on developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28157718>In vitro comparative assessment of decellularized bovine pericardial patches and commercial bioprosthetic heart valves.</a></h2><p>Notwithstanding their wide exploitation, biological prosthetic heart valves are characterized by limited durability (10-15 years). The treatment of biological tissues with chemical crosslinking agents such as glutaraldehyde accounts for the enhanced risk of structural deterioration associated with the early failure of bioprosthetic valves. To overcome the shortcomings of the currently available solutions, adoption of decellularized biological tissues of animal origin has emerged as a promising approach. The present study aims to assess in vitro cardiovascular scaffolds composed of bovine pericardium decellularized with the novel TRITDOC (TRIton-X100 and TauroDeOxyCholic ) procedure. The effects of the treatment have been assessed by means of histological, biomolecular, cellular, biochemical and biomechanical analyses. The TRITDOC procedure grants the complete decellularization of bovine pericardial scaffolds while preserving the extracellular matrix architecture and the biomechanical properties. With a dedicated ELISA test, the TRITDOC procedure has been proven to ensure the complete removal of the alphaGal antigen, responsible for hyperacute rejection and for long-term deterioration of xenogenic biomaterials. Static seeding of the acellular pericardial patches with human adipose-derived stem cells resulted in an evenly repopulated scaffold without signs of calcification. The in vitro cyto-/immuno-compatibility response of the TRITDOC-bovine pericardium was compared with glutaraldehyde-treated xenogenic pericardium collected from two bioprosthetic devices currently used in clinical practice: PERIMOUNT MAGNA and TRIFECTA. TRITDOC-bovine pericardium exhibited lower complement activation, lower cytotoxicity and a lower tendency to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to the tested commercial bioprostheses. Therefore, TRITDOC-decellularized pericardium could be considered as possible candidate material for the production of prosthetic heart valves.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487283>Bile acids  and ursodeoxycholic  differentially regulate human β-defensin-1 and -2 secretion by colonic epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Bile acids and epithelial-derived human β-defensins (HβDs) are known to be important factors in the regulation of colonic mucosal   and inflammation. We hypothesized that bile acids regulate colonic HβD expression and aimed to test this by investigating the effects of  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  on the expression and release of HβD1 and HβD2 from colonic epithelial cells and mucosal tissues. DCA (10-150 µM) stimulated the release of both HβD1 and HβD2 from epithelial cell monolayers and human colonic mucosal tissue  In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  (50-200 µM) inhibited both basal and DCA-induced defensin release. Effects of DCA were mimicked by the Takeda GPCR 5 agonist, INT-777 (50 μM), but not by the farnesoid X receptor agonist, GW4064 (10 μM). INT-777 also stimulated colonic HβD1 and HβD2 release from wild-type, but not Takeda GPCR 5, mice. DCA stimulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, an effect that was attenuated by ursodeoxycholic , whereas an NF-κB inhibitor, BMS-345541 (25 μM), inhibited DCA-induced HβD2, but not HβD1, release. We conclude that bile acids can differentially regulate colonic epithelial HβD expression and secretion and discuss the implications of our findings for intestinal health and disease.-Lajczak, N.

In the present work, we studied the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on arachidonic  metabolism in the liver and investigated the role of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR, NR1H4) in eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways and nuclear factor  light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) signaling, major modulators of the inflammatory cascade. Mice were fed an HFD to induce NAFLD and then treated with the FXR ligand obeticholic  (OCA). Histology and gene expression analyses were performed on liver tissue. Eicosanoid levels were measured from serum and urine samples. The molecular mechanism underlying the effect of FXR activation on arachidonic  metabolism and NF-kB signaling was studied in human liver Huh7 cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. NAFLD was characterized by higher (∼25%) proinflammatory [leukotrienes (LTB)] and lower (∼3-fold) anti-inflammatory [epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)] eicosanoid levels than in chow mice. OCA induced the expression of several hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) epoxygenases, the enzymes responsible for EET synthesis, and mitigated HFD-induced hepatic injury. In vitro, induction of CYP450 epoxygenases was sufficient to inhibit NF-kB signaling and cell migration. The CYP450 epoxygenase pan-inhibitor gemfibrozil fully abolished the protective effect of OCA, indicating that OCA-mediated inhibition of NF-kB signaling was EET-dependent. In summary, NAFLD was characterized by an imbalance in arachidonate metabolism. FXR activation reprogramed arachidonate metabolism by inducing P450 epoxygenase expression and EET production. In vitro, FXR-mediated NF-kB inhibition required active P450 epoxygenases.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29458053>Circulating bile acids in healthy adults respond differently to a dietary pattern characterized by whole grains, legumes and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars: A randomized, controlled, crossover feeding study.</a></h2><p>The effects of diets high in refined grains on biliary and colonic bile acids have been investigated extensively. However, the effects of diets high in whole versus refined grains on circulating bile acids, which can influence glucose homeostasis and  through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (TGR5), have not been studied.We conducted a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled crossover feeding trial () in 80 healthy adults (40 women/40 men, age 18-45 years) from the greater Seattle Area, half of which were normal weight (BMI 18.5-25.0 kg/m) and half overweight to obese (BMI 28.0-39.9 kg/m). Participants consumed two four-week controlled diets in randomized order: 1) a whole grain diet (WG diet), designed to be low in glycemic load (GL), high in whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables, and 2) a refined grain diet (RG diet), designed to be high GL, high in refined grains and added sugars, separated by a four-week washout period. Quantitative targeted analysis of 55 bile  species in fasting plasma was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of glucose, insulin, and CRP were measured in fasting serum. Linear mixed models were used to test the effects of diet on bile  concentrations, and determine the association between plasma bile  concentrations and HOMA-IR and CRP. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 was used to control for multiple testing.A total of 29 plasma bile acids were reliably detected and retained for analysis. Taurolithocholic  (TLCA), taurocholic  (TCA) and glycocholic  (GCA) were statistically significantly higher after the WG compared to the RG diet (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant differences by BMI or sex. When evaluating the association of bile acids and HOMA-IR, GCA, taurochenodeoxycholic , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), 5β‑cholanic ‑3β,12α‑diol, 5‑cholanic ‑3β‑ol, and glycodeoxycholic  (GDCA) were statistically significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR individually, and as a group, total, 12α‑hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile acids were also significant (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by BMI, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), cholic  (CA), UDCA, 5β-cholanic -3β, , and total, 12α-hydroxylated, primary and secondary bile  groups were significantly positively associated with HOMA-IR among overweight to obese individuals (FDR < 0.05). When stratifying by sex, GCA, CDCA, TCA, CA, UDCA, GDCA, glycolithocholic  (GLCA), total, primary, 12α‑hydroxylated, and glycine-conjugated bile acids were significantly associated with HOMA-IR among women, and CDCA, GDCA, and GLCA were significantly associated among men (FDR < 0.05). There were no significant associations between bile acids and CRP.Diets with comparable macronutrient and energy composition, but differing in carbohydrate source, affected fasting plasma bile acids differently. Specifically, a diet characterized by whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables compared to a diet high in refined grains and added sugars led to modest increases in concentrations of TLCA, TCA and GCA, ligands for FXR and TGR5, which may have beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is characterized by hyperpermeability, bacterial translocation and , we aimed to investigate, for the first time, if the FXR-agonist obeticholic  (OCA) could attenuate intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury.In a validated rat model of intestinal IRI (laparotomy + temporary mesenteric artery clamping), 3 conditions were tested (n = 16/group): laparotomy only (sham group); ischemia 60min+ reperfusion 60min + vehicle pretreatment (IR group); ischemia 60min + reperfusion 60min + OCA pretreatment (IR+OCA group). Vehicle or OCA (INT-747, 2*30mg/kg) was administered by gavage 24h and 4h prior to IRI. The following end-points were analyzed: 7-day survival; biomarkers of enterocyte viability (L-lactate, I-FABP); histology (morphologic injury to villi/crypts and villus length); intestinal permeability (Ussing chamber); endotoxin translocation (Lipopolysaccharide assay); cytokines (IL-6, IL-1-β, TNFα, IFN-γ IL-10, IL-13); apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3); and autophagy (LC3, p62).It was found that intestinal IRI was associated with high mortality (90%); loss of intestinal integrity (structurally and functionally); increased endotoxin translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production; and inhibition of autophagy. Conversely, OCA-pretreatment improved 7-day survival up to 50% which was associated with prevention of epithelial injury, preserved intestinal architecture and permeability. Additionally, FXR-agonism led to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release and alleviated autophagy inhibition.Pretreatment with OCA, an FXR-agonist, improves survival in a rodent model of intestinal IRI, preserves the gut barrier function and suppresses .

Klb mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed (increased) bile  (BA) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, fed a chow diet focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of microbiota-derived , classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity through direct action (mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms (mediating FGF15 signaling that maintains BA level and composition).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315087>Molecular Properties of Guar Gum and Pectin Modify Cecal Bile Acids, Microbiota, and Plasma Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein in Rats.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) act as signaling molecules in various physiological processes, and are related to colonic microbiota composition as well as to different types of dietary fat and fiber. This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles, microbiota composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular-weight (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high-fat diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbiota composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels, microbiota composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high-fat diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and ursodeoxycholic acids as well as α-, β-, and ω-muricholic acids to a greater extent than other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal - and hyodeoxycholic  were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ω-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF32. These results indicate that the molecular properties of guar gum and pectin are important for their ability to modulate cecal BA formation, gut microbiota composition, and high-fat diet induced .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25463533>24-nor-ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates inflammatory response and liver fibrosis in a murine model of hepatic schistosomiasis.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic granuloma formation and fibrosis characterize the pathological features of Schistosoma mansoni infection. Based on previously observed substantial anti-fibrotic effects of 24-nor-ursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA) in Abcb4/Mdr2(-/-) mice with cholestatic liver injury and biliary fibrosis, we hypothesized that norUDCA improves -driven liver fibrosis in S. mansoni infection.Adult NMRI mice were infected with 50 S. mansoni cercariae and after 12 weeks received either norUDCA- or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA)-enriched diet (0.5% wt/wt) for 4 weeks. Bile  effects on liver histology, serum biochemistry, key regulatory cytokines, hepatic hydroxyproline content as well as granuloma formation were compared to naive mice and infected controls. In addition, effects of norUDCA on primary T-cell activation/proliferation and maturation of the antigen-presenting-cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) were determined in vitro.UDCA as well as norUDCA attenuated the inflammatory response in livers of S. mansoni infected mice, but exclusively norUDCA changed cellular composition and reduced size of hepatic granulomas as well as TH2-mediated hepatic fibrosis in vivo. Moreover, norUDCA affected surface expression level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II of macrophages and dendritic cells as well as activation/proliferation of T-lymphocytes in vitro, whereas UDCA had no effect.This study demonstrates pronounced anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of norUDCA compared to UDCA in S. mansoni induced liver injury, and indicates that norUDCA directly represses antigen presentation of antigen presenting cells and subsequent T-cell activation in vitro. Therefore, norUDCA represents a promising drug for the treatment of this important cause of liver fibrosis.Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to clarify role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AAD and whether the antioxidant ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) attenuates AAD formation.Angiotensin II (Ang II) was infused in 8-months male ApoE-/- mice for one week to establish a model of AAD. UDCA (10 mg/kg/day) was administered via intragastric gavage for 3 consecutive days before AngII infusion and also during the AngII infusion for another consecutive 7 days.Ang II-infusion resulted in the incidence of AAD at a rate of 35% (13/37) and UDCA markedly reduced the incidence of AAD to 16% (6/37), accompanied with reduced maximal aortic diameter measured at the suprarenal region of the abdominal aorta. Additionally, UDCA pretreatment prevented Ang II induced generations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) both in vivo and in. vitro Mechanistically, we found UDCA markedly increased Nrf2 expression in VSMCs and prevented Ang II induced expression of NADPH subunits (p47, p67 and gp91) in Nrf2-dependent manner and rescued the activity of redox enzymes (Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT), thereby inhibiting apoptosis of VSMCs.These results demonstrate that UDCA prevented AAD formation by reducing apoptosis of VSMCs caused by oxidative stress in Nrf2 dependent manner and suggest that UDCA might have clinical potential to suppress AAD formation.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

This may be applicable to TBI, which also triggers inflammatory and apoptotic processes. Additionally, preliminary data support the use of pharmacological therapies that reduce apoptosis and  associated with TBI. The anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of TUDCA could prove promising in the treatment of TBI. Currently, there are no published data supporting improvement in clinical outcomes of TBI by treatment with TUDCA, but future studies should be considered.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26442866>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) Exerts Anti-Atherogenic Effects by Inhibiting Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress Induced by Disturbed Flow.</a></h2><p>Disturbed blood flow with low-oscillatory shear stress (OSS) is a predominant atherogenic factor leading to dysfunctional endothelial cells (ECs). Recently, it was found that disturbed flow can directly induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in ECs, thereby playing a critical role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a naturally occurring bile , has long been used to treat chronic cholestatic liver disease and is known to alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress at the cellular level. However, its role in atherosclerosis remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated the anti-atherogenic activity of UDCA via inhibition of disturbed flow-induced ER stress in atherosclerosis. UDCA effectively reduced ER stress, resulting in a reduction in expression of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) and CEBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in ECs. UDCA also inhibits the disturbed flow-induced inflammatory responses such as increases in adhesion molecules, monocyte adhesion to ECs, and apoptosis of ECs. In a mouse model of disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis, UDCA inhibits atheromatous plaque formation through the alleviation of ER stress and a decrease in adhesion molecules. Taken together, our results revealed that UDCA exerts anti-atherogenic activity in disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis by inhibiting ER stress and the inflammatory response. This study suggests that UDCA may be a therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222912>Inhibition of -Associated Thrombosis with ROS-Responsive Heparin-DOCA/PVAX Nanoparticles.</a></h2><p>-associated thrombosis is a non-negligible source of mortalities and morbidities worldwide. To manipulate -associated coagulation, nanoparticles that contain anti-inflammatory polymer (copolyoxalate containing vanillyl alcohol, PVAX) and anti-thrombotic heparin derivative  (Hep-DOCA) are prepared. The strategy takes advantage of the reducted side effects of heparin through heparin conjugation, achievement of long-term anti- by -trigged release of anti-inflammatory agents, and formation of PVAX/heparin-DOCA nanoparticles by co-self-assembly. It is demonstrated that the Hep-DOCA conjugate and PVAX are synthesized successfully; PVAX and Hep-DOCA nanodrugs (HDP) are obtained by co-assembly; the HDP nanoparticles effectively reduce the  and coagulation without inducing lethal bleeding both in vivo and in vitro. The method provided here is versatile and effective, which paves new way to develop nanodrugs to treat -associated thrombosis safely.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Both animal and clinical studies have revealed that bile  reflux and subsequent chronic inflammation are key causal factors of IM. Previous studies indicated that SOX2, the key transcription factor in gastric differentiation, was downregulated during IM development while CDX2, the pivotal intestine-specific transcription factor was upregulated significantly. However, it remains unclear whether the downregulation of SOX2 promotes gastric IM emergence or is merely a concomitant phenomenon. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of SOX2 downregulation during IM development are unclear.Gastric cell lines were treated with  (DCA) in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of CDX2 and miR-21 in gastric tissue microarray were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were performed to ascertain the interaction of SOX2 and CDX2. Luciferase reporter assays were used to detect the transcriptional activity of CDX2, and confirm miR-21 binding to SOX2 3'-UTR. The protein level of SOX2, CDX2 and downstream IM-specific genes were investigated using western blotting. mRNA level of miR-21, SOX2, CDX2 and downstream IM-specific genes were detected by qRT-PCR.Bile  treatment could suppress SOX2 expression and simultaneously induce expression of CDX2 in gastric cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SOX2 overexpression could significantly inhibit bile - and exogenous CDX2-induced IM-specific gene expression, including KLF4, cadherin 17 and HNF4α expression. In contrast, SOX2 knockdown had the opposite effect. A dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that SOX2 overexpression could significantly suppress CDX2 transcriptional activity in HEK293T cells. CDX2 and SOX2 could form protein complexes in the nucleus. In addition, bile  induced the expression of miR-21. The inhibition of SOX2 in bile -treated gastric cell lines was rescued by miR-21 knockdown.These findings suggested that SOX2 can interfere with the transcriptional activity of CDX2 in bile -induced IM and that miR-21 might play a key role in this process, which shed new lights in the prevention of gastric cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group). Following 10 weeks of tumor growth, all animals were sacrificed to collect total white adipose tissue (WAT). Luminex assays were performed for gut hormone and  marker analysis. Bile acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in feces and serum. The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels. Moreover, the TG mice displayed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-10. Lithocholic , , and ursodeoxycholic  were significantly decreased in the stool of TG mice. Significant alterations of the intestinal microbiome were found in the ileal contents of the TG.The present study provides a first glimpse that human NB in a murine model induces tumor cachexia associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory parameters, as well as changes in the intestinal microbiota. Since the intestinal microbiome is known to contribute to the host's ability to harvest energy, a favorable modulation of the intestinal microbiome in tumor patients could potentially represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent tumor-associated cachexia.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26067554>Chenodeoxycholic  attenuates ovalbumin-induced airway  in murine model of asthma by inhibiting the T(H)2 cytokines.</a></h2><p>Asthma is a complex highly prevalent airway disease that is a major public health problem for which current treatment options are inadequate. Recently, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory actions in various disease conditions, but there have been no reported investigations of Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a natural FXR agonist, in allergic airway . To test the CDCA effectiveness in airway , ovalbumin (OVA)-induced acute murine asthma model was established. We found that lung tissue express FXR and CDCA administration reduced the severity of the murine allergic airway disease as assessed by pathological and molecular markers associated with the disease. CDCA treatment resulted in fewer infiltrations of cells into the airspace and peribronchial areas, and decreased goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus secretion and serum IgE levels which was increased in mice with OVA-induced allergic asthma. The CDCA treatment further blocked the secretion of TH2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α indicate that the FXR and its agonists may have potential for treating allergic asthma.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the effect of DCA on inflammasome activation is mainly mediated through bile  receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2); however, the intermediate process remains unclear. Here, we sought to explore the detailed molecular mechanism involved and examine the effect of S1PR2 blockage in a colitis mouse model. In this study, we found that DCA could dose dependently upregulate S1PR2 expression. Meanwhile, DCA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation is at least partially achieved through stimulating extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling pathway downstream of S1PR2 followed by promoting of lysosomal cathepsin B release. DCA enema significantly aggravated DSS-induced colitis in mice and S1PR2 inhibitor as well as inflammasome inhibition by cathepsin B antagonist substantially reducing the mature IL-1 production and alleviated colonic  superimposed by DCA. Therefore, our findings suggest that S1PR2/ERK1/2/cathepsin B signaling plays a critical role in triggering inflammasome activation by DCA and S1PR2 may represent a new potential therapeutic target for the management of intestinal  in individuals on a high-fat diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772394>Obeticholic  differentially regulates hepatic injury and inflammation at different stages of D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide-evoked acute liver failure.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates genes involved in bile  metabolism. Accumulating data demonstrate that FXR has an anti-inflammatory activity. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of obeticholic  (OCA), a novel synthetic FXR agonist, on D-galactosamine (GalN)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-evoked acute liver injury. All mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with GalN (300 mg/kg) plus LPS (2.5 μg/kg). Some mice were pretreated with OCA (10 mg/kg) 48, 24 and 1 h before GalN/LPS. As expected, pretreatment with OCA alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis at early and middle stages of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. By contrast, pretreatment with OCA augmented hepatic injury and inflammatory cell infiltration at middle stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. Additional experiment found that OCA inhibited hepatic NF-κB activation at early and middle stages of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. Interestingly, OCA inhibited hepatic proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α and il-6 but upregulated hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 at early stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver failure. By contrast, OCA suppressed hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine tgf-β and il-10 at middle stage of GalN/LPS-induced acute liver injury. These results suggest that FXR agonist OCA differentially regulates hepatic injury and inflammation at different stages of GalN/LPS-evoked acute liver failure.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To pursue the possibility that the capsule of Francisella live vaccine strain (LVS) has a structurally unique lipid anchor, we have metabolically labeled Francisella with [14C]acetate to facilitate highly sensitive compositional analysis of capsule-associated lipids. Capsule was purified by two independent methods and yielded similar results. Autoradiographic and immunologic analysis confirmed that this purified material was largely devoid of low molecular weight LPS and of the copious amounts of free lipid A that the Francisellae accumulate. Chemical hydrolysis yielded [14C]-labeled free fatty acids characteristic of Francisella lipid A but with a different molar ratio of 3-OH C18:0 to 3-OH C16:0 and different composition of non-hydroxylated fatty acids (mainly C14:0 rather than C16:0) than that of free Francisella lipid A. Mild  hydrolysis to induce selective cleavage of KDO-lipid A linkage yielded a [14C]-labeled product that partitioned during Bligh/Dyer extraction and migrated during thin-layer chromatography like lipid A. These findings suggest that the O-antigen capsule of Francisella contains a covalently linked and structurally distinct lipid A species. The presence of a discrete lipid A-like molecule associated with capsule raises the possibility that Francisella selectively exploits lipid A structural heterogeneity to regulate synthesis, transport, and stable bacterial surface association of the O-antigen capsular layer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29672156>Ursodeoxycholic  protects against intestinal barrier breakdown by promoting enterocyte migration via EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.</a></h2><p>The intestinal barrier is often disrupted in disease states, and intestinal barrier failure leads to sepsis. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a bile  that may protect the intestinal barrier. We hypothesized that UDCA would protect the intestinal epithelium in injury models. To test this hypothesis, we utilized an in vitro wound-healing assay and a mouse model of intestinal barrier injury. We found that UDCA stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration in vitro, and this migration was blocked by inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or ERK. Furthermore, UDCA stimulated both COX-2 induction and EGFR phosphorylation. In vivo UDCA protected the intestinal barrier from LPS-induced injury as measured by FITC dextran leakage into the serum. Using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine injections, we found that UDCA stimulated intestinal epithelial cell migration in these animals. These effects were blocked with either administration of Rofecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, or in EGFR-dominant negative Velvet mice, wherein UDCA had no effect on LPS-induced injury. Finally, we found increased COX-2 and phosphorylated ERK levels in LPS animals also treated with UDCA. Taken together, these data suggest that UDCA can stimulate intestinal epithelial cell migration and protect against acute intestinal injury via an EGFR- and COX-2-dependent mechanism. UDCA may be an effective treatment to prevent the early onset of gut-origin sepsis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  stimulates intestinal epithelial cell migration after cellular injury and also protects the intestinal barrier in an acute rodent injury model, neither of which has been previously reported. These effects are dependent on epidermal growth factor receptor activation and downstream cyclooxygenase 2 upregulation in the small intestine. This provides a potential treatment for acute, gut-origin sepsis as seen in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27127878>FXR agonists enhance the sensitivity of biliary tract cancer cells to cisplatin via SHP dependent inhibition of Bcl-xL expression.</a></h2><p>Chemoresistance is common in patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) including gallbladder cancer (GBC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Therefore, it is necessary to identify effective chemotherapeutic agents for BTC. In the present study, we for the first time tested the effect of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists GW4064 and CDCA (chenodeoxycholic ) in combination with cisplatin (CDDP) on increasing the chemosensitivity in BTC. Our results show that co-treatment of CDDP with FXR agonists remarkably enhance chemosensitivity of BTC cells. Mechanistically, we found that activation of FXR induced expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP), which in turn inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and resulted in down-regulation of Bcl-xL expression in BTC cells, leading to increased susceptibility to CDDP. Moreover, the experiments on tumor-bearing mice showed that GW4064/CDDP co-treatment inhibited the tumor growth in vivo by up-regulating SHP expression and down-regulating STAT3 phosphorylation. These results suggest CDDP in combination with FXR agonists could be a potential new therapeutic strategy for BTC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28219198>[Effects and mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic  on isoprenaline-Induced myocardial fibrosis in mice].</a></h2><p> To investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on myocardial fibrosis in mice.  To observe the expression of transforming growth factor(TGF) -β1, CTGF, MMPs and the degree of myocardial fibrosis, 61 male Kunming mice were randomly divided into normal group, low dose UDCA group, high dose of UDCA group, spironolactone group, and the control group.Isoproterenol (ISO) injection was given subcutaneously (30 d) to make the model of myocardial fibrosis.Corresponding anti-fibrosis drugs (UDCA or spironolactone) were given by gavage.HE staining and Masson staining were performed to explore the  and fibrosis in the myocardium.The expression of collagen Ⅰ and collagen Ⅲ protein was detected by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the degree of fibrosis among the groups.Western blot was used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor, (TGF)-β1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-4, -1 and anti-phospho-NFKBIA (p-IκB-α) inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) protein in myocardium.  HE and Masson staining results showed that in the normal group, myocardial fibrosis is less, while the control group showed a large amount of fibrotic tissue (<0.05). Tissue fibrosis in the low/high dose UDCA group and spironolactone group was significantly reduced compared with the control group (<0.05), in which high dose of UDCA reduces fibrosis more significantly.Immunohistochemistry results showed that collagen Ⅰ and collagen Ⅲ protein expression was significantly increased (<0.05). Whereas in the low/high UDCA dose group and spironolactone group, collagen Ⅰ and collagen Ⅲ expression were significantly decreased (<0.05), the high UDCA dose group decreased more significantly.Western blot results suggest that TGFβ-1 expression in the myocardial tissue was significantly increased compared to the normal group (<0.05), whereas low/high UDCA dose group and spironolactone group, TGFβ-1 protein expression were significantly decreased [UDCA(1.52±0.16), (1.02±0.12), (1.01±0.21)vs (2.73±0.12), <0.05], in which high UDCA dose group TGFβ-1 protein expression level decreased more significantly.However, there was no significant difference in the expression of CTGF, MMP2/9 and TIMP1/4 protein among the groups (>0.05). UDCA decrease p-IκB-α expression and increase IκB protein expression dose-dependently.  UDCA can relieve isoproterenol induced myocardial fibrosis and reduce the myocardial collagen Ⅰ and collagen Ⅲ deposition in a dose dependent manner.Down-regulating of TGFβ-1 protein expression through the inhibition of TGR5-NF-κB signal transduction pathway might be a potential mechanism underlying UDCA's effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26188168>Chenodeoxycholic , an endogenous FXR ligand alters adipokines and reverses insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue secretes adipokines that regulate insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and other peripheral tissues critical to glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance is associated with severe alterations in adipokines characterized by release of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue. The role of Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation on adipokines in relation to adipose tissue  and insulin resistance is not completely explored. For the first time, we have evaluated the ability of Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an endogenous FXR ligand, in restoring the disturbance in adipokine secretion and insulin resistance in palmitate treated 3T3-L1 cells and adipose tissues of High fat diet (HFD) rats. CDCA suppressed several of the tested pro-inflammatory adipokines (TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, Chemerin, PAI, RBP4, resistin, vaspin), and enhanced the major anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing adipokines (adiponectin, leptin). CDCA suppressed the activation of critical inflammatory regulators such as NF-κB and IKKβ which are activated by palmitate treatment in differentiated cells and HFD in rats. We show the altered adipokines in insulin resistance, its association with inflammatory regulators, and the role of CDCA in amelioration of insulin resistance by modulation of adipokines.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Male Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with tauroursodeoxycholic  (400 mg/kg) or saline solution, once per day for 3 days before surgery, and then the model of hepatic I/R injury was established. Blood and liver samples were collected from each group at 3, 6, and 24 h after surgery. Liver pathological changes, liver function, hepatocyte apoptosis and proinflammatory factors were detected. KCs were extracted, cultured and treated with TUDCA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then viability and phagocytosis were examined. Additionally, IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity and AML cell apoptosis were detected. The results showed that TUDCA alleviated hepatic I/R injury, the level of liver function markers, and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effects of KCs were suppressed by down-regulating IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vivo. TUDCA dose-dependently suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors and IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway activity in vitro, consistent with the in vivo results. Therefore, TUDCA can effectively alleviate hepatic IR injury by down-regulating the activity of the IRE1α/TRAF2/NF-κB pathway to suppress the function of KCs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We investigated the chronic effects of UDCA on age-related lipid homeostasis and underlying molecular mechanisms. Twenty-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were fed a diet with or without 0.3% UDCA supplementation for 25 weeks. UDCA significantly reduced weight gain, adiposity, hepatic triglyceride, and hepatic cholesterol without incidental hepatic injury. UDCA-mediated hepatic triglyceride reduction was associated with downregulated hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and of other genes involved in lipogenesis (Chrebp, Acaca, Fasn, Scd1, and Me1) and fatty  uptake (Ldlr, Cd36). The inflammatory cytokines Tnfa, Ccl2, and Il6 were significantly decreased in liver and/or white adipose tissues of UDCA-fed mice. These data suggest that UDCA exerts beneficial effects on age-related metabolic disorders by lowering the hepatic lipid accumulation, while concurrently reducing hepatocyte and adipocyte susceptibility to inflammatory stimuli.

We demonstrate evidence supporting the cellular origin of BM from reprograming or transcommitment of resident normal esophageal squamous (NES) epithelial cells in response to  and bile (A + B) exposure using an in vitro cell culture model. The hTERT-immortalized NES cell line NES-B10T was exposed 5 min/day to an A + B mixture for 30 wk. Morphological changes, mRNA, and protein expression levels for the inflammatory marker cyclooxygenase-2; the lineage-determining transcription factors TAp63 (squamous), CDX2, and SOX9 (both columnar); and the columnar lineage markers Villin, Muc-2, CK8, and mAb Das-1 (incomplete phenotype of intestinal metaplasia) were assessed every 10 wk. Markers of columnar lineage and  increased progressively, while squamous lineage-determining transcriptional factors were significantly decreased both at the mRNA and/or protein level in the NES-B10T cells at/after A + B treatment for 30 wk. Distinct modifications in morphological features were only observed at/after 30 wk of A + B exposure. These changes acquired by the NES-B10T 30-wk cells were retained even after cessation of A + B exposure for at least 3 wk. This study provides evidence that chronic exposure to the physiological components of gastric refluxate leads to repression of the discernable squamous transcriptional factors and activation of latent columnar transcriptional factors. This reflects the alteration in lineage commitment of the precursor-like biphenotypic, NES-B10T cells in response to A + B exposure as the possible origin of BM from the resident NES cells. This study provides evidence of the origins of Barrett's metaplasia from lineage transcommitment of resident esophageal cells after chronic exposure to gastroesophageal refluxate. The preterminal progenitor-like squamous cells alter their differentiation and develop biphenotypic characteristics, expressing markers of incomplete-type columnar metaplasia.

However, the role of BA in white adipocyte  remains somewhat obscure. It was the aim to investigate the BA receptors (FXR, TGR5) and FGFR1 (Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) as well as Bsep (bile salt export pump) in white adipocytes and in murine and human adipose tissue (AT) and to investigate effects of different BA species in adipocyte .Receptor mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR in mice, humans and during 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation. Adipokines were measured by ELISA upon stimulation by several BA. Effects of BA on TNF- and LPS-induced MCP-1 secretion and lipolysis were analyzed. TNF-induced lipolysis was investigated by glycerol assay.The present data provide for the first time a detailed expression profile of FXR, TGR5, FGFR1, and Bsep during adipocyte differentiation and in murine and human AT. FGFR1 expression is upregulated in adipose tissue of LPS-injected animals. Several BA regulate secretion of adipokines such as adiponectin and resistin differentially. Importantly, TNF- and LPS-induced MCP-1 release from adipocytes as well as TNF-induced lipolysis can be antagonized by cholic  (CA) and  (DCA).The present data provide evidence of functional BA signaling pathways in adipocytes and argue for certain MCP-1 related anti-inflammatory effects of BA in TNF- and LPS-induced inflammation, whereas pro-inflammatory resistin is induced by CA and glycocholic  (GCA).

The present study further examined the relationship between brain MAPK signaling, ER stress, and sympathetic excitation in HF. Sham-operated (Sham) and HF rats received a 4-wk intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of vehicle (Veh) or the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA, 10 μg/day). Lower mRNA levels of the ER stress biomarkers GRP78, ATF6, ATF4, and XBP-1s in the SFO and PVN of TUDCA-treated HF rats validated the efficacy of the TUDCA dose. The elevated levels of phosphorylated p44/42 and p38 MAPK in SFO and PVN of Veh-treated HF rats, compared with Sham rats, were significantly reduced in TUDCA-treated HF rats as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Plasma norepinephrine levels were higher in Veh-treated HF rats, compared with Veh-treated Sham rats, and were significantly lower in the TUDCA-treated HF rats. TUDCA-treated HF rats also had lower mRNA levels for angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and NF-κB p65, and a higher mRNA level of IκB-α, in the SFO and PVN than Veh-treated HF rats.

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal  and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver  was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27630169>Galectin-3 regulates inflammasome activation in cholestatic liver injury.</a></h2><p>Macrophage activation is an important feature of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) pathogenesis and other cholestatic liver diseases. Galectin-3 (Gal3), a pleiotropic lectin, is produced by monocytic cells and macrophages. However, its role in PBC has not been addressed. We hypothesized that Gal3 is a key to induce NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages and in turn to propagate proinflammatory IL-17 signaling. In liver tissues from patients with PBC and dnTGF-βRII mice, a model of autoimmune cholangitis, the expression of Gal3, NLRP3, and the adaptor protein adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein was induced, with the downstream activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β. In wild-type hepatic macrophages,  induced the association of Gal3 and NLRP3 with direct activation of the inflammasome, resulting in an increase in IL-1β. Downstream retinoid-related orphan receptor C mRNA, IL-17A, and IL-17F were induced. In Gal3 macrophages, no inflammasome activation was detected. To confirm the key role of Gal3 in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury, we generated dnTGF-βRII/galectin-3 (dn/Gal3) mice, which showed impaired inflammasome activation along with significantly improved  and fibrosis. Taken together, our data point to a novel role of Gal3 as an initiator of inflammatory signaling in autoimmune cholangitis, mediating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and inducing IL-17 proinflammatory cascades. These studies provide a rationale to target Gal3 in autoimmune cholangitis and potentially other cholestatic diseases.-Tian, J., Yang, G., Chen, H.-Y., Hsu, D. K., Tomilov, A., Olson, K.

The bile -FXR interaction regulates bile  synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile -FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal , and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic  (6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic , 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), clinical disease was ameliorated by (i) suppressing lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (iii) increasing CD8(+) T cells and PD1, PDl-1, and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447434>Alterations in melatonin and 5-HT signalling in the colonic mucosa of mice with dextran-sodium sulfate-induced colitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by pain, bleeding, cramping and altered gastrointestinal (GI) function. Changes in mucosal 5-HT (serotonin) signalling occur in animal models of colitis and in humans suffering from IBD. Melatonin is co-released with 5-HT from the mucosa and has a wide variety of actions in the GI tract. Here, we examined how melatonin signalling is affected by colitis and determined how this relates to 5-HT signalling.Using electroanalytical approaches, we investigated how 5-HT release, reuptake and availability as well as melatonin availability are altered in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Studies were conducted to explore if melatonin treatment during active colitis could reduce the severity of colitis.We observed an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in melatonin availability in DSS-induced colitis. A significant reduction in 5-HT reuptake was observed in DSS-induced colitis animals. A reduction in the content of 5-HT was observed, but no difference in tryptophan levels were observed. A reduction in -stimulated 5-HT availability and a significant reduction in mechanically-stimulated 5-HT and melatonin availability were observed in DSS-induced colitis. Orally or rectally administered melatonin once colitis was established did not significantly suppress .Our data suggest that DSS-induced colitis results in a reduction in melatonin availability and an increase in 5-HT availability, due to a reduction/loss of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 enzyme, 5-HT content and 5-HT transporters. Mechanosensory release was more susceptible to  when compared with chemosensory release.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26381899>RAGE siRNA-mediated gene silencing provides cardioprotection against ventricular arrhythmias in acute ischemia and reperfusion.</a></h2><p>Expression of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is suggested to play a crucial role in mediating cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury, and the blockade of RAGE signaling has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IR-induced cardiac damage. In this study, we primarily investigated the effects of RAGE suppression particularly on IR-induced ventricular arrhythmia. To inhibit the IR-induced upregulation of RAGE, siRNA targeting RAGE (siRAGE) was delivered to myocardium by using -modified polyethylenimine (PEI-DA) as a non-viral gene carrier. The resultant PEI-DA/siRAGE nanocomplexes successfully silenced the expression of RAGE and attenuated the  and apoptosis in the ischemic-reperfused myocardium. According to our results, the electrophysiological properties (e.g., action potential propagation, action potential duration, and conduction velocity), disrupted by IR injury, were restored to normal level and the induction of ventricular tachycardia was abolished by RAGE silencing. We further found that RAGE suppression led to the activation of Wnt signaling, followed by the expression of gap junction protein, connexin43. Thus it could be concluded that successful siRAGE delivery is protective against IR-induced ventricular arrhythmia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Through systematic literature review, we identified nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) including 964 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, comparing vitamin E, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pentoxifylline, or obeticholic  to one another or placebo. The primary outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in ballooning degeneration, lobular , and steatosis. We reported relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05-1.00) and obeticholic  (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic  over placebo in improving ballooning degeneration. All four interventions seemed to have at least moderate-quality evidence over placebo to improve steatosis. Moderate-quality evidence supports that TZDs, pentoxifylline, and obeticholic  decrease lobular . All the head-to-head comparisons were supported by very-low-quality evidence except for superiority of TZDs over vitamin E on improving steatosis and lobular , which had moderate-quality evidence.Based on direct and network meta-analysis, pentoxifylline and obeticholic  improve fibrosis, and vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic  improve ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH.

Dysbiosis is associated with intestinal tumorigenesis.  (DCA), a secondary bile  increased by a western diet, correlates with intestinal carcinogenesis. However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal microbiota and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal microbiota was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier, gut low grade  and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal microbiota from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced  and recruited M2 phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal microbiota transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover, microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development. Our study demonstrated that alteration of the microbial community induced by DCA promoted intestinal carcinogenesis.© 2017 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351391>The bile acids,  and ursodeoxycholic , regulate colonic epithelial wound healing.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelium constitutes an innate barrier which, upon injury, undergoes self-repair processes known as restitution. Although bile acids are known as important regulators of epithelial function in health and disease, their effects on wound healing processes are not yet clear. Here we set out to investigate the effects of the colonic bile acids,  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), on epithelial restitution. Wound healing in T cell monolayers grown on transparent, permeable supports was assessed over 48 h with or without bile acids. Cell migration was measured in Boyden chambers. mRNA and protein expression were measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. DCA (50-150 µM) significantly inhibited wound closure in cultured epithelial monolayers and attenuated cell migration in Boyden chamber assays. DCA also induced nuclear accumulation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), whereas an FXR agonist, GW4064 (10 µM), inhibited wound closure. Both DCA and GW4064 attenuated the expression of CFTR Cl channels, whereas inhibition of CFTR activity with either CFTR--172 (10 µM) or GlyH-101 (25 µM) also prevented wound healing. Promoter/reporter assays revealed that FXR-induced downregulation of CFTR is mediated at the transcriptional level. In contrast, UDCA (50-150 µM) enhanced wound healing in vitro and prevented the effects of DCA. Finally, DCA inhibited and UDCA promoted mucosal healing in an in vivo mouse model. In conclusion, these studies suggest bile acids are important regulators of epithelial wound healing and are therefore good targets for development of new drugs to modulate intestinal barrier function in disease treatment. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The secondary bile , , inhibits colonic epithelial wound healing, an effect which appears to be mediated by activation of the nuclear bile  receptor, FXR, with subsequent downregulation of CFTR expression and activity.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic  and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects.

Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and  will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

PBC is characterized by portal  and immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts in liver histology and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies in the serum of nearly 95% of patients. In 5% to 20% of patients an overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is diagnosed. Ursodeoxycholic  is widely accepted as the standard medical treatment.A total of 204 patients with PBC or PBC/AIH were retrospectively analyzed with regard to their clinical, biochemical, serological, and histologic features. PBC was diagnosed on the basis of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria. Specific PBC scores, such as the MRS, the European and the Yale model, as well as nonspecific scores such as the Child-Pugh, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease, and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index score were analyzed for their utility to predict the clinical outcome of patients.One hundred eighty-four patients with PBC alone and 20 with primary biliary cirrhosis/autoimmune hepatitis overlap were followed up for an average of 7.0 (range, 0.5 to 33.2) years. Importantly, baseline values of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, as well as antimitochondrial antibodies titers did not allow in properly predicting patient's outcome. The MRS proved clinical applicability. Patients with an R-value <6 did not develop liver-related complications. The Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet Ratio Index score had a significant correlation with the histologic degree of liver fibrosis, with limited value of scores between 1.0 and 1.5. Patients with a Model for End-stage Liver Disease score ≥8 (n=17) had a significantly higher risk to undergo liver transplantation or liver-related death. Outcome was less favorable than predicted by the European model. All scores showed low positive predictive values, limiting their applicability in clinical practice.Herein, we demonstrate that clinical risk scores in PBC should be interpreted with care. The MRS proved to be helpful to predict a favorable outcome.

The bile  conjugate tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in different animal models of stroke and neurological diseases. We have previously shown that TUDCA has anti-inflammatory effects on glial cell cultures and in a mouse model of acute neuroinflammation. We show now that microglial cells (central nervous system resident macrophages) express the G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1/Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (GPBAR1/TGR5) in vivo and in vitro. TUDCA binding to GPBAR1/TGR5 caused an increase in intracellular cAMP levels in microglia that induced anti-inflammatory markers, while reducing pro-inflammatory ones. This anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA was inhibited by small interference RNA for GPBAR1/TGR5 receptor, as well as by treatment with a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. In the mouse model of acute neuroinflammation, treating the animals with TUDCA was clearly anti-inflammatory. TUDCA biased the microglial phenotype in vivo and in vitro toward the anti-inflammatory. The bile  receptor GPBAR1/TGR5 could be a new therapeutic target for pathologies coursing with neuroinflammation and microglia activation, such as traumatic brain injuries, stroke, or neurodegenerative diseases. TUDCA and other GPBAR1/TGR5 agonists need to be further investigated, to determine their potential in attenuating the neuropathologies associated with microglia activation. J. Cell.

We have previously shown the anti-inflammatory properties of TUDCA in an animal model of acute neuroinflammation. Here, we present a new anti-inflammatory mechanism of TUDCA through the regulation of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway. The bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected intravenously (iv) on TGFβ reporter mice (Smad-binding element (SBE)/Tk-Luc) to study in their brains the real-time activation profile of the TGFβ pathway in a non-invasive way. The activation of the TGFβ pathway in the brain of SBE/Tk-Luc mice increased 24 h after LPS injection, compared to control animals. This activation peak increased further in mice treated with both LPS and TUDCA than in mice treated with LPS only. The enhanced TGFβ activation in mice treated with LPS and TUDCA correlated with both an increase in TGFβ3 transcript in mouse brain and an increase in TGFβ3 immunoreactivity in microglia/macrophages, endothelial cells, and neurons. Inhibition of the TGFβ receptor with SB431542 drug reverted the effect of TUDCA on microglia/macrophages activation and on TGFβ3 immunoreactivity. Under inflammatory conditions, treatment with TUDCA enhanced further the activation of TGFβ pathway in mouse brain and increased the expression of TGFβ3. Therefore, the induction of TGFβ3 by TUDCA might act as a positive feedback, increasing the initial activation of the TGFβ pathway by the inflammatory stimulus. Our findings provide proof-of-concept that TGFβ contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect of TUDCA under neuroinflammatory conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31384531>Ablation of gut microbiota alleviates obesity-induced hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance by modulating bile  metabolism in hamsters.</a></h2><p>Since metabolic process differs between humans and mice, studies were performed in hamsters, which are generally considered to be a more appropriate animal model for studies of obesity-related metabolic disorders. The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and  accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal  (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice.

Clinical trials investigating the impact of UDCA treatment on glycemic markers were searched in PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases (from inception to April 16, 2018). A random-effects model and generic inverse variance method were used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. A weighted random-effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential confounders on glycemic parameters. Meta-analysis of seven studies comprising eight treatment arms revealed a significant reduction of fasting glucose levels following UDCA therapy (WMD: -3.30 mg/dL, 95% CI: -6.36, -0.24, p = 0.034; I = 28.95%). Also, meta-analysis of two treatment arms indicated a significant reduction of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentrations (WMD: -0.41% mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.81, -0.01, p = 0.042; I = 0%).

However, the detection is obstructed by the low contents, structural diversity, high structural similarity, and matrix interference. Herein, a fast cholamine-derivatization, within 1 min at room temperature, coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach was developed to determine LCFFAs in complex samples. After derivatization, the ionization and separation efficiency were significantly improved, which resulted in up to 2000-fold increase of sensitivity compared with non-derivatization method, and the limits of detection were at low femtogram level. As well, this approach was applied successfully in the rapid profiling or quantification of targeted and non-targeted LCFFAs in the sera of healthy human and asthma patients. The targeted metabolomics method showed that the contents of 17 PUFAs were significantly changed in asthma patients, especially hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (HPETEs) and prostaglandins (PGs). The non-targeted method resulted in the tentatively identification of 35 LCFFAs including 31 saturated and mono-unsaturated LCFFAs, and 4 bile acids, except for 27 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and the multivariate analysis indicated that eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), ursodeoxycholic , , isodeoxycholic , palmitic , 2-lauroleic  and lauric  also have significant difference between healthy and asthma groups except for 17 PUFAs.

Aim of the present study was to investigate whether the positive effects of OCA treatment are apparent also on ongoing bleomycin-induced PF, i.e., after 2 weeks of bleomycin administration.Bleomycin-induced PF rats were treated 2 weeks after bleomycin administration with OCA or pirfenidone for two additional weeks. Pulmonary function test was performed at 2 and 4 weeks in all experimental groups. At the same time points, lung morphological features and mRNA expression profile of genes related to fibrosis,  and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were also assessed.After 2 weeks, bleomycin significantly increased the pressure at the airway opening (PAO), a functional parameter related to fibrosis-induced lung stiffness, and induced diffuse lung interstitium fibrosis, with upregulation of  (IL1β, MCP1) and tissue remodeling (COL1A1, COL3A1, ET1, MMP7, PDGFa, αSMA, SNAI1) markers. At week four, a further increase of lung fibrosis and PAO was observed, accompanied by upregulation of extracellular matrix-related mRNA expression. OCA administration, even after the establishment of PF, significantly improved pulmonary function, normalizing PAO, and reverted the bleomycin-induced lung alterations, with significant reduction of markers of  (CD206, COX2, HIF1, IL1β, MCP1), epithelial proliferation (CTGF, PDGFa) and fibrosis (COL1A1, COL3A1, ET1, FN1, MMPs, αSMA, SNAIs, TGFβ1, TIMPs).

Experiments in rodents with trained exercise have shown that exercise improves vascular function and reduces vascular  by modulating the balance between nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. However, the upstream regulator of exercise-induced vascular benefits is unclear. We aimed to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) in exercise-induced vascular functional improvement. We show that PPARδ is a crucial mediator for exercise to exert a beneficial effect on the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice. In db/db mice and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise restored endothelium-dependent vasodilation of aortas and flow-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric resistance arteries, whereas genetic ablation of Ppard abolished such improvements. Exercise induces AMPK activation and subsequent PPARδ activation, which help to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, thus increasing NO bioavailability in endothelial cells and vascular tissues. Chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric  and tauroursodeoxycholic  decrease ER stress and protect against endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mice. The results demonstrate that PPARδ-mediated inhibition of ER stress contributes to the vascular benefits of exercise and provides potentially effective targets for treating diabetic vasculopathy.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25523099>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  and ursodeoxycholic  have an additive effect in attenuating diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress into liver cirrhosis; however, no definite treatment is available. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (omega-3) has been reported to alleviate experimental NASH, although its beneficial effect was not evident when tested clinically. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the additive effect of omega-3 and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on diet-induced NASH in mice. C57BL/6 mice were given a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks, at which point the mice were divided into three groups and fed HFD alone, HFD with omega-3 or HFD with omega-3 in combination with UDCA for another 24 weeks. Feeding mice an HFD and administering omega-3 improved histologically assessed liver fibrosis, and UDCA in combination with omega-3 further attenuated this disease. The assessment of collagen α1(I) expression agreed with the histological evaluation. Omega-3 in combination with UDCA resulted in a significant attenuation of  whereas administering omega-3 alone failed to improve histologically assessed liver . Quantitative analysis of tumor necrosis factor α showed an additive effect of omega-3 and UDCA on liver . HFD-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation was attenuated by omega-3 and adding UDCA accentuated this effect. In accordance with this result, the expression of sterol regulatory binding protein-1c decreased after omega-3 administration and adding UDCA further diminished SREBP-1c expression. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which may reflect oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, was suppressed by omega-3 administration and adding UDCA further attenuated iNOS expression. These results demonstrated an additive effect of omega-3 and UDCA for alleviating fibrosis,  and steatosis in diet-induced NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027487>Effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  on PUFA levels and  in an animal and cell model of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Rats were divided into control, tunicamycin (TM)-treated, and TM + tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA)-treated groups. Hepatic ER stress was induced by TM and the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA was injected 30 min before induction of ER stress. Liver THLE-3 cells were treated with TM and TUDCA was administered in advance to decrease cytotoxic effects. Necroinflammation was evaluated in liver sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein. Arachidonic  (C20:4n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3) in liver tissue and THLE-3 cells were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured in tissue and cell samples. Hepatic ER stress was accomplished by TM and was alleviated by TUDCA. TM treatment significantly decreased PUFAs in both liver and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. PLA2, COX, and PGE2 levels were significantly increased in TM-treated rats and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. TUDCA leads to a partial restoration of liver PUFA levels and decreased PLA2, COX, and PGE2. This study reports decreased PUFA levels in ER stress and supports the use of omega-3 fatty acids in liver diseases demonstrating ER stress.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26609171>Inactivation of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Reduces Bile /Farnesoid X Receptor Expression through Fxr gene CpG Methylation in Mouse Colon Tumors and Human Colon Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) regulates bile  (BA) metabolism and possesses tumor suppressor functions. FXR expression is reduced in colorectal tumors of subjects carrying inactivated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Identifying the mechanisms responsible for this reduction may offer new molecular targets for colon cancer prevention.We investigated how APC inactivation influences the regulation of FXR expression in colonic mucosal cells. We hypothesized that APC inactivation would epigenetically repress nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (FXR gene name) expression through increased CpG methylation.Normal proximal colonic mucosa and normal-appearing adjacent colonic mucosa and colon tumors were collected from wild-type C57BL/6J and Apc-deficient (Apc(Min) (/+)) male mice, respectively. The expression of Fxr, ileal bile -binding protein (Ibabp), small heterodimer partner (Shp), and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In both normal and adjacent colonic mucosa and colon tumors, we measured CpG methylation of Fxr in bisulfonated genomic DNA. In vitro, we measured the impact of APC inactivation and  (DCA) treatment on FXR expression in human colon cancer HCT-116 cells transfected with silencing RNA for APC and HT-29 cells carrying inactivated APC.In Apc(Min) (/+) mice, constitutive CpG methylation of the Fxrα3/4 promoter was linked to reduced (60-90%) baseline Fxr, Ibabp, and Shp and increased Cox-2 expression in apparently normal adjacent mucosa and colon tumors. Apc knockdown in HCT-116 cells increased cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) and lowered (∼50%) FXR expression, which was further reduced (∼80%) by DCA. In human HCT-116 but not HT-29 colon cancer cells, DCA induced FXR expression and lowered CpG methylation of FXR.We conclude that the loss of APC function favors the silencing of FXR expression through CpG hypermethylation in mouse colonic mucosa and human colon cells, leading to reduced expression of downstream targets (SHP, IBABP) involved in BA homeostasis while increasing the expression of factors (COX-2, c-MYC) that contribute to  and colon cancer.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924062>Chenodeoxycholic  activates NLRP3 inflammasome and contributes to cholestatic liver fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver contributes to cholestatic liver injury.  induced by excessive bile acids is believed to play a crucial role, however, the mechanisms of bile acids triggered inflammatory response remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating liver  and fibrosis. In this study, we for the first time showed that chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), the major hydrophobic primary bile  involved in cholestatic liver injury, could dose-dependently induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-1β in macrophages by promoting ROS production and K+ efflux. Mechanistically, CDCA triggered ROS formation in part through TGR5/EGFR downstream signaling, including protein kinase B, extracellular regulated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Meanwhile, CDCA also induced ATP release from macrophages which subsequently causes K+ efflux via P2X7 receptor. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically decreased mature IL-1β level of liver tissue and ameliorated liver fibrosis in bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model. In conclusion, excessive CDCA may represent an endogenous danger signal to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate liver  during cholestasis. Our finding offers a mechanistic basis to ameliorate cholestatic liver fibrosis by targeting inflammasome activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239660>Ocular anti-inflammatory activity of prednisolone acetate loaded chitosan-deoxycholate self-assembled nanoparticles.</a></h2><p> Conventional topical ophthalmic aqueous solutions and suspensions are often associated with low bioavailability and high administration frequency, pulsatile dose and poor exposure to certain ocular parts. The aim of this study was to develop an ophthalmic nanoparticles loaded gel, for delivering prednisolone acetate (PA), to increase dosing accuracy, bioavailability, and accordingly, efficiency of PA in treating inflammatory ocular diseases.  A novel formulation of self-assembled nanoparticles was prepared by the complexation of chitosan (CS) and, the counter-ion, sodium deoxycholate (SD), loaded with the poorly-water-soluble PA. Particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading content (LC) of prepared nanoparticles were assessed. Moreover, the nanoparticles were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug release and eye anti-inflammatory potential of the prepared novel formulation was investigated.  Mean particle size of the nanoparticles have dropped from 976 nm ±43 (PDI 1.285) to 480 nm ±28 (PDI 1.396) when the ratio of CS-SD was decreased. The incorporation of 0.1-0.3% of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), in the preparation stages, resulted in smaller nanoparticles: 462 nm ±19 (PDI 0.942) and 321 nm ±22 (PDI 0.454) respectively. DSC and FTIR results demonstrated the interaction between CS and SD, however, no interactions were detected between PA and CS or SD. Drug release of PA as received, in simulated tears fluid (pH 7.4), showed a twofold increase (reaching an average of 98.6% in 24 hours) when incorporated into an optimized nanoparticle gel formulation (1:5 CS-SD).  The anti-inflammatory effect of PA nanoparticles loaded gel on female guinea pig eyes was significantly superior to that of the micronized drug loaded gel ( < 0.05).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28982586>Molecular cloning and characterization of farnesoid X receptor from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and the effect of dietary CDCA on the expression of inflammatory genes in intestine and spleen.</a></h2><p>In the present study, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was cloned and characterized from liver of large yellow croaker (L crocea) and the effects of dietary chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), a nature ligand of FXR, on the inflammatory genes expression in the intestine and spleen of large yellow croaker were investigated. Multiple alignments showed that FXR of large yellow croaker contained highly conserved DNA-binding domain and ligand binding domain compared with other species. The subcellular localization analysis showed that FXR-GFP fusion protein could target to the nucleus in HEK 293t. The tissue specific results demonstrated that FXR was highly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney of large yellow croaker. In addition, dietary soybean oil decreased the expression of FXR and IL-10 and significantly increased the expression of the pro-inflammatory genes in the intestine or spleen, such as TNFα, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, while the supplementation of CDCA could partly reverse these effects.

We hypothesized that the plasma metabolome of asthma would reveal metabolic consequences of the specific immune and inflammatory responses unique to endotypes of asthma. The plasma metabolomic profiles of 20 asthmatic subjects and 10 healthy controls were examined using an untargeted global and focused metabolomic analysis. Individuals were classified based on clinical definitions of asthma severity or by levels of fraction of exhaled NO (FENO), a biomarker of airway . Of the 293 biochemicals identified in the plasma, 25 were significantly different among asthma and healthy controls (p < 0.05). Plasma levels of taurine, lathosterol, bile acids (taurocholate and glycodeoxycholate), nicotinamide, and adenosine-5-phosphate were significantly higher in asthmatics compared with healthy controls. Severe asthmatics had biochemical changes related to steroid and amino /protein metabolism. Asthmatics with high FENO, compared with those with low FENO, had higher levels of plasma branched-chain amino acids and bile acids. Asthmatics have a unique plasma metabolome that distinguishes them from healthy controls and points to activation of inflammatory and immune pathways. The severe asthmatic and high FENO asthmatic have unique endotypes that suggest changes in NO-associated taurine transport and bile  metabolism.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29959134>Glycyrrhizin Alleviates Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis via Modulating Bile Acids and Meta-.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that may ultimately lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer, and there are few therapeutic options for its treatment. Glycyrrhizin (GL), extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine liquorice, has potent hepatoprotective effects in both preclinical animal models and in humans. However, little is currently known about its effects and mechanisms in treating NASH. To explore the effects of GL on NASH, GL or its active metabolite glycyrrhetinic  (GA) was administered to mice treated with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model, and histologic and biochemical analyses were used to measure the degree of lipid disruption, liver , and fibrosis. GL significantly improved MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, , and fibrosis and inhibited activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. GL significantly attenuated serum bile  accumulation in MCD diet-fed mice partially by restoring -mediated hepatic farnesoid X receptor inhibition. In Raw 264.7 macrophage cells, both GL and GA inhibited -induced NLRP3 inflammasome-associated . Notably, both intraperitoneal injection of GL's active metabolite GA and oral administration of GL prevented NASH in mice, indicating that GL may attenuate NASH via its active metabolite GA. These results reveal that GL, via restoration of bile  homeostasis and inhibition of inflammatory injury, can be a therapeutic option for treatment of NASH.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28892150>Hepatic  caused by dysregulated bile  synthesis is reversible by butyrate supplementation.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated bile  (BA) synthesis or reduced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) levels are found in patients having metabolic diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, and liver cirrhosis or cancer. The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes, microbiota profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice. Microbiota transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

The LBP is designed as an anti-inflammatory peptide based on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding domain of HMGB-1. In vitro cytokine assays show that LBP reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting LPS. PEI-DA is synthesized as the gene carrier by conjugation of  to low-molecular weight polyethylenimine (2 kDa, PEI2k).

The ternary complex of an HO-1 plasmid (pHO-1), PEI-DA, and LBP is prepared as a combinational system to deliver the therapeutic gene and peptide. The transfection efficiency of the ternary complex is higher than that of the pHO-1/PEI-DA binary complex. The ternary complex also reduces TNF-α secretion in LPS-activated Raw264.7 macrophage cells. Administration of the ternary complex into the lungs of an animal ALI model by intratracheal injection induces HO-1 expression and reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines more efficiently than the pHO-1/PEI-DA binary complex or LBP alone. In addition, the ternary complex reduces inflammation in the lungs. Therefore, the pHO-1/PEI-DA/LBP ternary complex may be an effective treatment for ALI.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here we examined whether increasing cholesterol solubility with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) affects vascular CC formation and ultimately atherosclerotic lesion development. UDCA mediated intracellular CC dissolution in macrophages and reduced IL-1β production. In ApoE(-/-) mice, UDCA treatment not only impaired atherosclerotic plaque development but also mediated regression of established vascular lesions. Importantly, mice treated with UDCA had decreased CC-depositions in atherosclerotic plaques compared to controls.

An efficient and stereospecific enzymatic synthesis of 1β-OH-DCA was developed using a Bacillus megaterium (BM3) cytochrome P450 (P450) mutant, and its structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A [(2)H4]-labeled analog of 1β-OH-DCA was also prepared. The major hydroxylated metabolite of  (DCA) in human liver microsomal incubations was identified as 1β-OH-DCA by comparison with the synthesized reference analyzed by UPLC-HRMS. Its formation was strongly inhibited by CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole. Screening of 21 recombinant human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes showed that, with the exception of extrahepatic CYP46A1, the most abundant liver P450 subfamily CYP3A, including CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7, specifically catalyzed 1β-OH-DCA formation. This indicated that 1β-hydroxylation of DCA may be a useful marker reaction for CYP3A activity in vitro. The metabolic pathways of DCA and 1β-OH-DCA in human hepatocytes were predominantly via glycine and, to a lesser extent, via taurine and sulfate conjugation. The potential utility of 1β-hydroxylation of DCA as a urinary CYP3A biomarker was illustrated by comparing the ratio of 1β-OH-DCA:DCA in a pooled spot urine sample from six healthy control subjects to a sample from one patient treated with carbamazepine, a potent CYP3A inducer; 1β-OH-DCA:DCA was considerably higher in the patient versus controls (ratio 2.8 vs. 0.4).

Furthermore, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of UDCA-LPE were studied on primary hepatic stellate cells (HSC) incubated with supernatant from LPS±UDCA-LPE treated RAW264.7 cells.UDCA-LPE ameliorated LPS-induced increase of IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β, NOX-2 in the GalN/LPS model by up to 80.2% for IL-6. Similarly, UDCA-LPE markedly decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and TGF-β as well as the chemokines MCP1 and RANTES in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Anti-inflammatory effects were also observed in primary murine Kupffer cells. Mechanistic evaluation revealed a reversion of LPS-activated pro-inflammatory TLR4 pathway by UDCA-LPE. Moreover, UDCA-LPE inhibited iNOS and NOX-2 expression while activating eNOS via phosphorylation of AKT and pERK1/2 in RAW264.7 cells. HSC treated with conditioned medium from LPS±UDCA-LPE RAW264.7 cells showed lower fibrogenic activation due to less SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, reduced expression of profibrogenic CTGF and reduced pro-inflammatory chemokine expression.In the setting of endotoxin-mediated liver , UDCA-LPE exerts profound anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effect implying a promising potential for the drug candidate as an experimental approach for the treatment of acute and chronic liver diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631480>In vitro activity of two amphotericin B formulations against Malassezia furfur strains recovered from patients with bloodstream infections.</a></h2><p>Although guidelines for the treatment of Malassezia furfur fungemia are not yet defined, clinical data suggest that amphotericin B (AmB) is effective for treating systemic infections. In the absence of clinical breakpoints for Malassezia yeasts, epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs) are useful to discriminate between isolates with and without drug resistance. This study aimed to compare the distribution of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the ECVs for AmB of both deoxycholate (d-AmB) and liposomal (l-AmB) formulations of M. furfur isolates. The 84 M. furfur strains analyzed, which included 56 from blood, sterile sites and catheters, and 28 from skin, were isolated from patients with bloodstream infections. MICs were determined by the modified broth microdilution method of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The l-AmB MIC and the ECVs were two-fold lower than those of d-AmB and a lower l-AmB mean MIC value was found for blood isolates than from skin. The ECVs for l-AmB and d-AmB were 8 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively. Three strains (3.6%) showed l-AmB MIC higher than ECV (MIC > 8 mg/l) of which two were isolated from the catheter tip of patients treated with micafugin, l-Amb and fluconazole, and one from skin. The results showed that the l-AmB might be employed for assessing the in vitro antifungal susceptibility of M. furfur by a modified CLSI protocol and that ECVs might be useful for detecting the emergence of resistance.© The Author 2015.

A bile salt, chenodeoxycholate sodium salt (Na-CDC), used as an absorption enhancer at a 125-mg dose, together with a 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone provided 24% rectal absorption of ceftriaxone and a maximal plasma concentration of 21 µg/ml with good tolerance in human subjects.

The reduced liver injury in BDL rats by swertianlarin treatment for 14 days was further confirmed by liver histopathology. Levels of serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were decreased by swertianlarin in BDL rats for 3 and 7 days (P < 0.05). Moreover, reductions in serum interleukins IL-1β and IL-6 levels were also observed in BDL rats treated with swertianlarin (P < 0.05). In addition, most of serum toxic bile salt concentrations (e.g., chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (DCA)) in cholestatic rats were decreased by swertianlarin (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the data suggest that swertianlarin derived from Swertia mussotii Franch attenuates liver injury, , and cholestasis in bile duct-ligated rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249255>Nor-Ursodeoxycholic  as a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Cholestatic and Metabolic Liver Diseases.</a></h2><p>Norursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA) is a side-chain-shortened derivative of ursodeoxycholic  with relative resistance to amidation, which enables its cholehepatic shunting. Based on its specific pharmacologic properties, norUDCA is a promising drug for a range of cholestatic liver and bile duct disorders. Recently, norUDCA has been successfully tested clinically in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as first application in patients. Moreover, hepatic enrichment of norUDCA facilitates direct therapeutic effects on both parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells, thereby counteracting cholestasis, steatosis, hepatic  and fibrosis, inhibiting hepatocellular proliferation, and promoting autophagy. This may open its therapeutic use to other non-cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases. This review article is a summary of a lecture given at the XXIV International Bile  Meeting (Falk Symposium 203) on "Bile Acids in Health and Disease" held in Düsseldorf, on June 17-18, 2016 and summarizes the recent progress of norUDCA as novel therapeutic approach in cholestatic and metabolic liver disorders with a specific focus on PSC.© 2017 S.

Additionally, it acts as a cell protector with unclear mechanism but may be implicated in combating against inflammation, fibrosis and cancers. FXR is thus accepted as a promising target particularly for the enterohepatic diseases, and numerous FXR modulators have been patented and developed.This review provides an update on the development of FXR modulators for enterohepatic diseases and offers an in-depth perspective on new strategies for the development of novel FXR modulators.Despite the development of numerous FXR modulators, which culminated in the successful launch of obeticholic  (OCA), it remains a matter of debate on how the  of FXR should be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The improvement for obesity achieved by either FXR agonists or antagonists is still in confusion. Whether the side effect of pruritus induced by OCA could be exempted for non-steroidal FXR agonists needs further validation. Apart from the development of conventional FXR ligands, emerging evidence support that restoration of FXR protein level may represent a new strategy in targeting FXR for enterohepatic and metabolic diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555>Tauroursodeoxycholic  inhibits intestinal inflammation and  disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile -based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal  , intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses, obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal   by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical . The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal  , decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26499839>Administration of tauroursodeoxycholic  enhances osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and bone regeneration.</a></h2><p>It is known that osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be promoted by suppression of adipogenesis of MSCs. We have recently found that the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) significantly reduces adipogenesis of MSCs. In the present study, we examined whether TUDCA can promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) by regulating Integrin 5 (ITGA5) associated with activation of ERK1/2 signal pathway and thereby enhance bone tissue regeneration by reducing apoptosis and the inflammatory response. TUDCA treatment promoted in vitro osteogenic differentiation of BMMSCs and in vivo bone tissue regeneration in a calvarial defect model, as confirmed by micro-computed tomography, histological staining, and immunohistochemistry for osteocalcin. In addition, TUDCA treatment significantly decreased apoptosis and the inflammatory response in vivo and in vitro, which is important to enhance bone tissue regeneration. These results indicate that TUDCA plays a critical role in enhancing osteogenesis of BMMSCs, and is therefore a potential alternative drug for bone tissue regeneration.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we determined the in vivo contribution of EGFRtk and ER stress in acute myocardial infarction induced by acute ischemia (40 min)-reperfusion (24 h) (I/R) injury in T2D (db/db) mice. We treated db/db mice with EGFRtk inhibitor (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Mice were then subjected to myocardial I/R injury. The db/db mice developed a significant infarct after I/R injury. The inhibition of EGFRtk significantly reduced the infarct size and ER stress induction. We also determined that the inhibition of ER stress (tauroursodeoxycholic , TUDCA, 150 mg/kg per day) in db/db significantly decrease the infarct size indicating that ER stress is a downstream mechanism to EGFRtk. Moreover, AG1478 and TUDCA reduced myocardium p38 and ERK1/2 MAP-kinases activity, and increased the activity of the pro-survival signaling cascade Akt. Additionally, the inhibition of EGFRtk and ER stress reduced cell apoptosis and the  as indicated by the reduction in macrophages and neutrophil infiltration. We determined for the first time that the inhibition of EGFRtk protects T2D heart against I/R injury through ER stress-dependent mechanism. The cardioprotective effect of EGFRtk and ER stress inhibition involves the activation of survival pathway, and inhibition of apoptosis, and . Thus, targeting EGFRtk and ER stress has the potential for therapy to overcome myocardial infarction in T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29692610>Preparation, characterization and systemic application of self-assembled hydroxyethyl starch nanoparticles-loaded flavonoid Morin for hyperuricemia therapy.</a></h2><p>Morin, one of the most widely distributed flavonoids in plants, has been identified as a potent antihyperuricemic agent. Its poor water solubility and fast in vivo clearance, however, have limited its application in the treatment of hyperuricemia. In this study, a novel amphiphilic polymer (hydroxyethyl starch- [HES-DOCA]) was synthesized to overcome these limitations.HES-DOCA conjugates with various substitution degrees were prepared by chemical grafting DOCA to HES through ester formation. The structures of the conjugates were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and H-NMR. Physicochemical characterizations of HES-DOCA nanoparticles-loaded Morin (Morin/HES-DOCA-NPs) were studied using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vitro release studies were performed to evaluate the release properties of Morin from the NPs. Subsequently, in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters of Morin/HES-DOCA-NPs were investigated in Wistar rats through intravenous administration (2 mg/kg, equivalent to Morin). Antihyperuricemic efficacy of the NPs was evaluated in a rat hyperuricemic model.The optimized HES-based amphiphilic polymer contained approximately 10 DOCA groups per 100 anhydroglucose units of HES, which can spontaneously self-assemble to form spherical NPs as demonstrated by TEM images. Morin/HES-DOCA-NPs were monodispersed (polydispersity index = 0.05) with a mean diameter of 197 nm and exhibited a zeta potential of -14 mV. The use of DOCA as the polymer's hydrophobic segment enabled high drug loading efficiency (15.6%). After systemic administration, Morin/HES-DOCA-NPs exhibited significantly longer half-life and higher systemic exposure (elimination half-life and area under the plasma concentration-time curve) compared with free drug Morin. In a rat hyperuricemic model, treatment with Morin/HES-DOCA-NPs demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy over Morin in decreasing serum uric  level, increasing the uricosuric action, as well as attenuating hyperuricemia-associated  in kidney of rats.Collectively, these findings suggest that the novel HES-based NP formulation of Morin may have great potential for clinical treatment of hyperuricemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408609>Microbiota-Derived Metabolic Factors Reduce Campylobacteriosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Campylobacter jejuni, a prevalent foodborne bacterial pathogen, exploits the host innate response to induce colitis. Little is known about the roles of microbiota in C jejuni-induced intestinal . We investigated interactions between microbiota and intestinal cells during C jejuni infection of mice.Germ-free C57BL/6 Il10 mice were colonized with conventional microbiota and infected with a single dose of C jejuni (10 colony-forming units/mouse) via gavage. Conventional microbiota were cultured under aerobic, microaerobic, or anaerobic conditions and orally transplanted into germ-free Il10 mice. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. Fecal microbiota and bile acids were analyzed with 16S sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively.Introduction of conventional microbiota reduced C jejuni-induced colitis in previously germ-free Il10 mice, independent of fecal load of C jejuni, accompanied by reduced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin. Microbiota transplantation and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing experiments showed that Clostridium XI, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were enriched in fecal samples from mice colonized with microbiota cultured in anaerobic conditions (which reduce colitis) compared with mice fed microbiota cultured under aerobic conditions (susceptible to colitis). Oral administration to mice of microbiota-derived secondary bile  sodium deoxycholate, but not ursodeoxycholic  or lithocholic , reduced C jejuni-induced colitis. Depletion of secondary bile -producing bacteria with antibiotics that kill anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin) promoted C jejuni-induced colitis in specific pathogen-free Il10 mice compared with the nonspecific antibiotic nalidixic ; colitis induction by antibiotics was associated with reduced level of luminal deoxycholate.We identified a mechanism by which the microbiota controls susceptibility to C jejuni infection in mice, via bacteria-derived secondary bile acids.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress,  and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is an endogenous anti-apoptotic bile  with potent neuroprotective properties in several experimental models of AD. We have previously reported the therapeutic efficacy of TUDCA treatment before amyloid plaque deposition in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of TUDCA when administrated after the onset of amyloid pathology. APP/PS1 transgenic mice with 7 months of age were injected intraperitoneally with TUDCA (500 mg/kg) every 3 days for 3 months. TUDCA treatment significantly attenuated Aβ deposition in the brain, with a concomitant decrease in Aβ₁₋₄₀ and Aβ₁₋₄₂ levels. The amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein was also reduced, indicating that TUDCA interferes with Aβ production. In addition, TUDCA abrogated GSK3β hyperactivity, which is highly implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation and glial activation. This effect was likely dependent on the specific activation of the upstream kinase, Akt. Finally, TUDCA treatment decreased glial activation and reduced proinflammatory cytokine messenger RNA expression, while partially rescuing synaptic loss. Overall, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising therapeutic strategy not only for prevention but also for treatment of AD after disease onset.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This raises the possibility that bile acids may cause lung injury by damaging airway epithelium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bile  challenge using the immortalised human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). The immortalised human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) was cultured. A 48-h challenge evaluated the effect of individual primary and secondary bile acids. Post-challenge concentrations of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were measured using commercial ELISA kits.

A side-chain shorted derivative of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is 24 nor-ursodeoxycholic  (NorUDCA) and it represents a new class of drugs for treatment of liver diseases. NorUDCA has unique biochemical and therapeutic properties, since it is relatively resistant to conjugation with glycine or taurine compared to UDCA. NorUDCA undergoes cholehepatic shunting, resulting in ductular targeting, bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis, and cholangiocyte protection. Furthermore, it showed anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-lipotoxic properties in several animal models. As such, NorUDCA is a promising new approach in the treatment of cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases.

FXR activation has also been demonstrated to suppress the inflammatory response and to promote lung repair after lung injury. This study investigated the protective effects of OCA treatment (3 or 10mg/kg/day) on , tissue remodeling and fibrosis in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis rat model. Effects of OCA treatment on morphological and molecular alterations of the lung, as well as remodeling of the alveoli and the right ventricle were also evaluated. Lung function was assessed by measuring airway resistance to inflation. In the acute phase (7days), bleomycin promoted an initial thickening and fibrosis of the lung interstitium, with upregulation of genes related to epithelial proliferation, tissue remodeling and hypoxia. At 28days, an evident increase in the deposition of collagen in the lungs was observed. This excessive deposition was accompanied by an upregulation of transcripts related to the extracellular matrix (TGFβ1, SNAI1 and SNAI2), indicating lung fibrosis. Administration of OCA protected against bleomycin-induced lung damage by suppressing molecular mechanisms related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),  and collagen deposition, with a dose-dependent reduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6, as well as TGF-β1 and SNAI1 expression. Pirfenidone, a recently approved treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), significantly counteracted bleomycin-induced pro-fibrotic genes expression, but did not exert significant effects on IL-1β and IL-6. OCA treatment in bleomycin-challenged rats also improved pulmonary function, by effectively normalizing airway resistance to inflation and lung stiffness in vivo. Results with OCA were similar, or even superior, to those obtained with pirfenidone. In conclusion, our results suggest an important protective effect of OCA against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by blunting critical mediators in the pathogenesis of IPF.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Resveratrol (RSV) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are safe representatives of natural and synthetic antioxidants, respectively.The objective of this study was to evaluate protective effects of RSV and NAC, compared with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), on experimental NAFLD.NAFLD was induced by feeding rats a methionine choline-deficient diet (MCDD) for four cycles, each of 4 d of MCDD feeding and 3 d of fasting. Animals were divided into normal control, steatosis control, and five treatment groups, receiving UDCA (25 mg/kg/d), RSV (10 mg/kg/d), NAC (20 mg/kg/d), UDCA + RSV, and UDCA + NAC orally for 28 d.

PH results from increased resistance to portal blood flow through the cirrhotic liver. This is caused by two mechanisms: (a) distortion of the liver vascular architecture and (b) hepatic microvascular dysfunction. Increment in hepatic resistance is latterly accompanied by splanchnic vasodilation, which further aggravates PH. Hepatic microvascular dysfunction occurs early in the course of chronic liver disease as a consequence of  and oxidative stress and determines loss of the normal phenotype of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). The cross-talk between LSEC and hepatic stellate cells induces activation of the latter, which in turn proliferate, migrate and increase collagen deposition around the sinusoids, contributing to fibrogenesis, architectural disruption and angiogenesis. Therapy for PH aims at correcting these pathophysiological abnormalities: liver injury, fibrogenesis, increased hepatic vascular tone and splanchnic vasodilatation. Continuing liver injury may be counteracted specifically by etiological treatments, while architectural disruption and fibrosis can be ameliorated by a variety of anti-fibrogenic drugs and anti-angiogenic strategies. Sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction is ameliorated by statins and other drugs increasing NO availability. Splanchnic hyperemia can be counteracted by non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs), vasopressin analogs and somatostatin analogs. Future treatment of portal hypertension will evolve to use etiological treatments together with anti-fibrotic agents and/or drugs improving microvascular function in initial stages of cirrhosis (pre-primary prophylaxis), while NSBBs will be added in advanced stages of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28665991>Anti-inflammatory effects of ursodeoxycholic  by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 macrophages.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.We induced an inflammatory process in RAW 264.7 macrophages using LPS. The anti-inflammatory effects of UDCA on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were analyzed using nitric oxide (NO). Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways and nuclear factor kappa-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IκBα) signaling pathways were evaluated by western blot assays.UDCA decreased the LPS-stimulated release of the inflammatory mediator NO. UDCA also decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1-α (IL-1α), interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in mRNA and protein levels. In addition, UDCA increased an anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. UDCA inhibited the expression of inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, UDCA suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 signals related to inflammatory pathways. In addition, the phosphorylation of IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB, also inhibited by UDCA.UDCA inhibits the pro-inflammatory responses by LPS in RAW 264.7 macrophages. UDCA also suppresses the phosphorylation by LPS on ERK, JNK, and p38 in MAPKs and NF-κB pathway.

Accumulating evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a secondary bile  with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile  transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile  transporters apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile  transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile  homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile  transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile  homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis. Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental colitis, we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310532>Tauroursodeoxycholic  inhibits experimental colitis by preventing early intestinal epithelial cell death.</a></h2><p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by increased epithelial cell death and subsequent breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which perpetuates chronic intestinal . Since fecal bile  dysmetabolism is associated with UC and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) has been shown to improve murine colitis, we evaluated the effect of TUDCA on intestinal epithelial cell death in a mouse model of UC-like barrier dysfunction elicited by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). We identified the prevention of colonic caspase-3 induction, a key proapoptotic marker which was also over-activated in UC, as the earliest event resulting in a clear clinical benefit. Whereas vehicle-treated mice showed a cumulative mortality of 40%, all TUDCA-treated mice survived the DSS experiment during a 14-day follow-up period. In line with a barrier protective effect, TUDCA decreased bacterial translocation to the spleen and stimulated mucin production. Similarly, TUDCA inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal permeability and associated enterocyte apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect was confirmed in vitro by a dose-dependent inhibition of both receptor-dependent (using tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand) and receptor-independent (staurosporine) caspase-3 induction in HT29 colonic epithelial cells. These data imply that caspase-3 activation is an early marker of colitis that is prevented by TUDCA treatment. These data, together with the previously reported beneficial effect in colitis, suggest that TUDCA could be an add-on strategy to current immunosuppressive treatment of UC patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360029>Ursodeoxycholic  and lithocholic  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.</a></h2><p> Ursodeoxycholic  and lithocholic  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.  312: G550-G558, 2017. First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic  in vivo.

However, the benefits of inhibiting ER stress in the treatment of allergic airway disease are not well known. Herein, we tested the therapeutic potential of a chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), in combating allergic asthma, using a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway disease. TUDCA was administered during the HDM-challenge phase (preventive regimen), after the HDM-challenge phase (therapeutic regimen), or therapeutically during a subsequent HDM rechallenge (rechallenge regimen). In the preventive regimen, TUDCA significantly decreased HDM-induced , markers of ER stress, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and fibrosis. Similarly, in the therapeutic regimen, TUDCA administration efficiently decreased HDM-induced airway , mucus metaplasia, ER stress markers, and AHR, but not airway remodeling. Interestingly, TUDCA administered therapeutically in the HDM rechallenge regimen markedly attenuated HDM-induced airway , mucus metaplasia, ER stress markers, methacholine-induced AHR, and airway fibrotic remodeling. These results indicate that the inhibition of ER stress in the lungs through the administration of chemical chaperones could be a valuable strategy in the treatment of allergic airway diseases.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27468093>Obeticholic  for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease of the liver characterized by destruction and  of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The disease affects mainly women. The disease is often discovered through abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and is confirmed when anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are present. The etiology of PBC is poorly understood. Cigarette smoking, immune dysregulation, nail polish, urinary tract infections, and low socioeconomic status have been implicated but none have been confirmed. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have disclosed strong associations between certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and PBC. PBC can progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in up to 3.5% of PBC patients. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the only medication approved for the treatment of PBC. The use of UDCA in PBC delays histological progression and extends the transplant-free survival. 40% of PBC patients do not respond adequately to UDCA, and these patients are at high risk for serious complications. Therefore, there is a critical need for more effective therapies for this problematic disease. Multiple other agents have either been or are currently being studied as therapeutic options in UDCA non-responder PBC patients. Six-ethyl chenodeoxycholic  (6-ECDCA), a potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, has shown anti-cholestatic activity in rodent models of cholestasis. Obeticholic  (OCA, 6-ECDCA, or INT-747), a first-in-class FXR agonist, has been examined in PBC patients with inadequate response to UDCA, and shown promising results. Particularly, initial clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of OCA (in addition to UDCA) in PBC patients with inadequate response to UDCA led to significant reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP, an important prognostic marker in PBC). More recently, the results of a randomized clinical trial of OCA monotherapy in PBC reported significant reduction of ALP in the treatment group compared to placebo.This review covers the preclinical and clinical studies of OCA in PBC. In addition, other alternative therapies that are currently being examined in PBC patients will also be discussed in this review. A literature search was carried out using the PubMed database.If approved by the U.S. FDA, OCA will likely be an important alternative add-on therapy in PBC patients who have inadequate response to UDCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30666146>A pilot study of fecal bile  and microbiota profiles in inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to arise from an abnormal immune response to the gut microbiota. IBD is associated with altered intestinal microbial community structure and functionality, which may contribute to inflammation and complications such as colon cancer and liver disease. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is associated with IBD and markedly increases the risk of colon cancer. We hypothesized that secondary bile acids, which are products of microbial metabolism, are increased in PSC patients.Here, we profiled the fecal bile  composition and gut microbiota of participants with IBD and PSC, as well as healthy participants. Additionally, we tested the effects of vancomycin, a proposed treatment for PSC, on gut microbiota and fecal bile  composition in participants with IBD and PSC.Fecal samples were collected from patients with IBD, IBD/PSC and healthy controls and fecal bile acids and DNA for microbiota analysis were extracted. Fecal bile acids were averaged over a seven-day period. For subjects with IBD/PSC, oral vancomycin 500mg twice a day was administered and fecal samples were collected for up to eleven weeks.Participants with IBD and PSC had less fecal microbial diversity at baseline relative to controls. While there was some evidence of altered conversion of cholic  to , no substantial differences were found in the fecal bile  profiles of patients with IBD and PSC (n=7) compared to IBD alone (n=8) or healthy controls (n=8). Oral vancomycin was a potent inhibitor of secondary bile  production in participants with IBD and PSC, particularly , although no changes in liver biochemistry patterns were noted over a two week period.In this pilot study, bile  profiles were overall similar among patients with IBD and PSC, IBD alone, and healthy controls. Microbiota diversity was reduced in those with PSC and IBD compared to IBD alone or healthy controls.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27703259>Deficiency in Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) skews inflamed yet incompetent innate leukocytes in vivo during DSS-induced septic colitis.</a></h2><p>Functionally compromised neutrophils contribute to adverse clinical outcomes in patients with severe  and injury such as colitis and sepsis. However, the ontogeny of dysfunctional neutrophil during septic colitis remain poorly understood. We report that the dysfunctional neutrophil may be derived by the suppression of Toll-interacting-protein (Tollip). We observed that Tollip deficient neutrophils had compromised migratory capacity toward bacterial product fMLF due to reduced activity of AKT and reduction of FPR2, reduced potential to generate bacterial-killing neutrophil extra-cellular trap (NET), and compromised bacterial killing activity. On the other hand, Tollip deficient neutrophils had elevated levels of CCR5, responsible for their homing to sterile inflamed tissues. The inflamed and incompetent neutrophil phenotype was also observed in vivo in Tollip deficient mice subjected to DSS-induced colitis. We observed that TUDCA, a compound capable of restoring Tollip cellular function, can potently alleviate the severity of DSS-induced colitis. In humans, we observed significantly reduced Tollip levels in peripheral blood collected from human colitis patients as compared to blood samples from healthy donors. Collectively, our data reveal a novel mechanism in Tollip alteration that underlies the inflamed and incompetent polarization of neutrophils leading to severe outcomes of colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29874428>CANCERPREVENTIVE IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an actual problem today And it occurs 6 times more frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) than in healthy population.

There are no approved therapies for NASH; however, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonists are promising drug targets. We investigated the therapeutic effects of co-administration of a GLP-1R agonist, IP118, with FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) in mice.OCA and IP118 alone and in combination were sub-chronically administered to Lep/Lep mice with diet-induced NASH or diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Metabolic (body weight and glucose) and liver (biochemical and histological) endpoints were assessed. NASH severity in Lep/Lep mice was graded using a customized integrated scoring system.OCA reduced liver weight and lipid in NASH mice (both by -17%) but had no effect on plasma ALT or AST levels. In contrast, IP118 significantly reduced liver weight (-21%), liver lipid (-15%), ALT (-29%), and AST (-27%). The combination of OCA + IP118 further reduced liver weight (-29%), liver lipid (-22%), ALT (-39%), and AST (-36%). Combination therapy was superior to monotherapies in reducing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Hepatic improvements with IP118 and OCA + IP118 were associated with reduced body weight (-4.3% and -3.5% respectively) and improved glycemic control in OCA + IP118-treated mice. In DIO mice, OCA + IP118 co-administration reduced body weight (-25.3%) to a greater degree than IP118 alone (-12.5%) and further improved glucose tolerance and reduced hepatic lipid.Our data suggest a complementary or synergistic therapeutic effect of GLP-1R and FXR agonism in mouse models of metabolic disease and NASH.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced  inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29691718>Ursodeoxycholic  Inhibits Inflammatory Responses and Promotes Functional Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects by ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in rats with a spinal cord injury (SCI). A moderate mechanical compression injury was imposed on adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The post-injury locomotor functions were assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale and the tissue volume of the injured region was analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The pro-inflammatory factors were evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways related to inflammatory responses were measured by Western blot assays. UDCA improved the BBB scores and promoted the recovery of the spinal cord lesions. UDCA inhibited the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iba1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). UDCA decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines of TNF-α, interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the mRNA and protein levels. UDCA increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the mRNA and protein levels. UDCA suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and the p38 signals. UDCA reduces pro-inflammatory responses and promotes functional recovery in SCI in rats. These results suggest that UDCA is a potential therapeutic drug for SCI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29266628>Persistent reduction of mucosal-associated invariant T cells in primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells constitute a novel subset of innate-like T lymphocytes characterized by a semi-invariant T-cell receptor repertoire capable of recognizing bacterial products. Considering the abundance of MAIT cells in the liver and the possible association between bacterial infections and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), we aimed to analyze the involvement of MAIT cells in the immunopathogenesis of PBC.Peripheral blood and liver biopsy specimens were collected from 25 patients with PBC and 19 patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Surgically removed liver tissues distant from tumors in patients with metastatic liver tumors were used as controls. Mononuclear cells were separated using Ficoll gradient, and the expression of various markers was investigated by flow cytometry. Cytokine production was investigated using blood MAIT cells after stimulation by anti-CD3/CD28-coupled beads with/without interleukin-7 (IL-7).Mucosal-associated invariant T cells were significantly reduced in both the blood and liver of PBC patients compared with those in controls. MAIT cells in the blood of PBC patients expressed significantly lower levels of activation markers and IL-7 receptor. Moreover, MAIT cells in the blood of PBC patients showed impaired production of cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor alpha, after in vitro stimulation with IL-7. Interestingly, even after biochemical responses were achieved by ursodeoxycholic  treatment, the frequencies of MAIT cells did not fully recover to normal levels.These findings suggested that MAIT cells were activated, exhausted, and persistently depleted in PBC patients even after ursodeoxycholic  treatment, possibly as a consequence of persistent liver .© 2017 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26320013>Bile acids: emerging role in management of liver diseases.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are well known for their effects on cholesterol homeostasis and lipid digestion.

Its pathogenesis remains largely unknown, although frequent concomitant IBD hints towards common factors underlying gut and bile duct . Considering the mounting evidence on the involvement of the intestinal microbiota in initiating and determining IBD phenotype, we investigated intestinal microbiota composition in patients with PSC.Stool samples were collected from 147 individuals (52 patients with PSC, 52 age, gender and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers, 13 UC and 30 patients with Crohn's disease). An independent validation cohort of 14 PSC and 14 matched controls was recruited. 16S rDNA sequencing of faecal DNA was performed (Illumina MiSeq).The microbiota of patients with PSC was characterised by decreased microbiota diversity, and a significant overrepresentation of Enterococcus (p=3.76e-05), Fusobacterium (p=3.76e-05) and Lactobacillus (p=0.0002) genera. This dysbiosis was present in patients with PSC with and without concomitant IBD and was distinct from IBD, and independent of treatment with ursodeoxycholic . A decision tree based on abundances of these three genera allowed reliable classification in the validation cohort. In particular, one operational taxonomic unit belonging to the Enterococcus genus was associated with increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (p=0.048), a marker of disease severity.We here present the first report of PSC-associated faecal dysbiosis, independent from IBD signatures, suggesting the intestinal microbiota could be a contributing factor in PSC pathogenesis.

Recent studies indicate bile  composition between humans and rodents is dramatically different, as humans have a higher percent of glycine conjugated bile acids and increased chenodeoxycholate content, which increases the hydrophobicity index of bile acids. This increase may lead to direct toxicity that kills hepatocytes, and promotes . To address this issue, this study assessed how pathophysiological concentrations of bile acids measured in cholestatic patients affected primary human hepatocytes. Individual bile  levels were determined in serum and bile by UPLC/QTOFMS in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis with, or without, concurrent increases in serum transaminases. Bile  levels increased in serum of patients with liver injury, while biliary levels decreased, implicating infarction of the biliary tracts. To assess bile -induced toxicity in man, primary human hepatocytes were treated with relevant concentrations, derived from patient data, of the model bile  glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDC). Treatment with GCDC resulted in necrosis with no increase in apoptotic parameters. This was recapitulated by treatment with biliary bile  concentrations, but not serum concentrations. Marked elevations in serum full-length cytokeratin-18, high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), and acetylated HMGB1 confirmed inflammatory necrosis in injured patients; only modest elevations in caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 were observed. These data suggest human hepatocytes are more resistant to human-relevant bile acids than rodent hepatocytes, and die through necrosis when exposed to bile acids. These mechanisms of cholestasis in humans are fundamentally different to mechanisms observed in rodent models.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Treatment improved ileum expression of antimicrobial peptides, angiogenin-1 and alpha-5-defensin, tight junction proteins zonulin-1 and occludin, and reduced fecal albumin loss and liver fibrosis. Enteric bacterial load normalized, and the distinctive mucosal microbiota of cirrhosis was reduced. Gut immune cell infiltration was reduced and inflammatory cytokine and Toll-like receptor 4 expression normalized.In ascitic cirrhotic rats, obeticholic  reduces gut bacterial translocation via several complementary mechanisms at the intestinal level.

High-level fecal  (DCA) caused by HFD contributes to the colonic inflammatory injury of IBD; however, the mechanism concerning the initiation of inflammatory response by DCA remains unclear. In this study, we sought to investigate the role and mechanism of DCA in the induction of   promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here, we, for the first time, showed that DCA dose-dependently induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and highly pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-1β production in macrophages. Mechanistically, DCA-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting cathepsin B release at least partially through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2. Colorectal instillation of DCA significantly increased mature IL-1β level in colonic tissue and exacerbated DSS-induced colitis, while  blockage of NLRP3 inflammasome or macrophage depletion dramatically reduced the mature IL-1β production and ameliorated the aggravated inflammatory injury imposed by DCA.

Importantly, angiotensin II (AngII), independently of its vasoconstrictor action, causes β-cell  and dysfunction, which may be an early step in the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine how AngII causes β-cell dysfunction.

The mechanism of action of AngII was further investigated using isolated murine islets and clonal β cells. We show that AngII triggers ER stress, an increase in the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and promotes β-cell dysfunction in murine islets of Langerhans both in vivo and ex vivo. These effects were significantly attenuated by TUDCA, an inhibitor of ER stress. We also show that AngII-induced ER stress is required for the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and is caused by reactive oxygen species and IP3 receptor activation. These data reveal that the induction of ER stress is critical for AngII-induced β-cell dysfunction and indicates how therapies that promote ER homeostasis may be beneficial in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865854>Obeticholic  protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury and .</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays important roles in regulating bile  homeostasis.

In this study, we examined the protective effect of protease inhibitor aprotinin and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi) on pulmonary  in rats with severe pancreatitis-associated ALI.A rat model of acute pancreatitis (AP) was established by injecting sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDOC) into the pancreatic duct. Pharmacological interventions included pretreatment with a protease inhibitor aprotinin (10mg/kg) and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi, 100g/kg). The extent of pancreatic and lung injury and systemic  was assessed by examinations of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung tissue. Pancreatic or lung tissue edema was evaluated by tissue water content. Pulmonary arterial pressure and alveolar-capillary membrane permeability were evaluated post-injury via a catheter inserted into the pulmonary artery in an isolated, perfused lung model.Pre-treatment with aprotinin or MMPi significantly decreased amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the wet/dry weight ratio of the lung and pancreas in AP rats. Compared to the GDOC alone group, administration of aprotinin or MMPi prevented pancreatitis-induced IL-6 increases in the lung. Similarly, treatment with aprotinin or MMPi significantly decreased the accumulation of white blood cells, oxygen radicals, nitrite/nitrates in both blood and BAL, and markedly reduced lung permeability.Pretreatment with either aprotinin or MMPi attenuated the systemic  and reduced the severity of lung and pancreas injuries.

We investigated the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), an agonist of FXR, on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI in mice. Sixty male mice were randomly divided into six groups, and orally administered with or without OCA once daily for 3 consecutive days before LPS (1.0 mg/kg). Animals were sacrificed at 0 h, 2 h or 6 h after LPS. As expected, OCA enhanced pulmonary FXR activity. OCA prevented LPS-induced ALI. Additional experiment showed that OCA alleviated LPS-induced up-regulation of pulmonary pro-inflammatory and chemokine genes. Moreover, OCA also repressed LPS-induced the release of TNF-α and KC in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In contrast, OCA further up-regulated LPS-induced the expression of Il-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Further study showed that OCA inhibited LPS-evoked NF-κB signaling in the lungs. OCA attenuated LPS-induced ERK1/2, JNK, p38 and Akt phosphorylation in the lungs. Overall, these results suggest that OCA prevent LPS-induced ALI may be through enhancing pulmonary FXR activity and then blockading several inflammatory signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018.

In conclusion, QYT protects against DCA induced pancreatic acinar cell damage in ABP by inhibiting Gpbar1/NF-kB/p-RIP signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30223017>RNF186 impairs insulin sensitivity by inducing ER stress in mouse primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>RING finger 186 (RNF186) is involved in the process of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-mediated apoptosis and  of different cell types, such as HeLa cells and colon epithelial cells. However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018.

NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic  (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis,  and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in liver histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721575>Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperon Tauroursodeoxycholic  Attenuates Aldosterone-Infused Renal Injury.</a></h2><p>Aldosterone (Aldo) is critically involved in the development of renal injury via the production of reactive oxygen species and . Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is also evoked in Aldo-induced renal injury. In the present study, we investigated the role of ER stress in -mediated renal injury in Aldo-infused mice. C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive treatment for 4 weeks as follows: vehicle infusion, Aldo infusion, vehicle infusion plus tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), and Aldo infusion plus TUDCA. The effect of TUDCA on the Aldo-infused inflammatory response and renal injury was investigated using periodic -Schiff staining, real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. We demonstrate that Aldo leads to impaired renal function and inhibition of ER stress via TUDCA attenuates renal fibrosis. This was indicated by decreased collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, and TGF- expression, as well as the downregulation of the expression of Nlrp3 inflammasome markers, Nlrp3, ASC, IL-1, and IL-18. This paper presents an important role for ER stress on the renal inflammatory response to Aldo. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by TUDCA negatively regulates the levels of these inflammatory molecules in the context of Aldo.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860118>Association between serum soluble CD14 and IL-8 levels and clinical outcome in primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by portal  and immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts that often leads to liver decompensation and liver failure. Although the biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) can predict disease outcome in PBC, few biomarkers have been identified as prognostic tools applicable prior to UDCA treatment. We therefore sought to identify such indicators of long-term outcome in PBC in the Japanese population.The prebiopsy serum samples and subsequent clinical data of 136 patients with PBC treated with UDCA were analysed over a median follow-up period of 8.8 years. Serum levels of biomarkers related to microbial translocation (sCD14, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were measured along with those of 33 cytokines and chemokines and additional auto-antibodies. Associations between the tested parameters and the clinical outcomes of liver decompensation and liver-related death/liver transplantation were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model with stepwise methods and Kaplan-Meier analysis.Elevated levels of serum IL-8, and sCD14 before UDCA therapy were significantly associated with both liver decompensation and liver-related death/liver transplantation. In multivariate analyses, IL-8≥46.5 pg/mL or sCD14≥2.0 μg/mL at enrolment demonstrated the same results. Kaplan-Meier analysis also revealed IL-8 and sCD14 to be significantly associated with a poor outcome. sCD14 was significantly correlated with IL-8. EndoCAb and I-FABP were not related to disease outcome.Serum IL-8 and sCD14 levels before UDCA therapy represent noninvasive surrogate markers of prognosis in patients with PBC.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Typically, anionic drugs are incorporated within conductive polymers through electrostatic interaction with the positively charged polymer. Following this approach, the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone phosphate is often delivered from neural probes to reduce the inflammation of the surrounding tissue. In light of the recent literature on the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), for the first time, this natural bile  was incorporated within poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The new material, PEDOT-TUDCA, efficiently promoted an electrochemically controlled delivery of the drug, while preserving optimal electrochemical properties. Moreover, the low cytotoxicity observed with viability assays, makes PEDOT-TUDCA a good candidate for prolonging the time span of chronic neural recording brain implants.© 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Bile  dysregulation leads to intestinal dysbiosis, that allows enterogenous pathogenic bacteria, including Gram‑negative bacteria and their products lipopolysaccharide (LPS), into the liver via the portal vein, triggering inflammation in the liver. The inflammasome serves as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects pathogens or danger signals and mediates innate immunity in the liver or gut. Specifically, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains‑containing protein (NLRP)6 inflammasome maintains intestinal microbial balance, by promoting interleukin (IL)‑18‑dependent antimicrobial peptide synthesis and mucus secretion from goblet cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome, in contrast, primarily induces IL‑1β and aggravates inflammatory liver injury. Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome affects the epithelial integrity of cholangiocytes by inducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. In addition, bile acids, including  and chenodeoxycholic , are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages; however, bile acids have the potential to exert the opposite role by interacting with the membrane‑bound Takeda G‑protein receptor 5 or by activating nuclear farnesoid‑X receptor. Therefore, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammasome, involved in the gut‑liver axis, may provide important insights into the identification of a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of liver and gut diseases. The present review discusses the roles of the inflammasome in the gut‑liver axis, and the emerging associations between the inflammasome and the intestinal microbiota or the bile acids in the gut‑liver axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874313>New therapeutic perspectives in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is focused on restitution of metabolic derangement, weight loss and drugs able to improve steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis.
