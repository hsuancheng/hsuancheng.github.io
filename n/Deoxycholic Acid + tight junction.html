However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal   remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CDCA on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-impaired intestinal epithelial   and explore the underlying mechanisms. In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA reversed the LPS-induced increase in transepithelial electrical resistance and decrease in tight junction protein expression. In addition, we found that farnesoid X receptor (FXR) but not Takeda G-protein receptor 5 was responsible for the CDCA-improved epithelial   impaired by LPS. Furthermore, CDCA blocked LPS-induced activation of the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) pathway in a FXR-dependent manner and elicited similar effects to MLCK inhibition. In mice, CDCA supplementation restored LPS-induced elevation of intestinal permeability and MLCK expression and reduction of tight junction protein expression, thus alleviating LPS-induced intestinal  impairment. In conclusion, CDCA protected against the LPS-induced impairment of the intestinal epithelial   via the FXR-MLCK pathway.</p><p>Keyword: tight junction</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26595891>High-fat Diet-induced Intestinal Hyperpermeability is Associated with Increased Bile Acids in the Large Intestine of Mice.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome is characterized by low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, which is associated with intestinal hyperpermeability. This study examined the effects of 3 high-fat diets (HFDs) composed of different fat sources (soybean oil and lard) on the intestinal permeability, tight junction (TJ) protein expression, and cecal bile  (BA) concentrations in mice, and then analyzed their interrelations. C57/BL6 mice were fed the control diet, HFD (soybean oil), HFD (lard), and HFD (mix; containing equal concentrations of soybean oil and lard) for 8 wk. Glucose tolerance, intestinal permeability, TJ protein expression, and cecal BA concentration were evaluated. Feeding with the 3 HDFs similarly increased body weight, liver weight, and fat pad weight, and induced glucose intolerance and intestinal hyperpermeability. The expression of TJ proteins, zonula occludens-2 and junctional adhesion molecule-A, were lower in the colons of the 3 HFD groups than in the control group (P < 0.05), and these changes appeared to be related to intestinal hyperpermeability. Feeding with HFDs increased total secondary BA (SBA) and total BA concentrations along with increases in some individual BAs in the cecum. Significant positive correlations between intestinal permeability and the concentrations of most SBAs, such as  and ω-muricholic acids, were detected (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the HFD-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is associated with increased BA secretion. The abundance of SBAs in the large intestine may be responsible for the hyperpermeability.© 2015 Institute of Food Technologists®</p><p>Keyword: tight junction</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25592258>The FXR agonist obeticholic  prevents gut  dysfunction and bacterial translocation in cholestatic rats.</a></h2><p>Bacterial translocation (BTL) drives pathogenesis and complications of cirrhosis. Farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) is a key transcription regulator in hepatic and intestinal bile metabolism. We studied potential intestinal FXR dysfunction in a rat model of cholestatic liver injury and evaluated effects of obeticholic  (INT-747), an FXR agonist, on gut permeability, inflammation, and BTL. Rats were gavaged with INT-747 or vehicle during 10 days after bile-duct ligation and then were assessed for changes in gut permeability, BTL, and tight-junction protein expression, immune cell recruitment, and cytokine expression in ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Auxiliary in vitro BTL-mimicking experiments were performed with Transwell supports. Vehicle-treated bile duct-ligated rats exhibited decreased FXR pathway expression in both jejunum and ileum, in association with increased gut permeability through increased claudin-2 expression and related to local and systemic recruitment of natural killer cells resulting in increased interferon-γ expression and BTL. After INT-747 treatment, natural killer cells and interferon-γ expression markedly decreased, in association with normalized permeability selectively in ileum (up-regulated claudin-1 and occludin) and a significant reduction in BTL. In vitro, interferon-γ induced increased Escherichia coli translocation, which remained unaffected by INT-747. In experimental cholestasis, FXR agonism improved ileal   by attenuating intestinal inflammation, leading to reduced BTL and thus demonstrating a crucial protective role for FXR in the gut-liver axis.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The objective of the present investigation was to demonstrate the absorption mechanism of insulin in the physical complexation of deoxycholyl-l-lysyl-methylester (DCK) for oral delivery. The oral insulin/DCK complex was prepared by making a physical complex of insulin aspart with DCK through ion-pair interaction in water. For the cellular uptake study, fluorescein-labeled insulin or DCK were prepared according to a standard protocol and applied to Caco-2 or MDCK cell lines. For the PK/PD studies, we performed intrajejunal administration of different formulation of insulin/DCK complex to diabetic rats. The resulting insulin and DCK complex demonstrated greatly enhanced lipophilicity as well as increased permeation across Caco-2 monolayers. The immunofluorescence study revealed the distribution of the complex in the cytoplasm of Caco-2 cells. Moreover, in the apical sodium bile  transporter (ASBT) transfected MDCK, the insulin/DCK complex showed interaction with ASBT, and also demonstrated absorption through passive diffusion. We could not find that any evidence of endocytosis in relation to the uptake of insulin complex in vitro. In the rat intestine model, the highest absorption of insulin complex was observed in the jejunum at 1 h and then in the ileum at 2-4 h. In PK/PD study, the complex showed a similar PK profile to that of SC insulin. Overall, the study showed that the effect of DCK on enhancing the absorption of insulin resulted from transcellular processes as well as bile  transporter activity.</p><p>Keyword: tight junction</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554966>The Yin and Yang of bile  action on tight junctions in a model colonic epithelium.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal epithelial  loss due to tight junction (TJ) dysfunction and bile -induced diarrhea are common in patients with inflammatory diseases. Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ . We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative, lithocholic  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial  resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing  dysfunction, while LCA restores  integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

However, evidence relating to bile acids and intestinal tumorigenesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DCA on the intestinal mucosal  and its impact on the development of CRC. Here we showed that DCA disrupted cell monolayer integrity and increased proinflammatory cytokine production in intestinal cancer and precancerous cell lines (Caco-2 and IMCE). Apcmin/+ mice receiving DCA increased the number and size of intestinal adenomas and promoted the adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Importantly, DCA induced the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased the production of inflammatory cytokines, and led to intestinal low grade inflammation. A reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the number of intestinal cells including goblet cells and Paneth cells was also observed after DCA treatment. Moreover, DCA significantly reduced the level of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages in the intestine of Apcmin/+ mice. In conclusion, these data suggested that DCA induced intestinal low grade inflammation and disrupted the mucosal physical and functional barriers, aggravating intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><p>Keyword: tight junction</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268667>Ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates diabetic retinopathy via reducing retinal inflammation and reversing the breakdown of blood-retinal .</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the hydrolysis of tauroursodeoxycholic , which is the main ingredient from bear gall that has functions including clearing heat and detoxification, and improving eyesight. However, whether UDCA has improving effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) is not known. This study aims to observe the amelioration of UDCA on DR and its engaged mechanisms. The results of Evans blue permeation assay showed that UDCA (15, 30 mg/kg) reversed the breakdown of blood-retinal  (BRB) and the decreased expression of claudin-1 and claudin-19 in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reversed the reduced thickness of both inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced retinal ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression in STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA reduced the expression of phosphorylated the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK) and the nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in retinas from STZ-induced diabetic mice. UDCA also reduced retinal expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In conclusion, UDCA attenuates BRB breakdown during DR development via inhibiting retinal inflammation and reversing the reduced expression of tight junctions (TJs) including claudin-1 and claudin-19.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In light of this issue, an amphiphilic sulfhydrylated N--N,O-hydroxyethyl chitosan (TGA-DHC) was synthesized to improve the oral bioavailability of PTX. First, TGA-DHC demonstrated substantial loading of PTX into the inner hydrophobic core. A desirable enhancement in the bioavailability of PTX by TGA-DHC was verified by pharmacokinetic studies on rats against Taxol and non-sulfhydrylated DHC micelles. Moreover, cellular uptake studies revealed significant accumulation of TGA-DHC micelles encapsulating PTX or rhodamine-123 into Caco-2 cells via clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and inhibition of P-gp efflux of substrates. The results of the Caco-2 transport study further confirmed the mechanistic basis of TGA-DHC efficacy; which was attributed to permeabilized tight junctions, clathrin-mediated transcytosis across the endothelium, and inhibition of P-gp. Finally, in vitro mucoadhesion investigations on freshly excised rat intestine intuitively confirmed increased intestinal retention of drug-loaded TGA-DHC through thiol-mediated mucoadhesion. TGA-DHC has demonstrated the capability to overcome what is perhaps the most prominent  to oral PTX efficacy, low bioavailability, and serves as a prominent platform for oral delivery of P-gp substrates.</p><p>Keyword: tight junction</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555>Tauroursodeoxycholic  inhibits intestinal inflammation and  disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile -based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal  , intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses, obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal   by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical . The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal  , decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: tight junction</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26723896>Obeticholic  reduces bacterial translocation and inhibits intestinal inflammation in cirrhotic rats.</a></h2><p>In advanced cirrhosis, gut bacterial translocation is the consequence of intestinal  disruption and leads to bacterial infection. Bile  abnormalities in cirrhosis could play a role in the integrity of the intestinal  and the control of microbiota, mainly through the farnesoid X receptor. We investigated the long-term effects of the farnesoid X receptor agonist, obeticholic , on gut bacterial translocation, intestinal microbiota composition,  integrity and inflammation in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis with ascites.Cirrhotic rats received a 2-week course of obeticholic  or vehicle starting once ascites developed. We then determined: bacterial translocation by mesenteric lymph node culture, ileum expression of antimicrobial peptides and tight junction proteins by qPCR, fecal albumin loss, enteric bacterial load and microbiota composition by qPCR and pyrosequencing of ileum mucosa-attached contents, and intestinal inflammation by cytometry of the inflammatory infiltrate.Obeticholic  reduced bacterial translocation from 78.3% to 33.3% (p<0.01) and upregulated the expression of the farnesoid X receptor-associated gene small heterodimer partner. Treatment improved ileum expression of antimicrobial peptides, angiogenin-1 and alpha-5-defensin, tight junction proteins zonulin-1 and occludin, and reduced fecal albumin loss and liver fibrosis. Enteric bacterial load normalized, and the distinctive mucosal microbiota of cirrhosis was reduced. Gut immune cell infiltration was reduced and inflammatory cytokine and Toll-like receptor 4 expression normalized.In ascitic cirrhotic rats, obeticholic  reduces gut bacterial translocation via several complementary mechanisms at the intestinal level. This agent could be used as an alternative to antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection in cirrhosis.Copyright © 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.
