The present results demonstrated that UDCA could effectively inhibit the proliferation of two human melanoma cell line (M14 and A375) with time‑ and concentration‑dependence. Following exposure to various concentrations of UDCA, M14 cells exhibited typical morphological changes and weaker ability of colony forming. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that UDCA could induce a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in M14 cells. The cell cycle was arrested in the G2/M phase, which was confirmed by the decrease of cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 and cyclinB1 at the protein level. However, when M14 cells were treated with UDCA and Z‑VAD‑FMK (caspase inhibitor) synchronously, the apoptosis rate of the cells was reduced significantly. In addition, it was demonstrated that UDCA induced apoptosis of human melanoma M14 cells through the ROS‑triggered mitochondrial‑associated pathway, which was indicated by the increased expression of cleaved‑caspase‑3, cleaved‑caspase‑9, apoptotic protease activating factor‑1, cleaved‑poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 and the elevation of B cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) associated X protein/Bcl‑2 ratio associated with apoptosis. Therefore, UDCA may be a potential drug for the treatment of human melanoma.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608189>A novel, protective role of ursodeoxycholate in bile-induced pancreatic ductal injury.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) strongly inhibits pancreatic ductal HCO3 (-) secretion through the destruction of mitochondrial function, which may have significance in the pathomechanism of acute pancreatitis (AP). Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is known to protect the  against hydrophobic bile acids and has an ameliorating effect on cell death. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effect of UDCA pretreatment on CDCA-induced pancreatic ductal injury. Guinea pig intrainterlobular pancreatic ducts were isolated by collagenase digestion. Ducts were treated with UDCA for 5 and 24 h, and the effect of CDCA on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), intracellular pH (pHi), morphological and functional changes of , and the rate of apoptosis were investigated. AP was induced in rat by retrograde intraductal injection of CDCA (0.5%), and the disease severity of pancreatitis was assessed by measuring standard laboratory and histological parameters. Twenty-four-hour pretreatment of pancreatic ducts with 0.5 mM UDCA significantly reduced the rate of ATP depletion, mitochondrial injury, and cell death induced by 1 mM CDCA and completely prevented the inhibitory effect of CDCA on -base transporters. UDCA pretreatment had no effect on CDCA-induced Ca(2+) signaling. Oral administration of UDCA (250 mg/kg) markedly reduced the severity of CDCA-induced AP. Our results clearly demonstrate that UDCA 1) suppresses the CDCA-induced pancreatic ductal injury by reducing apoptosis and mitochondrial damage and 2) reduces the severity of CDCA-induced AP. The protective effect of UDCA against hydrophobic bile acids may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of biliary AP.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26901615>Emerging drugs for the treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune chronic disease of the liver that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It affects approximately 1 in 4,000 with a 10:1 female to male ratio. The diagnosis of PBC can be made based on serum antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in a patient with abnormally high serum alkaline phosphatase after ruling out other causes of cholestasis and biliary obstruction. Genome-wide association studies have revealed several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA risk loci in PBC, and complex environmental-host immunogenetic interactions are believed to underlie the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Fatigue and pruritus are the most common and often problematic symptoms; although often mild, these can be severe and life-alternating in a subset of patients. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PBC. Clinical trials have shown that UDCA significantly improves transplant-free survival. However, nearly 40% of PBC patients do not respond adequately to PBC and are at higher risk for serious complications when compared to PBC patients with complete response to UDCA.Here we provide a detailed discussion regarding novel therapeutic agents and potential areas for further investigation in PBC-related research.Results of ongoing clinical trials and emerging treatment paradigms for PBC will likely further improve medical management of this disorder in the near future.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843188>Critical Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia-Induced Deficits in Synaptic Plasticity and Long-Term Memory.</a></h2><p>This study examined the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mediating chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH)-induced neurocognitive deficits. We designed experiments to demonstrate that ER stress is initiated in the hippocampus under chronic IH and determined its role in apoptotic cell death, impaired synaptic structure and plasticity, and memory deficits.Two weeks of IH disrupted ER fine structure and upregulated ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein, in the hippocampus, which could be suppressed by ER stress inhibitors, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric . Meanwhile, ER stress induced apoptosis via decreased Bcl-2, promoted reactive oxygen species production, and increased malondialdehyde formation and protein carbonyl, as well as suppressed mitochondrial function. These effects were largely prevented by ER stress inhibitors. On the other hand, suppression of oxidative stress could reduce ER stress. In addition, the length of the synaptic active zone and number of mature spines were reduced by IH. Long-term recognition memory and spatial memory were also impaired, which was accompanied by reduced long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral pathway. These effects were prevented by coadministration of the TUDCA.These results show that ER stress plays a critical role in underlying memory deficits in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-associated IH. Attenuators of ER stress may serve as novel adjunct therapeutic agents for ameliorating OSA-induced neurocognitive impairment.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28916388>Differential effects of FXR or TGR5 activation in cholangiocarcinoma progression.</a></h2><p>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive tumor type affecting cholangiocytes. CCAs frequently arise under certain cholestatic liver conditions. Intrahepatic accumulation of bile acids may facilitate cocarcinogenic effects by triggering an inflammatory response and cholangiocyte proliferation. Here, the role of bile  receptors FXR and TGR5 in CCA progression was evaluated.FXR and TGR5 expression was determined in human CCA tissues and cell lines. An orthotopic model of CCA was established in immunodeficient mice and tumor volume was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging under chronic administration of the specific FXR or TGR5 agonists, obeticholic  (OCA) or INT-777 (0,03% in chow; Intercept Pharmaceuticals), respectively. Functional effects of FXR or TGR5 activation were evaluated on CCA cells in vitro.FXR was downregulated whereas TGR5 was upregulated in human CCA tissues compared to surrounding normal liver tissue. FXR expression correlated with tumor differentiation and TGR5 correlated with perineural invasion. TGR5 expression was higher in perihilar than in intrahepatic CCAs. In vitro, FXR was downregulated and TGR5 was upregulated in human CCA cells compared to normal human cholangiocytes. OCA halted CCA growth in vivo, whereas INT-777 showed no effect. In vitro, OCA inhibited CCA cell proliferation and migration which was associated with decreased mitochondrial energy metabolism. INT-777, by contrast, stimulated CCA cell proliferation and migration, linked to increased mitochondrial energy metabolism.Activation of FXR inhibits, whereas TGR5 activation may promote, CCA progression by regulating proliferation, migration and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Modulation of FXR or TGR5 activities may represent potential therapeutic strategies for CCA.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Melatonin, an indolamine synthesized in the pineal gland, shows a wide range of physiological functions, and is under clinical investigation for expanded applications. Melatonin has demonstrated efficient protective effects against various types of oxidative damage in the liver system. This study investigates the protective effects of melatonin pretreatment on glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA)-induced hepatotoxicity and elucidates the potential mechanism of melatonin-mediated protection. Melatonin markedly decreased mitochondrial ROS (mROS) production in L02 cells treated with 100 μM GCDCA, and inhibited GCDCA-stimulated cytotoxicity. Notably, melatonin exerted its hepatoprotective effects by upregulating sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) activity and its expression level, thus regulating superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) acetylation and inhibiting the production of mROS induced by GCDCA. Moreover, siRNA targeting SIRT3 blocked the melatonin-mediated elevation in mitochondrial function by inhibiting SIRT3/SOD2 signaling. Importantly, melatonin-activated SIRT3 activity was completely abolished by AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit (AMPK) siRNA transfection. Similar results were obtained in rat with bile duct ligation or BDL. In summary, our findings indicate that melatonin is a novel hepatoprotective small molecule that functions by elevating SIRT3, stimulating SOD2 activity, and suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress at least through AMPK, and that SIRT3 may be of therapeutic value in liver cell protection for GCDCA-induced hepatotoxicity.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702187>Solubilization conditions for bovine heart mitochondrial membranes allow selective purification of large quantities of respiratory complexes I, III, and V.</a></h2><p>Ascertaining the structure and functions of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes is essential to understanding the biological mechanisms of energy conversion; therefore, numerous studies have examined these complexes. A fundamental part of that research involves devising a method for purifying samples with good reproducibility; the samples obtained need to be stable and their constituents need to retain the same structure and functions they possess when in mitochondrial membranes. Submitochondrial bovine heart particles were isolated using differential centrifugation to adjust to a membrane concentration of 46.0% (w/v) or 31.5% (w/v) based on weight. After 0.7% (w/v) , 0.4% (w/v) decyl maltoside, and 7.2% (w/v) potassium chloride were added to the mitochondrial membranes, those membranes were solubilized. At a membrane concentration of 46%, complex V was selectively solubilized, whereas at a concentration of 31.5% (w/v), complexes I and III were solubilized. Two steps-sucrose density gradient centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography on a POROS HQ 20 μm column-enabled selective purification of samples that retained their structure and functions. These two steps enabled complexes I, III, and V to be purified in two days with a high yield. Complexes I, III, and V were stabilized with n-decyl-β-D-maltoside. A total of 200 mg-300 mg of those complexes from one bovine heart (1.1 kg muscle) was purified with good reproducibility, and the complexes retained the same functions they possessed while in mitochondrial membranes.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

(Fructus Psoraleae (FP)) have been widely used for the treatment of various skin diseases for hundred years. Recently, the emerging FP-induced toxic effects, especially hepatotoxicity, in clinic are getting the public's attention. However, its exact toxic components and mechanisms underlying remain unclear. Bavachin, one of flavonoids in FP, has been documented as a hepatotoxic substance, and the present study aimed to determine the toxicity caused by bavachin and the possible toxic mechanisms involved using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results showed that bavachin could significantly inhibited cell proliferation and trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent manner. Downregulating ER stress using tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) obvious attenuated bavachin-triggerd cell apoptosis. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of Mitofusion2 (Mfn2) resulted in a remarkable aggravation of ER stress through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Additionally, suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by ROS Scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cystein (NAC)) also reduced bavachin-induced ER stress. Taken together, our study demonstrated that bavachin-induced ER stress caused cell apoptosis by Mfn2-Akt pathway, and that ROS may participate upstream in this mechanism. Here, we not only provide a new understanding of ROS/Mfn2/Akt pathway in bavachin-induced cytotoxicity via the ER stress, but also identify a new specific intervention to prevent FP-induced hepatotoxicity in the future.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622747>[Ursodeoxycholic  induced apoptosis of human hepatoma cells HepG2 and SMMC-7721 bymitochondrial-mediated pathway].</a></h2><p>To explore the effects and underlying mechanisms of ursodeoxycholic  on human hepatoma cells.HepG2 and SMMC-7721 HCC cell lines were respectively treated with ursodeoxycholic .

For epitope-mapping, 29 overlapping peptides were used. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 33 PSC-patients and analysed for SO-induced proliferation, production of cytokines, and expression of the activation marker cluster of differentiation (CD) 69.43% of the 30 untreated and 26% of the 23 treated PSC-patients had IgG anti-SO-antibodies predominantly reacting with SO-fl, SO-I and SO-II. Antibody-reactivity decreased after UDCA-treatment. Prevalence and reactivity of anti-SO-antibodies were significantly higher in PSC than in patients with other hepatic and non-hepatic disorders. Epitope mapping revealed no distinct immuno-dominant regions within SO. Incubation of PBMC from PSC-patients (but not from controls) with SO-antigens revealed an activation of B-cells and a T-helper cell type-2 reaction pattern (production of interleukin [IL]-13, IL-10).PSC-patients show humoral and cellular immune response towards SO. Antibodies may be predominantly directed against conformational epitopes. SO enhances in vitro especially T-helper cell type-2 immune-reactions, which may be pro-fibrotic.

We have recently discovered that the endogenous bile  tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis and a neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, also enhances NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neuronal conversion by improving mitochondrial integrity and function of NSCs. In the present study, we explore the effect of TUDCA on regulation of NSC fate in neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using rat postnatal neurospheres and adult rats exposed to the bile . TUDCA significantly induced NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neural differentiation in the SVZ, without affecting DG-derived NSCs. More importantly, expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial antioxidant responses were significantly increased by TUDCA in SVZ-derived NSCs. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of TUDCA in adult rats markedly enhanced both NSC proliferation and early differentiation in SVZ regions, corroborating in vitro data.

Apoptosis induces cell death through mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is considered an irreversible step in apoptosis. Activation of MOMP to levels that fail to reach the apoptotic threshold may paradoxically promote cancer-a phenomenon called "Minority MOMP." We asked whether reflux-induced esophageal carcinogenesis occurred via minority MOMP and whether compensatory resistance mechanisms prevented cell death during this process. We exposed preneoplastic, hTERT-immortalized Barrett's cell, CP-C and CP-A, to the oncogenic bile ,  (DCA), for 1 year. Induction of minority MOMP was tested via comet assay, CyQuant, annexin V, JC-1, cytochrome C subcellular localization, caspase 3 activation, and immunoblots. We used bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3) profiling to test the mitochondrial apoptotic threshold. One-year exposure of Barrett's cells to DCA induced a malignant phenotype noted by clone and tumor formation. DCA promoted minority MOMP noted by minimal release of cytochrome C and limited caspase 3 activation, which resulted in DNA damage without apoptosis. Upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Mcl-1, ROS generation, and NF-κB activation occurred in conjunction with minority MOMP. Inhibition of ROS blocked minority MOMP and Mcl-1 upregulation. Knockdown of Mcl-1 shifted minority MOMP to complete MOMP as noted by dynamic BH3 profiling and increased apoptosis. Minority MOMP contributes to DCA induced carcinogenesis in preneoplastic BE.

The secosteroid stimulates intestinal Ca absorption. Whether LCA alters this process remains unknown. The aim of our work was to determine the effect of LCA on intestinal Ca absorption in the absence or presence of NaDOC, bile  that inhibits the cation transport. The data show that LCA by itself did not alter intestinal Ca absorption, but prevented the inhibitory effect of NaDOC. The concomitant administration of LCA avoided the reduction of intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity caused by NaDOC. In addition, LCA blocked a decrease caused by NaDOC on gene and protein expression of molecules involved in the transcellular pathway of intestinal Ca absorption. The oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC were abrogated by LCA co-treatment. In conclusion, LCA placed in the intestinal lumen protects intestinal Ca absorption against the inhibitory effects caused by NaDOC. LCA avoids the reduction of the transcellular Ca movement, apparently by blocking the oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC, normalizing the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in Ca movement. Therefore, LCA might become a possible treatment to improve intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651747>Tauroursodeoxycholic  Improves Motor Symptoms in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe motor symptoms, and currently there is no treatment that retards disease progression or reverses damage prior to the time of clinical diagnosis. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD; however, its effect in PD motor symptoms has never been addressed. In the present work, an extensive behavior analysis was performed to better characterize the MPTP model of PD and to evaluate the effects of TUDCA in the prevention/improvement of mice phenotype. MPTP induced significant alterations in general motor performance paradigms, including increased latency in the motor swimming, adhesive removal and pole tests, as well as altered gait, foot dragging, and tremors. TUDCA administration, either before or after MPTP, significantly reduced the swimming latency, improved gait quality, and decreased foot dragging. Importantly, TUDCA was also effective in the prevention of typical parkinsonian symptoms such as spontaneous activity, ability to initiate movement and tremors. Accordingly, TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced decrease of dopaminergic fibers and ATP levels, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Overall, MPTP-injected mice presented motor symptoms that are aggravated throughout time, resembling human parkinsonism, whereas PD motor symptoms were absent or mild in TUDCA-treated animals, and no aggravation was observed in any parameter.

UDCA prominently improved motor performance in the open field test and halted the decline in the striatal dopamine content. Meanwhile, it improved mitochondrial function as verified by elevation of ATP associated with preservation of mitochondrial integrity as portrayed in the electron microscope examination. In addition, through its anti-inflammatory potential, UDCA reduced the rotenone-induced nuclear factor-κB expression and tumor necrosis factor alpha level. Furthermore, UDCA amended alterations in Bax and Bcl-2 and reduced the activities of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, indicating that it suppressed rotenone-induced apoptosis via modulating both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.

The optimal pharmacological treatment of primary biliary cholangitis remains uncertain.To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers to February 2017 to identify randomised clinical trials on pharmacological interventions for primary biliary cholangitis.We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with primary biliary cholangitis. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with each other or with placebo or no intervention.We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.We identified 74 trials including 5902 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. A total of 46 trials (4274 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. All the trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, all the evidence was low or very low quality. The proportion of participants with symptoms varied from 19.9% to 100% in the trials that reported this information. The proportion of participants who were antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive ranged from 80.8% to 100% in the trials that reported this information. It appeared that most trials included participants who had not received previous treatments or included participants regardless of the previous treatments received. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 96 months.The proportion of people with mortality (maximal follow-up) was higher in the methotrexate group versus the no intervention group (OR 8.83, 95% CI 1.01 to 76.96; 60 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). The proportion of people with mortality (maximal follow-up) was lower in the azathioprine group versus the no intervention group (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 224 participants; 2 trials; I = 0%; low quality evidence). However, it has to be noted that a large proportion of participants (25%) was excluded from the trial that contributed most participants to this analysis and the results were not reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in any of the remaining comparisons. The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the D-penicillamine versus no intervention group (OR 28.77, 95% CI 1.57 to 526.67; 52 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the obeticholic  plus ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) group versus the UDCA group (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 12.51; 216 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the remaining comparisons for serious adverse events (proportion) or serious adverse events (number of events). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life at any time point.nine trials had no special funding or were funded by hospital or charities; 31 trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; and 34 trials provided no information on source of funding.Based on very low quality evidence, there is currently no evidence that any intervention is beneficial for primary biliary cholangitis. However, the follow-up periods in the trials were short and there is significant uncertainty in this issue. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary. Future randomised clinical trials ought to be adequately powered; performed in people who are generally seen in the clinic rather than in highly selected participants; employ blinding; avoid post-randomisation dropouts or planned cross-overs; should have sufficient follow-up period (e.g. five or 10 years or more); and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver transplantation.

There are several limitations to the available drugs including high toxicity, low efficacy, prolonged parenteral administration, and high costs. Steroids are a diverse group of compounds with various applications in pharmacology. However, the antileishmanial activity of this class of molecules has not yet been explored. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the antileishmanial activity and cytotoxicity of novel steroids against murine macrophages with a focus on the derivatives of cholesterol (CD), cholic  (CA), and  (DA). Furthermore, the mechanism of action of the best compound was assessed, and in silico studies to evaluate the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were also conducted. Among the sixteen derivatives, schiffbase2, CD2 and  derivatives (DOCADs) were effective against promastigotes of Leishmania species. Despite their low toxicity to macrophages, the majority of DOCADs were active against intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonensis, and DOCAD5 exhibited the best biological effect against these parasitic stages (IC = 15.34 μM). Neither the CA derivatives (CAD) nor DA alone inhibited the intracellular parasites. Thus, the absence of hydroxyl in the C-7 position of the steroid nucleus, as well as the modification of the  group in DOCADs were considered important for antileishmanial activity. The treatment of L. amazonensis promastigote forms with DOCAD5 induced biochemical changes such as depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS production and cell cycle arrest. No alterations in parasite plasma membrane integrity were observed. In silico physicochemical and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that DOCAD5 could be a good candidate for an oral drug. The data demonstrate the potential antileishmanial effect of certain steroid derivatives and encourage new in vivo studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

When ER stress occurs, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is subsequently activated to restore ER proteostasis. However, severe ER stress leads to apoptosis. Recent studies have suggested that cisplatin cytotoxicity may be related to ER stress. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ER stress participates in cochlear cell apoptosis in a cisplatin-induced ototoxicity rat model and to also determine the possible relationship between ER stress and hearing loss. Our results revealed that treatment with cisplatin upregulated the expression of active caspase-12 in cochlear cells, which is indicative of cisplatin-induced activation of ER-specific apoptosis. Increased expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-9 suggested a close relationship between severe ER stress and -dependent apoptosis in the cochlear cells of cisplatin-treated rats. In addition, we found that tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a promoter of ER proteostasis, had a protective effect on cisplatin-induced hearing loss. These results demonstrate that ER stress is involved in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of cochlear cells in vivo.© 2017 S.

Unexpectedly, inhibition of ER stress did not reverse Qu-induced cell death. Further functional studies revealed that Qu-induced ER stress could activate protective autophagy concomitantly by activating the p-STAT3/Bcl-2 axis in this process. Moreover, the autophagy scavenger 3-MA was shown to enhance Qu's anticancer effects in an ovarian cancer mice xenograft model. These findings revealed a novel role of ER stress as a "double edge sword" participating in Qu-induced apoptosis of OC and might provide a new angle to consider in clinical studies of biological modifiers that may circumvent drug resistance in patients by targeting protective autophagy pathways.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358121>Advanced bile -based multi-compartmental microencapsulated pancreatic β-cells integrating a polyelectrolyte-bile  formulation, for diabetes treatment.</a></h2><p>This study utilized the Seahorse Analyzer to examine the effect of the bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), on the morphology, swelling, stability, and size of novel microencapsulated β-cells, in real-time.

Mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified in many cell types in AD, with deficits preceding the development of the classical pathological aggregations. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis, improves mitochondrial function in fibroblasts derived from Parkinson's disease patients as well as several animal models of AD and Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we investigated both mitochondrial function and morphology in fibroblasts from patients with both sporadic and familial AD. We show that both sporadic AD (sAD) and PSEN1 fibroblasts share the same impairment of mitochondrial membrane potential and alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondrial respiration, however, was decreased in sAD fibroblasts and increased in PSEN1 fibroblasts. Morphological changes seen in AD fibroblasts include reduced mitochondrial number and increased mitochondrial clustering around the cell nucleus as well as an increased number of long . We show here for the first time in AD patient tissue that treatment with UDCA increases mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration as well as reducing the amount of long  in AD fibroblasts. In addition, we show reductions in dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) level, particularly the amount localized to  in both sAD and familial patient fibroblasts. Drp1 protein amount and localization were increased after UDCA treatment. The restorative effects of UDCA are abolished when Drp1 is knocked down.

Disrupted mitochondrial morphology has been observed in cholestatic liver disease. However, the role of mitochondrial shape change in cholestasis is not defined. In this study, using in vitro and in vivo models of bile -induced liver injury, we investigated the contribution of mitochondrial morphology to the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease. We found that the toxic bile salt glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) rapidly fragmented , both in primary mouse hepatocytes and in the bile transporter-expressing hepatic cell line McNtcp.24, leading to a significant increase in cell death. GCDC-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We found that preventing mitochondrial fragmentation in GCDC by inhibiting mitochondrial fission significantly decreased not only ROS levels but also cell death. We also induced cholestasis in mouse livers via common bile duct ligation. Using a transgenic mouse model inducibly expressing a dominant-negative fission mutant specifically in the liver, we demonstrated that decreasing mitochondrial fission substantially diminished ROS levels, liver injury, and fibrosis under cholestatic conditions. Taken together, our results provide new evidence that controlling mitochondrial fission is an effective strategy for ameliorating cholestatic liver injury.© 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089371>FXR/TGR5 Dual Agonist Prevents Progression of Nephropathy in Diabetes and Obesity.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5. We have shown that FXR and TGR5 have renoprotective roles in diabetes- and obesity-related kidney disease. Here, we determined whether these effects are mediated through differential or synergistic signaling pathways. We administered the FXR/TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 to DBA/2J mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, db/db mice with type 2 diabetes, and C57BL/6J mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity. We also examined the individual effects of the selective FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 in diabetic mice. The FXR agonist OCA and the TGR5 agonist INT-777 modulated distinct renal signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Treatment of diabetic DBA/2J and db/db mice with the dual FXR/TGR5 agonist INT-767 improved proteinuria and prevented podocyte injury, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. INT-767 exerted coordinated effects on multiple pathways, including stimulation of a signaling cascade involving AMP-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, PGC-1, sirtuin 3, estrogen-related receptor-, and Nrf-1; inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress; and inhibition of enhanced renal fatty  and cholesterol metabolism. Additionally, in mice with diet-induced obesity, INT-767 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress determined by fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and kidney fibrosis determined by second harmonic imaging microscopy. These results identify the renal signaling pathways regulated by FXR and TGR5, which may be promising targets for the treatment of nephropathy in diabetes and obesity.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society of Nephrology.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222033>Multiple perspectives of qingkailing injection-fraction-single compound in revealing the hepatotoxicity of baicalin and hyodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>The complexity of ingredients in traditional Chinese medical formulas and the limited consideration of toxicological responses are fundamental issues that hamper prognostic information of drug quality control.A multidisciplinary approach for quality control of Qingkailing injection (QKL) regarding drug induced liver toxicity was described for the first time. High content image analysis (HCA) was combined with reverse-phase chromatographic separation and high-resolution MS detection technologies to provide the dynamic responses of drug induced HepG2 cell injury. Firstly, a simple and rapid method for simultaneous qualification and quantification of 21 major constituents in QKL was established and validated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap), which were operated in full MS/dd-MS mode and thus simultaneously acquired quantitative high resolution (HR) full scan data and confirmatory HR MS data. Secondly, repeated semi-preparation HPLC was applied to obtain four fractions (F1-F4) for HCS analysis. Finally, potential hepatotoxicity was determined by five hepatotoxicity biomarkers, including cell loss, DNA condense, glutathione (GSH) depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and  membrane potential (MMP) depolarization.The detection in polarity switching mode empowered the coverage of comprehensive constituents with different chemical properties. Satisfactory linearity precisions, repeatability, stability, and recovery were achieved. QKL injection significantly induced HepG2 cell injury above the concentration of 1.25% (v/v). Meanwhile, flavone glycosides (F3) and stinasterols (F4) fractions exhibited hepatotoxicity above 75μg/mL and 50μg/mL, respectively. Still further, baicalin originated from F3 significantly caused cell loss and glutathione (GSH) depletion. In parallel, hyodeoxycholic  from F4 induced cell loss, nucleus condense, and GSH reduction as well.Our work provides multiple perspectives based on injection-fractions-single compound format to improve QKL pharmacovigilance through revealing the potential hepatotoxic material basis.

UDCA was assessed for its rescue effect on intracellular ATP levels in NM-LRRK2(G2019S) and in a LRRK2 transgenic fly model with dopaminergic expression of LRRK2(G2019S).Crucial parameters of mitochondrial function were similarly reduced in both M-LRRK2(G2019S) and NM-LRRK2(G2019S) with a specific decrease in respiratory chain complex IV activity. Mitochondrial dysfunction precedes changes in mitochondrial morphology but is normalized after siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRRK2.

The bile  phospholipid conjugate Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a novel anti-inflammatory agent with hepatoprotective effects in murine high--diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High  diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic  extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated fatty acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and oleic . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of fatty  oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty  oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective fatty   during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered  profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects.

Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognised in adult patients globally; male sex, younger age at onset (<45) and advanced disease at presentation are baseline predictors of poorer outcome. As the disease is increasingly diagnosed through the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies, most presenting patients are not cirrhotic and the term cholangitis is more accurate. Disease course is frequently accompanied by symptoms that can be burdensome for patients, and management of patients with PBC must address, in a life-long manner, both disease progression and symptom burden. Licensed therapies include ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA), alongside experimental new and re-purposed agents. Disease management focuses on initiation of UDCA for all patients and risk stratification based on baseline and on-treatment factors, including in particular the response to treatment. Those intolerant of treatment with UDCA or those with high-risk disease as evidenced by UDCA treatment failure (frequently reflected in trial and clinical practice as an alkaline phosphatase >1.67 × upper limit of normal and/or elevated bilirubin) should be considered for second-line therapy, of which OCA is the only currently licensed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended agent. Follow-up of patients is life-long and must address treatment of the disease and management of associated symptoms.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

In nonhepatic cells, both pro- and antiapoptotic effects of PKC-δ are described. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PKC-δ in glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC)-induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes and human HUH7-Na-taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) cells. Apoptosis was monitored morphologically by Hoechst staining and biochemically by immunoblotting for caspase 3 cleavage. The role of PKC-δ was evaluated with a PKC activator (phorbol myristate acetate, PMA) and PKC inhibitors (chelerythrine, H-7, or calphostin), PKC-δ knockdown, and wild-type (WT) or constitutively active (CA) PKC-δ. PKC-δ activation was monitored by immunoblotting for PKC-δ Thr505 and Tyr311 phosphorylation or by membrane translocation. JNK and Akt phosphorylation and the amount of total bisindolylmaleimide (BIM) were determined by immunoblotting. GCDC induced the translocation of PKC-δ to the mitochondria and/or plasma membrane in rat hepatocytes and HUH7-Ntcp cells and increased PKC-δ phosphorylation on Thr505, but not on Tyr311, in HUH7-Ntcp cells. GCDC-induced apoptosis was attenuated by PMA and augmented by PKC inhibition in rat hepatocytes. In HUH-Ntcp cells, transfection with CA or WT PKC-δ attenuated GCDC-induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of PKC-δ increased GCDC-induced apoptosis. PKC-δ silencing increased GCDC-induced JNK phosphorylation, decreased GCDC-induced Akt phosphorylation, and increased expression of BIM. GCDC translocated BIM to the mitochondria in rat hepatocytes, and knockdown of BIM in HUH7-Ntcp cells decreased GCDC-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that PKC-δ does not mediate GCDC-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. Instead PKC-δ activation by GCDC stimulates a cytoprotective pathway that involves JNK inhibition, Akt activation, and downregulation of BIM.Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27122157>Chronology of UPR activation in skeletal muscle adaptations to chronic contractile activity.</a></h2><p>The mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein responses (UPR(mt) and UPR(ER)) are important for cellular homeostasis during stimulus-induced increases in protein synthesis. Exercise triggers the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). To investigate the role of the UPR in exercise-induced adaptations, we subjected rats to 3 h of chronic contractile activity (CCA) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days followed by 3 h of recovery. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, through PGC-1α mRNA, increased 14-fold after 1 day of CCA. This resulted in 10-32% increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, between days 3 and 7, as well as increases in the autophagic degradation of p62 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (LC3)-II protein. Before these adaptations, the UPR(ER) transcripts activating transcription factor-4, spliced X-box-binding protein 1, and binding immunoglobulin protein were elevated (1.3- to 3.8-fold) at days 1-3, while CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 were elevated at mRNA and protein levels (1.5- to 3.9-fold) at days 1-7 of CCA. The mitochondrial chaperones 10-kDa chaperonin, HSP60, and 75-kDa mitochondrial HSP, the protease ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit, and the regulatory protein sirtuin-3 of the UPR(mt) were concurrently induced 10-80% between days 1 and 7 To test the role of the UPR in CCA-induced remodeling, we treated animals with the endoplasmic reticulum stress suppressor tauroursodeoxycholic  and subjected them to 2 or 7 days of CCA. Tauroursodeoxycholic  attenuated CHOP and HSP70 protein induction; however, this failed to impact mitochondrial remodeling. Our data indicate that signaling to the UPR is rapidly activated following acute contractile activity, that this is attenuated with repeated bouts, and that the UPR is involved in chronic adaptations to CCA; however, this appears to be independent of CHOP signaling.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28583715>Novel insights into the antioxidant role of tauroursodeoxycholic  in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Impaired mitochondrial function and generation of reactive oxygen species are deeply implicated in Parkinson's disease progression.

We show that TUDCA exerts its neuroprotective role in a parkin-dependent manner. Overall, our results point to the pharmacological up-regulation of mitochondrial turnover by TUDCA as a novel neuroprotective mechanism of this molecule, and contribute to the validation of TUDCA clinical application in PD.Copyright © 2017.

Thus, to keep a healthy mitochondrial population, a balanced mitochondrial turnover must be achieved. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative disease models; however, the mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of TUDCA against mitochondrial damage triggered by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophelyhydrazone (CCCP). Herein, we show that TUDCA significantly prevents CCCP-induced cell death, ROS generation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of TUDCA in this cell model is mediated by parkin and depends on mitophagy. The demonstration that pharmacological up-regulation of mitophagy by TUDCA prevents neurodegeneration provides new insights for the use of TUDCA as a modulator of mitochondrial activity and turnover, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26351365> modulates cell death signaling through changes in mitochondrial membrane properties.</a></h2><p>Cytotoxic bile acids, such as  (DCA), are responsible for hepatocyte cell death during intrahepatic cholestasis. The mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear, and recent studies conflict, pointing to either a modulation of plasma membrane structure or mitochondrial-mediated toxicity through perturbation of mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) properties. We conducted a comprehensive comparative study of the impact of cytotoxic and cytoprotective bile acids on the membrane structure of different cellular compartments. We show that DCA increases the plasma membrane fluidity of hepatocytes to a minor extent, and that this effect is not correlated with the incidence of apoptosis. Additionally, plasma membrane fluidity recovers to normal values over time suggesting the presence of cellular compensatory mechanisms for this perturbation. Colocalization experiments in living cells confirmed the presence of bile acids within mitochondrial membranes. Experiments with active isolated mitochondria revealed that physiologically active concentrations of DCA change MOM order in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and that these changes preceded the mitochondrial permeability transition. Importantly, these effects are not observed on liposomes mimicking MOM  composition, suggesting that DCA apoptotic activity depends on features of mitochondrial membranes that are absent in protein-free mimetic liposomes, such as the double-membrane structure,  asymmetry, or mitochondrial protein environment. In contrast, the mechanism of action of cytoprotective bile acids is likely not associated with changes in cellular membrane structure.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225148>Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27387768>Protective role of biliverdin against bile -induced oxidative stress in liver cells.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of bile acids affects  causing oxidative stress. Antioxidant defense is accepted to include biotransformation of biliverdin (BV) into bilirubin (BR) through BV reductase α (BVRα). The mutation (c.214C>A) in BLVRA results in a non-functional enzyme (mutBVRα). Consequently, homozygous carriers suffering from cholestasis develop green jaundice. Whether BVRα deficiency reduces BV-dependent protection against bile acids is a relevant question because a screening of the mut-BLVRA allele (a) in 311 individuals in Greenland revealed that this SNP was relatively frequent in the Inuit population studied (1% a/a and 4.5% A/a). In three human liver cell lines an inverse correlation between BVRα expression (HepG2>Alexander>HuH-7) and basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was found, however the ability of BV to reduce oxidative stress and cell death induced by  (DCA) or potassium dichromate (PDC) was similar in these cells. The transduction of BVRα or mutBVRα in human placenta JAr cells with negligible BVRα expression or the silencing of endogenous BVRα expression in liver cells had no effect on DCA-induced oxidative stress and cell death or BV-mediated cytoprotection. DCA stimulated both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production, whereas BV only inhibited the latter. DCA and other dihydroxy-bile acids, but not PDC, induced up-regulation of both BVRα and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in liver cells through a FXR independent and BV insensitive mechanism. In conclusion, BV exerts direct and BVRα-independent antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, whereas bile  accumulation in cholestasis stimulates the expression of enzymes favoring the heme biotransformation into BV and BR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the second case, the predominant condition was, initially, an antimitochondrial antibody-negative primary biliary cirrhosis with progressive course towards end-stage liver disease; the patient then developed either antimitochondrial antibody positivity or changes in the biliary tree compatible with primary sclerosing cholangitis.These two cases add information on a controversial issue in the literature, and indicate the importance of recognizing a possible overlap syndrome to optimize treatment.Copyright © 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.
