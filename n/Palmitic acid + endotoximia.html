DIETS AND MEASUREMENTS: Three groups of pigs (n = 12 per group) were fed for 8 days diets containing either omega-6 fatty acids (FAs) (corn oil; diet A), or omega-3 FAs (fish oil; diet B), or a combination of omega-6 and omega-3 FAs (borage and fish oils; diet C). Eight of 12 pigs in each group received a 0.1-mg/kg bolus of Escherichia coli endotoxin followed by a continuous infusion (0. 075 mg/kg/h). One lung was subsequently isolated ex vivo, and pressure-volume curves were measured. The contralateral lung was lavaged, and surfactant was analyzed for total and individual phospholipids and FA composition. Minimum and maximum surface tension was measured by bubble surfactometry.Pigs fed either diet B or C had increased oleic  (C(18:1) omega-9), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; C(20:5) omega-3), docosahexaenoic  (C(22:6) omega-3), and total omega-3 and monounsaturated FAs in their surfactant PUFA pools. The relative percentage of linoleic  (C(18:2) omega-6) and total omega-6 FAs were significantly lower from pigs fed diets B and C compared with diet A.  (C(16:0)) concentrations, the primary FA in surfactant, had a tendency to be lower in pigs fed diets B and C. There were no demonstrable effects on surfactant function or pulmonary compliance.Diets containing EPA or EPA and gamma-linolenic  altered the PUFA composition of pulmonary surfactant, but without demonstrable effects on surfactant function during porcine .</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25383781>Deletion of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) protects pancreatic beta-cells from stress-induced death but not from glucose homeostasis alterations under pro-inflammatory conditions.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and is associated with low-grade . Recent observations suggest that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is involved in beta-cell death in response to different stressors. In this study, we tested whether ASK1 deficiency protects beta-cells from glucolipotoxic conditions and cytokines treatment or from glucose homeostasis alteration induced by endotoxemia.Insulin secretion was neither affected upon shRNA-mediated downregulation of ASK1 in MIN6 cells nor in islets from ASK1-deficient mice. ASK1 silencing in MIN6 cells and deletion in islets did not prevent the deleterious effect of glucolipotoxic conditions or cytokines on insulin secretion. However, it protected MIN6 cells from death induced by ER stress or palmitate and islets from short term caspase activation in response to cytokines. Moreover, endotoxemia induced by LPS infusion increased insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps but the response was similar in wild-type and ASK1-deficient mice. Finally, insulin sensitivity in the presence of LPS was not affected by ASK1-deficiency.Our study demonstrates that ASK1 is not involved in beta-cell function and dysfunction but controls stress-induced beta-cell death.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2407024>Effects of endotoxin infusion on circulating levels of eicosanoids, progesterone, cortisol, glucose and lactic , and abortion in pregnant cows.</a></h2><p>The effects of Escherichia coli endotoxin infusions (1.0 or 2.5 micrograms kg-1 over 6 h) on pregnancy were investigated in cows in the first, second and third trimester of gestation. Endotoxin increased the plasma levels of prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxane B2 and cortisol, and decreased progesterone. The severity of the clinical signs and the magnitude of the increases in plasma PGs, thromboxane B2 and cortisol tended to depend on the dose of endotoxin, but were independent of the gestation period. There was hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia and lactic acidemia. Hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia were significant only at the high dose of endotoxin. Endotoxin infusion at both doses caused a preferential mobilization of oleic  from adipose tissue, and also had some effects on the mobilization of  and stearic acids during the post-infusion period. The cows in the first trimester of gestation were more sensitive to the abortifacient effect of endotoxin than cows in the second and third trimester of gestation. The results of this study indicate that the mechanism of endotoxin-induced abortion in cows initially involves a prolonged release of PGF2 alpha and its subsequent stimulant effect on uterine smooth muscle contraction and luteolytic effect leading to a gradual decline in the plasma levels of progesterone. It was concluded that pregnancy terminates in the absence of an adequate level of progesterone, especially during the first trimester of gestation, when progesterone of extraluteal origin is not yet available, coupled with the PGF2 alpha-induced propulsive contraction of the uterus. In addition, the metabolic and circulatory failures in severe cases of , especially at the high dose of endotoxin, resulting either directly or indirectly via the release of various autacoids, catecholamines and cortisol, may also contribute to the termination of pregnancy at any stage of gestation.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3825740>Potential therapeutic efficacy of inhibitors of human phospholipase A2 in septic shock.</a></h2><p>Soluble phospholipase A2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of local and systemic inflammatory reactions. Elevated levels of circulating phospholipase A2 (PLA2) correlate with the severity of circulatory collapse and pulmonary dysfunction in gram-negative septic shock. Characterization of septic shock serum PLA2 revealed a calcium-dependent enzyme with absolute 2-acyl specificity with a pH optimum of 7.5. We tested a number of therapeutic agents for their ability to inhibit PLA2 from human septic shock serum. Chloroquine, chlorpromazine, dexamethasone base, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, indomethacin, lidocaine, oleic , , promethazine, trans-retinoic , rutin and dl-alpha-tocopherol were all studied over the range of 10(-2) to 10(-7) M. All agents, with the sole exception of dexamethasone base, inhibited PLA2 activity at concentrations greater than 10(-3) M. PLA2 inhibition by dexamethasone sodium phosphate was factitious, due to the formation of calcium-phosphate complexes. Of the 11 agents studied, chlorpromazine was the most effective, with an IC50 of 7.5 X 10(-5) M, a membrane concentration achievable within its therapeutic range. Inhibition was non-competitive with an apparent Ki of 5 nM. Since serum PLA2 levels correlate with mortality in both experimental  and clinical gram-negative septic shock, and chlorpromazine was previously shown to improve survival in these conditions, we postulate that its therapeutic efficacy resides at least in part in its PLA2-inhibitory activity.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606743>[Synthesis of 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine and its anti- activity].</a></h2><p>To synthesize the derivatives of sinomenine, 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine, and explore its therapeutic effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia.A highly efficient synthesis of sinomenine derivatives called 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine was made with a molecule of  substitutions at C-16 position of ring A. One hour before endotoxemia induction by i.p. injection of 10 mg/kg LPS, high-dose treatment mice (n=5/group) received an i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg sinomenine or 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine while the low-dose treatment mice (n=5/group) received 2.5 mg/kg sinomenine or 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine. Untreated group and normal control group received normal saline. And their survival was monitored hourly for 24 hours. Examination of cytotoxicity of 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine on RAW264.7 cells was conducted at a concentration range of 1 to 125 μmol/L using MTT assay. RAW264.7 cells were exposed to 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine (0, 1, 2, 5, 10 μmol/L) for 24 hours, and then treated with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 6 hours. Then RAW264.7 cells were collected and the mRNA level of IL-6 was detected by real-time quantitative PCR(qRT-PCR).Sinomenine derivatives were successfully synthesized to get 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine. The survival percentage of 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine treatment groups was higher than that of sinomenine treatment groups at the same treatment concentration. The 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine inhibited RAW264.7 cell proliferation and IL-6 gene transcription.The 4-palmitoyl-sinomenine has an anti- probably through inhibiting the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells and decreasing the inflammatory gene expression and inflammatory cytokine release.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2830707>Effects of smooth and rough Pasteurella haemolytica lipopolysaccharides on plasma cyclic-nucleotides and free fatty acids in calves.</a></h2><p>The present study examined the potency of smooth or rough Pasteurella haemolytica lipopolysaccharide infusion (LPS, 24 ng kg-1 min-1 for 500 min) on plasma cyclic-nucleotides and several free fatty acids (FFA) in calves. Both smooth or rough LPS increased plasma cAMP immediately to its maximum at 1 h of infusion, whereas plasma cGMP levels rose slowly and peaked 12 h later. The increases in cAMP levels were more prolonged for smooth LPS than rough LPS. The maximum plasma cAMP rise coincided with increases of several plasma FFA. Rough LPS increased plasma oleic greater than  greater than stearic greater than linoleic acids in the second hour and reached their steady state levels between 2 h of infusion and 5 h post-infusion. Thereafter, oleic  remained maximally elevated, while stearic  decreased and other FFA returned to baseline. Smooth LPS had no effects on  and stearic acids, but elevated oleic  in an essentially similar manner to rough LPS and increased linoleic  initially at 5 h, followed by decreases throughout post-infusion. These results demonstrate that  produces early marked elevations in plasma cAMP, a gradual rise in plasma cGMP and disproportionate increases in several plasma FFA. The data also demonstrate that smooth and rough LPS differ in their abilities to increase plasma cAMP and FFA and these may be attributed to differences in their in vivo mechanisms of action. The study suggests that cAMP and cGMP may mediate actions of endotoxin at the cellular level and that differences exist in release and/or utilization of each FFA at different stages of .</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22842335>Anti-inflammatory activity of methyl palmitate and ethyl palmitate in different experimental rat models.</a></h2><p>Methyl palmitate (MP) and ethyl palmitate (EP) are naturally occurring fatty  esters reported as inflammatory cell inhibitors. In the current study, the potential anti-inflammatory activity of MP and EP was evaluated in different experimental rat models. Results showed that MP and EP caused reduction of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema in addition to diminishing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in the inflammatory exudates. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced  in rats, MP and EP reduced plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). MP and EP decreased NF-κB expression in liver and lung tissues and ameliorated histopathological changes caused by LPS. Topical application of MP and EP reduced ear edema induced by croton oil in rats. In the same animal model, MP and EP reduced neutrophil infiltration, as indicated by decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of MP and EP in combating inflammation in several experimental models.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, macrophages (J774) and hepatocytes (HepG2) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli 0111: B4 and analyzed for modulation of this response when preconditioned or stimulated subsequent to LPS, with different doses of Vitamin D3 or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) over a time period of 1 and 5 days. Pro-inflammatory TNFα and pro-fibrotic TGFβ released into the supernatants were measured by ELISA; qPCR was performed for Srebp-1c and PPARα mRNA (genes for products involved in fatty  synthesis and catabolism, respectively). Vitamin D3 and DHA exerted a consistent, dose dependent anti-inflammatory effect, and increased PPARα relative to Srebp-1c in both cell types. By contrast, addition of free fatty acids (FFA, oleic / 2:1) caused aggravation of LPS-induced inflammatory reaction and an increase of Srebp-1c relative to PPARα. Our results argue in favor of dietary supplementation of Vitamin D3 or DHA (and avoidance of monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids) to alleviate development of fatty liver disease.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29989851>Saturated fatty  combined with lipopolysaccharide stimulates a strong inflammatory response in hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) is a risk factor for NAFLD. The HFD not only increases intake of saturated fatty  (SFA) but also induces metabolic endotoxemia, an HFD-associated increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although it is known that SFA or LPS promote hepatic , a hallmark of NAFLD, it remains unclear how SFA in combination with LPS stimulates host inflammatory response in hepatocytes. In this study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the effect of SFA in combination with LPS on proinflammatory gene expression in hepatocytes. Our animal study showed that feeding low-density lipoprotein-deficient mice HFD enriched with SFA and injection of low-dose LPS cooperatively stimulated IL-6 expression in livers. To understand how SFA and LPS interact to promote IL-6 expression, our in vitro studies showed that  (PA), a major SFA, and LPS exerted synergistic effect on the expression of IL-6 in hepatocytes. Furthermore, coculture of hepatocytes with macrophages resulted in a greater IL-6 expression than culture of hepatocytes without macrophages in response to the combination of PA and LPS. Finally, we observed that LPS and PA increased ceramide production by cooperatively stimulating ceramide de novo synthesis, which played an essential role in the synergistic stimulation of proinflammatory gene expression by LPS and PA. Taken together, this study showed that SFA in combination with LPS stimulated a strong inflammatory response in hepatocytes in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766838>Inhibition of lethal inflammatory responses through the targeting of membrane-associated Toll-like receptor 4 signaling complexes with a Smad6-derived peptide.</a></h2><p>We have previously reported that Smad6, one of the inhibitory Smads of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling by disrupting the Pellino-1-mediated TLR4 signaling complex. Here, we developed Smaducin-6, a novel membrane-tethered -conjugated Smad6-derived peptide composed of amino acids 422-441 of Smad6. Smaducin-6 interacted with Pellino-1, located in the inner membrane, thereby disrupting the formation of IRAK1-, RIP1-, IKKε-mediated TLR4 signaling complexes. Systemic administration of Smaducin-6 showed a significant therapeutic effect on mouse TLR4-mediated inflammatory disease models, cecal-ligation-puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, and lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia, by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and apoptosis while enhancing neutrophil migration and bacterial clearance. Our findings provide clues to develop new peptide-based drugs to target Pellino-1 protein in TLR4 signaling pathway for the treatment of sepsis.© 2015 The Authors.
