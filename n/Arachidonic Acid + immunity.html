Most notably, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, IL-25, IL-25, IL-31 and IL-32 contribute in concert to pathophysiological events. These include cell death, inflammation, allergy and autoimmunity. Up-regulation of either T helper (TH)1 or TH2 cells is pathogenic, and these subsets downregulate each other. The expression of chemokines/cytokines by endothelial cells is also crucial to autoimmunity by trafficking inflammatory T cells into the central-nervous system. IL-32 (previously termed NK transcript 4), is the newest inflammatory cytokine produced by mitogen-activated lymphocytes, interferon-gamma activated epithelial cells and IL-12, IL-18 and IL-32-activated NK cells. This induces TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and 2 C-X-C chemokine family members involved in several autoimmune diseases. In addition, IL-32 activates  metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by stimulating the release of prostaglandins. Discovery of this supplementary inflammatory cytokine further complicates the network of inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2837958>Effect of  metabolites on thymocyte tolerance.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2948632>Experimental granulomatosis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20620762>Healing fats of the skin: the structural and immunologic roles of the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Linoleic  (18:2omega6) and alpha-linolenic  (18:3omega3) represent the parent fats of the two main classes of polyunsaturated fatty acids: the omega-6 (n-6) and the omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, respectively.

These fatty acids are showing promise as safe adjunctive treatments for many skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, systemic lupus erythematosus, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and melanoma. Their roles are diverse and include maintenance of the stratum corneum permeability barrier, maturation and differentiation of the stratum corneum, formation and secretion of lamellar bodies, inhibition of proinflammatory eicosanoids, elevation of the sunburn threshold, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-12), inhibition of lipoxygenase, promotion of wound healing, and promotion of apoptosis in malignant cells, including melanoma. They fulfill these functions independently and through the modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and Toll-like receptors.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This study elucidated the mechanisms contributing to tumor development induced by the HBV X (HBx) gene of predominantly Asian genotype B HBV and its common HBx variants. To compare the potential tumorigenic effects of K130M/V131I (Mut) and wild-type (WT) HBx on HCC, the  () transposon system was used to deliver HBx Mut and WT into the livers of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ()-deficient mice and in the context of  () deficiency. From our results, HBx Mut had a stronger tumorigenic effect than its WT variant. Also, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis were evident in HBx experimental animals. Reduction of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) with increased phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine kinase (AKT) was detected under HBx Mut overexpression. Thus, it is proposed that HBx Mut enhances disease progression by reducing FOXO1 via phosphorylation of AKT. At the metabolomic level, HBx altered the expression of genes that participated in  (AA) metabolism, as a result of inflammation via accumulation of proinflammatory factors such as prostaglandins and leukotriene in liver. Taken together, the increased rate of HCC observed in chronic hepatitis B patients with K130M/V131I-mutated X protein, may be due to changes in AA metabolism and AKT/FOXO1 signaling. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggested that HBx-K130M/V131I-mutant variant promoted HCC progression by activating AKT/FOXO1 pathway and inducing stronger inflammation in liver via AA metabolism.Â©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11448594>Modulation of human immune and inflammatory responses by dietary fatty acids.</a></h2><p>I review the effects of the amount and composition of dietary fat on indices of human immune and inflammatory responses. A reduction in the amount of fat intake enhanced several indices of immune response, including lymphocyte proliferation, natural-killer-cell activity, cytokine production, and delayed-type hypersensitivity. When total fat intake was held constant, an increase in the intake of linoleic  (18:2 omega-6) or  (20:4 omega-6) by healthy human volunteers did not inhibit many indices of immune response tested but did increase the production of inflammatory eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4). Supplementation of human diets with omega-3 fatty acids reduced several aspects of neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte functions, including the production of inflammatory mediators. Most of the studies have indicated reductions in these functions, with a minimum of 1.2 g/d of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  for 6 wk. However, other studies concomitantly supplementing with 205 mg/d of vitamin E did not find inhibition of immune-cell functions, even with larger amounts and longer durations of supplementation with these fatty acids. One study reported that supplementation with docosahexaenoic  selectively inhibits inflammatory responses without inhibiting T- and B-cell functions. Despite some discrepancies, fish oils have been used successfully in the management of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The potential for the use of fish oils in the management of these diseases is tremendous, even though further studies are needed to establish safe and adequate intake levels of omega-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8409519>Activation of neutrophil membrane-associated oxidative metabolism by ultraviolet radiation.</a></h2><p>Exposure of human neutrophils to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in vitro was accompanied by activation of superoxide generation and preferential release of secondary granules. These pro-oxidative interactions of UVR with neutrophils were dependent on intact cellular membrane-associated oxidative metabolism and were mediated almost exclusively by the UVB component of UVR. Irradiation of neutrophils was also associated with release of  from membrane phospholipids, implicating involvement of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the pro-oxidative activity of UVR. The pro-oxidative interactions of UVR with neutrophils were mimicked by coincubation of the cells with reagent arachidonate or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), whereas the PLA2 inhibitor 4-p-bromophenacyl bromide, as well as the LPC- and arachidonate complex-forming agent alpha-tocopherol, inhibited these pro-oxidative interactions of UVR with phagocytes.

In this study, we investigated its toxic effects on human neutrophils at concentrations corresponding to those found in the blood of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Incubation of the cells for 10min with 30-100ng/ml of gliotoxin inhibited phagocytosis of either zymosan or serum-opsonized zymosan without affecting superoxide production or the exocytosis of specific and azurophil granules. Gliotoxin also induced a significant re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton which collapsed around the nucleus leading to cell shrinkage and the disappearance of filopodia. This gliotoxin-induced actin phenotype was reversed by the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMP and mimicked by pCPT-cAMP indicating that it probably resulted from the deregulation of intracellular cAMP homeostasis as previously described for gliotoxin-induced apoptosis. By contrast, gliotoxin-induced inhibition of phagocytosis was not reversed by Rp-cAMP but by , another member of a known signalling pathway affected by the toxin. This suggests that gliotoxin can affect circulating neutrophils and favour the dissemination of A. fumigatus by inhibiting phagocytosis and the consequent killing of conidia.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12489129>Eicosanoids in insect : bacterial infection stimulates hemocytic phospholipase A2 activity in tobacco hornworms.</a></h2><p>Intracellular phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is responsible for releasing  from cellular phospholipids, and is thought to be the first step in eicosanoid biosynthesis. Intracellular PLA(2)s have been characterized in fat body and hemocytes from tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta. Here we show that bacterial challenge stimulated increased PLA(2) activity in isolated hemocyte preparations, relative to control hemocyte preparations that were challenged with water. The increased activity was detected as early as 15 s post-challenge and lasted for at least 1 h. The increased activity depended on a minimum bacterial challenge dose, and was inhibited in reactions conducted in the presence of oleyoxyethylphosphorylcholine, a site-specific PLA(2) inhibitor. In independent experiments with serum prepared from whole hemolymph, we found no PLA(2) activity was secreted into serum during the first 24 h following bacterial infection. We infer that a hemocytic intracellular PLA(2) activity is increased immediately an infection is detected. The significance of this enzyme lies in its role in launching the biosynthesis of eicosanoids, which mediate cellular immune reactions to bacterial infection.Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19969040>Lipidomic approaches to the study of phospholipase A2-regulated phospholipid fatty  incorporation and remodeling.</a></h2><p>The distribution of fatty acids among cellular glycerophospholipids is finely regulated by the CoA-dependent acylation of lysophospholipids followed by transacylation reactions.  is the fatty  precursor of a wide family of bioactive compounds called the eicosanoids, with key roles in innate  and inflammation. Because availability of free AA constitutes a rate-limiting step in the generation of eicosanoids by mammalian cells, many studies have been devoted to characterize the processes of arachidonate liberation from phospholipids by phospholipase A(2)s and its re-incorporation and further remodeling back into phospholipids by acyltransferases and transacylases. These studies have traditionally been conducted by using radioactive precursors which do not allow the identification of the phospholipid molecular species involved in these processes. Nowadays, lipidomic approaches utilizing mass spectrometry provide a new frame for the analysis of unique phospholipid species involved in fatty  release and phospholipid incorporation and remodeling.

Our experiments show that TNF and CHI, when used independently, caused the rapid phosphorylation of cPLA2 (within 10 min). In both cases, cPLA2 was subsequently dephosphorylated to pretreatment levels by 40 min. In addition, under these conditions [3H] was not released, and we could not detect a change in the activity of cPLA2 in vitro. In contrast, in cells treated with a combination of TNF and CHI, we found that the dephosphorylation of cPLA2 was inhibited, and cPLA2 remained phosphorylated for up to 2 h. In vitro we found that sustained phosphorylation of cPLA2 was accompanied by a 60 to 80% increase in the activity of cPLA2. The sustained phosphorylation of cPLA2 also occurred in cells infected with the adenovirus mutant dl309, suggesting that sustained phosphorylation may be a general requirement for the activation of cPLA2 in apoptotic cells. We also found that sustained phosphorylation of phosphoproteins is not a general consequence of apoptotic death, since the phosphorylation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase was not sustained. Finally, we show that the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate acts as does CHI to render cells susceptible to TNF, suggesting that resistance to TNF may depend on TNF's ability to induce the expression of tyrosine or dual specificity phosphatase(s).</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2438210>Effect of alpha-fetoprotein on  metabolism in a human T-cell line.</a></h2><p>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), an onco-fetal protein which binds specifically polyunsaturated fatty acids, has been shown to modulate  metabolism in a human T-cell line.

We tested the hypothesis that eicosanoids also mediate nodulation reactions to bacterial challenge in adults of a social insect, the honey bee, Apis mellifera. Treating newly-emerged experimental bees with the eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitor, dexamethasone, impaired nodulation reactions to bacterial infections, and the influence of dexamethasone was reversed by treating infected insects with , an eicosanoid precursor. Several other eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors, including the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and the dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor, phenidone, also impaired the ability of experimental honeybees to form nodules in reaction to bacterial challenge. The influence of phenidone on nodulation was expressed in a dose-dependent manner. However, in experiments with older honey bees foragers, similar bacterial challenge did not evoke nodulation reactions. We infer from our results that while eicosanoids mediate cellular immune responses to bacterial infections in newly emerged honey bees, and more broadly, in most insect species, nodulation reactions to bacterial challenge probably do not occur in all phases of insect life cycles.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26632201>Possible effects of repeated exposure to ibuprofen and acetaminophen on the intestinal immune response in young infants.</a></h2><p>There has been an exponential increase in the frequency of immune deviations in young children. Consequently, research investigating environmental causes for this increase has become a Public Health priority. We have summarized the experimental observations and epidemiological data that could link repeated acetaminophen and ibuprofen exposure in early infancy to this increase. Recent observations on the maturational  of the intestinal sub-mucosal lamina propria underscore indeed the importance of prostaglandins (PGE2s). PGE2 appearing at this sub-mucosal level is a product of  metabolism mediated by type-2 cyclooxygenase (COX-2) situated on the membrane of many immune cells. Moreover, it seems that acetaminophen - like ibuprofen - also carries a non-selective inhibitory action on peripheral COXs, besides its central action. This inhibitory action of acetaminophen on COX2 only relates to physiological, low  concentrations. This explains the difference in anti-inflammatory effects. The impact of repeated inhibition of mucosal PGE2 synthesis due to COX-inhibitor exposure on maturational  has been demonstrated in animal experiments. Repeatedly exposed young animals do not develop tolerance to food antigens and exhibit autoimmune deviations. Several recent epidemiological studies have also reported on the magnitude of acetaminophen and ibuprofen exposure in children and the increase in immune deviations, it is important to better understand the potential negative impact of repeated inhibitions of prostaglandin synthesis by COX2s during infancy. Since acetaminophen and ibuprofen are commonly administered analgesics and antipyretics, a well-designed prospective strategy for pharmacovigilance and -epidemiology of COX-inhibitor exposure in infancy is urgently needed.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantification and incorporation studies of [(3)H]AA indicated that TNF-resistant cells were not depleted in AA. Furthermore, distribution of this fatty  in different phospholipid pools was similar in both sensitive cells and their resistant counterparts, ruling out a defect in phospholipid pools. Since phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) are the main enzymes releasing free AA, we investigated their relative contribution in the acquisition of cell resistance to TNF-induced cell death and AA release. For this purpose, we used two PLA(2) inhibitors, methylarachidonyl fluorophosphate (MAFP) and bromoenol lactone (BEL), which selectively and irreversibly inhibit the cytosolic PLA(2) (cPLA(2)) and the Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2), respectively. Although a significant inhibitory effect of MAFP on both TNF-induced AA release and PLA(2) activity in MCF7 was observed, BEL had no effect. The inhibitory effect of MAFP on cPLA(2) activity correlated with an inhibition of TNF-induced cell death. Western blot analysis revealed that TNF induced a differential cleavage of cPLA(2) in TNF-sensitive vs TNF-resistant cells. Although the p70 (70-kDa) form of cPLA(2) was specifically increased in TNF-sensitive cells, a cleaved form, p50 (50 kDa), was selectively observed in TNF-resistant C1001 cells in the presence or absence of TNF. These findings suggest that the acquisition of cell resistance to this cytokine may involve an abnormal cPLA(2) cleavage.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1958207>Increased 12-HETE production in bovine lymphocytes during selenium deficiency.</a></h2><p>When peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated with  in the presence of Ca++ ionophore (A23187), the cells from the selenium-deficient dairy cows produced significantly greater quantities of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12-HETE) than the cells from the selenium-supplemented animals.

This study analyzed the inhibitory effect of X. nematophila on the humoral  of the target insects and tested its association with the host eicosanoid pathway. Plasma collected from the fifth instar larvae of Spodoptera exigua, when they were injected with X. nematophila, did not show antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli by a growth inhibition zone assay.

Two cecropin genes ('A' and 'B') were partially cloned from the fifth instar larvae of S. exigua by conserved degenerate primers using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). They showed high homologies with known cecropins from other lepidopteran species.

Interestingly, the production of the lymphokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) was elevated in Molt-4 cells, but it was reduced in the normal human lymphocytes. Addition of GLA or IL-2 or a combination of both showed enhancement of SO2.- and of lipid peroxidation levels, which were significantly higher in Molt-4 cells than in the normal lymphocytes. Reduction of protein concentration was also observed in both types of cells during this treatment. The data showed that the antiproliferative effects of GLA and IL-2 may partly be exerted through the elevated production of superoxide free radicals and peroxidation products. This is a novel finding and therefore, further exploitation of combinations of PUFAs and IL-2 may be a possible way of combating cancer cell growth.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848277>Fatty acids, the immune response, and autoimmunity: a question of n-6 essentiality and the balance between n-6 and n-3.</a></h2><p>The essentiality of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is described in relation to a thymus/thymocyte accretion of  (20:4n-6, AA) in early development, and the high requirement of lymphoid and other cells of the immune system for AA and linoleic  (1 8:2n-6, LA) for membrane phospholipids. Low n-6 PUFA intakes enhance whereas high intakes decrease certain immune functions. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies for a role of AA metabolites in immune cell development and functions shows that they can limit or regulate cellular immune reactions and can induce deviation toward a T helper (Th)2-like immune response. In contrast to the effects of the oxidative metabolites of AA, the longer-chain n-6 PUFA produced by gamma-linolenic  (18:3n-6, GLA) feeding decreases the Th2 cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody response. The n-6 PUFA, GLA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic  (20:3n-6, DHLA) and AA, and certain oxidative metabolites of AA can also induce T-regulatory cell activity, e.g., transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-producing T cells; GLA feeding studies also demonstrate reduced proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. Low intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (fish oils) enhance certain immune functions, whereas high intakes are inhibitory on a wide range of functions, e.g., antigen presentation, adhesion molecule expression, Th1 and Th2 responses, proinflammatory cytokine and eicosanoid production, and they induce lymphocyte apoptosis. Vitamin E has a demonstrable critical role in long-chain n-3 PUFA interactions with immune functions, often reversing the effects of fish oil. The effect of dietary fatty acids on animal autoimmune disease models depends on both the autoimmune model and the amount and type of fatty acids fed. Diets low in fat, essential fatty  deficient (EFAD), or high in long-chain n-3 PUFA from fish oils increase survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, whereas high-fat LA-rich diets increase disease severity. In experimentally induced T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, EFAD diets or diets supplemented with long-chain n-3 PUFA augment disease, whereas n-6 PUFA prevent or reduce the severity. In contrast, in both T cell- and antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, the desaturated/elongated metabolites of LA are protective. PUFA of both the n-6 and n-3 families are clinically useful in human autoimmune-inflammatory disorders, but the precise mechanisms by which these fatty acids exert their clinical effects are not well understood. Finally, the view that all n-6 PUFA are proinflammatory requires revision, in part, and their essential regulatory and developmental role in the immune system warrants appreciation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18640269>Prostaglandin E(2)-loaded microspheres as strategy to inhibit phagocytosis and modulate inflammatory mediators release.</a></h2><p>PGE(2), an  metabolite produced by various type of cells regulates a broad range of physiological activities in the endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, and is involved in maintaining the local homeostasis.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), including leukotriene (LT) C, LTD, and LTE, are metabolites of  and mediate inflammatory responses. Their role in human ILC2s is still poorly understood.We sought to determine the role of cysLTs and their relationship with other ILC2 stimulators in the activation of human ILC2s.For exÂ vivo studies, fresh blood from patients with atopic dermatitis and healthy control subjects was analyzed with flow cytometry. For inÂ vitro studies, ILC2s were isolated and cultured. The effects of cysLTs, PGD, IL-33, IL-25, TSLP, and IL-2 alone or in combination on ILC2s were defined by using chemotaxis, apoptosis, ELISA, Luminex, quantitative RT-PCR, and flow cytometric assays. The effect of endogenous cysLTs was assessed by using human mast cell supernatants.Human ILC2s expressed the LT receptor CysLT, levels of which were increased in atopic subjects. CysLTs, particularly LTE, induced migration, reduced apoptosis, and promoted cytokine production in human ILC2s inÂ vitro. LTE enhanced the effect of PGD, IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, resulting in increased production of type 2 and other proinflammatory cytokines. The effect of LTE was inhibited by montelukast, a CysLT antagonist. Interestingly, addition of IL-2 to LTE and epithelial cytokines significantly amplified ILC2 activation and upregulated expression of the receptors for IL-33 and IL-25.CysLTs, particularly LTE, are important contributors to the triggering of human ILC2s in inflammatory responses, particularly when combined with other ILC2 activators.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

However, the underlying molecular and cellular basis of this function remains unclear. IL-10-producing B (Breg) cells display tumor-promoting effects by negatively regulating anti-tumor . Here we show that LXA4 inhibits tumor growth by suppressing the generation of Breg cells in tumor-bearing mice. The administration of LXA4 inhibited the induction of Breg cells. Breg cell deficiency, in turn, resulted in LXA4 losing its anti-tumor properties. Intriguingly, regulatory T (Treg) cells also had a role in this process. Targeting Breg cells by LXA4 decreased the number of Treg cells in draining lymph nodes and tumor tissues as well as enhanced cytotoxic T cell activities. In addition, we further demonstrated that LXA4 inhibited Breg cells through its dephosphorylating STAT3 and ERK. These findings unveil a new anti-tumor mechanism underlying LXA4 targeting Breg cells with potential clinical applications.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

All Graves' and toxic adenoma patients were hyperthyroid. Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients were euthyroid. Healthy age and sex matched volunteers served as controls. The results are as follows: 1) In PMNs from both hyperthyroid groups (Graves' disease and toxic adenoma), independently from the autoimmune origin of the disease, a significantly increased Antimycin A sensitive mitochondrial oxygen consumption and a slightly increased superoxide anion generation were detected. 2) In both autoimmune thyroid disease groups (Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis)--depending on the functional state of the thyroid gland--a significantly altered intracellular killing activity was measured. 3) An increased  cascade--triggered by opsonized zymozan (OZ)--was detected in both autoimmune thyroid diseases. The increased  cascade was sensitive to phospholipase A2 inhibiting Mepacrin treatment. 4) The PMNs from both autoimmune thyroid diseases produced large amount of leukotriens (LTs)--LTC4 and LTB4--after stimulation through their Fc receptors but the synthesis of prostagalandins (PGs) has not changed. There are no data indicating local, specific effects of circulating leukotriens in the thyroid gland itself, but based on authors' data, their general, regulating role on both the endocrine-- as well as on the immune system--seems to be plausible.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19835110> and docosahexaenoic  deficits in preterm neonatal mononuclear cell membranes.

Significantly increased anti-CFA autoAb of IgG class were found in HIV-1-infected patients (alpha < 0.001). Using our ELISA method and CFA differing in their length and their degree of unsaturation (lauric, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linolenic, linoleic, lignoceric, , eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids), it was demonstrated that the acyl chain of CFA is the immunodominant part recognized by these autoAb.

Because eicosanoids act in several areas of insect biology, we posed the hypothesis that chronic inhibition of eicosanoid biosynthesis, in the absence of microbial challenge, can influence insect life table parameters, including developmental time, survival, adult longevity and parasitoid fecundity. Here we report that inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis throughout the larval life exerted minor influences on some life table parameters of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella and its ectoparasitoid, Bracon hebetor, however, the inhibitors strongly reduced the production and hatchability of the parasitoids' eggs. The significance of the work relates to the potentials of understanding and targeting eicosanoid systems as a platform for developing new technologies of insect pest management.

Here, we show that a multistep reciprocal crosstalk exists between these two cell types, ultimately facilitating neutrophil influx into the lung to eliminate infections. Activated platelets adhere to intravascular neutrophils through P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1)-mediated binding, a primary interaction that allows platelets glycoprotein IbÎ± (GPIbÎ±)-induced generation of neutrophil-derived extracellular vesicles (EV). EV production is directed by exocytosis and allows shuttling of  into platelets. EVs are then specifically internalized into platelets in a Mac1-dependent fashion, and relocated into intracellular compartments enriched in cyclooxygenase1 (Cox1), an enzyme processing  to synthesize thromboxane A (TxA).

A., Copeland, N. G., and Funk, C. D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13979-13987). By in situ hybridization we show that the L-12LO gene is expressed abundantly in a subset of peritoneal macrophages but not in elicited leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, or bone marrow-derived macrophages. L-12LO is highly related to human and rabbit 15-lipoxygenases, enzymes that have been implicated in the maturation process of red blood cells, and the oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins that is implicated in atherogenesis. Accordingly, these enzymes have been referred to as 12/15-lipoxygenases. We have inactivated the L-12LO gene in mice using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Macrophage expression of L-12LO was abolished in homozygous deficient mice as was formation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12-HETE). In zymosan-stimulated cells, there was significant diversion of metabolism to the 5-lipoxygenase products leukotriene C4 and 5-HETE and in A23187-treated cells to 5-HETE only. The enhanced formation of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites was not due to compensatory changes of 5-lipoxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase activating protein but rather an apparent substrate diversion. L-12LO-deficient mice have no obvious abnormalities in reticulocyte or mature red blood cells, which suggest that in mice this pathway is not functionally important for erythrocytic development. Indices for oxidation of low density lipoprotein (measured as either thiobarbituric -reactive substances or the oxidant stress marker isoprostane 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha) were identical in incubations with unstimulated wild-type and L-12LO-deficient macrophages, but the zymosan-induced increase observed with wild-type macrophages was abolished in L-12LO-deficient cells.

Despite comparably equivalent bacterial uptake, few viable intracellular LM were recovered at T = 24 for all test samples, indicating that, regardless of the dietary treatment, PEC were able to handle the in vitro LM infection. This bacterial clearance was accompanied by equivalent NO generation by PEC from each dietary group in response to LM. Summarily, dietary FS produced significant changes in fatty  composition of serum and PEC, inhibited O2- generation by PEC, and was ineffectual to both NO production by and antilisterial activity of PEC.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20689730>Eicosanoids in the innate immune response: TLR and non-TLR routes.</a></h2><p>The variable array of pattern receptor expression in different cells of the innate immune system explains the induction of distinct patterns of  (AA) metabolism. Peptidoglycan and mannan were strong stimuli in neutrophils, whereas the fungal extract zymosan was the most potent stimulus in monocyte-derived dendritic cells since it induced the production of PGE(2), PGD(2), and several cytokines including a robust IL-10 response. Zymosan activated kappaB-binding activity, but inhibition of NF-kappaB was associated with enhanced IL-10 production. In contrast, treatments acting on CREB (CRE binding protein), including PGE(2), showed a direct correlation between CREB activation and IL-10 production.

Large retrospective and prospective population-based studies have shown that the use of both nonselective, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective COX-2 inhibitors are associated with decreased colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rate. A majority of animal studies provide strong evidence that prevention of intestinal tumors is more efficiently accomplished by COX-2 selective inhibition rather than by COX-1 suppression. The inducible COX-2 isoform is overexpressed in colorectal tissues and is associated with critical events of tumorigenesis. COX-2 expression correlates with expression of angiogenic factors and new blood vessel formation. Inhibition of COX-2 favors apoptosis and causes a dose-dependent decline of tumor growth and metastasis in these models. These data, together with the fact that COX-2 inhibitors cause less toxic side effects compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, render these new compounds promising candidates in chemoprevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. Results from initial clinical trials suggest that COX-2 inhibitors may be able to reduce the polyp burden in patients with familial polyposis coli. However, further clinical studies are needed to evaluate whether COX-2 inhibition will be effective in all types of colorectal tumor tissues. This is especially true for neoplastic lesions that express COX-2 at a lower level (eg, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) and for colorectal tumors of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In summary, COX-2 inhibitors represent a new and very promising group of chemotherapeutic agents with great potential for both colorectal cancer prevention and treatment.Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Nutritionally adequate semipurified diets containing at 10% either corn oil (CO) or fish oil (FO) were fed from 1 mo of age and were monitored for proteinuria and survival. Proteinuria was detected earlier and became progressively severe in CO-fed mice. The average life span was significantly shortened by the CO diet (266.7 days +/- 12.5), whereas FO extended the survival significantly (402.1 days +/- 26.1; p < 0.001). A cross-sectional study at 6.5 mo of age revealed an increased proliferative response to T cell mitogens including bacterial superantigens and decreased serum anti-dsDNA Ab titers in the FO group compared with the CO group. Furthermore, splenocytes from the FO group when stimulated with Con A had higher IL-2 and lower IL-4 production similar to that of young (3.5 mo) mice. Flow cytometric analyses of splenocytes revealed lower Ig+, higher lymphocyte endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and lower Pgp-1+ cells within CD4+ and CD8+ subsets in FO-fed mice. Also, elevated IL-2 and IL-4 and significantly higher TGF-beta 1 and lower c-myc and c-ras mRNA expression and higher TGF-beta 1 and significantly lower c-Myc and c-Ha-Ras proteins were detected in spleens of FO-fed mice.

Then, association between these mutations with metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes was investigated using Ï correlation coefficients for variables and logistic regression.The results showed that among 50 diabetic participants, 68% of patients have the mutant allele for rs174537 in FADS1 gene.

Because cellular activation during inflammation leads to the release of arachidonate, a stimulator of leukocyte function, we sought to determine whether arachidonate regulates CRIg expression. Adding arachidonate to maturing human macrophages and to prematured CRIg(+) macrophages caused a significant decrease in the expression of cell-surface CRIg and CRIg mRNA. This effect was independent of the metabolism of arachidonate via the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, because it was not inhibited by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic . Studies with specific pharmacological inhibitors of arachidonate-mediated signaling pathways showed that protein kinase C was involved. Administration of dexamethasone to macrophages caused an increase in CRIg expression. Studies with proinflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines showed that IL-10 increased, but interferon-Î³, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-Î²1 decreased CRIg expression on macrophages. This down- and up-regulation of CRIg expression was reflected in a decrease and increase, respectively, in the phagocytosis of complement opsonized Candida albicans. These data suggest that a unique inflammatory mediator network regulates CRIg expression and point to a mechanism by which arachidonate and dexamethasone have reciprocal effects on inflammation.Copyright Â© 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

PPARs limit the action of type 1 , in which classically activated macrophages act through the production of proinflammatory signals, to spare the parasites.

Both the reduction of cytokine levels and the decrease in  levels in these cells, induced by DGLA, were dose dependent, suggesting a shift in eicosanoid-subtype synthesis. However, although some DGLA-derived eicosanoids similarly reduced TNF-alpha levels, the effects of DGLA were probably not mediated by COX products, as the addition of indomethacin did not alter the effects of DGLA. In conclusion, these results suggest that DGLA affects cytokine production by human PBMC independently of COX activation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18847518>Session 3: Joint Nutrition Society and Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute Symposium on 'Nutrition and autoimmune disease' PUFA, inflammatory processes and rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease manifested by swollen and painful joints, bone erosion and functional impairment. The joint lesions are characterised by infiltration of T lymphocytes, macrophages and B lymphocytes into the synovium and by synovial inflammation involving eicosanoids, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. In relation to inflammatory processes, the main fatty acids of interest are the n-6 PUFA , which is the precursor of inflammatory eicosanoids such as PGE2 and leukotriene B4, and the n-3 PUFA EPA and DHA, which are found in oily fish and fish oils. Eicosanoids derived from the n-6 PUFA  play a role in RA, and the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in RA indicates the importance of pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase pathway products of  in the pathophysiology of the disease. EPA and DHA inhibit  metabolism to inflammatory eicosanoids. EPA also gives rise to eicosanoid mediators that are less inflammatory than those produced from  and both EPA and DHA give rise to resolvins that are anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving. In addition to modifying the lipid mediator profile, n-3 PUFA exert effects on other aspects of  relevant to RA such as antigen presentation, T-cell reactivity and inflammatory cytokine production. Fish oil has been shown to slow the development of arthritis in an animal model and to reduce disease severity. Randomised clinical trials have demonstrated a range of clinical benefits in patients with RA that include reducing pain, duration of morning stiffness and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2503285>The relationship of insulin antibodies, platelet-fixing immune complexes and platelet-associated IgG to in vitro platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 synthesis in childhood type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>The relationship of insulin antibodies, platelet-fixing soluble immune complexes and platelet associated IgG to in vitro platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 synthesis was studied in a group of children with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.

The consequences of mild dietary Zn restriction were examined in two mouse models of inflammation and recovery.Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a Zn adequate diet (ZA, 30 mg Zn/kg diet), or diets containing sub-optimal Zn levels (ZM, 15 mg Zn/kg diet; ZD, 10 mg Zn/kg diet) for 30 days before a thioglycollate peritonitis challenge. Plasma lipid profiles were distinct, with greater Zn restriction resulting in a greater impact on metabolites. The milder ZM diet was selected for immune studies. Peritoneal macrophages from ZM mice displayed increased phagocytosis and amplified pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNFÎ±) release compared to ZA, at baseline and after a secondary LPS challenge. Splenocytes isolated from ZM mice displayed an increase in IL-6 and a reduction in anti-inflammatory IL-4 compared to ZA. Cytokine levels in plasma were unaltered.

Through specialized receptors, known as pattern recognition receptors, especially Toll-like receptors, specialized cells of myeloid origin, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are able to phagocytose microorganisms and induce an innate inflammatory response. Although B and T lymphocytes recognize tissue antigens with high specificity, they are unable to initiate immune responses. The decision to activate an appropriate immune response is made by unique DC, the most professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) which control the responses of several types of lymphocytes and play central role in the transition between innate and adaptive . Increased secretion of inflammatory endogenous mediators such as cytokines and -derived lipid mediators, also termed eicosanoids, can activate APC, particularly DC, which in turn induce an adaptive immune response. There is an increasing evidence that eicosanoids play an important role in connecting innate and adaptive  by acting on cells of both systems. Prostanoids, a major class of eicosanoids, have a great impact on inflammatory and immune responses. PGE(2) is one of the best known and most well-characterized prostanoids in terms of immunomodulation. Although cytokines are known as key regulators of , eicosanoids, including PGE(2), PGD(2), LTB(4), and LTC(4), may also affect cells of immune system by modulating cytokine release, cell differentiation, survival, migration, antigen presentation, and apoptosis.

Monoenes and saturated fatty acids had little effect on T-cell proliferation. Eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  exerted a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation of mitogen- or antigen-stimulated T-cells, similar to that observed for . Sixty microM of albumin-bound eicosapentaenoic  or  promoted 25-40% inhibition of proliferation of T-cells stimulated with mitogen, whereas the same concentration of albumin-bound docosahexaenoic  promoted 60% inhibition. When epidermal cells (Langerhans cells) were used as antigen-presenting cells, 100 microM of albumin-bound eicosapentaenoic  or  caused 40% inhibition on T-cell proliferation. Low density lipoprotein (LDL), isolated after four months of dietary intake of fish oil or corn oil, inhibited mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Fish oil- and corn oil-enriched LDL showed similar ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation. Epidermal cells preincubated with docosahexaenoic , and extensively washed before adding purified T-cells and antigen, resulted in a strong inhibition of T-cell proliferation, whereas preincubation of purified T-cells with docosahexaenoic  did not cause any inhibitory effect. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin, acetylsalicylic , nordihydroguaertic ) did not affect the antiproliferative effect of eicosapentaenoic  and , neither did the antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene or alpha-tocopherol. Eicosanoids, (PGE2, PGE3, LTB4, LTB5 and lipoxin A or lipoxin B) added directly to mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) did not influence T-cell proliferation significantly. Decreased viability was observed when mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes were cultured with essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, whereas the viability of unstimulated lymphocytes was hardly influenced by the same fatty acids.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE), an  pathway metabolite and mediator of chronic inflammation, has emerged as a powerful immunosuppressor in the TME through engagement with one or more of its 4 receptors (EP1-EP4). We have developed E7046, an orally bioavailable EP4-specific antagonist and show here that E7046 has specific and potent inhibitory activity on PGE-mediated pro-tumor myeloid cell differentiation and activation. E7046 treatment reduced the growth or even rejected established tumors  in a manner dependent on both myeloid and CD8 T cells. Furthermore, co-administration of E7046 and E7777, an IL-2-diphtheria toxin fusion protein that preferentially kills Tregs, synergistically disrupted the myeloid and Treg immunosuppressive networks, resulting in effective and durable anti-tumor immune responses in mouse tumor models. In the TME, E7046 and E7777 markedly increased ratios of CD8granzymeB cytotoxic T cells (CTLs)/live Tregs and of M1-like/M2TAM, and converted a chronic inflammation phenotype into acute inflammation, shown by substantial induction of STAT1/IRF-1 and IFNÎ³-controlled genes. Notably, E7046 also showed synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, which have been reported to diminish intratumoral Tregs.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (10(6) cells/ml) were stimulated with 0.25% phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and the proliferative response was determined from the uptake of tritiated thymidine. Scoparone (10(-6) to 3 x 10(-4) M) reduced the proliferative response in a dose-dependent manner. The proliferative response of mononuclear cells to mixed lymphocyte reaction was also reduced by scoparone (10(-5) to 10(-4) M). Interleukin-1, interleukin-2 production and interleukin-2 receptor expression were all reduced in the presence of scoparone. Scoparone (10 and 30 microM) significantly reduced the suppression elicited by the diabetogenic drug, alloxan (10 mM). The suppressive activity of scoparone was significantly reduced by quinacrine (a phospholipase A2 inhibitor), indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and nordihydroguaiaretic  (a lipoxygenase inhibitor).

In addition, eicosanoids also mediate these cellular immune reactions in various insects, resulting in clearing the bacteria circulating in the hemolymph. This study investigated a hypothesis on signal cross-talk between both types of immune mediators in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, which had been observed in the effect of eicosanoids on mediating the cellular immune responses. In response to bacterial infection, octopamine or 5-HT markedly enhanced both hemocytic phagocytosis and nodule formation in S. exigua larvae. Their specific antagonists, phentolamine (an octopamine antagonist) or ketanserin (a 5-HT antagonist) suppressed both cellular immune responses of S. exigua.

The recognition signal will propagate to nearby immune effectors. It is well-known that Toll signal pathway induces antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression. Eicosanoids play crucial roles in mediating the recognition signal to immune effectors by enhancing humoral immune response through activation of AMP synthesis as well as cellular immune responses, suggesting a functional cross-talk between Toll and eicosanoid signals. This study tested a cross-talk between these two signals. Two signal transducing factors (MyD88 and Pelle) of Toll immune pathway were identified in Spodoptera exigua. RNA interference (RNAi) of either SeMyD88 or SePelle expression interfered with the expression of AMP genes under Toll signal pathway. Bacterial challenge induced PLA enzyme activity. However, RNAi of these two immune factors significantly suppressed the induction of PLA enzyme activity. Furthermore, RNAi treatment prevented gene expression of cellular PLA. Inhibition of PLA activity reduced phenoloxidase activity and subsequent suppression in cellular immune response measured by hemocyte nodule formation. However, immunosuppression induced by RNAi of Toll signal molecules was significantly reversed by addition of  (AA), a catalytic product of PLA. The addition also significantly reduced the enhanced fungal susceptibility of S.Â exigua treated by RNAi against two Toll signal molecules.

Macrophages, the most important cells in host defence and control of invasive amoebiasis, in infected animals have been found to be deficient in effector functions and accessory cell potential. However, little is known of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the down-regulation. This study investigated whether macrophage dysfunction in amoebiasis is associated with altered macrophage  (AA) metabolism. Resident peritoneal macrophages (PMO) from naive gerbils produced enhanced levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in response to live E. histolytica trophozoites, to diffusible excretory/secretory products released from live amoebae in millicells and to freeze-thawed soluble amoebic proteins that were inhibitable by indomethacin (INDO) and nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA), respectively. In contrast to PMO from naive gerbils, PMO from animals with amoebic liver abscesses at 10, 20 and 30 days post-infection (p.i.) released high basal levels of PGE2 and LTC4. In response to zymosan stimulation, PMO from infected animals produced two- and fourfold less PGE2 and LTC4, respectively, as compared to uninfected controls. AMO showed high constitutive basal release of PGE2 and LTC4. In response to amoebic and zymosan stimulation, AMO at 10 days p.i. produced significantly higher levels of PGE2 than AMO at 20 days p.i., while AMO at 30 days p.i. were refractory to stimulation to produce higher than basal levels of PGE2. Early (10 days) and late (20-30 days) AMO were refractory to amoebic and zymosan stimulation for enhanced LTC4 release. Pretreatment of AMO with AA substrate restored optimal PGE2 and LTC4 biosynthesis, but the cells were generally unresponsive to zymosan stimulation to produce augmented levels of LTC4. These results strongly suggest that intrinsic or secreted products or both from E. histolytica can induce profound alteration of eicosanoid formation in cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in macrophages from naive and infected animals and that AA metabolism by AMO is sequentially modified during the course of the disease.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15240920>5-Lipoxygenase Pathway, Dendritic Cells, and Adaptive .</a></h2><p>5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway is the major source of potent proinflammatory leukotrienes (LTs) issued from the metabolism of  (AA), and best known for their roles in the pathogenesis of asthma.

Levels of LTC4 were stimulated 5 min after light onset (prior to detectable shedding) and declined below dark levels as shedding progressed.

In this study FA-GPL remodeling was investigated in resting and proliferating primary human T cells. Significant changes were measured in the composition and distribution of FAs in GPLs following receptor activation of human T cells. The FA distribution of proliferating T cells was very similar to that of the human Jurkat T cell line and when the stimulus was removed from proliferating T cells, they stopped proliferating and the FA distribution largely reverted back to that of resting T cells. The cellular content of saturated and monounsaturated FAs was significantly increased in proliferating cells, which was associated with an induction of FA synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 gene expression. Additionally, cellular arachidonate was redistributed in GPLs in a distinct pattern that was unlike any other FAs. This redistribution was associated with an induction of CoA-dependent and CoA-independent remodeling. Accordingly, significant changes in the expression of several acyl-CoA synthetases, lysophospholipid acyltransferases, and phospholipase A2 were measured. Overall, these results suggest that metabolic pathways are activated in proliferating T cells that may represent fundamental changes associated with human cell proliferation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29312832>Lipid raft localization of TLR2 and its co-receptors is independent of membrane lipid composition.</a></h2><p>Toll like receptors (TLRs) are an important and evolutionary conserved class of pattern recognition receptors associated with innate . The recognition of Gram-positive cell wall constituents strongly depends on TLR2. In order to be functional, TLR2 predominantly forms a heterodimer with TLR1 or TLR6 within specialized membrane microdomains, the lipid rafts. The membrane lipid composition and the physicochemical properties of lipid rafts are subject to modification by exogenous fatty acids. Previous investigations of our group provide evidence that macrophage enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) induces a reordering of lipid rafts and non-rafts based on the incorporation of supplemented PUFA as well as their elongation and desaturation products.In the present study we investigated potential constraining effects of membrane microdomain reorganization on the clustering of TLR2 with its co-receptors TLR1 and TLR6 within lipid rafts. To this end, RAW264.7 macrophages were supplemented with either docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or  (AA) and analyzed for receptor expression and microdomain localization in context of TLR stimulation.Our analyses showed that receptor levels and microdomain localization were unchanged by PUFA supplementation.

Human macrophages express two  (AA) 15-lipoxygenating enzymes classified as ALOX15 and ALOX15B. ALOX15, which was first described in 1975, has been extensively characterized and its biological functions have been investigated in a number of cellular systems and animal models. In macrophages, ALOX15 functions to generate specific phospholipid (PL) oxidation products crucial for orchestrating the nonimmunogenic removal of apoptotic cells (ACs) as well as synthesizing precursor lipids required for production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that facilitate inflammation resolution. The discovery of ALOX15B in 1997 was followed by comprehensive analyses of its structural properties and reaction specificities with PUFA substrates. Although its enzymatic properties are well described, the biological functions of ALOX15B are not fully understood. In contrast to ALOX15 whose expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages is strictly dependent on Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, ALOX15B is constitutively expressed.

These units can be highly diverse in their amino  sequences, but absolutely conserved signature amino  positions are identifiable. NPA units are helix-rich and possibly fold as four helix bundle proteins. The NPA units have relatively non-specific lipid binding activities, binding fatty acids and retinoids, with dissociation constants similar to those of lipid transport proteins of vertebrates. Fluorescence-based analysis has indicated that, like most lipid transport proteins, the ligand is taken into the binding site in its entirety, but the binding site environment is unusual. NPAs are synthesised in the gut of nematodes, and presumably act to distribute small lipids from the gut, via the pseudocoelomic fluid, to consuming tissues (muscles, gonads, etc.). In some species, one of the units has a histidine-rich extension peptide which binds haems and certain divalent metal ions. NPAs appear to be released by parasitic nematodes, and may thereby be involved in modification of the local inflammatory and immunological environment of the tissues they inhabit by delivering or sequestering pharmacologically active lipids - they are known to bind  acids and some of its metabolites, lysophospholipids, and retinoids.

Evidence is presented supporting a hypothesis of Pb-induced immunosuppression stemming from altered fatty  metabolism, and mediated by eicosanoids and macrophages (MO). Chronic Pb exposure increases the proportion of arachidonate (ArA) among fatty acids in lipid from avian tissues, and this change provides precursors for eicosanoids, the oxygenated derivatives of ArA that mediate MO acute inflammatory response. In the current study, we showed that the concentration of ArA in phospholipids of MO elicited from turkey poults fed 100 ppm dietary Pb acetate was twice that of controls. In vitro production of eicosanoids by these MO was substantially increased, and this effect was most pronounced following lipopolysaccharide stimulation: prostaglandin F2 alpha was increased 11-fold, thromboxane B2 increased threefold, and prostaglandin E2 increased by 1.5 times. In vitro phagocytic potential of these MO was suppressed, such that the percentage of MO engulfing sheep red blood cell (RBC) targets was reduced to half that of control MO. In vivo susceptibility of Pb-treated and control birds to Gram-negative bacteria challenge was also evaluated. The morbidity of chicks inoculated with Salmonella gallinarum and fed either control or 200 ppm Pb acetate-supplemented diets was similar, except early in the course of the disease when mortality among Pb-treated birds was marginally greater.

We report that dietary fatty  (FA) composition is sensed by the NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages. For this purpose, we have analysed three roles of FA supplementation: as a priming signal for ATP-activated macrophages, in determining where the administration of dietary FAs interferes with LPS-mediated inflammasome activation and by inducing inflammasome activation per se. In this study, we confirm that saturated (SFAs) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and stimulated the secretion of the IL-1Î² cytokine, while PUFAs were mainly inhibitors.

The antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal defense have not been defined. We found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein A-I. The predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic , cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. Normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. Removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. Furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide HNP-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against P. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

However, components of the immune system can become dysregulated such that their activities are directed against host tissues, so causing damage. Lymphocytes are involved in both the beneficial and detrimental effects of the immune system. Both the level of fat and the types of fatty  present in the diet can affect lymphocyte functions. The fatty  composition of lymphocytes, and other immune cells, is altered according to the fatty  composition of the diet and this alters the capacity of those cells to produce eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E2, which are involved in immunoregulation. A high fat diet can impair lymphocyte function. Cell culture and animal feeding studies indicate that oleic, linoleic, conjugated linoleic, gamma-linolenic, dihomo-gamma-linolenic, , alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids can all influence lymphocyte proliferation, the production of cytokines by lymphocytes, and natural killer cell activity. High intakes of some of these fatty acids are necessary to induce these effects. Among these fatty acids the long chain n-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic , appear to be the most potent when included in the human diet. Although not all studies agree, it appears that fish oil, which contains eicosapentaenoic , down regulates the T-helper 1-type response which is associated with chronic inflammatory disease. There is evidence for beneficial effects of fish oil in such diseases; this evidence is strongest for rheumatoid arthritis. Since n-3 fatty acids also antagonise the production of inflammatory eicosanoid mediators from , there is potential for benefit in asthma and related diseases. Recent evidence indicates that fish oil may be of benefit in some asthmatics but not others.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8394139>Antioxidants impair the coupling of cell-surface ligand receptors to the inositol lipid signalling pathway in human T lymphocytes but not in Jurkat T lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

Previous evidence has suggested that the generation of leukotrienes may play an intermediary role in coupling the ligation of T lymphoid cell-surface structures to the inositol lipid signalling system in these cells (A.R. Mire-Sluis et al. (1989) FEBS Lett. 258, 84-88). Here we have studied the actions of two novel selective leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors, MK 886 and BW A4C and of two general lipid soluble antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) on this pathway. Neither MK 886 nor BW A4C abrogated stimulation of inositol lipid breakdown following PHA or anti CD3 treatment of T lymphocytes. By contrast, this pathway was inhibited by BHT and BHA. These observations, together with our failure to demonstrate the generation of lipoxygenase products following PHA stimulation of T lymphocytes, suggests that an antioxidant-sensitive step other than the generation of leukotrienes plays a critical role in coupling cell-surface receptors to the inositol lipid signalling system in these cells. By contrast none of these inhibitors abrogated ligand-stimulated inositol lipid signalling in Jurkat T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells.

PGs and related eicosanoids are oxygenated derivatives of  (AA) and two other C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids. PGs are mostly appreciated in the context of biomedicine, but a growing body of literature indicates the biological significance of these compounds extends throughout the animal kingdom, and possibly beyond. The actions of most PGs are mediated by specific receptors. Biomedical research has discovered a great deal of knowledge about PG receptors in mammals, including their structures, pharmacology, molecular biology and cellular locations. Studies of PG receptors in insects lag behind the biomedical background, however, recent results hold the promise of accelerated research in this area. A PG receptor has been identified in a class of lepidopteran hemocytes and experimentally linked to the release of prophenoloxidase. PGs act in several crucial areas of insect biology. In reproduction, a specific PG, PGE(2), releases oviposition behavior in most crickets and a few other insect species; PGs also mediate events in egg development in some species, which may represent all insects. PGs play major roles in modulating fluid secretion in Malpighian tubules, rectum and salivary glands, although, again, this has been studied in only a few insect species that may represent the Class. Insect  is a very complex defense system. PGs and other eicosanoids mediate a large number of immune reactions to infection and invasion. We conclude that research into PGs and their receptors in insects will lead to important advances in our understanding of insect biology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8060955>[The mechanisms and mediators of ocular inflammation].</a></h2><p>The humoral and cellular  responses are essential components of the inflammation.

We tested the effects of highly purified DHA on M phi activation in vitro. M phi were stimulated with rIFN-gamma plus either of two second or "triggering" signals, LPS or heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes. M phi activation was assayed as the lysis of P815 mastocytoma cells, which are resistant to TNF-alpha. DNA inhibited the activation of peritoneal M phi and the M phi line RAW264.7 in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations between 20 and 160 microM. These concentrations are found in fetal and neonatal rodent sera. Another polyunsaturated fatty ,  (20:4n6), was much less inhibitory. In contrast to its profound effect on tumoricidal activation, DHA did not inhibit phagocytosis and catabolism of 125I-heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes. Increasing the rIFN-gamma or second signals reduced the inhibition of tumoricidal activation by DHA but not M phi incorporation of 14C-DHA. When the rIFN-gamma and second signals were separated in time, DHA was far more inhibitory if delivered with the triggering signal than if delivered with the rIFN-gamma. However, the incorporation of 14C-DHA was the same under these two conditions. In M phi treated with DHA during LPS stimulation, the inhibition was time-dependent, requiring more than 2 h. Although DHA inhibits cyclooxygenase activity, its inhibition of M phi activation was not reversed with the following cyclooxygenase products: PGE2, a stable TXA2 analog (U-46, 619) or a stable PGI2 analog (Iloprost). Although DHA is metabolized by lipoxygenases, the inhibition was not reversed by the lipoxygenase inhibitors 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraynoic  and nordihydroguaiaretic .

Our studies demonstrate that PGE(2) protects DC in vitro against apoptosis induced by withdrawal of growth factors or ceramide. DC matured in conditions that inhibit endogenous PGE(2) release are highly susceptible to apoptosis and exogenous PGE(2) re-establishes the more resistant phenotype. The antiapoptotic effect is mediated through EP-2/EP-4 receptors and involves the PI3K --> Akt pathway. PGE(2) leads to increased phosphorylation of Akt, protection against mitochondrial membrane compromise, and decreased caspase 3 activity. Macroarray data indicate that PGE(2) leads to the down-regulation of a number of proapoptotic molecules, i.e., BAD, several caspases, and granzyme B. In vivo, higher numbers of immature and Ag-loaded CFSE-labeled DC are present in the draining lymph nodes of mice inoculated with PGE(2) receptor agonists, compared with animals treated with ibuprofen or controls injected with PBS.

In an earlier study, we showed that these fatty acids can induce free radical generation in human neutrophils and tumor cells. Here we show that cis-unsaturated fatty acids augment free radical generation and lipid peroxidation in human T-cells. The growth suppressive action of cis-unsaturated fatty acids on human T-cells could be blocked by anti-oxidant, vitamin E and the superoxide anion quencher superoxide dismutase. These results suggest that c-UFAs-induced cell growth suppression is a free radical dependent process.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25802299>Inducible Expression of a Resistance-Nodulation-Division-Type Efflux Pump in Staphylococcus aureus Provides Resistance to Linoleic and  Acids.</a></h2><p>Although Staphylococcus aureus is exposed to antimicrobial fatty acids on the skin, in nasal secretions, and in abscesses, a specific mechanism of inducible resistance to this important facet of innate  has not been identified. Here, we have sequenced the genome of S. aureus USA300 variants selected for their ability to grow at an elevated concentration of linoleic . The fatty -resistant clone FAR7 had a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in an HâââY substitution in an uncharacterized transcriptional regulator belonging to the AcrR family, which was divergently transcribed from a gene encoding a member of the resistance-nodulation-division superfamily of multidrug efflux pumps. We named these genes farR and farE, for regulator and effector of fatty  resistance, respectively. Several lines of evidence indicated that FarE promotes efflux of antimicrobial fatty acids and is regulated by FarR. First, expression of farE was strongly induced by  and linoleic acids in an farR-dependent manner. Second, an HâââY substitution in FarR resulted in increased expression of farE and was alone sufficient to promote increased resistance of S. aureus to linoleic . Third, inactivation of farE resulted in a significant reduction in the inducible resistance of S. aureus to the bactericidal activity of 100 Î¼M linoleic , increased accumulation of [(14)C]linoleic  by growing cells, and severely impaired growth in the presence of nonbactericidal concentrations of linoleic . Cumulatively, these findings represent the first description of a specific mechanism of inducible resistance to antimicrobial fatty acids in a Gram-positive pathogen.Staphylococcus aureus colonizes approximately 25% of humans and is a leading cause of human infectious morbidity and mortality. To persist on human hosts, S. aureus must have intrinsic defense mechanisms to cope with antimicrobial fatty acids, which comprise an important component of human innate defense mechanisms. We have identified a novel pair of genes, farR and farE, that constitute a dedicated regulator and effector of S. aureus resistance to linoleic and  acids, which are major fatty acids in human membrane phospholipid. Expression of farE, which encodes an efflux pump, is induced in an farR-dependent mechanism, in response to these antimicrobial fatty acids that would be encountered in a tissue abscess.Copyright Â© 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

The more important changes observed, in activated relative to quiescent cells, started after 24 h and consisted in an increase in the proportion of oleic (18:1(n - 9)), docosapentaenoic (22:5(n - 3)) and docosahexaenoic (22:6(n - 3)) acids and a decrease in that of linoleic (18:2(n - 6)) and  (20:4(n - 6)) acids. This represented a relative increase of 26% for 18:1, 56% for 22:5 and 84% for 22:6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and 35%, 182% and 94%, respectively, in purified T-lymphocytes, both activated for 72 h. The decrease in n - 6 fatty acids was of 42% for 18:2 and 14% for 20:4 in PBMC and 30% and 19%, respectively, for 72 h.

The 18:1/18:0 ratio increased greatly in major cell phospholipids. The proportion of 20:4, 22:5 and 22:6 in phosphatidylinositol was not significantly altered after 72 h of activation. The molar ratio cholesterol/phospholipids was reduced in 72-h-activated lymphocytes (0.29) compared to quiescent cells (0.5). On the other hand, the stimulation of human T-lymphocytes caused a significant decrease in the order parameter (S) of DPH, according to the observed changes in lipid composition. After 72 h in culture, the S value for quiescent and stimulated T-lymphocytes was 0.530 and 0.326, respectively. In conclusion, the blastic transformation of human T-lymphocytes is associated with changes in lipid composition which modify the physical properties of their membranes. These modifications could modulate, in turn, the activity of membrane proteins implicated in the process of blastic transformation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19247743>Propofol inhibits cyclo-oxygenase activity in human monocytic THP-1 cells.</a></h2><p>Monocytes/macrophages are key players in innate and adaptive .

We investigated the effect of propofol on prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) production by the human monocytic cell line THP-1.The THP-1 cells were cultured with lipopolysaccharide (1 microg ml(-1)) in the presence of clinically relevant sedative/anesthetic concentrations of propofol (0-30 microM) for 18 h, and the concentration of prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) in culture supernatants was measured using an enzyme immunoassay. Intracellular cyclooxygenase protein expression was measured by flow cytometry. Cyclooxygenase activity was assessed by measuring production of prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) by THP-1 cells after  (10 microM) substrate provision.Propofol decreased the production of prostaglandin E(2) (75.4 +/- 6.4 pg ml(-1) at 0 microM vs. 28.5 +/- 11.2 pg ml(-1) at 30 microM; P < 0.001) and thromboxane B(2) (282.4 +/- 79.2 pg ml(-1) at 0 microM vs. 40.4 +/- 21.7 pg ml(-1) at 30 microM; P < 0.001). The inhibition was not due to the decreased cyclooxygenase protein expression because intracellular staining of this enzyme was not affected by propofol. After  provision, prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) production from activated THP-1 cells was significantly (P < 0.001) decreased with propofol, indicating direct suppression of cyclooxygenase activity with propofol.Propofol may modulate inflammation via the suppression of cyclooxygenase activity.

HuPrP82-146 or amyloid-beta1-42 induced phenotypic changes in neurons that caused them to bind a CD14-IgG chimera. In co-cultures microglial cells produced interleukin (IL)-6 in response to HuPrP82-146 or amyloid-beta1-42 damaged neurons. The binding of the CD14-IgG chimera to HuPrP82-146 or amyloid-beta1-42 damaged neurons was reduced by pre-treatment with cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 inhibitors and in co-cultures, COX-1 inhibitors significantly increased neuronal survival. Studies with individual prostaglandins demonstrated that the addition of prostaglandin D2, or prostaglandin E2, but not other prostaglandins (F2alpha, H2, I2 or 15-dJ2), mimicked the effects of amyloid-beta1-42 on neurons. Thus, prostaglandin D2 or E2 damaged neurons bound the CD14-IgG chimera, and in co-cultures prostaglandin D2 damaged neurons activated microglial cells. These effects were mediated via the DP prostanoid receptor; DP receptor agonists BW245C or SQ27986 induced neuronal damage, while the DP receptor antagonist BWA868C was neuroprotective in co-cultures. These results indicate that prostaglandin D2, produced following activation of COX-1 by sub-lethal concentrations of HuPrP82-146 or amyloid-beta1-42, causes phenotypic changes in neurons that activates microglial cells and leads to neuronal loss.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10697856>15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE), a product of  peroxidation, is an active component of hemozoin toxicity to monocytes.</a></h2><p>Several studies have shown that human and murine hemozoin-fed phagocytes are functionally impaired. Unpurified hemozoin contains unspecifically attached unsaturated fatty acids such as  and linolenic acids. The presence in unpurified hemozoin of large quantities of ferric heme with small amounts of free iron makes hemozoin a generator of oxidative radicals capable of forming lipoperoxides or other breakdown products from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Here we show that delipidized hemozoin had reduced toxicity to monocytes. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-elicited burst was poorly affected by delipidized hemozoin (ca. 17% and 21% burst inhibition by delipidized hemozoin vs ca. 75% and 65% burst inhibition by native hemozoin at 20 min or 17 h post-phagocytosis, respectively). Analysis of the lipid fraction isolated from native hemozoin by HPLC and chiral-phase HPLC showed equimolar amounts of 15(R)- and 15(S)-HETE (HETE, 15-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic ), most likely by-products of non-enzymatic peroxidation of .

Approximately 84% of 15-HETE attached to hemozoin was in the esterified form. A large preponderance of esterified over free 15-HETE was also noted in supernatants of hemozoin-fed monocytes and in hemozoin-fed monocytes. In the latter cells, remarkable levels of the substance were attained. A dose-dependent curve of inhibition of PMA-elicited oxidative burst was observed. Assuming homogenuous distribution of 15-HETE in hemozoin-fed monocytes, 15(S)-HETE concentrations measured in hemozoin-fed monocytes (8 muMol) would bring about ca. 85% inhibition of PMA-elicited burst.

However, such roles of COX in fish remain largely unknown. In this study, we designed three semi-purified diets, namely ARA-free (control), ARA, and ARA + acetylsalicylic  (ASA; a COX inhibitor), and used them to feed grass carp (27.65Â Â±Â 3.05Â g) for 8Â weeks. The results showed that dietary ARA significantly increased the amount of ARA in the hepatopancreas, muscle, and kidney (PÂ <Â 0.05), whereas this increase was reduced by dietary ASA. The hepatopancreatic prostaglandin E content increased in the ARA group, and this increase was inhibited by ASA (PÂ <Â 0.05). ARA decreased the lipid content in the hepatopancreas, whereas ASA recovered lipid content to a significant level (PÂ <Â 0.05). ARA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase in the hepatopancreas (PÂ <Â 0.05). However, ASA did not rescue the mRNA expression of these genes (PÂ >Â 0.05). Interestingly, ARA significantly enhanced the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± gene expression, and this increase was attenuated by ASA (PÂ <Â 0.05). Finally, ARA significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in the kidney, and ASA attenuated the expression of toll-like receptor 22 and MyD88 (PÂ <Â 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that COX metabolites play important roles in the inhibition of lipid accumulation in the hepatopancreas of grass carp fed with ARA and that regulation of gene expression promotes lipid catabolism rather than lipogenic activities.

As a consequence of this process, the arachidonate levels in membrane phospholipids markedly decrease. We have applied mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling to study the levels of arachidonate-containing phospholipids under inflammatory activation of macrophages. We identify an unusual inositol phospholipid molecule, PI(20:4/20:4), the levels of which do not decrease but actually increase by 300% after activation of the macrophages. PI(20:4/20:4) is formed and degraded rapidly, suggesting a role for this molecule in regulating cell signaling events. Using a metabolipidomic approach consisting in exposing the cells to deuterium-labeled arachidonate at the time they are exposed to stimuli, we show that PI(20:4/20:4) biosynthesis occurs via the sequential incorporation of arachidonate, first into the sn-2 position of a preformed phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecule, followed by the rapid introduction of a second arachidonate moiety into the sn-1 position. Generation requires the participation of cytosolic phospholipase A2Î± and CoA-dependent acyltransferases. PI(20:4/20:4) formation is also detected in vivo in murine peritonitis exudates. Elevating the intracellular concentration of PI(20:4/20:4) by introducing the lipid into the cells results in enhancement of the microbicidal capacity of macrophages, as measured by reactive oxygen metabolite production and lysozyme release.

Resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) and recruited leukocytes (PMNL) mediate cellular defense against bacterial infections in the lung, and phagocytosis and lipid mediator synthesis are important components of their antimicrobial capacity. The objective of this study was to determine if either phagocytic capacity or lipid mediator generation declines with normal aging, in either AMs or PMNL recruited to a site of inflammation. The F344xBN rat hybrid has a lower incidence of pathologies associated with aging, particularly up to 20 months; animals aged 6,12 and 18 months were chosen to evaluate changes associated with normal aging. As previously reported for peripheral blood leukocytes, phagocytosis by recruited PMNL declined with aging: recruited PMNL from 18 months rats showed a significantly decreased capacity to phagocytose live Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria, compared to PMNL from 6 months rats. Surprisingly, however, the phagocytic capacity of AMs increased with aging: the phagocytic index of AMs from 18 months rats was more than three times that of AMs from 6 months rats. The capacity of AMs and recruited PMNL to release  or synthesize leukotrienes or prostaglandins did not change with aging. This study demonstrates that, although phagocytosis by recruited PMNL declines with aging, other aspects of immune function do not decline, and may actually increase, with normal aging.

The infection of MO was associated with a sustained elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP and the release of  (AA) and its metabolite PGE2 (activator of adenylate cyclase) in culture supernatants. The AA release was incidentally associated with TNF-alpha production. Monoclonal antibodies to TNF-alpha and pentoxyphylline (inhibitor of TNF synthesis) inhibited both AA and PGE2 release. The release of AA required protein synthesis and occurred under conditions consistent with the expression of CMV immediate early genes. Treatment of MO cultures at time of infection with 100 microM indomethacin or 1 microg of TNF-alpha mAb abolished the CMV-induced T cell inhibitory activity of the supernatants by 100%.

Recent advances in immunometabolism illuminate the intimate link between the metabolic states of immune cells and their specific functions. In this review, we describe the little-studied biphasic metabolic dynamics of the macrophage response during progression of infection by  and discuss their relevance to macrophage  and  pathogenicity. The early phase of macrophage infection, which is marked by M1 polarization, is accompanied by a metabolic switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1Î±)-mediated aerobic glycolysis (also known as the Warburg effect in cancer cells), as well as by an upregulation of pathways involving oxidative and antioxidative defense responses, arginine metabolism, and synthesis of bioactive lipids. These early metabolic changes are followed by a late adaptation/resolution phase in which macrophages transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, with a consequent dampening of macrophage proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Importantly, the identification of upregulated metabolic pathways and/or metabolic regulatory mechanisms with immunomodulatory functions during M1 polarization has revealed novel mechanisms of  pathogenicity. These advances can lead to the development of novel host-directed therapies to facilitate bacterial clearance in tuberculosis by targeting the metabolic state of immune cells.Copyright Â© 2019 Shi et al.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11237929>Dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic , but not with other long-chain n-3 or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, decreases natural killer cell activity in healthy subjects aged >55 y.</a></h2><p>Animal studies showed that dietary flaxseed oil [rich in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  alpha-linolenic  (ALA)], evening primrose oil [rich in the n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  gamma-linolenic  (GLA)], and fish oil [rich in the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA)] can decrease natural killer (NK) cell activity.

PGE2s appear at this intestinal submucosal level from the metabolism of  mediated by type-2 cyclooxygenases (COX2s) situated in the membranes of many immune cells. The potential risk of repeated inhibition of PGE2 synthesis at a young age has been demonstrated in experiments with animals systemically exposed to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The repeatedly exposed animal cannot develop tolerance to food antigens and exhibits autoimmune deviations. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ibuprofen are analgesic and antipyretic medications given to children either alone or in combination, most often without medical prescription. Recently, it has been demonstrated that paracetamol, like ibuprofen, also carries, besides its central action, a non-selective inhibitory action on peripheral COXs. However, this inhibitory action only relates to physiological concentrations of  and explains the difference in their respective anti-inflammatory effects. Since recently published data have repeatedly reported an increase of immune deviations associated with paracetamol exposure at a young age, it appears important to better understand the possible negative impact of excessive and repetitive inhibitions of the physiological synthesis of prostaglandins by COX2s in childhood during which all immune mechanisms are built up at the intestinal submucosal level. Therefore, a well-designed prospective strategy for pharmacovigilance of these COX inhibitors repeatedly given during childhood is urgently needed.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Furthermore, FcgammaR cross-linking stimulated the release of AA from monocytes. Studies with selective inhibitors revealed that the FcgammaR-mediated activation of PLA2 is dependent on Ca2+ and tyrosine kinase activity. Together these results indicate a key role for PLA2/AA, but not its major metabolites, in mediating the FcgammaR-stimulated intracellular killing of S. aureus by monocytes.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21421891>Intra-amniotic infection upregulates neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) expression at the maternal-fetal interface at term: implications for infection-related preterm birth.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a ubiquitous lipocalin that serves as a critical component of innate  and a transport shuttle for numerous substances (retinoids, , prostaglandins, fatty acids, steroids, iron, and MMPs). Despite the well-documented association between intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) and preterm birth, NGAL expression in the uterus has not previously been examined. This study investigates NGAL expression at the maternal-fetal interface in vivo and in vitro.Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression in term placenta with/without IAI was examined by immunohistochemistry. Trophoblast and decidual stromal cells were retrieved from elective cesarean, purified, and depleted of leukocytes. On days 1 (cytotrophoblast cells) and 4 (syncytiotrophoblast), cells were stimulated with/without interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²; 1 ng/mL), tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±; 1 ng/mL), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 Î¼g/mL). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were measured by immunocytochemistry/Western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively.Under basal conditions, NGAL is expressed in trophoblast, but not decidua. Trophoblast NGAL is significantly upregulated in tissues with evidence of IAI vs controls. NGAL expression was increased after stimulation with all 3 pro-inflammatory mediators in day 1 (cytotrophoblast) but not day 4 cells (syncytiotrophoblast). IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± (not LPS) upregulated NGAL gene expression in cytotrophoblast (not syncytiotrophoblast) cells.Intra-amniotic infection/inflammation is associated with increased expression of NGAL in trophoblast tissues in vivo. IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, and LPS stimulated NGAL in cytotrophoblast cells (not syncytiotrophoblast and decidua) in vitro. These data suggest that, in keeping with its role as a mediator of innate , NGAL may have a central role to play in IAI-induced preterm birth.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23812073>[Resolving factors of inflammation - a bridge between innate  and adaptive ].</a></h2><p>Acute inflammation, a physiologic response to protect cells from microbial infection and other stimuli, is automatically terminated by endogenous anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators to restore homeostatic conditions.

When this critical concentration is reached, the nonenzymatic oxidation of LDL phospholipids produces a series of biologically active, oxidized phospholipids that mediate the cellular events seen in the developing fatty streak. Normal high density lipoprotein (HDL) contains at least 4 enzymes as well as apolipoproteins that can prevent the formation of the LDL-derived oxidized phospholipids or inactivate them after they are formed. In the sense that normal HDL can prevent the formation of or inactivate these inflammatory LDL-derived oxidized phospholipids, normal HDL is anti-inflammatory. HDL from mice that are genetically predisposed to diet-induced atherosclerosis became proinflammatory when the mice are fed an atherogenic diet, injected with LDL-derived oxidized phospholipids, or infected with influenza A virus. Mice that were genetically engineered to be hyperlipidemic on a chow diet and patients with coronary atherosclerosis, despite normal lipid levels, also had proinflammatory HDL.

Variance in plasma LDL cholesterol concentration may be associated with differences in cardiovascular disease risk and high levels of lipids are associated with increased risk of developing atherosclerosis. Macrophages, which generate pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-alpha), are deeply involved in atherosclerosis, as well as mast cells which generate several cytokines, including IL-6 and IFN-gamma, and chemokines such as eotaxin, MCP-1 and RANTES involved in monocyte recruitment and differentiation in the arterial wall. In addition, mast cells participate in lipid retention and vascular cell remodeling, and are mediators of innate and adaptive  during atherosclerosis. Mast cells which accumulate in the human arterial intima and adventitia during atherosclerotic plaque progression, release vasoactive and angiogenic compounds, and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as  metabolites, histamine, cytokines/chemokines, platelet activating factor (PAF) and proteolytic enzymes.

Interleukin (IL)-33 participates in innate and adaptive immunity and  and, acting on CD34+ cells, causes MC differentiation and maturation.

In this study, we have found that phosphatidylcholine carrying a linoleic  molecule or  molecule has the potential to kill steroid-free H. pylori. The bactericidal action of phosphatidylcholines against H. pylori was due to the lytic activity of the phosphatidylcholines themselves and not due to the lytic activity of the unsaturated fatty acids or lyso-phosphatidylcholine resulting from the hydrolysis of the phosphatidylcholines. In contrast to the steroid-free H. pylori, the organism that absorbed and glucosylated free cholesterol was unaffected by the bactericidal action of the phosphatidylcholines. Similarly, H. pylori that absorbed estrone without glucosylating it also resisted the bactericidal action of the phosphatidylcholines. The steroids absorbed by H. pylori existed in both the outer and inner membranes, while the glucosyl-steroids produced via the steroid absorption were localized in the outer membrane rather than in the inner membrane.

The first enzyme in the metabolic pathway for the generation of eicosanoids is group IVA phospholipase A(2), also known as cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha). During phagocytosis, cPLA(2)alpha has been found to translocate to the phagosome, although the molecular mechanism involved in such a translocation has not been elucidated. By using enhanced GFP-tagged proteins we show in this work that a nonphosphorylatable cPLA(2)alpha mutant (S505A) does not translocate to the phagosomes, but a mutant that mimics phosphorylation on Ser(505) (S505E) does it so readily. During phagocytosis, endogenous cPLA(2)alpha is phosphorylated at Ser(505), and inhibitors of JNK, but not of other related kinases such as p38 or the extracellular-regulated kinases 1 and 2, completely block such a phosphorylation. Inhibition of JNK activity also inhibits the translocation of cPLA(2)alpha to phagosomal membranes, as well as  release to the extracellular medium. Moreover, the S505E mutant makes the enzyme refractory to JNK inhibition, translocating normally to phagosomal membranes.

To this latter point, the cellular and subcellular events involved in immune regulation by IC and Fc fragments of Ig have been the focus of numerous investigations. Characterization of cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments from a human IgG1 myeloma protein indicates that one biologically-active site is found in residues 335-357 of the CH3 domain of the molecule. Synthesis of the biologically-active region resulted in a peptide, termed p23, which stimulates mouse and human B cells to secrete polyclonal Ig and activates AA metabolic pathways. In contrast to these findings, p23 is unable to induce B cell proliferation or IL-1 secretion from macrophages. Analysis of data obtained with overlapping peptides, based on p23, suggests that the minimal active sequence needed for B cell differentiation is leu-pro-pro-ser-arg (residues 351-355). In contrast, only p23 or p23 minus the carboxyterminal glu356 and glu357 were able to induce PGE release.

GCs enhanced the mRNA (Northern blot) and protein (Western blot) expression of the calcium and phospholipid binding proteins lipocortin I, II, and V. As a consequence of mitogenic stimulation, PBML secrete PGE2 and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Antiproliferative concentrations of both DEX and PRED as well as recombinant lipocortin I abolished PGE2 and LTB4 production, suggesting an involvement of lipocortins in GC-mediated antiproliferative effects, possibly by inhibiting eicosanoid production and, consequently, mitogen-induced cellular proliferation. Whereas 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic  and nordihydroguaiaretic  mimicked DEX and PRED in inhibiting PGE2 and LTB4 production, neither 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic  nor nordihydroguaiaretic  had any effect on mitogen-induced PBML proliferation, indicating that the GC-mediated antiproliferative effect is separate from their effects on eicosanoid release. Furthermore, neutralizing anti-lipocortin I and anti-lipocortin II mAb, while reversing the inhibitory activity of DEX and PRED on PGE2 and LTB4 production, only partially reversed DEX- and PRED-mediated antiproliferative effects. This indicates that the GC-mediated antiproliferative effect is not dependent on inhibition of eicosanoid release by lipocortins and suggests the existence of lipocortin-dependent and lipocortin-independent pathways by which GCs mediate their antiproliferative effects.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9990674>Mice deficient for 5-lipoxygenase, but not leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase, display altered immune responses during infection with Schistosoma mansoni.</a></h2><p>Periovular granuloma formation during Schistosoma mansoni infection is a complex, multifaceted immunologic response. Products of  metabolism have been shown to contribute to this response through studies in which general inhibitors of lipoxygenase function reduce granulomatous inflammation. To determine which lipoxygenases are important for granuloma development in schistosomiasis, wild type mice or mice deficient for 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) or "leukocyte-type" 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) were infected with S. mansoni and studied for responses to schistosome eggs and egg antigens. At the acute stage of infection, when granuloma formation is usually maximal, 5-LO deficient mice developed smaller granulomas around liver-deposited schistosome eggs compared with wild type or 12-LO deficient mice. 5-LO mice also displayed less antibody-mediated (5 h) and cell-mediated, delayed-type (24 h) hypersensitivity to schistosome egg antigens than did the other two infection groups. In an attempt to determine possible mechanisms for the reduced inflammatory responses, we also measured hepatic mRNA levels of cytokines that have been shown to influence granuloma size (IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma). The mRNA levels for IL-10 were significantly lower in 5-LO-deficient mice, but SEA-stimulated spleen cells did not demonstrate a significant difference in IL-10 production between wild type and 5-LO mice. These data suggest that 5-LO plays a role in host responses to schistosomiasis via a mechanism that cannot be explained solely by changes in expression of these cytokines.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2466802>Human monocytes exposed to Biostim (RU 41740) alter lymphocyte mitogenesis: mechanisms of action.</a></h2><p>The immunomodulatory agent RU 41740 (Biostim), which is derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae, may augment mitogenic responses of purified human blood lymphocytes. In non-purified preparations, however, responses may be sharply reduced due to the fact that Biostim induces monocytes to secrete immunosuppressive factors. This investigation has shown that both these biological activities can be exerted by a single, major glucoprotein fraction of Biostim termed F1. The Biostim-induced suppression of mitogen responses was not blocked by antibodies directed against IFN alpha or IFN gamma, thus speaking against IFN as being a mediator of suppression. Reduced suppression, however, was observed in the presence of drugs which inhibit  transformation. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors meclofenamic  and indomethacin, which diminish biosynthesis of prostaglandins, could partially block the Biostim-induced suppression. Such an effect was not observed with 5,8,11-eicosatrynoic  (ETI) which is an inhibitor of 12-lipoxygenase and leukotriene biosynthesis. Combinations of ETI and meclofenamic , however, were more potent than the latter tested separately. Another drug termed diclofenac Na, which apart from being an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, rapidly clears cells of free  by binding to triglycerides, was found to be the most potent in preventing Biostim-induced suppression of mitogen responses. It is concluded that Biostim-exposed monocytes liberate increased amounts of immunosuppressive eicosanoids such as prostaglandins.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2552225>Comparison of  metabolism by pulmonary intravascular and alveolar macrophages exposed to particulate and soluble stimuli.</a></h2><p>Pulmonary intravascular macrophages, as prominent components of the pulmonary mononuclear phagocyte system, could be significant mediators of lung inflammation. We have shown that intravascular and alveolar macrophages metabolize exogenous  to its inflammatory metabolites via the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways after exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. In this study, we compare the metabolism of endogenous  by porcine intravascular and alveolar macrophages after exposure to soluble and particulate stimuli. Since intravascular and alveolar macrophages are exposed to various stimuli in vivo, it is essential to know the range of inflammatory mediators that these cells can generate. Alveolar macrophages attached to plastic and exposed to the various stimuli produced prostaglandin F2 alpha, 12-hydroxyheptade-catrienoic  (HHT), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE), and leukotriene B4. In contrast, adherent and stimulated intravascular macrophages produced several cyclooxygenase products and lipoxygenase products including 5-HETE, 12-HETE, and leukotriene B4. Both macrophages released large amounts of  upon exposure to each stimulant. Intravascular macrophages that were adherent to plastic or were stimulated with glass, asbestos, or A23187 released significantly (p less than 0.05) more metabolized  than similarly treated alveolar macrophages. The major cyclooxygenase metabolite released by alveolar macrophages was prostaglandin 2 alpha, whereas HHT was the primary metabolite of intravascular macrophages. The major lipoxygenase metabolite released by both macrophage types was 5-HETE, but intravascular macrophages also released substantial amounts of 12-HETE and leukotriene B4. In both macrophage preparations, lipoxygenase products composed most released metabolites. After exposure to iron, asbestos, and A23187 intravascular macrophages released significantly more (p less than 0.05) lipoxygenase metabolites than alveolar macrophages. However, in alveolar macrophages, chrysotile asbestos induced greater activity by the cyclooxygenase pathway than by the lipoxygenase pathway. Both asbestos and iron spheres induced release of  and its metabolites, but the most potent stimulants in both macrophage preparations were A23187, zymosan, and lipopolysaccharide. We conclude that stimulated intravascular macrophages use both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways to metabolize endogenous , that these macrophages are metabolically more active than alveolar macrophages, and that both macrophage types are induced to metabolize  by various particulate and soluble stimuli. Furthermore, we have shown that intravascular macrophages predominantly utilize the lipoxygenase rather than cyclooxygenase pathways to metabolize endogenous .</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19262503>Cyclooxygenase-2 in mucosal DC mediates induction of regulatory T cells in the intestine through suppression of IL-4.</a></h2><p>Oral intake of protein leads to tolerance through the induction of regulatory T cells (Tr cells) in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Here we show that the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in vivo suppressed oral tolerance and was associated with enhanced differentiation of interleukin (IL)-4-producing T cells and reduced Foxp3(+) Tr-cell differentiation in MLN. As a result, the functional suppressive capacity of these differentiated mucosal T cells was lost. IL-4 was causally related to loss of tolerance as treatment of mice with anti-IL-4 antibodies during COX-2 inhibition restored tolerance. Dendritic cells (DCs) in the MLN differentially expressed COX-2 and reductionist experiments revealed that selective inhibition of the enzyme in these cells inhibited Foxp3(+) Tr-cell differentiation in vitro. Importantly, the inhibition of COX-2 in MLN-DC caused increased GATA-3 expression and enhanced IL-4 release by T cells, which was directly related to impaired Tr-cell differentiation.

LTB4 generation by human neutrophils (PMN), however, was unrelated to this haemolytic potential (r = 0.164). In contrast, both prelabelled monocytes and PMN were stimulated by haemolytic strains of E. coli and by haemolytic culture supernatants to release significant amounts of [3H]. There was a significant correlation between haemolytic activity and [3H] release generated by individual strains from monocytes (r = 0.804, P less than 0.001) and PMN (r = 0.888, P less than 0.001). In addition, nonhaemolytic strains but not their culture supernatants were capable of causing slow release of both [3H] and LTB4 from PMN and mononuclear cells. These results suggest that both the possession of haemolytic activity, and the direct interaction of bacteria with the leukocyte surface are mechanisms by which uropathogenic strains of E. coli may cause the release and metabolism of . In addition, there was synergistic augmentation by nonhaemolytic bacteria of the PMN LTB4 response to haemolytic culture supernatants or to low doses of the calcium ionophore A23187. These results support an ionophore-like mechanism for the activation of the cell by haemolysin. LTB4 generation by PMN incubated with haemolytic supernatants was also augmented by particulate zymosan in a manner dependent on the dose of zymosan, suggesting that the direct interaction of E. coli with PMN may involve an activation mechanism similar to that for zymosan. These results demonstrate differing responses of peripheral mononuclear cells and PMN from the same donors to identical strains of E. coli and suggest that the generation of the potent chemotactic agent LTB4 in response to E. coli infection in vivo need not depend solely on the elaboration of cytotoxic haemolysins by individual strains.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21148797>Disruption of leptin receptor-STAT3 signaling enhances leukotriene production and pulmonary host defense against pneumococcal pneumonia.</a></h2><p>The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin regulates energy homeostasis and the innate immune response. We previously reported that leptin plays a protective role in bacterial pneumonia, but the mechanisms by which leptin regulates host defense remain poorly understood. Leptin binding to its receptor, LepRb, activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, STAT5, and STAT3. In this study, we compared the responses of wild-type and s/s mice, which possess a mutant LepRb that prevents leptin-induced STAT3 activation, to determine the role of this signaling pathway in pneumococcal pneumonia. Compared with wild-type animals, s/s mice exhibited greater survival and enhanced pulmonary bacterial clearance after an intratracheal challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae. We also observed enhanced phagocytosis and killing of S. pneumoniae in vitro in alveolar macrophages (AMs) obtained from s/s mice. Notably, the improved host defense and AM antibacterial effector functions in s/s mice were associated with increased cysteinyl-leukotriene production in vivo and in AMs in vitro. Augmentation of phagocytosis in AMs from s/s mice could be blocked using a pharmacologic cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor antagonist. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and cytosolic phospholipase A(2) Î±, known to enhance the release of  for subsequent conversion to leukotrienes, was also increased in AMs from s/s mice stimulated with S. pneumoniae in vitro. These data indicate that ablation of LepRb-mediated STAT3 signaling and the associated augmentation of ERK1/2, cytosolic phospholipase A(2) Î±, and cysteinyl-leukotriene synthesis confers resistance to s/s mice during pneumococcal pneumonia. These data provide novel insights into the intracellular signaling events by which leptin contributes to host defense against bacterial pneumonia.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20633531>Promotion of interferon-gamma production by natural killer cells via suppression of murine peritoneal macrophage prostaglandin Eâ production using intravenous anesthetic propofol.</a></h2><p>Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic, widely used for general anesthesia during surgery, which inevitably involves tissue trauma with inflammation. At sites of inflammation, prostanoids, especially prostaglandin Eâ (PGEâ), are abundant. This study addresses the effect of propofol on macrophage PGEâ production. Using thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages, propofol (7.5-30 Î¼M) suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced PGEâ production. The suppression was via the direct inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activity and due neither to the downregulation of COX expression nor the inhibition of  release from plasma membranes. In macrophage:natural killer (NK) cell co-culture, propofol dramatically increased interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) production, and the actions of propofol were mimicked by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, as well as the selective EP4 receptor antagonist L-161,982, suggesting a role of PGEâ suppression in the upregulation of IFN-Î³ production. Furthermore, in purified NK cell culture, PGEâ directly suppressed the production of IFN-Î³ by activated NK cells, which was reversed by selective inhibition of EP4 activity. Taken together, our results show that, in macrophage:NK cell co-culture, propofol, through the suppression of macrophage PGEâ production, upregulates NK cell IFN-Î³ production by alleviating EP4 receptor-mediated suppression of IFN-Î³ production. Propofol may potentially exert considerable influence on inflammation and  by suppressing PGEâ synthesis.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As unspecific phagocytes, they belong to the so-called innate . Two S100 proteins, namely S100A9 (MRP14) and S100A8 (MRP8), constitute roughly 40% of the cytosolic protein in these cells, implying by their pure abundance an important role in the effector functions of neutrophils. However, despite intense research in the past 15 years, the puzzle that may embed both molecules into the neutrophil/monocyte physiology is still incomplete. One reason might be the conformational variability the S100A9 and S100A8 molecules can adopt. They readily form hetero- and homodimeric, trimeric as well as tetrameric complexes, but they evidently do also exert specific functions as monomers. An ever-increasing body of information suggests that S100A9 plays a prominent role in leukocyte trafficking and  metabolism.

Dendritic cells are critical for the cell-mediated arm of the immune response as they activate naÃ¯ve T cells after maturation. Platelets play a crucial role in thrombus formation in the injured vessel walls. We investigated the role of resting and thrombin-activated platelets in dendritic cell maturation in vitro using platelets and monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy donors. Resting platelet supernatants did not affect maturation, whereas supernatants from thrombin-activated platelets induced dendritic cell maturation as demonstrated by FACS analysis of HLA-DR expression. This effect was inhibited by anti CD40 ligand antibody, but not by aspirin pretreatment of platelets. Supernatants of platelet-dendritic cell co-cultures induced augmented monocyte migration when platelets were activated by thrombin, again reversible by blocking CD40 ligand. These data show that activated platelets trigger dendritic cell maturation independent of cyclooxygenase-derived  metabolites by mechanisms involving CD40 ligand, which is also involved in monocyte chemotactic mediator release from platelets and dendritic cells.

The latter produce decreased prostaglandins E2 and I2 and leukotriene C4 while conserving the synthesis of thromboxane A2. We show here that the initial changes in peritoneal macrophage arachidonate metabolism during the immune response appear to be the result of the large influx of blood monocytes, which have a characteristic metabolism distinct from resident macrophages. We demonstrate that the initial decrease in peritoneal macrophage arachidonate metabolism and the increase in macrophage numbers occur simultaneously after infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Also the macrophage arachidonate metabolism seen at the height of the peritoneal cellular influx is the same as that of purified blood monocytes. Both Listeria peritoneal macrophages and blood monocytes produce equal or greater quantities of thromboxane A2 relative to prostaglandins I2 and E2 or leukotriene C4 whereas resident cells produce 1/10 to 1/25 as much thromboxane A2 compared to the other products. Furthermore, the changes in peritoneal macrophage arachidonate metabolism in response to Listeria infection do not occur if the influx of blood monocytes is stopped by irradiating the mice prior to infection implying that the cellular influx is necessary to see the changes in arachidonate metabolism.

The interference of symbiotic bacteria with insect host immune responses is fairly well documented. However, knowledge of mechanisms regulating parasiteâhost interactions still remains fragmentary. In this study, we used nematode (Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) cuticles and Galleria mellonella larvae as parasiteâhost model, focused on the changes of innate immune parameters of the host in the early phase of nematode cuticle infection and investigated the role of eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in the process.

Two G protein-coupled receptors for LTB4 have been identified: a high-affinity receptor, BLT1, and a low-affinity receptor, BLT2. Both receptors mainly couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-like G proteins and induce cell migration. 12(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic  (12-HHT) was identified to bind BLT2 with higher affinity than LTB4. Expression of BLT1 was confirmed in type 1 helper T cells, type 2 helper T cells, type 17 helper T cells, effector CD8(+) T cells, dendritic cells and osteoclasts in addition to granulocytes, eosinophils and macrophages, and BLT1-deficient mice showed greatly reduced phenotypes in models of various inflammatory diseases, such as peritonitis, bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. In mice, BLT2 expression is restricted to intestinal epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes. BLT2-deficient mice showed enhanced colitis after administration of dextran sulfate, possibly due to reduced intestinal barrier function. An aspirin-dependent reduction in 12-HHT production was responsible for delayed skin wound healing, showing that the 12-HHT/BLT2 axis also plays an important role in skin biology.

Activation of the phosphatidylinositide cycle in activated T cells is a well-known source of the second messengers DAG and inositol triphosphate (IP3). The present report demonstrates that a particular pool of phosphatidylcholine (PC) arising from the sequential methylation of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) is probably a second source of DAG. The occurrence of two distinct sources of DAG in activated T cells is supported by the fact that DAG production was not accompanied by a decrease of phosphatidylinositol mono- and bisphosphate (PIP/PIP2) pools as measured after [3H]glycerol labeling whereas [3H] PIP/PIP2 pools decrease in parallel with DAG production. The presence of a second generating pathway for DAG was demonstrated by measuring phospholipid synthesis and degradation in cells labeled with [3H]choline, [3H]ethanolamine or [3H]serine. In Jurkat cells, PHA decreased the incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine and [3H]serine but not [3H]choline into PC suggesting that the PC pool arising from the methylation of PE was utilized during activation whereas the PC pool synthesized through the CDP choline pathway was not. In [3H]ethanolamine-prelabeled cells, but not in [3H]choline-prelabeled cells, PHA, CD3 and CD2 induced the breakdown of PC. The PC breakdown was accompanied by a release of [3H]choline and the production of DAG and phosphatidic  (PA).

After 14 days treatment, serum TXB levels were significantly greater 2 h post-dosing with aspirin 20 mg BD vs. 75 mg OD (3.0 Â± 3.6 ng/mL vs. 0.8 Â± 1.9 ng/mL; p = 0.018) whereas pre-dosing levels were not significantly different (3.5 Â± 4.1 ng/mL vs. 2.5 Â± 3.1 ng/mL, p = 0.23). 1-mmol/L -induced platelet aggregation was similarly inhibited by both regimens pre-dose (8.5 Â± 14.3% vs. 5.1 Â± 3.6%, p = 0.24) and post-dose (8.7 Â± 14.2% vs. 6.6 Â± 5.3%; p = 0.41). Post-dose bleeding time was shorter with 20 mg BD (680 Â± 306 s vs. 834 Â± 386 s, p = 0.02). Urinary prostacyclin and TX metabolite excretion were not significantly different. In conclusion, compared to aspirin 75 mg OD, aspirin 20 mg BD provided consistent inhibition of platelet TXA release and aggregation, and improved post-dose hemostasis, in ticagrelor-treated ACS patients.

Our study was carried out to determine the importance of impaired  release in the depression of the respiratory burst after ElgG phagocytosis. The depression of triggered H2O2 production after ElgG phagocytosis was not due to cyclooxygenase products because indomethacin or aspirin did not modify the depression. Further studies revealed that the depression of triggered H2O2 production after ElgG phagocytosis was associated with a depression in the ability of macrophages to release  in response to PMA, zymosan, or calcium ionophore. The addition of exogenous  partially prevented the depression of triggered H2O2 production after ElgG phagocytosis. Unlike phagocytosis mediated by FcR, complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis did not alter H2O2 production or  release. Ligation of FcR was not sufficient to depress triggered H2O2 production and  release because these functions were not depressed when phagocytosis was inhibited with cytochalasin D. Thus, it was found that the depression of triggered H2O2 production by macrophages after FcR-mediated phagocytosis was associated with impaired release of  and that H2O2 production could be partially restored by the addition of .

It is caused by inflammatory mediators such as neutral proteases including tryptase and chymase,  products, histamine, platelet activating factor and a variety of cytokines and chemokines released during the activation process. Platelets with FCÎµRI and FCÎµRII receptors also participate in the above cascade. Vasospastic allergic angina, allergic myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis with occluding thrombus infiltrated by eosinophils and/or mast cells constitute the three reported variants of this syndrome. Kounis syndrome is a ubiquitus disease that represents a magnificent natural paradigm and nature's own experiment, in a final trigger pathway implicated in cases of coronary artery spasm and plaque rupture. Kounis syndrome can complicate anesthesia, vaccination, medical therapy and stent implantation and it seems to be associated with coronary allograft vasculopathy and takotsubo syndrome, it can often be confused with hypersensitivity myocarditis and can be the cause of unexplained sudden death. Kounis syndrome has revealed that the same mediators released from the same inflammatory cells are present in acute coronary events of nonallergic etiology. These cells are not only present in the culprit region before plaque erosion or rupture but they release their contents just before an actual coronary event. Therefore, does Kounis syndrome represent a magnificent natural paradigm and nature's own experiment in a final trigger pathway implicated in cases of coronary artery spasm and plaque rupture showing a novel way towards our effort to prevent acute coronary syndromes? Drugs, substances targeting the stem cell factor that is essential for mast cell development, proliferation, survival, adhesion and homing as well as monoclonal antibodies and natural molecules that protect mast cell surface and stabilize mast cell membrane could emerge as novel therapeutic ways capable to prevent acute coronary and acute cerebrovascular events.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30905346>Roles of secreted phospholipase A group IIA in inflammation and host defense.</a></h2><p>Among all members of the secreted phospholipase A (sPLA) family, group IIA sPLA (sPLA-IIA) is possibly the most studied enzyme. Since its discovery, many names have been associated with sPLA-IIA, such as "non-pancreatic", "synovial", "platelet-type", "inflammatory", and "bactericidal" sPLA Whereas the different designations indicate comprehensive functions or sources proposed for this enzyme, the identification of the precise roles of sPLA-IIA has remained a challenge. This can be attributed to: the expression of the enzyme by various cells of different lineages, its limited activity towards the membranes of immune cells despite its expression following common inflammatory stimuli, its ability to interact with certain proteins independently of its catalytic activity, and its absence from multiple commonly used mouse models. Nevertheless, elevated levels of the enzyme during inflammatory processes and associated consistent release of  from the membrane of extracellular vesicles suggest that sPLA-IIA may contribute to inflammation by using endogenous substrates in the extracellular milieu. Moreover, the remarkable potency of sPLA-IIA towards bacterial membranes and its induced expression during the course of infections point to a role for this enzyme in the defense of the host against invading pathogens. In this review, we present current knowledge related to mammalian sPLA-IIA and its roles in sterile inflammation and host defense.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Dietary Ï-3 docosahexaenoic  (DHA) is protective in DED but mechanisms of action remain elusive. DHA is converted to Ï-3 SPMs by PMN via the same lipoxygenases (LOX) that generate LXA. We investigated if dietary DHA amplifies SPM formation and affects T effector cell function and/or regulatory PMN in DED. DED was induced in mice on a DHA-enriched or Ï-3-deficient diet. DHA deficiency amplified DED with marked sex-specific differences. Dietary DHA protection against dry eye disease correlated with increased PMN levels in lymph nodes, ocular tissues, and unexpectedly, selective amplification of LXA tissue levels. Dietary DHA increased 12/15-LOX and decreased 5-LOX expression in lymph nodes and isolated lymph node PMN, which correlated with amplified LXA formation. Acute DHA treatment rescued DHA-deficient females from exaggerated DED by amplifying lymph node LXA formation, increasing T and decreasing T1 and T17 effector cells. Our results identify DHA regulation of LXA producing PMN in ocular tissues and lymph nodes in health and immune disease as novel mechanism and determinant for T-cell responses to routine ocular injury or stress signals.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2122656>Seasonal variation in the phagocytic activity and  metabolism of human blood monocytes in healthy non-smokers, smokers and chronic bronchitics.</a></h2><p>Peripheral blood monocytes are precursor cells to alveolar macrophages (AMs). Many studies have been performed with a view to assessing the differences, in respect of morphology and function, between the AMs of smokers and those of non-smokers. Disturbed host-defence activity of smokers' AMs is reflected by, for instance, decreased phagocytic activity and impaired  metabolism. However, very little attention has been paid to the question what effects cigarette smoking and chronic bronchitis may have on the function of the precursors of these cells--the blood monocytes. The collection of blood monocytes is much less laborious than the sampling of AMs. Therefore, it would be a great advance if the deteriorated host defence in chronic bronchitis could be detected and followed by studies of blood monocytes. However, a seasonal variation in monocyte function, discussed in this paper, may counteract the advantage inherent in repeated sampling. This seasonal variation in cellular host-defence mechanisms should be taken into account when designing longitudinal intervention trials in chronic bronchitis.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1311012>In vivo latex phagocytosis primes the Kupffer cells and hepatic neutrophils to generate superoxide anion.</a></h2><p>Activation of liver macrophages during clearance of endotoxins, bacteria, or other particulate materials may be accompanied by the migration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into the liver and priming of the hepatic phagocytes to release toxic oxygen metabolites. In the present study we investigated the effect of in vivo administration of latex particles on the hepatic sequestration of PMNs and the release of superoxide anion (O2-) by the in situ perfused rat liver and isolated hepatic phagocytes. One hour after an intravenous injection of latex beads, a significant amount of O2- (0.7 nmol/min/g) was produced by the in situ perfused liver. Administration of latex particles into the perfused liver also elicited O2- production. Hepatic phagocytes from latex-treated rats generated large amounts of O2- (2-14 nmol/60 min/10(6) cells) when these cells were stimulated in vitro with opsonized zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), whereas phagocytes from saline-treated rats released less than 0.8 nmol O2-. Intravenous infusion of superoxide dismutase or ibuprofen did not prevent the immigration of PMNs to the liver. However, ibuprofen inhibited the production of O2- by the perfused liver. Also, after addition of ibuprofen in vitro to isolated cells, there was more than 50% inhibition of O2- generation by Kupffer cells and hepatic PMNs treated with either zymosan or PMA. These observations suggest that  metabolites play a role in O2- release under these conditions. Thus, activation of the reticuloendothelial system by latex phagocytosis induces the migration of PMNs into the liver and enhances the production of toxic oxygen-derived radicals by these cells and the resident Kupffer cells. The toxic oxygen radicals may also contribute to hepatic injury.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1656192>Inhibition of cytoskeletal rearrangement by botulinum C2 toxin amplifies ligand-evoked lipid mediator generation in human neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Botulinum C2 toxin, a binary toxin that ADP-ribosylates nonmuscle G-actin, was used as a selective tool to evaluate the role of actin-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangement in ligand-evoked lipid mediator generation. Human neutrophils (PMN) were preincubated with varying concentrations of the toxin for 30 min. Lipoxygenase products of  were measured by chromatographic techniques in the presence of exogenous  to probe PMN 5-lipoxygenase activity. Formation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) was assayed by the bioincorporation of [3H]acetate. Stimulation was performed with the soluble chemotactic ligands formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and PAF, as well as opsonized zymosan. PMN pretreatment with C2 toxin in the range between 200/400 and 800/1600 ng/ml C2I/II caused a dose-dependent suppression of the basal F-actin content and of stimulus-induced actin assembly. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis (measured as liberated inositol phosphates) and PAF generation in response to FMLP and exogenous PAF were markedly increased at these toxin doses. Minor C2 toxin concentrations (range, approximately 25/50 to 200/400 ng/ml C2I/II) were sufficient to amplify stimulus-induced formation of leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products, nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (5-HETE). With increasing toxin doses, leukotriene generation declined and 5-HETE became the predominant metabolite. In contrast to the soluble ligands, the zymosan-effected generation of PAF and leukotrienes was dose-dependently inhibited by C2 toxin concentrations of greater than 200/400 ng/ml, paralleled by a loss of motile and phagocytotic functions in these cells. We conclude that selective inhibition of actin assembly amplifies PAF and 5-lipoxygenase product formation in response to soluble chemoattractants with distinct dose dependences. The augmentation of PAF generation may be linked to amplified second messenger levels at higher doses of C2 toxin, whereas the sensitivity of the 5-lipoxygenase metabolism to low concentrations may indicate toxin effect on a small, functionally specified, actin pool.

The products of 5-lipoxygenase act on inflammation and  by stimulation of a membrane receptor called OxeR1. The presence of OxeR1 in other systems has not been described up to date and little is known about its mechanism of action and other functions. In this context, the aim of this study was the identification and characterization of OxeR1 as a mediator of cAMP-dependent and independent pathways. Overexpression of OxeR1 in MA-10 Leydig cells increased cAMP-dependent progesterone production. Angiotensin II and cAMP stimulation of adrenocortical human H295R cells produced an increase in StAR protein induction and steroidogenesis in cells overexpressing OxeR1 as compared to mock-transfected cells. Additionally, activation of OxeR1 caused a time-dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In summary, membrane receptor OxeR1 is involved in StAR protein induction and activation of steroidogenesis triggered by cAMP or angiotensin II, acting, at least in part, through ERK1/2 activation.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Phagocytosed hemozoin and trophozoites inhibit important monocyte functions. Delipidized trophozoites and hemozoin were remarkably less toxic to monocytes. Parasitized RBCs and hemozoin contained large amounts of mostly esterified monohydroxy derivatives (OH-PUFAs), the stable end products of peroxidation of polyenoic fatty acids. The concentrations of OH-PUFA were 1.8 micromoles per liter RBCs in nonparasitized RBCs, 11.1 micromoles per liter RBCs in rings, 35 micromoles per liter RBCs in trophozoites; and approximately 90 micromoles per liter RBC equivalents in hemozoin. In parasitized RBCs and hemozoin a complex mixture of monohydroxy derivatives of  (HETEs) and linoleic (HODEs)  was determined. Respectively, 13- and 9-HODE and 9- and 12-HETE were predominant in hemozoin and parasitized RBCs. The estimated concentrations of all HETE isomers were 33 and 39 micromoles per liter RBCs or RBC equivalents in trophozoites and hemozoin, respectively. No evidence of lipoxygenase activity was found, whereas the large number of positional and optical isomers, the racemic structure, and their generation by incubation of  with hemozoin indicated nonenzymatic origin via heme-catalysis. Sub/low micromolar concentrations of 12- and 15-HETE were toxic to monocytes, whereas HODE isomers were ineffective. Low micromolar concentrations of HETE isomers were estimated to be similarly present in monocytes after phagocytosis of trophozoites or hemozoin. Thus, specific products of heme-catalyzed lipid peroxidation appear to contribute to hemozoin toxicity to phagocytes and may thus play a role in increased cytoadherence, vascular permeability, and chemotaxis, as well as in immunodepression in malaria.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8482923>Transmembrane signaling pathways involved in phagocytosis and associated activation of NADPH oxidase mediated by Fc gamma Rs in human neutrophils.</a></h2><p>We have previously shown that in neutrophils classical transmembrane signaling consisting of increased [Ca2+]i and hydrolysis of phospholipids was not essential for phagocytosis mediated by more than one receptor (yeast-IgG, yeast-C3b/bi, yeast-Con A). This work deals with the role of this transmembrane signaling in phagocytosis of erythrocyte (E) IgG, which is mediated only by receptors for IgG (Fc gamma Rs). The ingestion of E-IgG was associated with an increase in [Ca2+]i and production of inositol phosphates, phosphatidic , diacylglycerol, and , via activation of phospholipases C, D and A2. Related to the same number of particles ingested, the respiratory burst and the transmembrane signaling during phagocytosis of E-IgG were much smaller than during phagocytosis of yeast-IgG. In Ca(2+)-depleted neutrophils, where the increase in [Ca2+]i and hydrolysis of phospholipids were lacking, the phagocytosis of E-IgG was depressed by about 60%; the respiratory burst was also depressed due to the decrease of ingestion and of stimulation of NADPH oxidase by residual phagocytosis. Pertussis toxin (PT) did not inhibit the phagocytosis of E-IgG but depressed by about 40% the stimulation of lipidic transmembrane signaling and the respiratory burst in normal neutrophils. In Ca(2+)-depleted neutrophils the toxin was without effect on ingestion and respiratory burst. Staurosporine did not inhibit the ingestion of E-IgG in normal and Ca(2+)-depleted neutrophils but depressed by 30-40% the respiratory burst in normal and not in Ca(2+)-depleted neutrophils. Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, did not inhibit the ingestion of E-IgG but depressed by 30-40% the respiratory burst both in normal and Ca(2+)-depleted neutrophils. These results demonstrate the following findings in human neutrophils. (1) Contrary to the phagocytosis mediated by more than one receptor (yeast-IgG, yeast-Con A, yeast-C3b/bi), the transmembrane signaling involving increase in [Ca2+]i and hydrolysis of phospholipids plays a role in the phagocytosis and respiratory burst mediated by Fc gamma Rs alone. Thus, different signal transduction pathways can be involved in phagocytosis and associated respiratory burst depending on the receptor or combination of receptors activated. (2) Fc gamma Rs alone promote phagocytosis with two signaling pathways independent of and dependent on [Ca2+]i changes and phospholipid hydrolysis and insensitive to PT, staurosporine, and genistein. (3) The signaling pathways promoting phagocytosis triggered by Fc gamma Rs alone are in some way, or at some step, different from those that activate the respiratory burst.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3020585>Role of icosanoids in alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and aggregation.</a></h2><p>Rat alveolar macrophages (AM) collected by bronchoalveolar lavage were incubated in the presence or absence of various icosanoids or inhibitors of the  cascade with either chrysotile asbestos (50 micrograms/ml) to determine cell aggregation, or human red blood cells (Rh+; preincubated with anti-D globulin) to measure phagocytosis.

In this study, we demonstrate that PGE suppresses basal and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (VD)-induced expression of hCAP18/LL-37 via E prostanoid (EP)2 and EP4 receptors. In humans, VD up-regulates vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression and promotes transcription of the cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37 gene, whereas PGE counteracts this effect. We find that PGE induces the cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway and enhances the expression of the inhibitory transcription factor cAMP-responsive modulator/inducible cAMP early repressor, which prevents VDR expression and induction of hCAP18/LL-37 in human macrophages. The negative regulation by PGE was evident in M1- and M2-polarized human macrophages, although PGE displayed more profound inhibitory effects in M2 cells. PGE impaired VD-induced expression of cathelicidin and concomitant activation of autophagy during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and facilitated intracellular Mtb growth in human macrophages. An EP4 agonist also significantly promoted Mtb survival in human macrophages.

This system can be an important signaling pathway for immune modulation. To assess the immunomodulating role of the cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor, we sought polymorphisms in the human gene, identified a common dinucleotide polymorphism, and investigated its effect on endocannabinoid-induced inhibition of T lymphocyte proliferation. The CB2 cDNA 188-189 GG/GG polymorphism predicts the substitution of glutamine at amino  position 63 by arginine. T lymphocytes from CB2 188-189 GG/GG homozygotes had approximately twofold reduction of endocannabinoid-induced inhibition of proliferation compared with cells from CB2 188-189 AA/AA homozygotes. In GG/GG subjects, the reduced endocannabinoid inhibitory response was highly significant for N-arachidonylglycine and nearly significant for 2-arachidonylglycerol, and a specific CB2 receptor antagonist partially blocked these effects. Also, patients with autoimmune diseases had an increased prevalence of the homozygous GG/GG genotype. Collectively, these results demonstrate reduced endogenous fatty  amide immunomodulatory responses in individuals with the CB2 188-189 GG/GG genotype and suggest that this CB2 gene variation may be a risk factor for autoimmunity.

Furthermore, treatment of animals with cyclooxygenase inhibitors abrogated the effect of linoleic . Administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitors to animals enhanced both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. In vitro studies have shown that prostaglandin E (PGE) group inhibits both T and B lymphocyte functions; it is suggested that effects of EFA on immune response are, in part, mediated through eicosanoids. Growing evidence now suggests that the PGE group of prostaglandins can serve as a negative feedback modulator of immune response. However, in vitro effects of other cyclooxygenase-derived products, such as PGI2 and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) have not been well established, perhaps because of their instability in aqueous media. Unlike the PGE group, some of lipoxygenase-derived products of  have shown immunostimulatory effects, as assessed by lymphokine production in vitro. Whether such effects can be seen in vivo remains to be determined. Some lipoxygenase-derived products with strong chemotactic action may indirectly influence immune response by modulating the population of antigen-presenting macrophages in tissues. Thus, the net effect of eicosanoids synthesized in macrophages on modulating immune response may depend on relative amounts of cyclooxygenase-derived products as compared with lipoxygenase-derived products. Macrophages are the major source of eicosanoids among immunocompetent cells. The profile of eicosanoids, produced in vitro by macrophages, varies with type of stimuli and anatomical sites.

In this study it was investigated whether monomeric IgE induces Ca2+ influx and mediator release from human lung mast cells (HLMC). Purified HLMC were cultured for 4 weeks and then exposed to monomeric human myeloma IgE. Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed on single fura-2-loaded cells. Histamine release was measured by radioenzymatic assay; leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and interleukin (IL)-8 were measured by ELISA. At concentrations experienced in vivo, monomeric IgE induced dose-dependent histamine release, LTC4 production and IL-8 synthesis. This was associated with a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+.

There was a significant increase in intracellular calcium concentration (P = 0.0008) and in the rate of rise of intracellular calcium levels (P = 0.0009) after reperfusion.There was a significant increase in circulating monocyte membrane permeability for calcium and cytosolic calcium concentration following reperfusion in human OLT. This was independent of extracellular calcium concentration. These results are consistent with WBC activation by reperfusion and could be implicated in the systemic reperfusion syndrome seen in OLT in humans.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850486>Possible involvement of aiPLA2 in the phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes induced production of PGE2 and PGD2 in microglia.</a></h2><p>Liposomes containing phosphatidylserine (PSL) produce PGE2 after being phagocytosed by microglia, but the precise underlying mechanism behind it still remains unclear. Here, we showed that liposomes consisting of phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylcholine, a lipolysis product of phosphatidylcholine by PLA2, were phagocytosed by microglia, but failed to induce secretion of PGE2.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of ALNA, gamma-linolenic  (GLA),  (ARA), DHA or FO on the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the production of cytokines by those cells. The study was randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and parallel. Healthy subjects ages 55-75 y consumed nine capsules/d for 12 wk; the capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflower seed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in ALNA, GLA, ARA or DHA or FO. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g of ALNA or 770 mg of GLA or 680 mg of ARA or 720 mg of DHA or 1 g of EPA plus DHA (720 mg of EPA + 280 mg of DHA) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g/d. The fatty  composition of PBMC phospholipids was significantly changed in the GLA, ARA, DHA and FO groups. Lymphocyte proliferation was not significantly affected by the placebo, ALNA, ARA or DHA treatments. GLA and FO caused a significant decrease (up to 65%) in lymphocyte proliferation. This decrease was partly reversed by 4 wk after stopping the supplementation. None of the treatments affected the production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma by PBMC and none of the treatments affected the number or proportion of T or B lymphocytes, helper or cytotoxic T lymphocytes or memory helper T lymphocytes in the circulation. We conclude that a moderate level GLA or EPA but not of other (n-6) or (n-3) PUFA can decrease lymphocyte proliferation but not production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27265031>Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV) induce the expression of small heat shock protein 25.4 in Antheraea pernyi.</a></h2><p>Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) is one group of Baculoviruses.

These ACBPs bind long-chain acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids and are involved in diverse cellular functions, including acyl-CoA homeostasis, development, and stress tolerance. Recombinant ACBP3 binds polyunsaturated acyl-CoA esters and phospholipids in vitro. Here, we show that ACBP3 plays a role in the plant defense response to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000. ACBP3 mRNA was up-regulated upon pathogen infection and treatments using pathogen elicitors and defense-related phytohormones. Transgenic Arabidopsis ACBP3 overexpressors (ACBP3-OEs) showed constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes (PR1, PR2, and PR5), cell death, and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in leaves. Consequently, ACBP3-OEs displayed enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen P. syringae DC3000. In contrast, the acbp3 T-DNA insertional mutant was more susceptible and exhibited lower PR gene transcript levels upon infection. Using the ACBP3 OE-1 line in combination with nonexpressor of PR genes1 (npr1-5) or coronatine-insensitive1 (coi1-2), we concluded that the enhanced PR gene expression and P. syringae DC3000 resistance in the ACBP3-OEs are dependent on the NPR1-mediated, but not the COI1-mediated, signaling pathway. Given that ACBP3-OEs showed greater susceptibility to infection by the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea while the acbp3 mutant was less susceptible, we suggest that ACBP3 plays a role in the plant defense response against biotrophic pathogens that is distinct from necrotrophic pathogens. ACBP3 function in plant defense was supported further by bioinformatics data showing up-regulation of many biotic and abiotic stress-related genes in ACBP3 OE-1 in comparison with the wild type.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2648506>[Mechanism of action and effects of corticoids in asthma].</a></h2><p>The value of oral or inhaled glucocorticoids (GCS) in asthma is well recognized. Their use has remained empirical for a long time. However, some progress has been achieved recently in the understanding of their general mode of action and of their bronchial effects suggesting that in the near future ther may be some new therapeutic perspectives. The fundamental action of GCS involves a close intracellular interaction between the specific glucocorticoid hormone receptor and the cellular genome which results in the activation of the genes coding the proteins responsible for the phenotypic response of the cell and thus for their biological action. The place of the extra-genomic mechanisms remains ill understood. The immunomodulating action of GCS is difficult to dissociate from their anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects which seem to predominate in asthma. They inhibit all stages of the inflammatory reaction in acting on the key mediators of the inflammatory response, the pharmacologically active lipids (LPA: prostaglandins, leukotrienes, PAF-acether) which are a result of the catabolism of  which occurs during the course of membrane activation. The phospholipid A2 (PLA2), a membrane enzyme responsible for the splitting of the phospholipids in the presence of calcium and leading to the liberation of LPA is the driving force of the reaction in such a way that the products of the nuclear activation subsequently reactivated. GCS is considered as a natural modulator of inflammation, inducing the synthesis of lipocortin, an inhibitory protein of PLA2, which explains the blockage in the generation of LPA and thus the inflammatory reaction. The regulation of the activity of these or of the lipocortin seems to lead to the intervention of the phosphorylation. But numerous questions remain concerning the precise action of PLO2, the existence of endogenous lipocortin, their secretion and their extra-cellular action. In spite of these unknown facts it is not impossible to envisage a clinical potential for lipocortin, once sequenced and produced, when the pharmacological and immunological problems have been surmounted. In asthma the effect of GCS essentially involve: the inhibition of all the bronchial components of inflammation: the synthesis, liberation and peripheral action of the mediators; the oedema and mucous congestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1416192>[The effect of indomethacin and leukinferon on the level of blood plasma thromboxane B2, platelet aggregation and the immune system of patients with endometrial cancer in the perioperative period].</a></h2><p>The perioperative influence of leukinferon, indomethacin and their combination on the blood plasma level of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), platelet aggregation ability and humoral and cellular  has been assessed in 40 endometrial cancer patients.

As a result, oxylipins have been implicated in many conditions characterized by these processes, including cardiovascular disease and aging. The best characterized oxylipins in relation to cardiovascular disease are derived from the Ï-6 fatty  . These oxylipins generally increase inflammation, hypertension, and platelet aggregation, although not universally. Similarly, oxylipins derived from the Ï-6 fatty  linoleic  generally have more adverse than beneficial cardiovascular effects. Alternatively, most oxylipins derived from 20- and 22-carbon Ï-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory, antiaggregatory, and vasodilatory effects that help explain the cardioprotective effects of these fatty acids. Much less is known regarding the oxylipins derived from the 18-carbon Ï-3 fatty  Î±-linolenic , but clinical trials with flaxseed supplementation have indicated that these oxylipins can have positive effects on blood pressure. Normal aging also is associated with changes in oxylipin levels in the brain, vasculature, and other tissues, indicating that oxylipin changes with aging may be involved in age-related changes in these tissues. A small number of trials in humans and animals with interventions that contain either 18-carbon or 20- and 22-carbon Ï-3 fatty acids have indicated that dietary-induced changes in oxylipins may be beneficial in slowing the changes associated with normal aging. In summary, oxylipins are an important group of molecules amenable to dietary manipulation to target cardiovascular disease and age-related degeneration. Oxylipins are an important group of fatty  metabolites amenable to dietary manipulation. Because of the role they play in cardiovascular disease and in age-related degeneration, oxylipins are gaining recognition as viable targets for specific dietary interventions focused on manipulating oxylipin composition to control these biological processes.Copyright Â© 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3151694>Protein myristoylation as an intermediate step during signal transduction in macrophages: its role in  metabolism and in responses to interferon gamma.</a></h2><p>The role of macrophages in the regulation of inflammation and  is, in part, due to their secretory repertoire. Among the important mediators released by macrophages are the products of both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of  (20:4) metabolism. The principal focus of this paper is the mechanism by which bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) regulate 20:4 metabolism in macrophages. LPS has the capacity to prime macrophages for greatly enhanced 20:4 metabolism when the cells are subsequently challenged with a spectrum of triggers. Concomitant with priming, LPS also promotes the covalent attachment of myristic  to a set of macrophage proteins. The time and concentration dependence of LPS-induced protein myristoylation is consistent with a role for myristoylation in LPS priming of the 20:4 cascade. One of the myristoylated proteins is a 68K (K = 10(3) Mr) protein kinase C substrate which associates with membranes upon myristoylation. LPS-primed macrophages show greatly increased phosphorylation of the 68K protein when the cells are subsequently treated with protein kinase C activating phorbol esters. It is proposed that the myristoylation of the 68K protein promotes its attachment to the membrane where it is more closely associated with activated protein kinase C (PKC), an association which would ensure more efficient catalysis during the mobilization and oxygenation of 20:4. This paper also examines protein myristoylation during T-cell-mediated activation of macrophages. Immune-activated macrophages have an enhanced capacity to kill several infectious agents by oxidative mechanisms. The lymphokine gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) rapidly induces the myristoylation of a 48K protein. This 48K protein is also myristoylated in murine macrophages that have been activated in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of Corynebacterium parvum, suggesting that it may be an important intermediate in the activation of macrophages for enhanced microbicidal capacity.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8846196>Augmentative inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by cyclosporin A combined with the riminophenazine compounds clofazimine and B669.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the effects of cyclosporin A (CsA, 3-50 ng/ml) in combination with the riminophenazine agents clofazimine and B669 (60-500 ng/ml) on the mitogen- and alloantigen-activated proliferative responses of human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL), as well as on the phospholipase A2 and Na+, K+- adenosine triphosphatase activities of these cells. When used in combination these agents caused inhibition of the proliferative responses of both mitogen- and alloantigen-activated MNL which was at least additive. Combinations of CsA with the riminophenazines also caused augmentative activation of PLA2 and inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase. The inhibitory effects of these agents, both individually and in combination, on the Na+, K+-ATPase and proliferative responses of MNL were neutralized by the membrane-stabilizing, lysophospholipid complex-forming agent alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E, 20 microgram/ml). These observations suggest that combinations of CsA with riminophenazines cause interactive enhancement of the activity of PLA2 in MNL leading to lysophospholipid-mediated inactivation of Na+, K+-ATPase and consequent inhibition of the proliferative responses of these cells.

After induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model mimicking multiple sclerosis, TASK1(-/-) mice showed a significantly reduced clinical severity and markedly reduced axonal degeneration compared with wild-type controls. T cells from TASK1(-/-) mice displayed impaired T cell proliferation and cytokine production, while the immune repertoire is otherwise normal. In addition to these effects on systemic T cell responses, TASK1 exhibits an independent neuroprotective effect which was demonstrated using both a model of acutely prepared brain slices cocultured with activated T cells as well as in vitro cultivation experiments with isolated optic nerves. Anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid and inhibitor of TASK channels, reduced outward currents and inhibited effector functions of T cells (IFN-gamma production and proliferation); an effect completely abrogated in TASK1(-/-) mice. Accordingly, preventive blockade of TASK1 significantly ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis after immunization.

Thus, in this work we evaluated the ability of human MM cells to modulate the inflammatory phenotype of human THP-1 monocytes and macrophages, a widely used in vitro model of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that the exposure to MM cells could alter the differentiation of THP-1 monocytes favoring the development of alternatively activated, tumor-supporting macrophages. Our data prove for the first time that MM cells can polarize monocytes towards an altered inflammatory phenotype and macrophages towards an immunosuppressive phenotype. Moreover, we demonstrate that monocytes cocultivated with MM cells 'keep a memory' of their encounter with the tumor which influences their differentiation to macrophages. On the whole, we provide evidence that MM cells exert distinct, cell-specific effects on monocytes and macrophages.

All these effects may be linked to the ability of gangliosides to modulate the  cascade in lymphoid cells, which for the first time was demonstrated in the course of our studies. Possible mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory effects of serum gangliosides as well as their role in the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance and inhibition of the hosts immune system are discussed.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7840772>The regulation of superoxide production by the NADPH oxidase of neutrophils and other mammalian cells.</a></h2><p>Superoxide is produced by a NADPH oxidase of phagocytic cells and contributes to their microbicidal activities. The oxidase is activated when receptors in the neutrophil plasma membrane bind to the target microbe. These receptors recognise antibodies and complement fragments which coat the target cell. The oxidase electron transport chain, located in the plasma membrane, comprises a low potential cytochrome b heterodimer (gp 91-phox and p22-phox) associated with FAD. It is non-functional until at least three proteins, p67-phox, p47-phox and p21rac (and possibly others), move from the cytosol to dock on the cytochrome b. The docking involves the interaction of SH3 domains on p47-phox or p67-phox with a proline-rich sequence on the small subunit of the cytochrome b. These SH3 domains may become exposed following phosphorylation of p47-phox by protein kinase C or, in model systems, by addition of  to reconstitution mixtures. Following the docking process the electron-transporting component is able to transfer electrons from NADPH to oxygen. This electrogenic event is charge-compensated by the opening of a proton channel. Components of the oxidase are expressed in non-phagocytes, where their function is uncertain but could be related to some signal function of superoxide.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2516987>The synthesis, catabolism, and pathophysiological role of platelet-activating factor.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19190401>Biological mechanism of antidepressant effect of omega-3 fatty acids: how does fish oil act as a 'mind-body interface'?</a></h2><p>The unsatisfactory results of monoamine-based antidepressant therapy and the high occurrence of somatic symptoms and physical illness in patients with depression imply that the serotonin hypothesis is insufficient to approach the aetiology of depression. Depressive disorders with somatic presentation are the most common form of depression. Somatization, the bodily symptoms without organic explanation, is similar to cytokine-induced sickness behaviour. Based on recent evidence, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs, or n-3 fatty acids) are enlightening a promising path to discover the unsolved of depression, sickness behaviour and to link the connection of mind and body. The PUFAs are classified into n-3 (or omega-3) and n-6 (or omega-6) groups. Eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , the major bioactive components of n-3 PUFAs, are not efficiently synthesized in humans and should therefore be obtained directly from the diet, particularly by consuming fish. Docosahexaenoic  deficiency is associated with dysfunctions of neuronal membrane stability and transmission of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which might connect to the aetiology of mood and cognitive dysfunction of depression. Likewise, eicosapentaenoic  is important in balancing the immune function and physical health by reducing membrane  (an n-6 PUFA) and prostaglandin E(2) synthesis, which might be linked to the somatic manifestations and physical comorbidity in depression. The role of n-3 PUFAs in  and mood function supports the promising hypothesis of psychoneuroimmunology of depression and provides an excellent interface between 'mind' and 'body'. This review is to provide an overview of the evidence about the role of n-3 PUFAs in depression and its common comorbid physical conditions and to propose mechanisms by which they may modulate molecular and cellular functions.2009 S.

We investigated the PGE(2) biosynthetic capacity of bone marrow-derived DC (BM-DC) and the effects of PG on the APC. We observed that BM-DC produce PGE(2) and other proinflammatory mediators, such as leukotriene B(4) and NO, after LPS exposure. Constitutively present in BM-DC, cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 did not contribute significantly to the total pool of PGE(2) compared with the LPS-induced COX-2-produced PGE(2). Treatment of BM-DC with exogenous PGE(2) induced the production of large amounts of IL-10 and less IL-12p70. In addition, selective inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1, was followed by significant decrements in PGE(2) and IL-10, a concomitant restoration of IL-12 production, and an enhancement of DC stimulatory potential. In contrast, we found no demonstrable role for leukotriene B(4) or NO. In view of the potential of PGE(2) to stimulate IL-10, we examined the possibility that the suppressive effect of PGE(2) is mediated via IL-10. We found that exogenous IL-10 inhibits IL-12p70 production in the presence of NS-398, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, while the inhibitory effects of PGE(2) were totally reversed by anti-IL-10.

The cellular immune responses refer to hemocyte-mediated processes such as phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation. Nodulation is considered the predominant defense reaction to infection in insects. Treating third instar larvae of the grey flesh fly, Neobellieria bullata, with laminarin (beta-1,3-glucan, a typical component of fungal cell walls) induced nodulation in a dose-dependent manner. This reaction was initiated very soon after injection and reached its maximal response level after 4 h. The nodules were not randomly distributed in the hemocoel, but were concentrated around the crop. The possible role of eicosanoids in this nodulation process was determined by treating larvae with the phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, dexamethasone, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, naproxen, and the lipoxygenase inhibitor, esculetin. Both dexamethasone and naproxen significantly impaired the ability of N. bullata larvae to form nodules in response to laminarin. Supplying dexamethasone-treated larvae with the eicosanoid precursor, , restored the full response. On the other hand, treating larvae with esculetin did not influence the formation of nodules in response to laminarin. This is the first study that demonstrates the occurrence of a laminarin-induced nodulation response in Diptera.

Adherent alveolar macrophages, prelabelled with [3H]- (AA), were incubated with live, opsonized Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (bacteria:macrophage ratio of 50:1) at 37 degrees C for 90 min. Supernatant eicosanoids were extracted and separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). While the amounts of labelled PGE2, TXB2, and PGD2 produced in response to the two organisms were equal, the amount of PGF2 alpha elicited by S. aureus amounted to three times that released during macrophage challenge with P. aeruginosa. Overall, preferential release of cyclooxygenase products occurred during phagocytosis of S. aureus. In contrast, eicosanoids identified presumptively as oxygenated metabolites of AA predominated in cultures challenged with opsonized P. aeruginosa. Live, non-opsonized P. aeruginosa elicited the same profile of eicosanoids, but in reduced amounts. Inhibitor studies indicated that these AA derivatives were not synthesized via the macrophage lipoxygenase pathway. Their production was dependent on the viability of P. aeruginosa. Macrophages challenged with opsonized, heat-killed P. aeruginosa resulted in production of an eicosanoid profile similar to that elicited by S. aureus. Secondary metabolism by P. aeruginosa of eicosanoids released from the macrophage did not contribute to the unique profile produced during the interaction of this organism with labelled macrophages. Our data indicate that during binding to macrophages, the primary human pathogen, P. aeruginosa, specifically modulates the profile of eicosanoids produced.

The synthesis of these phospholipids occurred gradually, compared to rapid synthesis of phosphatidic  (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI). Exposure of RPE cells to latex particles elicited active phagocytosis. In [3H] glycerol- or [3H] -prelabeled cells, a transient decrease in PI was observed without increases in the level of either diacylglycerol (DG) or PA. However, the radioactivity of PC and PE significantly increased. The enhancement of de novo synthesis of phospholipids, measured by the incorporation of [3H] glycerol, was not stimulated within 2 hours after the addition of latex particles. The transient increase in the ratio of [14C] choline/[3H] glycerol in PC may indicate the accelerated synthesis of PC but not via a de novo synthetic pathway.

To examine the hypothesis that increased cholinomimetic responsiveness of tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) caused by immune-sensitization results from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChase) activity, we developed a method for direct measurement of AChase activity in homogenates of TSM obtained from mongrel dogs actively sensitized in vivo to ragweed pollen extract (n = 7) and sham-sensitized littermate controls (n = 7). For both sensitized and control specimens, saturation of AChase was obtained at approximately 3.12 mM substrate (acetylthiocholine); however, maximal enzyme activity in homogenates of ragweed-sensitized tissues was significantly less (0.862 +/- 0.088 absorbance units/min/mg protein [AU/min/mg]) compared to control homogenates (1.590 +/- 0.129 AU/min/mg; P less than 0.001).

Because tumor growth increases m phi tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production and TNF-alpha stimulates m phi PGE2 synthesis, we examined the contribution of TNF-alpha to fibrosarcoma-induced m phi-mediated suppression of alloreactive CD4+ T cell proliferation. We showed that tumor-bearing host (TBH) m phi s express high levels of TNF-alpha mRNA, which leads to increased lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-alpha production. Tumor cells were directly involved in m phi TNF-alpha synthesis because fibrosarcoma cells induced normal host (NH) m phi s to produce TNF-alpha. Addition of TBH m phi s to allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) cultures suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation more than NH m phi s. The neutralization of endogenous TNF-alpha activity with anti-TNF-alpha antibody (Ab) treatment reversed TBH, but not NH, m phi-mediated suppression. Conversely, exogenous TNF-alpha increased NH or TBH m phi-mediated suppression but stimulated T cell proliferation without m phi s. Kinetic treatment of MLR cultures with anti-TNF-alpha Ab or TNF-alpha showed that TNF-alpha production and activity occurred at the beginning of T cell proliferation. When  metabolite synthesis was inhibited, TNF-alpha-induced suppression was blocked in NH m phi-containing cultures and completely reversed in TBH m phi-containing cultures. A PGE2-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that TNF-alpha addition increased PGE2 production in NH m phi-containing cultures to that of TBH m phi-containing cultures. Exogenous PGE2 did not affect the TNF-alpha enhancement of T cell proliferation without m phi s. Therefore, suppression induced by TNF-alpha was caused by increased m phi PGE2 production and not by TNF-alpha in concert with PGE2. Even though TNF-alpha is known to enhance lymphocyte proliferation, we show that in the presence of m phi s, the main TNF-alpha producers, TNF-alpha suppresses T cell proliferation.

To study carefully whether anti-Ig-Dex recruited a phosphoinositide-dependent pathway of activation, we stimulated B cells that were labeled with 32P and [3H]glycerol with anti-Ig-Dex conjugates at concentrations ranging from 1-1 x 10(-4) micrograms/ml. Thirty seconds to thirty minutes after stimulation lipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography and spots correlating with known lipid standards were isolated and counted. There was a four- and tenfold increase in the ratio of 32P/3H incorporated into phosphatidic  (a metabolite of diacylglycerol) and phosphatidylinositol, respectively, when cells were stimulated with 0.1-1.0 microgram/ml of anti-Ig-Dex for 30 min. Below 1 ng/ml there was no detectable increase in the turnover of these metabolites despite the fact that in parallel cultures B cells were stimulated to proliferate by this concentration of anti-Ig-Dex. To determine whether a cAMP-dependent pathway was recruited by low concentrations of conjugates, we evaluated cAMP levels from B cells that were stimulated with anti-Ig-Dex for 5-60 min using a radioimmunoassay. While cholera toxin stimulated a 50-100-fold increase in the levels of cAMP, we observed no alteration in cAMP in anti-Ig-stimulated cells. These results support and extend our previous findings by demonstrating that B cell activation that is induced by cross-linking of surface Ig may not stimulate phosphoinositide-dependent or cAMP-dependent pathways of activation.

Production of IL-2 is blocked in the presence of various chemical constituents including  (AA) metabolites, however, the effects of these compounds on preformed IL-2 is less clear. This study was designed to observe whether commonly employed drugs and AA metabolites will inhibit the ability to measure IL-2 in a standard bioassay. We measured cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLL) proliferation in response to IL-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of drugs or AA metabolites. Our data provides clear evidence that no suppression of cell replication occurs with PGE2, PGF2 alpha, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 at concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-9) M. At high concentrations, both dexamethasone (10(-5)M) and indomethacin (10(-5) and 10(-6) M) resulted in a suppressive effect on CTLL proliferation, while low concentrations of either compound (10(-7)-10(-9) M) had no effect.

Both doses similarly reduced the rate of ischemic events versus placebo. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor 60 mg bid have not been studied.In this study, the authors sought to study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for ticagrelor 60 mg compared with 90 mg bid.A total of 180 patients who received >4 weeks of study medication had blood sampling in the morning pre-maintenance dose and again 2 h post-dose. All patients received aspirin. Plasma levels of ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX were determined. P2Y12 inhibition was assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (Accumetrics, Inc., San Diego, California) (P2Y12 reaction units [PRU]), light transmittance aggregometry (adenosine diphosphate 5 and 20 Î¼mol/l and ), and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assays. VerifyNow Aspirin assays and serum thromboxane B2 measurements were performed.Mean pre- and post-dose plasma levels of ticagrelor were 35% and 38% lower, respectively, with 60 mg versus 90 mg. Both doses achieved high levels of platelet inhibition pre- and post-dose, with numerically slightly more variability with 60 mg: mean (SD) pre-dose PRU values were 59 Â± 63 and 47 Â± 43 for ticagrelor 60 and 90 mg, respectively (p = 0.34). High platelet reactivity, determined as PRU >208, was rare with the 60-mg pre-dose and was absent post-dose.

To detect the immunosuppressive effect, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were pretreated for 2 hr at 37 degrees with SV-IV, and the protein was maintained in the incubation medium during the whole culture time. We obtained evidence that, during preincubation of PBL and SV-IV the protein was transformed by a transglutaminase (TGase) released from PBL into modified low and high molecular weight forms able to bind to PBL surfaces. It is suggested that T lymphocytes are the possible targets of the immunosuppressive effect. SV-IV seems to inhibit only the early phase of the proliferative response of T lymphocytes to mitogens without having any direct effect on the enzymatic system involved in DNA synthesis. Moreover, the protein SV-IV was also shown to possess an anti-inflammatory property due to a block of the  cascade at the level of the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2).

Both murine and human macrophages stimulated with TNF-alpha or directly administered  showed an impaired ability to ingest apoptotic cells (efferocytosis). The inhibition was shown to be due to generation of reactive oxygen species, was blocked with a superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP, and was mimicked by direct addition of H2O2. To determine the mechanism of TNF-alpha-stimulated oxidant production, bone marrow-derived macrophages from gp91(phox)-deficient mice were examined but shown to still produce oxidants and exhibit defective apoptotic cell uptake. In contrast, a specific cytosolic phospholipase A2 inhibitor blocked the oxidant production and reversed the inhibited uptake. The suppressive effect of endogenous or exogenous oxidants on efferocytosis was mediated through activation of the GTPase, Rho. It was reversed in macrophages pretreated with C3 transferase to inactivate Rho or with an inhibitor of Rho kinase. During maturation of human monocyte-derived macrophages, only mature cells exhibited TNF-alpha-induced suppression of apoptotic cell clearance. The resistance of immature macrophages to such inhibition was shown to result not from defective generation of oxidants, but rather, from lack of response of these cells to the oxidants. Overall, the data suggest that macrophages in a TNF-alpha- and oxidant-rich inflammatory environment are less able to remove apoptotic cells and, thereby, may contribute to the local intensity of the inflammatory response.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710562>Phagocytosis of haemozoin (malarial pigment) enhances metalloproteinase-9 activity in human adherent monocytes: role of IL-1beta and 15-HETE.</a></h2><p>It has been shown previously that human monocytes fed with haemozoin (HZ) or trophozoite-parasitized RBCs displayed increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) enzyme activity and protein/mRNA expression and increased TNF production, and showed higher matrix invasion ability.

The second aim was to find out which component of HZ was responsible for the effects.Native HZ freshly isolated from Plasmodium falciparum (Palo Alto strain, Mycoplasma-free), delipidized HZ, beta-haematin (lipid-free synthetic HZ), trophozoites and control meals such as opsonized non-parasitized RBCs and inert latex particles, were fed to human monocytes. The production of IL-1beta by differently fed monocytes, in presence or absence of specific MMP-9 inhibitor or anti-hIL-1beta antibodies, was quantified in supernatants by ELISA. Expression of IL-1beta was analysed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. MMP-9 activity and protein expression were quantified by gelatin zymography and Western blotting.Monocytes fed with HZ or trophozoite-parasitized RBCs generated increased amounts of IL-1beta and enhanced enzyme activity (in cell supernatants) and protein/mRNA expression (in cell lysates) of monocyte MMP-9. The latter appears to be causally related to enhanced IL-1beta production, as enhancement of both expression and enzyme activity were abrogated by anti-hIL-1beta Abs. Upregulation of IL-1beta and MMP-9 were absent in monocytes fed with beta-haematin or delipidized HZ, indicating a role for HZ-attached or HZ-generated lipid components. 15-HETE (15(S,R)-hydroxy-6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic ) a potent lipoperoxidation derivative generated by HZ from  via haem-catalysis was identified as one mediator possibly responsible for increase of both IL-1beta production and MMP-9 activity.Results indicate that specific lipoperoxide derivatives generated by HZ may play a role in modulating production of IL-1beta and MMP-9 expression and activity in HZ/trophozoite-fed human monocytes.

The phagocytosis-enhancing activity of THG was dose-dependent (5-50 micrograms/ml) and was possibly mediated by the increased expressions of complement receptor type 1 (CR1) and type 3 (CR3) on the neutrophils. The release of [3H] and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but not thromboxane B2 (TXB2), from neutrophils were also significantly enhanced by THG. Using 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide as indicator, THG (25 micrograms/ml) depolarized the membrane potential of PMN after 30 min preincubation. In addition, THG exhibited a specific membranotropic effect with PMN. It is conceivable that THG binds to the cell surface and depolarizes the membrane potential of PMN which subsequently enhances the release of  metabolites and the translocation of the complement receptors to the membrane. These biochemical events lead to the increment of PMN phagocytosis and suggests that THG may play an important role in the defense mechanisms of the urinary tract in that a large amount of THG is usually present.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9753280>Quantitative and ultrastructural analysis of rectal mucosal mast cells in acute infectious diarrhea.</a></h2><p>The role of mast cells, potential mediators of mucosal  and inflammation, was studied morphologically in the rectal mucosa in two acute diarrheal diseases, cholera and shigellosis.

The CYP-catalyzed epoxidation and hydroxylation of  (AA) were established recently as the so-called third branch of AGE cascade. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases convert AA to four epoxyeicosatrienoic  (EET) regioisomers, that produce vascular relaxation anti-inflammatory effects on blood vessels and in the kidney, promote angiogenesis, and protect ischemic myocardium and brain. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are accessible to CYP enzymes in the same way as AA. Metabolites derived from EPA include epoxye-icosatetraenoic acids (EETR) and hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (19- and 20-HEPE), whereas DHA include epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids (21- and 22-HDoHE). For many of the CYP isoforms, the n-3 PUFAs are the preferred substrates and the available data suggest that some of the vasculo- and cardioprotective effects attributed to dietary n-3 PUFAs may be mediated by CYP-dependent metabolites of EPA and DHA.

Metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, are linked with chronic low-grade inflammation, impacting the immune system and promoting a variety of chronic diseases. Recent Advances: Multiple studies have corroborated the important function of eicosanoids and their receptors in (non)-inflammatory cells in immunometabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance, obesity, and cardiovascular and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases). In this context, LOX and COX products are involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

Host cells are one source of prostaglandins; however, another potential source of prostaglandins is the fungal pathogen itself. Our objective was to determine if the pathogenic yeasts Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans produce prostaglandins and, if so, to begin to define the role of these bioactive lipids in yeast biology and disease pathogenesis. C. neoformans and C. albicans both secreted prostaglandins de novo or via conversion of exogenous . Treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors dramatically reduced the viability of the yeast and the production of prostaglandins, suggesting that an essential cyclooxygenase like enzyme may be responsible for fungal prostaglandin production. A PGE series lipid was purified from both C. albicans and C. neoformans and was biologically active on both fungal and mammalian cells. Fungal PGE(x) and synthetic PGE(2) enhanced the yeast-to-hypha transition in C. albicans. Furthermore, in mammalian cells, fungal PGE(x) down-modulated chemokine production, tumor necrosis factor alpha production, and splenocyte proliferation while up-regulating interleukin 10 production. These are all activities previously documented for mammalian PGE(2). Thus, eicosanoids are produced by pathogenic fungi, are critical for growth of the fungi, and can modulate host immune functions. The discovery that pathogenic fungi produce and respond to immunomodulatory eicosanoids reveals a virulence mechanism that has potentially great implications for understanding the mechanisms of chronic fungal infection, immune deviation, and fungi as disease cofactors.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436590>Pulmonary epithelial cancer cells and their exosomes metabolize myeloid cell-derived leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4.</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes (LTs) play major roles in lung immune responses, and LTD4 is the most potent agonist for cysteinyl LT1, leading to bronchoconstriction and tissue remodeling. Here, we studied LT crosstalk between myeloid cells and pulmonary epithelial cells. Monocytic cells (Mono Mac 6 cell line, primary dendritic cells) and eosinophils produced primarily LTC4 In coincubations of these myeloid cells and epithelial cells, LTD4 became a prominent product. LTC4 released from the myeloid cells was further transformed by the epithelial cells in a transcellular manner. Formation of LTD4 was rapid when catalyzed by Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)1 in the A549 epithelial lung cancer cell line, but considerably slower when catalyzed by GGT5 in primary bronchial epithelial cells. When A549 cells were cultured in the presence of IL-1Î², GGT1 expression increased about 2-fold. Also exosomes from A549 cells contained GGT1 and augmented LTD4 formation. Serine-borate complex (SBC), an inhibitor of GGT, inhibited conversion of LTC4 to LTD4 Unexpectedly, SBC also upregulated translocation of 5-lipoxygenase (LO) to the nucleus in Mono Mac 6 cells, and 5-LO activity.

After the supplementation period, a series of stimulants (pokeweed mitogen, phytohemagluttinin, lipopolysaccharide, beta-lactoglobulin, and ibuprofen) was used to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo. Antigen expression on T cells (CD25 and CD80), B cells, and macrophages (CD54), as well as cytokine production (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor, IL-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma), were measured using flow cytometry, monoclonal antibodies, and cytometric bead array, respectively.Mononuclear cells from children provided long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) had fewer CD8+ cells expressing CD25 and CD80 compared with placebo after exposure to each mitogen. The LCPUFA group also exhibited lower proportions of CD14+ cells after stimulation with beta-lactoglobulin and ibuprofen. The proportion of CD54+ cells was 2-fold higher for the LCPUFA group compared with placebo after exposure to ibuprofen and beta-lactoglobulin (P < 0.05).

We recently established the larvae of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) as a model host for the investigation of L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and as a source of peptides exhibiting anti-Listeria-activity. Here we show that G. mellonella can be used to study brain infection and its impact on larval development as well as the activation of stress responses and neuronal repair mechanisms. The infection of G. mellonella larvae with L. monocytogenes elicits a cellular immune response involving the formation of melanized cellular aggregates (nodules) containing entrapped bacteria. These form under the integument and in the brain, resembling the symptoms found in human patients. We screened the G. mellonella transcriptome with marker genes representing stress responses and neuronal repair, and identified several modulated genes including those encoding heat shock proteins, growth factors, and regulators of neuronal stress. Remarkably, we discovered that L. monocytogenes infection leads to developmental shift in larvae and also modulates the expression of genes involved in the regulation of endocrine functions. We demonstrated that L. monocytogenes pathogenesis can be prevented by treating G. mellonella larvae with signaling inhibitors such as diclofenac, , and rapamycin.

However, the involvement of such injury in the inflammatory response associated with the inhalation of asbestos fibers is unclear and the mechanism of asbestos fiber cytotoxicity remains unknown. In the present study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were challenged with amosite asbestos and several parameters of cellular function were examined. Electron microscopic examination revealed that endothelial cell exposure to asbestos resulted in active phagocytosis of these particulates. Biochemical evidence of dose-dependent asbestos-mediated endothelial cell activation was indicated by increased metabolism of . For example, amosite asbestos (500 micrograms/ml) produced a ninefold increase in prostacyclin (PGI2) levels over those levels in non-exposed cells. Incubation of human endothelial cells with asbestos fibers induced specific 51Cr release in both a dose- and time-dependent fashion indicative of cellular injury. Injury induced by amosite asbestos was not significantly attenuated by treatment of the endothelial cell monolayer with either the iron chelator deferoxamine, which prevents hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation, or by the superoxide anion (O2-) scavenger, superoxide dismutase. However, significant dose-dependent protection was observed with the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger, catalase.

Oxidation of LDL phospholipids containing  at the sn-2 position occurs when a critical concentration of 'seeding molecules' derived from the lipoxygenase pathway is reached in LDL. This generates a series of biologically active, oxidized phospholipids that mediate the cellular events seen in the developing fatty streak.We have observed that LDL from mice that are genetically predisposed to diet-induced atherosclerosis is highly proinflammatory when the mice are maintained on an atherogenic diet, when they are injected with LDL-derived oxidized phospholipids, or once they are infected with influenza A virus. Patients with coronary atherosclerosis also had highly proinflammatory LDL, despite having normal blood lipid levels or normal plasma HDL levels.We and others have hypothesized that HDL and LDL-derived oxidized phospholipids may be part of a system of nonspecific innate .

These alterations were transferable with T cells, suggesting that this animal model could be used as a model for cellular IgE-independent . In the present study we demonstrated that depletion of T suppressor/cytotoxic cells failed to abolish the ability of transferred cells to induce hyperresponsiveness. Depletion of T helper cells partially inhibited the induction of hyperreactivity. Depletion of 14-30+ cells (the monoclonal antibody 14-30 reacts with a common isotype of T cell-derived antigen binding molecules [TABM] that can arm mast cells) completely abolished the ability to transfer hyperreactivity. The cromoglycate-like antiasthmatic drug nedocromil, which stabilizes mast cells, inhibited the induction of T cell-mediated hyperresponsiveness. Moreover, in mast cell-deficient mice, T cell-mediated hyperresponsiveness can be less induced compared with normal littermates. These experiments indicate that mast cells play at least a partial role in the induction of airway hyperresponsiveness in this model. Dexamethasone, a well-known inhibitor of phospholipase A2, inhibited the T cell-mediated hyperresponsiveness, whereas the cyclooxygenase inhibitor suprofen did not. This indicated that  metabolites, but not cyclooxygenase products, play a role in the induction of T cell-mediated hyperreactivity. Pretreatment with the lipoxygenase inhibitor AA-861 significantly inhibited the induction of tracheal hyperreactivity. Platelet-activating factor appeared not to be involved in the induction of hyperresponsiveness in this model, because the platelet-activating factor antagonist WEB 2170 failed to abolish the induction of T cell-mediated hyperreactivity. Intravenous injection of purified mast cell-arming TABM, followed by intranasal hapten challenge 30 min later, resulted in increased vascular permeability 2 h after challenge, which is characteristic of the early initiating phase of DTH. In addition, tracheal hyperreactivity (in vitro) and altered lung functions (in vivo) were observed 2 h after challenge. From these data we conclude that airway hyperreactivity and altered lung functions are induced by early steps in the cellular cascade of DTH.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1901879>Aspirin-like drugs prime human T cells.

Normal human T cells do not produce any eicosanoids. Therefore we studied whether ALD would affect purified T cells directly. We found that ALD enhanced the proliferation and IL-2 production of T cells in the absence of monocytes. This effect did not depend on  metabolism as no lipoxygenase products and only nonsuppressive levels of cyclooxygenase products were detected in T cell cultures. Several possible mechanisms of the ALD effect were ruled out including 1) enhanced mitogen binding, 2) induction of activation markers (IL-2R, transferrin receptor, HLA-DR) on the cell surface, 3) down-regulation of suppressor cells. ALD caused a rise in [Ca2+]i which appeared to reflect an influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular milieu and was more pronounced in CD4+ cells. The rise in intracellular levels of Ca2+, that is considered a necessary second messenger for T cell activation, may prime these cells for an enhanced response to mitogens. In addition, ALD increased T cell membrane fluidity but only at higher concentrations than those found to enhance proliferation.

A less pronounced concentration-dependent inhibitory response was observed with the C18 fatty acids linoleic , alpha-linolenic  and gamma-linolenic . Palmitic  and oleic did not have any effect on either basal or IL-1-stimulated proliferation at concentrations up to 100 microM. The potencies of each fatty  for this effect at a concentration of 100 microM were:  > EPA > or = DGLA > linoleic . DGLA,  and EPA also attenuated IL-2-stimulated proliferation. The inhibitory action of these fatty acids was not mediated by conversion to prostaglandins or other eicosanoids as the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ketoprofen and NDGA did not alter their action. Incubation of thymocytes with radiolabelled DGLA and EPA followed by reverse-phase HPLC analysis revealed that DGLA is predominantly converted to a more polar metabolite which is not PGE1 whereas EPA does not appear to be converted to any other detectable metabolite.

DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and play major roles in both the induction of primary immune responses and tolerance. It is well established that PGE2 functions significantly in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although the role of PGE2 in RA has been studied extensively, the effects of PGE2 on DC biology and the role of DCs in RA have not become the focus of investigation until recently. Here, we summarize the latest progress in PGE2 research with respect to DC functions, as well as the role of PGE2 receptor signaling of DCs in the pathogenesis of RA.Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Inhibition of cytolysis and activation by inhibitors of lipoxygenase: possible role of leukotrienes.</a></h2><p>Rat splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity against 51Cr-labeled YAC-1 or TMT-081 tumor cells can be augmented by culturing at 37 degrees C for 18 hr. Inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway of  metabolism, NDGA, alpha-phenanthroline, quercetin, ETYA, BW755C, esculetin, and timegadine, inhibited this NK activation and also inhibited NK cytotoxicity when added directly to the NK assay. However, there was a partial loss of sensitivity of activated NK cells to suppression by NDGA, BW755C, and esculetin. Indomethacin failed to reverse the inhibition of NK activation caused by NDGA. However, LTB4 and LTC4 (0.01 microgram/ml) were able to reverse the inhibitory effect of NDGA on NK activation. Furthermore, spleen cells cultured for 18 hr synthesized detectable amount of LTC4 in their supernatants. NDGA inhibited the LTC4 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. These data therefore suggest that leukotrienes are responsible for NK activation, and lipoxygenase activity is essential for NK cytolytic activity.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23047497>Role of fatty acids and polyphenols in inflammatory gene transcription and their impact on obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes.</a></h2><p>Obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes represent multi-factorial conditions resulting from improper balances of hormones and gene expression. In addition, these conditions have a strong inflammatory component that can potentially be impacted by the diet. The purpose of this review is to discuss the molecular targets that can be addressed by anti-inflammatory nutrition. These molecular targets range from reduction of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids that can alter hormonal signaling cascades to the modulation of the innate immune system, via toll-like receptors and gene transcription factors.

Dendritic cells process and present antigens to T lymphocytes. They are highly specialized antigen-presenting cells (APC) and usually considered as 'professional APC'. In the present paper, we report some data on the biosynthetic capacity of murine APC from the bone marrow (BM-DCs) to produce AA metabolites. Using an ELISA we have observed that BM-DCs spontaneously produce both PGE(2) and LTB(4) whose production increased in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In addition we found that LTB(4) production was twice as high when both COX pathways were blocked with selective COX-inhibitors. We have also investigated the effect of PGE(2) and LTB(4) on the in vitro generation of the so-called BM-DCs. Exogenous PGE(2) and LTB(4) added to bone marrow cultures inhibit and promote, respectively, BM-DC generation.

This review considers the essential role that ARA plays in infant development. ARA is always present in human milk at a relatively fixed level and is accumulated in tissues throughout the body where it serves several important functions. Without the provision of preformed ARA in human milk or infant formula the growing infant cannot maintain ARA levels from synthetic pathways alone that are sufficient to meet metabolic demand. During late infancy and early childhood the amount of dietary ARA provided by solid foods is low. ARA serves as a precursor to leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes, collectively known as eicosanoids which are important for  and immune response. There is strong evidence based on animal and human studies that ARA is critical for infant growth, brain development, and health. These studies also demonstrate the importance of balancing the amounts of ARA and DHA as too much DHA may suppress the benefits provided by ARA. Both ARA and DHA have been added to infant formulas and follow-on formulas for more than two decades.

Given the parasite ability to influence host  and metabolism, understanding of the metabolic alterations in the host's immune organs during T. gondii infection may enhanceÂ the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that define the pathophysiology of T. gondii infection.We investigated the global metabolic changes in the spleen of BALB/c mice at early and late stage of infection with T. gondii using LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics. Multivariate data analysis methods, principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used to identify metabolites that are influenced by T. gondii infection.Multivariate analyses clearly separated the metabolites of spleen of infected and control mice. A total of 132 differential metabolites were identified, 23 metabolites from acutely infected versus control mice and 109 metabolites from chronically infected versus control mice. Lipids, hormones, lactones, acids, peptides, antibiotics, alkaloids and natural toxins were the most influenced chemical groups. There were 12 shared differential metabolites between acutely infected versus control mice and chronically infected versus control mice, of which 4,4-Dimethyl-5alpha-cholesta-8,14,24-trien-3beta-ol was significantly upregulated and ubiquinone-8 was significantly downregulated. Major perturbed metabolic pathways included primary bile  biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, biotin metabolism, and steroid biosynthesis, with  metabolism being the most significantly impacted pathway.

We observed the differential expression of 581 genes upon exposure of whole blood to M. leprae sonicate in the retrospective study. We defined a 44 T1R gene set signature of differentially regulated genes. The majority of the T1R set genes were represented by three functional groups: i) pro-inflammatory regulators; ii)  metabolism mediators; and iii) regulators of anti-inflammation.

In this study we investigated whether prostaglandin subtypes metabolized from  (PGE2), dihomo-gamma-linolenic  (PGE1) or eicosapentaenoic  (PGE3) have different effects on T-cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of exogenous PGE1, PGE2 or PGE3. We found that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and to a lesser extent interleukin (IL)-10 production was inhibited by all PGE-subtypes in ConA-stimulated PBMC concomitant with unaffected IL-2 levels. The modulated cytokine production of ConA stimulated cells was independent of T-cell proliferation. PGE2 and PGE1 moderately stimulated proliferation, while PGE3 inhibited the proliferative response to some extent. In LPS-stimulated PBMC, TNF-alpha production was inhibited by all PGE-subtypes, whereas IL-6 remained unaffected and IL-10 production was increased. Time course experiments on the effects of PGE-subtypes on cytokine production after ConA or LPS stimulation showed these effects to be time dependent, but indifferent of the prostaglandin subtype added. Overall, the modulatory effects of PGE on cytokine production were irrespective of the subtype.

Tests for association in N = 329 individuals across 80 nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Fatty  Desaturase (FADS) locus revealed significant association with AA, DGLA and the AA/DGLA ratio, a measure of enzymatic efficiency, in both racial groups (peak signal p = 2.85 Ã 10(-16) in African Americans, 2.68 Ã 10(-23) in European Americans). Ancestry-related differences were observed at an upstream marker previously associated with AA levels (rs174537), wherein, 79-82% of African Americans carry two copies of the G allele compared to only 42-45% of European Americans. Importantly, the allelic effect of the G allele, which is associated with enhanced conversion of DGLA to AA, on enzymatic efficiency was similar in both groups.We conclude that the impact of FADS genetic variants on PUFA metabolism, specifically AA levels, is likely more pronounced in African Americans due to the larger proportion of individuals carrying the genotype associated with increased FADS1 enzymatic conversion of DGLA to AA.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2489284>[Phospholipid-deacylating activities of the mouse peritoneal macrophages during phagocytosis].</a></h2><p>In the macrophages (M phi) obtained from mouse peritoneal exudates, five kinds of phospholipid-deacylating activities were detected using phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) labeled with [1-14C]oleic  either in 1- or 2- position and 1- [1-14C]oleoyl-lysoPE, as substrates. Two types of phospholipipase A1 with pH optima of 4 to 6 and 8, respectively, and two types of phospholipase A2 activities with pH optima of 4 to 5 and 8, respectively, were identified. A detected lysophospholipase activity exhibited a broad pH optimum between 4 and 8. Both types of the phospholipase A1 and A2 of M phi hydrolyzed PE more than PC. Exogenously added Ca2+ did not increase the enzymatic activities. A comparison was made of three kinds of the M phi-phospholipid deacylating activities at pH8, after challenging the M phi with Mycobacterium lepraemurium, Escherichia coli, zymosan, or latex beads for 17 hours at 37 degrees C.

When the M phi were challenged with M. lepraemurium, the phospholipase A1, A2 and lysophospholipase activities were stimulated by about 160%, 150% and 140%, respectively. However, when challenged with E. coli, the phospholipase A1 activity remarkably decreased by about a third, although the phospholipase A2 activity was stimulated by about 150% that is similar to the challenge with M. lepraemurium.

Kanamycin, neomycin and streptomycin were compared to gentamicin in intact cells and in cell-free in vitro assays using luminescence detection with lucigenin or luminol. Neutrophils and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells served as cell models in which a respiratory burst of superoxide was induced by phorbol ester. The addition of millimolar amounts of any of the aminoglycosides increased the luminescence significantly.

Half-maximal stimulation was reached with (0.4 mM gentamicin, and there was an absolute requirement for an electron donor, .

Based upon the evidence from epidemiological data, case-control studies of phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) levels in human tissues, and antidepressant effect in clinical trials, PUFAs have shed a light to discover the unsolved of depression and connect the mind and body. Briefly, the deficit of n-3 PUFAs has been reported to be associated with neurological, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, autoimmune, metabolic diseases and cancers. Recent studies revealed that the deficit of n-3 PUFAs is also associated with depression. For example, societies that consume a small amount of omega-3 PUFAs appear to have a higher prevalence of major depressive disorder. In addition, depressive patients had showed a lower level of omega-3 PUFAs; and the antidepressant effect of PUFAs had been reported in a number of clinical trials. The PUFAs are classified into n-3 (or omega-3) and n-6 (or omega-6) groups. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the major bioactive components of n-3 PUFAs, are not synthesized in human body and can only be obtained directly from the diet, particularly by consuming fish. DHA deficit is associated with dysfunctions of neuronal membrane stability and transmission of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which might connect to the aetiology of mood and cognitive dysfunction of depression. On the other hand, EPA is important in balancing the immune function and physical healthy by reducing  (AA, an n-6 PUFA) level on cell membrane and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Interestingly, animals fed with high AA diet or treated with PGE2 were observed to present sickness behaviours of anorexia, low activity, change in sleep pattern and attention, which are similar to somatic symptoms of depression in human. Therefore, the deficit of EPA and DHA in depression might be associated with mood disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, medical comorbidity and somatic symptoms in depression. Indeed, the role of n-3 PUFAs in  and mood function supports the promising psychoneuroimmunologic hypothesis of depression and provides an excellent interface shared by body and mind.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2408764>B lymphocyte receptors and polyphosphoinositide degradation.</a></h2><p>Resting B lymphocytes can be activated and induced to proliferate by antibodies against their antigen receptors (anti-lg).

All the fatty acids added were elongated by activated PBMC and the maximal activity was observed on 20:4(n - 6) (a 25% of conversion to 22:4(n - 6)). Supplementation with stearic  increased the proportion of oleic (from 21.4% to 23.7%) and eicosaenoic (from 3.1% to 5.7%) acids in cellular lipids, indicating the existence of a delta 9-desaturase activity. Supplementation with linoleic and linoleic acids increased slightly the cell content in their more unsaturated derivatives. Direct measurement of desaturase activities was performed by incubating quiescent and activated PBMC with [1-14C]stearic, [1-14C]linoleic and [1-14C]linolenic acids. Quiescent cells exhibited a very low delta 9-desaturase and no sign of delta 6-desaturase activity. A moderate and progressive activation of delta 9-, delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases was observed during blastic transformation of human PBMC. Up to 8% of 18:0 was converted to monoenes, 4% and 1.5% of 18:2(n - 6) was converted to trienes and tetraenes, respectively, and 14.5% of 18:3(n - 3) was converted to pentaenes. The maximal relative activities were found after 48 h of PHA-stimulation for delta 9-desaturase (around 90 pmol of 18:0 converted per 10(6) cells in the last 24 h) and at 72 h for delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases (around 75 and 140 pmol of 18:2 and 18:3, respectively, converted per 10(7) cells in the last 24 h).

A generalized ceramide signal transduction scheme is shown in Fig. 2 in which ceramide is generated through the activation of distinct SMases residing in separate subcellular compartments in response to specific stimuli. Clearly, specificity of cellular responses to ceramide depends upon many factors which include the nature of the stimulus, co-stimulatory signals and the cell type involved. Ceramide derived from neutral SMase activation is thought to be involved in modulating CAPK and MAP kinases, PLA2 ( mobilization), and CAPP while ceramide generated through  SMase activation appears to be primarily involved in NF-kappa B activation. While there is no apparent cross-talk between these two ceramide-mediated signalling pathways, there is likely to be significant cross-talk between ceramide signalling and other signal transduction pathways (e.g., the PKC and MAP kinase pathways). Other downstream targets for ceramide action include Cox, IL-6 and IL-2 gene expression, PKC zeta, Vav, Rb, c-Myc, c-Fos, c-Jun and other transcriptional regulators. Many, if not all, of these ceramide-mediated signalling events have been identified in the various cells comprising the immune system and are integral to the optimal functioning of the immune system. Although the role of the SM pathway and the generation of ceramide in T and B lymphocytes have only recently been recognized, it is clear from these studies that signal transduction through SM and ceramide can strongly affect the immune response, either directly through cell signalling events, or indirectly through cytokines produced by other cells as the result of signalling through the SM pathway. An overview of the signalling mechanisms coupling ceramide to the modulation of the immune response is depicted in Fig. 3 and shows how ceramide may play pivotal roles in regulating a number of complex processes. The SM pathway represents a potentially valuable focal point for therapeutic control of immune responses, perhaps for either enhancement of the activity of T cells in the elimination of tumors, or the down-regulation of lymphocyte function in instances of autoimmune disease. The recent explosion of knowledge regarding ceramide signalling notwithstanding, a number of critical questions need to be answered before a comprehensive, mechanistic understanding can be formulated relative to the incredibly varied effects of ceramide on cell function. For example, (i) how is a structurally simple molecule like ceramide able to mediate so many different, and sometimes paradoxical, physiological responses ranging from cell proliferation and differentiation to inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis, (ii) what are the molecular identities and modes of activation of the various SMase isoforms, (iii) what determines the distribution of the unique isoforms of SMase in cells of different lineages or at different stages of differentiation, (iv) what is the relative contribution of ceramide generated through SM hydrolysis versus de novo synthesis, and (v) by what means does ceramide interact with specific intracellular targets? Although a number of ceramide-activatable kinases, phosphatases, and their protein substrates have been identified, a more extensive search for additional cellular targets will be indispensable in determining the phosphorylation cascades linking the activation of the SM pathway to the regulation of nuclear events. Clearly, cross-talk between ceramide-induced signal transduction cascades and other signalling pathways adds to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing the specific effects of complex, intertwining signalling pathways.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12344006>Defect of NK regulation in HIV-infected patients.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15541396>Binding of  to myeloid-related proteins (S100A8/A9) enhances phagocytic NADPH oxidase activation.</a></h2><p>Activation of the O(2)(-) generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes results from the assembly of the membrane-bound flavocytochrome b(558) with cytosolic proteins, p67(phox), p47(phox), and Rac.

We employed an IL-2 responsive T-cell line, HT-2 and also human peripheral blood T cells rendered IL-2 responsive by culture with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). In the presence of concentrations of IL-2 that resulted in suboptimal stimulation of HT-2 cells (5-20% of maximum proliferation), LTB4 at 10(-8) or 10(-10) M produced a several-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation, resulting in levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation that were comparable to those produced by HT-2 cells stimulated with optimal concentrations of IL-2. Similar results were obtained with the peripheral blood T cells. Leukotriene C4, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and  did not share with LTB4 the ability to stimulate proliferation of HT-2 cells. Hydrocortisone and nordihydroguairetic  (NDGA), drugs which block endogenous LTB4 production in cell cultures inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation of HT-2 cells stimulated by suboptimal but not optimal levels of IL-2.

The Ag-specific (TCR mediated) stimulation of cloned murine CTL was monitored by changes in intracellular calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) using the fluorescence indicator acetoxymethylester of fura-2 and by degranulation as measured by the release of BLT-esterase. Treatment of the CTL cells with any of the physiologically important FFA; oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), linolenic (18:3), or  (20:4) , at concentrations between 1 and 10 microM inhibits the target cell-mediated rise in [Ca2+]i which occurs within seconds of stimulation and the release of BLT-esterase, which occurs over a period of 1 to 3 h. These inhibitory effects are observed within seconds to minutes of FFA addition. Inhibition can be reversed by treating cells with fatty  free BSA and, in agreement with our previous studies, indicates that the effects of FFA are due to physical perturbations of cellular components. To determine the locus of this perturbation, the effect of FFA on the lipid order of CTL plasma membrane was determined using fluorescence polarization of the membrane impermeable probe trimethylammoniumdiphenylhexatriene. Cis unsaturated FFA were found to disorder the lipid acyl chains and the degree of disorder was found to increase with the degree of cis unsaturation. These results, together with the previous studies, suggest that inhibition results from a physical perturbation of plasma membrane lipid order. Moreover, because degranulation requires elevated levels of [Ca2+]i, it is likely that inhibition of degranulation results from a FFA-induced decrease in Ca2+ permeability through the membrane.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2123474>Interactions between inflammatory mediators in expression of antitumor cytostatic activity of macrophages.</a></h2><p>Antitumor properties and participation in inflammatory events are important characteristics of activated macrophages. We show here that both antitumor cytostatic function of macrophages and participation of these cells at inflammatory sites are controlled by two main groups of mediators: cytokines (IL-1, TNF alpha) and eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). These two groups of mediators represent a complex system of mutual interactions in regulation of their production and activities. Multiple sets of experiments with murine macrophages are discussed in favor of the views that PGE2 and lipoxygenase products oppose each other's actions, and that the regulating role of PGE2 in the secretions of cytokines are of pivotal importance in antitumor cytostasis of macrophages in vitro. Such observations can be extended to a situation ex vivo, showing that human macrophages harvested from inflammatory sites have markedly augmented cytostatic expression. It thus appears that the antitumor cytostatic function of macrophages is related to the production of inflammatory mediators by these cells.

We previously identified Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein as a negative regulator of fibroblast activation (Csepeggi, C., Jiang, M., Kojima, F., Crofford, L. J., and Frolov, A. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 2078-2087). Here we report that NPC2-deficiency leads to a dramatic up-regulation of the  (AA) metabolic pathway in human fibroblasts. The major enzymes in this pathway, cPLA2 type IVA, COX-2, and mPGES-1, were dramatically up-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The specific phenotypic changes resulted in a >10-fold increase in the production and secretion of a key modulator of inflammation and , prostaglandin E2. More importantly, AA metabolome profiling by liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry revealed the very specific nature of prostaglandin E2 up-regulation as the other analyzed AA metabolites derived from the COX-2, cytochrome P450, 5/15-lipoxygenase, and non-enzymatic oxidative pathways were mostly down-regulated. Blocking activity of cPLA2 efficiently suppressed expression of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1Î² and IL-6, thereby identifying cPLA2 as an important regulator of the inflammatory program in NPC2-null cells. Altogether, these studies highlight NPC2 as a specific regulator of AA metabolism and inflammation that suggests potential for NPC2 protein or its related signaling in the treatment of inflammatory diseases characterized by the presence of activated fibroblasts.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3008533>Production of leukotriene B4 by polymorphonuclear leukocytes during phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10690587>Immunopharmacology of 5-aminosalicylic  and of glucocorticoids in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids as well as 5-aminosalicylic  have been used successfully in different formulations during the past 40 years for the treatment of both acute and chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. The mechanism by which the drugs exert their actions are only partially known. Recent studies of the immunoregulation in the lamina propria provide evidence that numerous therapeutic mechanisms contribute to the efficacy of these drugs including the inhibition of  metabolism, a decrease in radical formation by oxygen radical scavenging, an inhibition of both in vivo and in vitro activation of peripheral and intestinal lymphocytes. Moreover direct immunoregulatory effects exerted by the drug may be important in influencing the complex balance of pro-inflammatory mechanisms during active intestinal inflammation. Such effects are the inhibition of both peripheral and intestinal B lymphocyte immunoglobulin secretion as well as the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and their binding to receptors. Some of these immunoregulatory effects appear to be mediated by an inhibition of the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor family by steroids and (less potent) aminosalicylic . Activation of nuclear factor kappa B appears to be pivotal for the sustained upregulation of inflammation molecule expression in many inflammatory diseases. It seems, therefore, most likely that the enormous therapeutic potency of steroids, as well as the anti-inflammatory properties of 5-aminosalicylic , are not achieved by a single action of the drug. The complex orchestration of numerous inhibitory interactions with pro-inflammatory principles will add to the therapeutic potential of steroids and of 5-aminosalicylic  in the treatment of both acute and chronic intestinal inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1559127>Decreased inhibition by gravidin of arachidonate release from transformed compared to nontransformed cells.</a></h2><p>1.

To this end, EVs were isolated from interferon-stimulated macrophage cultures or from serum of patients with acute or chronic hepatitis C.

Functional analyses were performed to assess the impact of PUFAs on EV-mediated antiviral . We found that macrophages secreted various cytokines shortly after stimulation with type I and II IFN, which orchestrated a fast but short-lasting antiviral state. This rapid innate immune answer was followed by the production of macrophage-derived EVs, which induced a late, but long-lasting inhibitory effect on HCV replication. Of note, exposure of macrophages to PUFAs, which are important regulators of immune responses, dampened EV-mediated antiviral immune responses. Finally, EVs from patients with hepatitis C exhibited long-lasting antiviral activities during IFN therapy as well. The antiviral effect of EVs from Caucasian and Japanese patients differed, which may be explained by different nutritional uptake of PUFAs.

In this study, we examined how exposure to fatty acids affects the production of growth-regulated oncogene/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (GRO/CINC-1) and interleukin (IL)-6 in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). The long-chain fatty acids, oleic, linoleic and  acids, and the middle-chain fatty  octanoic  were administered to subconfluent cultures of IEC-6 cells alone, or in combination with IL-1beta and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. The GRO/CINC-1 and IL-6 concentrations in culture media were determined by sandwich enzyme immunoassay. In epithelial cells, GRO/CINC-1 and IL-6 mRNA expression were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities determined by immunoblotting. Administration of long-chain fatty acids significantly increased the GRO/CINC-1 and IL-6 secretion into culture media, and this secretion was markedly increased (P < 0.05) in the presence of IL-1beta or TGF-beta. Octanoic  had no effect on GRO/CINC-1 or IL-6 production. Furthermore, treatment with long-chain fatty acids significantly enhanced the GRO/CINC-1 and IL-6 expression that was induced by IL-1beta or TGF-beta.

It can however be deleterious because of its localization or its deregulating effect. 2.The inflammatory reaction occurs in three phases. The first is vasculoexudation: dilatation of the blood vessels, followed by plasma exudation and leukocyte diapedesis. The second is a cellular or productive phase with formation of an inflammatory granuloma. Repair is the third phase, with retraction of the inflammatory focus, development of neocapillaries, regeneration of connective tissue, and variable regeneration of epithelial tissue. 3.In acute inflammatory processes, vasculoexudation predominates while in subacute inflammation, cellular phenomena play the major role. When the inflammation becomes chronic fibrosis is the most important process. 4.Antigen-presenting cells have a most important role. T-cells mediate cellular  and B-cells hormonal . Monocyte macrophages as well as polymorphonuclears support the phagocyte activity. Most cells share several functions with basophil polynuclears involved in allergic disease as well as in certain non-allergic inflammatory reactions. Endothelial cells secrete mediators leading to serum extravasation and influx of inflammatory substances and cells. Structural cells and platelets are also involved. 5.All cells participating in the inflammatory reaction secrete cytotoxic and/or effector and amplifying substances mediating the immune response. Soluble mediators include cytokines, acute phase proteins, enzymes, plasma activation systems (contact system, complement system, coagulation factors, fibrinolysis factors),  metabolites, biogenic or vasoactive amines (histamine, serotonin), eosinophil granular proteins, neuropeptides, oxygen free radicals, and nitrogen monoxide. 6.Several varieties of inflammation can be distinguished: foreign body reactions, anti-infectious agent reactions, and immunoallergic reactions.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7649404>Specificity of expression and effects of eicosanoid mediators in normal physiology and human diseases.</a></h2><p>The eicosanoids are a family of oxygenated  derivatives that potently mediate diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes.

Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g per day.

Furthermore, we conclude that moderate levels of ALNA and FO, which could be incorporated into the diet, can decrease some markers of endothelial activation and that this mechanism of action may contribute to the reported health benefits of n-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15780766>Oxidative stress and lipid mediators induced in alveolar macrophages by ultrafine particles.</a></h2><p>In ambient aerosols, ultrafine particles (UFP) and their agglomerates are considered to be major factors contributing to adverse health effects. Reactivity of agglomerated UFP of elemental carbon (EC), Printex 90, Printex G, and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) was evaluated by the capacity of particles to oxidize methionine in a cell-free in vitro system for determination of their innate oxidative potential and by alveolar macrophages (AMs) to determine production of  (AA), including formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostane. EC exhibiting high oxidative potential induced generation of AA, PGE2, LTB4, and 8-isoprostane in canine and human AMs. Printex 90, Printex G, and DEP, showing low oxidative capacity, still induced formation of AA and PGE2, but not that of LTB4 or 8-isoprostane. Aging of EC lowered oxidative potential while still inducing production of AA and PGE2 but not that of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane. Cellular ROS production was stimulated by all particles independent of oxidative potential. Particle-induced formation of AA metabolites and ROS was dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) as shown by inhibitor studies. In conclusion, cPLA2, PGE2, and ROS formation was activated by all particle types, whereas LTB4 production and 8-isoprostane were strongly dependent on particles' oxidative potential.

Major depression is characterized by significantly lower plasma concentrations of a number of key antioxidants, such as vitamin E, zinc and coenzyme Q10, and a lowered total antioxidant status. Lowered antioxidant enzyme activity, e.g. glutathione peroxidase (GPX), is another hallmark of depression. The abovementioned lowered antioxidant capacity may impair protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing damage to fatty acids, proteins and DNA by oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS). Increased ROS in depression is demonstrated by increased levels of plasma peroxides and xanthine oxidase. Damage caused by O&NS is shown by increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a by-product of polyunsaturated fatty  peroxidation and ; and increased 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, indicating oxidative DNA damage. There is also evidence in major depression, that O&NS may have changed inactive autoepitopes to neoantigens, which have acquired immunogenicity and serve as triggers to bypass immunological tolerance, causing (auto)immune responses. Thus, depression is accompanied by increased levels of plasma IgG antibodies against oxidized LDL; and increased IgM-mediated immune responses against membrane fatty acids, like phosphatidyl inositol (Pi); oleic, palmitic, and myristic ; and NO modified amino-acids, e.g. NO-tyrosine, NO-tryptophan and NO-arginine; and NO-albumin. There is a significant association between depression and polymorphisms in O&NS genes, like manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, and myeloperoxidase. Animal models of depression very consistently show lowered antioxidant defences and activated O&NS pathways in the peripheral blood and the brain. In animal models of depression, antidepressants consistently increase lowered antioxidant levels and normalize the damage caused by O&NS processes. Antioxidants, such as N-acetyl-cysteine, compounds that mimic GPX activity, and zinc exhibit antidepressive effects. This paper reviews the pathways by which lowered antioxidants and O&NS may contribute to depression, and the (neuro)degenerative processes that accompany that illness. It is concluded that aberrations in O&NS pathways are--together with the inflammatory processes--key components of depression. All in all, the results suggest that depression belongs to the spectrum of (neuro)degenerative disorders.Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that the antiparasitic activity of neutrophils can be greatly increased (>threefold) by short-term treatment with fatty acids with 20 to 24 carbon atoms and at least three double bonds. In particular, the n-3 polyenoic fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, and the n-6 fatty , , significantly enhanced neutrophil antiparasitic activity. This effect was >1.5-fold higher than that induced by an optical concentration of the known agonist cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). At suboptimal concentrations, the combination of  and TNF-alpha caused a synergistic increase in neutrophil-mediated parasite killing. The fatty -induced effect was independent of the availability of serum opsonins but dependent on the structure of the fatty acids. The length of the carbon chain, degree of unsaturation, and availability of a free carboxyl group were important determinants of fatty  activity. The fatty acids which increased neutrophil-mediated killing primed the enhanced superoxide radical generation of neutrophils in response to P. falciparum as detected by chemiluminescence. Scavengers of oxygen radicals significantly reduced the fatty -enhanced parasite killing, but cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors had no effect. These findings have identified a new class of immunoenhancers that could be exploited to increase resistance against Plasmodium species.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2931220>Strong prostaglandin associated suppression of the proliferation of human maternal lymphocytes by neonatal lymphocytes linked to T versus T cell interactions and differential PGE2 sensitivity.</a></h2><p>Lymphocytes from human fetuses and newborns strongly, regularly, and non-specifically suppress the proliferation of PHA stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes. The suppression is prostaglandin (PG)-dependent. Our present investigation clearly indicates that the suppression is associated with neonatal T versus maternal T lymphocyte interactions, independent of monocytes. This was borne out from co-cultures of PHA stimulated maternal and male cord T cells enriched by nylon wool columns (greater than 90% T3+ cells; residual adherent cells ranging between 0 and 0.05%, and sIg+ cells between 0.6 and 3.2%). Sex chromosomes served as markers for dividing cord (male) or maternal cells. Each of three separate PG synthetase inhibitors introduced into the co-cultures-indomethacin 28 microM, 5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraynoic  (ETYA) 33 microM, or Naprosyn 217 microM--decreased the suppression of the maternal T cells by a maximum of 65%, indicating the importance of PG for the suppression. Moreover, exogenous PGE2 ranging between 1.4 X 10(-5) and 1.4 X 10(-9) M strongly suppressed the proliferation of PHA stimulated maternal T cells (ranging between 62 and 26%) but left the proliferation of cord T cells virtually unchanged.

Release of AA was produced by IC and latex-OVA beads bound to IgG, whereas binding of C3bi to IC inhibited the ability of IC to release AA. In contrast, coating of zymosan particles with C3bi enhanced AA release as compared with that produced by non-coated particles. Masking of C3bi on C3bi-bound IC by incubation with anti-C3 IgG resulted in the recovery of their ability to release AA, thereby suggesting that binding of C3b by IC reduces their flogogenic effects, whereas opsonization of microbial walls by complement may enhance their proinflammatory potential. The binding/uptake of opsonized zymosan particles was inhibited by anti-CR3 Ab and C3bi-bound IC, but not by beta-glucan, mannan, and anti-Toll-like receptor 2 Ab. These findings show that cooperative engagement of CR3 on both the lectin-like site involved in beta-glucan binding and the I-domain involved in C3bi binding, as it can be observed in the innate immune response, produces AA release, whereas the unique interaction of C3bi-bound IC with the I-domain of CR3, as it may occur in the adaptive immune response, diverts the IC lattice from a productive interaction with FcgammaR linked to AA release.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19016853>Calcium-independent phospholipase A2-mediated formation of 1,2-diarachidonoyl-glycerophosphoinositol in monocytes.</a></h2><p>Phagocytic cells exposed to exogenous  (AA) incorporate large quantities of this fatty  into choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, and into phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns).

Surface marker expression was evaluated by flow cytometry, and granulocyte migration was assessed in a multiwell chemotaxis system.Exosomes from macrophages and DCs contain functional enzymes for LT biosynthesis. After incubation of intact cells with the LT biosynthesis intermediate LTA(4), LTB(4) was the major product of macrophages, whereas DCs primarily formed LTC(4). However, in exosomes from both cell types, LTC(4) was the predominant LTA(4) metabolite. Exosomal LTC(4) formation (per milligram protein) exceeded that of cells. In macrophages and DCs, TGF-Î²1 upregulated LTA(4) hydrolase along with increased LTB(4) formation also in the exosomes. Moreover, TGF-Î²1 modified the expression of surface marker proteins on cells and exosomes and reduced the exosome yield from macrophages. On Ca(2+)-ionophore and  stimulation, exosomes produced chemotactic eicosanoids and induced granulocyte migration. Interestingly, active LTA(4) hydrolase and LTC(4) synthase were present also in exosomes from human plasma.Our findings indicate that exosomes can contribute to inflammation by participation in LT biosynthesis and granulocyte recruitment.Copyright Â© 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

In the study presented here, the cultured human mesangial but not epithelial cells synthetized PAF not only in response to calcium ionophore A23187 and phagocytosis of immunoglobulin G-coated latex beads, but also after stimulation with cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta. PAF synthetized after stimulation with A23187 and to a lesser extent with phagocytosis was partially released. In contrast, PAF synthesized by stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta remained cell associated.

The present investigation, therefore, examined whether macrophage lipid metabolism is modulated by dexamethasone. Control and steroid treated macrophages were allowed to incorporate radiolabeled arachidonate and were incubated subsequently in the absence and presence of yeast. Following ingestion by control macrophages, arachidonate from phosphatidylcholine was readily cleaved to free fatty  and transferred to the neutral lipid fraction.

It was found: 1) that pertussis toxin interferes with the first pathway of T cell activation insofar as it can substitute for phytohemagglutinin or monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD3 surface proteins, suggesting that a G protein serves as transducer for signals via the T cell receptor-CD3 complex; and 2) that fluoride ions induce the release of diacylglycerol (DAG) from [3H]  or [3H]oleic -prelabeled cells. In [3H]inositol or 32P-prelabeled cells, the increase in DAG production was also found to be accompanied by a 280% increase of intracellular inositol phosphate (IP), without significant modification of IP2 and IP3. These results suggest that a G protein controls the activity of a phospholipase C in Jurkat cells that upon stimulation releases DAG but not IP3. Inasmuch as DAG, like the phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, activates protein kinase C, it suggests that a G protein is also involved in the transduction of the second signal for lymphocyte activation. Fluoride ions were found to be as effective as tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate to stimulate IL-2 synthesis in Jurkat cells when used in combination with phytohemagglutinin. Finally, cholera toxin and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)-triphosphate were found to increase intracellular cyclic adenosine triphosphate and to inhibit IL-2 synthesis.

This generated a range of cells enriched in saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, including n-3 acids of fish oil origin. Saturated fatty  enrichment enhanced macrophage adhesion to both tissue culture plastic and bacterial plastic compared with enrichment with polyunsaturated fatty acids. Macrophages enriched with the saturated fatty acids myristate or palmitate showed decreases of 28% and 21% respectively in their ability to phagocytose unopsonized zymosan particles. Those enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids showed 25-55% enhancement of phagocytic capacity. The greatest rate of uptake was with arachidonate-enriched cells. Phagocytic rate was highly correlated with the saturated/unsaturated fatty  ratio, percentage of polyunsaturated fatty  and index of unsaturation, except for macrophages enriched with fish-oil-derived fatty acids; they showed lower phagocytic activity than expected on the basis of their degree of unsaturation. These results suggest that membrane fluidity is important in determining macrophage adhesion and phagocytic activity.

Supernatants from activated CRTH2(+) CD4(+) Th2 cells caused a concentration-dependent increase in the migration of naive CRTH2(+) CD4(+) Th2 cells compared to supernatants from unstimulated CRTH2(+) CD4(+) Th2 cells. The level of chemotactic activity peaked at 8 hr after activation, corresponding to the peak levels of PGD(2), but production of chemotactic activity was only partially inhibited by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac.

These data suggest that CRTH2 plays an important paracrine role in mediating chemotactic activation of Th2 cells.

During an outbreak of Streptococcus iniae, fish fed with moderate ARA survived significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) better (89%) than the control and the high ARA groups (59% and 48%, respectively). Moderate ARA supplementation resulted in elevated lysozyme and complement levels in the plasma of rabbitfish. A significant increase in the total serum immunoglobulin levels was observed in both the medium and the high ARA level groups; however, a decrease in antiprotease activity was recorded in the supplemented groups as compared to the control. Fatty  analysis in fish red blood cells revealed a significant (pÂ <Â 0.05) increase in the proportion of ARA of total fatty acids in the groups fed with the medium and the high ARA level diets (9.5% and 11.2%, respectively, compared to 7.1% in the control).

By contrast, alkylglycerols did not affect the outcomes of P. aeruginosa infection. Our findings suggest that supplementation with ray oil enriched in DHA/EPA (2:1) can be considered as a preventive treatment for patients at risk for P. aeruginosa infection.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9710433>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration to HIV-infected subjects augments reduced leukotriene synthesis and anticryptococcal activity in neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil (PMN) dysfunction occurs in HIV infection. Leukotrienes (LT) are mediators derived from the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway that play a role in host defense and are synthesized by PMN. We investigated the synthesis of LT by PMN from HIV-infected subjects. There was a reduction (4.0+/-1.3% of control) in LT synthesis in PMN from HIV-infected compared with normal subjects. This was associated with reduced expression of 5-LO-activating protein (31.2+/-9.6% of normal), but not of 5-LO itself. Since HIV does not directly infect PMN, we considered that these effects were due to reduced release of cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). We examined the effect of G-CSF treatment (300 microgram daily for 5 d) on eight HIV-infected subjects. PMN were studied in vitro before therapy (day 1) and on days 4 and 7. LTB4 synthesis was increased on day 4 of G-CSF treatment, and returned toward day 1 levels on day 7. 5-LO and 5-LO-activating protein expression were increased in parallel. As a functional correlate to this increase in PMN LT synthesis by G-CSF, we examined the effects on killing of Cryptococcus neoformans. Anticryptococcal activity of PMN from HIV-infected subjects was less than that of PMN from normal subjects. G-CSF treatment improved fungistatic activity of PMN. This increase in antifungal activity was attenuated by in vitro treatment with the LT synthesis inhibitor, MK-886. In conclusion, PMN from HIV-infected subjects demonstrate reduced 5-LO metabolism and antifungal activity in vitro, which was reversed by in vivo G-CSF therapy.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2537352>Eicosanoids in skin of patients with atopic dermatitis: prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 are present in biologically active concentrations.</a></h2><p>The biochemical events leading to atopic dermatitis (AD) are unknown. Certain eicosanoids derived from  are potent mediators of skin inflammation and modulators of certain T-lymphocyte activities. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether eicosanoids are present in biologically active concentrations in the skin of adult patients with AD. The levels of the cyclooxygenase product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and the lipoxygenase products, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  were determined in biopsy specimens obtained by keratome from lesional, perilesional, and clinically unaffected skin of patients with AD. Methods for identification of eicosanoids included reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassays. Eicosanoid levels were at the same level in normal skin and in uninvolved skin of AD. Compared with uninvolved skin, both lesional and perilesional skin contained markedly elevated concentrations of PGE2 and LTB4: PGE2, 97.2 +/- 15.6 ng/gm of lesional skin and 128.3 +/- 27.2 ng/gm of perilesional skin; LTB4, 5.2 +/- 1.6 ng/gm of lesional skin and 3.2 +/- 0.6 ng/gm of perilesional skin. Compared with uninvolved skin, the levels of 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  were elevated sevenfold and elevenfold, respectively, in lesional skin, but did not reach biologically active concentrations. The results demonstrate that the inflammatory mediators PGE2 and LTB4 are present in lesional skin of atopic subjects in biologically active concentrations. Because these mediators are able to induce cutaneous inflammation and to modulate cellular , they may be involved in the biochemical processes leading to AD.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21077736>Exposure to host or fungal PGEâ abrogates protection following immunization with Candida-pulsed dendritic cells.</a></h2><p>Candida albicans produces an immunomodulatory oxylipin from  that is structurally identical to host prostaglandin Eâ (PGEâ).

Direct measurement of enzymatic activity in vitro of TCR/CD3-stimulated Jurkat cell extracts on labeled vesicle substrates showed that TCR/CD3 cross-linking resulted in AA release from sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) vesicles, as detected by TLC analysis, suggesting that DAG lipase was activated following TCR/CD3 stimulation and DAG generation. On the contrary, no phospholipase A2 activation was observed in response to TCR/CD3 stimulation, since no lyso-phospholipids were generated in vitro from either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, or from phosphatidic  vesicles. Moreover, the 1-DAG lipase inhibitor RHC80267 completely blocked TCR/CD3-dependent AA release in vitro and in vivo, without effect upon TCR/CD3-dependent inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation. Importantly, evidence for further metabolism of released AA was obtained, since synthesis and release of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CLT), but not of leukotriene B4 or cyclooxygenase products, could be detected by radioimmunoassay in different T cell lines and peripheral blood T cells following TCR/CD3 cross-linking. Moreover, HPLC analysis revealed an accumulation of leukotriene E4 in TCR/CD3 stimulated Jurkat cells. This was associated with translocation of 5-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to the cell membranes. Finally, TCR/CD3-mediated CLT production was blocked by MK886, a specific inhibitor of 5-LO translocation and activation.

PGE(2) is generated from  by the sequential actions of the COX and terminal synthases (PGES). Increased levels of COX-2, with a concomitant elevation of PGE(2), are often found in colorectal cancers (CRC), providing the rationale for the use of COX-2 inhibitors for chemoprevention. Despite their proven efficacy in cancer prevention, however, COX-2 inhibitors exhibit dose-dependent toxicities that are mediated in part by their nonspecific reduction of essential prostanoids, thus limiting their chemopreventive benefit. To achieve enhanced specificity, recent efforts have been directed toward targeting the inducible terminal synthase in the production of PGE(2), microsomal PGES (mPGES-1). In the present study, we show that genetic deletion of mPGES-1 affords significant protection against carcinogen-induced colon cancer. mPGES-1 gene deletion results in an about 80% decrease in tumor multiplicity and up to a 90% reduction in tumor load in the distal colon of azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice.

Two intracellular PLA s, iPLA A and iPLA B, have been found in Spodoptera exigua. Both are calcium-independent cellular PLA . Their orthologs have been found in other insects. These two iPLA s are different in ankyrin motif of N terminal region. The objective of this study was to determine whether Toll/immune deficiency (IMD) signal pathways could mediate cellular immune responses via induction of iPLA expression. Both iPLA  s were expressed in all developmental stages of S. exigua, showing the highest expression in the adult stage. During larval stage, hemocyte is the main tissue showing expression of these iPLA s. Both iPLA s exhibited similar expression patterns after immune challenge with different microbial pathogens such as virus, bacteria, and fungi. Promoter component analysis of orthologs encoded in S. frugiperda indicated nuclear factor-ÎºB- and Relish-responsible elements on their promoters, suggesting their expression in S. exigua under Toll/IMD immune signaling pathways. RNA interference (RNAi) of MyD88 or Pelle under Toll pathway suppressed inducible expression levels of both iPLA s in response to Gram-positive bacteria containing Lys-type peptidoglycan or fungal infection. In contrast, RNAi against Relish under IMD pathway suppressed both iPLA s in response to infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Under RNAi conditions, hemocytes significantly lost cellular immune response measured by nodule formation. However, addition of  (a catalytic product of PLA ) rescued such immunosuppression.

However, EPO contains a very high level of linoleic  which itself can affect lymphocyte functions and it is not clear to what extent the effects of EPO can be attributed to GLA. The current study investigated the effect of two levels of GLA in the rat diet upon immune cell functions; the level of linoleic  was maintained below 30 g/100 g total fatty acids. Weanling rats were fed on high fat (178 g/kg) diets which contained 4.4 g or 10 g GLA/100 g total fatty acids in place of a proportion of linoleic . The total polyunsaturated fatty  content and the n-6 to n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  ratio of the diet were maintained at 35 g/100 g total fatty acids and 7, respectively. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet, with an increase in the proportions of GLA and dihomo-gamma-linolenic  when the diets containing GLA were fed; these diets also increased the proportion of  in spleen leukocytes. Spleen lymphocyte proliferation in response to concanavalin A was significantly reduced (by 60%) by feeding the diet containing the higher level of GLA, but not by the diet containing the lower level of GLA. Spleen natural killer cell activity and prostaglandin E (PGE) production by spleen leukocytes were not significantly affected by inclusion of GLA in the diet, although there was a tendency towards decreased natural killer cell activity by cells from rats fed the high GLA diet. Thus, this study shows that dietary GLA is capable of altering the fatty  composition of cells of the immune system and of exerting some immunomodulatory effects, but that the level of GLA in the diet must exceed 4.4 g/100 g total fatty acids for these effects to become apparent.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15626436>Phospholipase A2 pathway association with macrophage-mediated polycarbonate-urethane biodegradation.</a></h2><p>Activation of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) pathway is a key cell signaling event in the inflammatory response.

Given the well-documented activating role of biomaterials in the inflammatory response to medical implants, the present study investigated the link between PLA2 and polycarbonate-based polyurethane (PCNU) biodegradation, and the effect that material surface had on PLA2 activation in the U937 cell line. PCNUs were synthesized with poly(1,6-hexyl 1,2-ethyl carbonate)diol, 1,4-butanediol and one of two diisocyanates (hexane 1,6-diisocyanate or 4,4'-methylene bisphenyl diisocyanate) in varying stoichiometries and incubated with adherent U937 cells. PLA2 inhibiting agents resulted in significantly decreased PCNU biodegradation (p < 0.05). Moreover, when activation of PLA2 was assessed (3H-AA release), significantly more 3H-AA was released from PCNU-adherent U937 cells than polystyrene-adherent U937 cells (p < 0.05) which was significantly decreased in the presence of PLA2 inhibitors. The pattern of inhibition of U937 cell-mediated biodegradation and 3H-AA release that was modulated by PCNU surface differences, suggests a role for secretory PLA2 along with cytosolic PLA2.

It completes the essay with a prospectus meant to illuminate research opportunities for interested readers. In more detail, cellular and secretory types of PLA, similar to those known on the biomedical background, have been identified in insects and their roles in eicosanoid biosynthesis documented. It highlights recent findings showing that eicosanoid biosynthetic pathway in insects is not identical to the solidly established biomedical picture. The relatively low concentrations of  (AA) present in insect phospholipids (PLs) (< 0.1% in some species) indicate that PLA may hydrolyze linoleic  (LA) as a precursor of eicosanoid biosynthesis. The free LA is desaturated and elongated into AA. Unlike vertebrates, AA is not oxidized by cyclooxygenase, but by a specific peroxidase called peroxinectin to produce PGH, which is then isomerized into cell-specific PGs. In particular, PGE synthase recently identified converts PGH into PGE. In the cross-talks with other immune mediators, eicosanoids act as downstream signals because any inhibition of eicosanoid signaling leads to significant immunosuppression. Because host immunosuppression favors pathogens and parasitoids, some entomopathogens evolved a PLA inhibitory strategy activity to express their virulence.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11855293>[Suppression of nonspecific resistance of the body under the effect of extremely high frequency electromagnetic radiation of low intensity].</a></h2><p>The dynamics of leukocyte number and functional activity of peripheral blood neutrophils under whole-body exposure of healthy mice to low-intensity extremely-high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (EHF EMR, 42.0 GHz, 0.15 mW/cm2, 20 min daily) was studied.

Severe sepsis is associated with the failure of neutrophil migration. To investigate whether CRTH2 influences neutrophil recruitment and the lethality during sepsis, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery in mice. CRTH2 knockout (CRTH2(-/-)) mice were highly resistant to CLP-induced sepsis, which was associated with lower bacterial load and lower production of TNF-Î±, IL-6, and CCL3. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was higher in CRTH2(-/-) mice, blunting CLP-induced lethality in CRTH2(-/-) mice. Neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneum was more pronounced after CLP in CRTH2(-/-) mice, which was associated with higher CXCR2 levels in circulating neutrophils. Furthermore, sepsis caused a decrease in the level of acetylation of histone H3, an activation mark, at the CXCR2 promoter in wild-type neutrophils, suggesting that CXCR2 expression levels are epigenetically regulated. Finally, both pharmacological depletion of neutrophils and inhibition of CXCR2 abrogated the survival benefit in CRTH2(-/-) mice. These results demonstrate that genetic ablation of CRTH2 improved impaired neutrophil migration and survival during severe sepsis, which was mechanistically associated with epigenetic-mediated CXCR2 expression.

Taken together these data indicate that PA-LOX can oxidize the membrane lipids of eukaryotic cells and that the functional consequences of this reaction strongly depend on the cell type.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.

The molecular mechanisms of rapid production of active oxygen species (AOS), however, are not well known. We isolated homologs of gp91 phox, a plasma membrane protein of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, from a potato cDNA library. Molecular cloning of the cDNA showed that there are two isogenes, designated StrbohA and StrbohB, respectively. The RNA gel blot analyses showed that StrbohA was constitutively expressed at a low level, whereas StrbohB was induced by hyphal wall components (HWC elicitor) from Phytophthora infestans in potato tubers. Treatment of potato tubers with HWC elicitor caused a rapid but weak transient accumulation of H2O2 (phase I), followed by a massive oxidative burst 6 to 9 h after treatment (phase II). Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase, blocked both bursts, whereas pretreatment of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide with the tuber abolished only the second burst. These results suggest that the expression of StrbohA and StrbohB contributes to phase I and II bursts, respectively. The same is true for , a lipid component of P. infestans-stimulated biphasic oxidative burst, whereas an endogenous signaling molecule, salicylic , only induced a weak phase II burst. Both molecules induced the StrbohB expression, which is in agreement with the second burst. To characterize the signal transduction pathway leading to the oxidative burst, we examined the role of protein phosphorylation in HWC-stimulated StrbohB gene expression. K252a and staurosporine, two protein kinase inhibitors, blocked the transcript accumulation. Two inhibitors of extracellular Ca2+ movement, however, did not abolish the transcript accumulation of StrbohB, suggesting that certain calcium-independent protein kinases are involved in the process of StrbohB gene expression. Additionally, we examined a causal relationship between the oxidative burst and expression of defense genes induced by the HWC elicitor. The transcript accumulation of genes related to sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin synthesis (lubimin and rishitin) and phenylpropanoid pathway was inhibited slightly by the DPI treatment, suggesting that the oxidative burst is not essential to activate these genes. Interestingly, the concomitant presence of DPI with the elicitor resulted in an increase in lubimin accumulation and a decrease in rishitin accumulation. Because it is known that lubimin is metabolized into rishitin via oxylubimin, we propose that AOS mediates the synthesis of rishitin from lubimin.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7523442>Prostaglandins and inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism suppress experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.</a></h2><p>Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is an animal model of post-infectious encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis (MS). Acute EAE is mediated by macrophages and by T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes directed against brain antigens. Inflammation in EAE could potentially be modified by prostaglandins (PG) secreted by blood monocytes (Mo) and brain glial cells. PGE elevates cAMP, which inhibits Mo function and selectively blocks secretion of cytokines by Th1 cells. In the present study, we found that a long-acting PGE1 analogue (LAPGE) inhibited clinical and histological EAE. Indomethacin (INDO) also suppressed active EAE. The combination of INDO plus LAPGE inhibited disease further, possibly by allowing LAPGE to function unopposed by immunostimulatory PG. EAE was suppressed when these agents were administered from the time of immunization or from the onset of clinical disease. The combination of INDO plus LAPGE also inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to myelin basic protein (MBP), and diminished in vitro lymphocyte responses to mitogens and MBP. PGE analogues and modifiers of arachidonate metabolism block autoimmune responses to brain antigens in vitro and in vivo, and may ameliorate inflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the brain and other organs.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3084670>Temporal relationships among immunologic alterations in a guinea pig model of thermal injury.</a></h2><p>Temporal relationships among various humoral and cellular alterations of host defense mechanisms were investigated in a guinea pig model of thermal injury during three weeks after burning. Reduction in serum concentration of C3 and fixation of C3 on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, presence of activated C3 in plasma, and elevations in levels of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 in wound fluid were observed at 3-6 hr after burning. These alterations were accompanied by reduction in intrinsic bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) against P. aeruginosa, suppression of bactericidal activity of PMNs by serum, and decreased blood clearance of P. aeruginosa. All parameters returned to normal values by seven to nine days after burning. Proliferative responses of splenic lymphocytes to T cell mitogens were depressed at four days after burning and were maximally reduced at eight days.

Pyruvate was previously shown to be an important lipid precursor for lymphocytes, macrophages and tumour cells. This study now reports the role of prostaglandins (PG) on the regulation of lipogenesis from [3-14C] pyruvate in 24-h cultured lymphocytes. It is shown that indomethacin (10 microM) and ibuprofen (10 microM), both inhibitors of PG biosynthesis, increased [3-14C] pyruvate incorporations into phospholipid and cholesterol fractions in resting lymphocytes but reduced its incorporation into these fractions in concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated lymphocytes and tumour cells. These two agents also affected [2-14C] thymidine incorporation into the DNA of these cells in the same manner. Lipids produced from [3-14C] pyruvate and exported into the cell culture medium were also measured. The PG biosynthesis inhibitions reduced the transfer to culture medium of , phospholipids, cholesterol and fatty acids higher than C20 by lymphocytes and tumour cells. Although macrophages are not proliferative cells, the cytoplasmic export measurement is important because these cells have a high capacity for lipid secretion. The results show that the PG biosynthesis inhibitors do not affect the export of phospholipids and cholesterol in macrophages. They do however markedly change the export of  and fatty acids higher than C20 produced from [3-14C] pyruvate in macrophages. It is also reported that a cell-stimulating response diminished the above fatty  outcome in resting cells and augmented it in thioglycollate-stimulated macrophages. The findings suggest that PG modulation of lipogenesis may depend on cell cycle phase as well as the intrinsic lipid metabolic diversity and capacity.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8329189>Circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha is an important mediator of  and inflammation, and because of its biologic activities (activation of neutrophils, release of  metabolites from synovial cells, induction of cartilage resorption and inhibition of proteoglycan release in cartilage) is one of the potential mediators of the chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.

We tested sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative arthritis, osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis and normal healthy subjects as controls. Furthermore, we statistically analysed data to investigate whether a correlation exists between serum levels of TNF alpha and some humoral indexes of disease activity. The results show strikingly higher TNF alpha levels in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients when compared both to normal controls and arthritis or connective tissue disease controls. TNF alpha was also found to correlate positively with levels of the rheumatoid factor as measured either by means of the latex agglutination test (LAT) or by nephelometry.

All compounds were potent inhibitors of formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)- and platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced superoxide anion generation, beta-glucuronidase release and Ca++ influx. The PAF-induced release of LTB4 in the presence of 10 mumoles/l  was significantly attenuated by these prostaglandins. This inhibition of PMN function was paralleled by an increase in cellular cAMP levels. The molar potency of the prostaglandins used was comparable, although the D-type compounds appeared slightly more potent in some PMN function tests. None of the substances affected PMN activation induced by the calcium inophore calcimycin (A23187). The data demonstrate an effective inhibition of receptor-mediated (FMLP, PAF) PMN activation by PGD2 and its mimetic ZK 110.841, suggesting either an inhibitory PGD2 receptor on human PMN or action of PGD2 at the PGE receptor.

Although the macrophage is a primary source of IL-1, epidermal, epithelial, lymphoid, and vascular tissues synthesize IL-1. When IL-1 gains access to the circulation, it induces a broad spectrum of systemic changes in physiologic, neurologic, metabolic, hematologic, and endocrine systems. However, because IL-1 lacks a signal peptide, a considerable amount of the IL-1 synthesized may remain associated with the cell and particularly as part of the plasma membrane where it may participate in lymphocyte activation and mesenchymal tissue remodeling. Two gene products code for IL-1: IL-1-beta and IL-1-alpha. The spectrum of biological activities of IL-1 are induced by both forms and receptors for IL-1 recognize both forms. The most consistent property of IL-1 is upregulation of cellular metabolism and increased expression of several genes coding for biologically active molecules. IL-1 is a highly inflammatory molecule and stimulates the production of  metabolites, most consistently, prostaglandin E. IL-1 also acts synergistically with other cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor. Some of the multiple biological effects of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor are prevented by cyclooxygenase inhibitors whereas others are unaffected. Given the widespread use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, understanding their effect on IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor action is important in several disease models.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624493>The influence of dietary supplementation of  on prostaglandin production and oxidative stress in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.</a></h2><p>In a previous study, dietary supplementation with  (ARA) to oysters Crassostrea gigas increased haemocyte numbers, phagocytosis, and production of reactive oxygen species level (ROS) by haemocytes (Delaporte et al., 2006). To assess if the observed stimulation of these cellular responses resulted from changes of ARA-related prostaglandin (PG) production, we analysed prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGEM) content on the same oysters fed three levels of ARA. Dietary supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could also induce an oxidative stress that could similarly increase cellular responses; therefore, two indicators of oxidative stress were analysed: peroxidation level and antioxidant defence status. Together the observed positive correlation between ARA and PGEM levels and the absence of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant activity changes supports the hypothesis of an immune stimulation via PG synthesis. Although ARA proportion in oyster tissues increased by up to 7-fold in response to ARA dietary supplementation, peroxidation index did not change because of a compensatory decrease in n-3 fatty  proportion, mainly 22:6n-3. To further confirm the involvement of PG in the changes of haemocyte count, phagocytosis and ROS production upon ARA supplementation, it would be interesting to test cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase inhibitors in similar experiments.Copyright Â© 2011.

However, the specific role of inflammation during EAEC pathogenesis has not been investigated in detail. To better understand how EAEC may induce inflammation, we have focused our attention on the intimate interactions between EAEC and the host epithelium and the subsequent induction of host cell signaling events leading to innate immune responses.

Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells derived from hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells which migrate and mature close to epithelial, blood vessels, and nerves. In almost all vascularized tissues there are MCs that produce, contain and release biologically active products including cytokines,  compounds, and proteases. In addition, MCs participate in innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate responses in the central nervous system (CNS) occur during neuroinflammatory phenomena, including migraine. Antigens found in the environment have a crucial role in inflammatory response, causing a broad range of diseases including migraine. They can be recognized by several innate immune cells, such as macrophages, microglia, dendritic cells and MCs, which can be activated trough Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. MCs reside close to primary nociceptive neurons, associate with nerves, and are capable of triggering local . MCs are involved in the pathophysiology of various tissues and organs, especially where there is an increase of angiogenesis. Activated MCs release preformed mediators include histamine, heparin, proteases (tryptase, chimase), hydrolases, cathepsin, carboxypeptidases, and peroxidase, and they also generate pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In addition, activated macrophages, microglia and MCs in the CNS release pro-inflammatory cytokines which provoke an increase of  product levels and lead to migraine and other neurological manifestations including fatigue, nausea, headaches and brain fog. Innate immunity and pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 cytokine family members can be inhibited by IL-37, a relatively new member of the IL-1 family.

Although different hypotheses related to modifications of  metabolism or alterations at the level of the cell membrane have been put forward to explain their suppressive effect on the lymphocyte growth, their mechanism of action remains largely unknown. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) has been shown to be an important target involved in the control of lymphocyte proliferation. The present study aimed to determine whether in vitro addition of a physiological concentration (5 microM) of n-6 (20:3n-6) or n-3 (18:4n-3, 20:5n-3, 22:6n-3) fatty acids to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was able to alter the PDE activity of these cells, and especially the PDE increase in response to Con A stimulation. Pretreatment of human PBMC for a short period of time (90 min) with 5 microM of either 20:3n-6, 20:5n-3 or 22:6n-3 was sufficient to induce a significant enrichment of cellular phospholipids in the corresponding fatty , whereas 18:4n-3 was poorly incorporated.

One of the major products of cyclooxygenase activity is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). As is known, macrophages (Mo) are the main PGE2 producer cells among the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBL) and can be induced to release PGE2 during T cell activation. On culturing PBL with T cell mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or monoclonal antibody OKT3, the levels of PGE2 produced by Mo were positively correlated with the entity of the T cell mitogenic signal. During T cell activation, subcellular factors able to provide positive or negative signals on the Mo PGE2 production are released in culture. We observed that recombinant IL2 strongly enhanced PGE2 synthesis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated Mo culture, while recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) partially inhibited its production. Moreover, purified IL1 induced PGE2 synthesis in resting Mo and increased its production when Mo were activated by LPS. The PGE2 released during T cell activation seems to have no effect on T cell mitogenesis, since the addition of cyclooxygenase inhibitors did not influence the proliferative response of mitogen stimulated T cells. However, the addition of PGE2 to OKT3 stimulated PBL at the beginning of the culture period inhibited the proliferative response in a dose-dependent manner. Its addition had no effect on PHA-stimulated PBL cultures.

These two types of cells were induced to differentiate with a combination of phorbol ester, retinoic , and extracellular matrix. The induced cells displayed the morphology of histiocytes or histiocytelike cells, with a small, round or oval, eccentric nucleus and abundant cytoplasm. In ultrastructural studies, many cytoplasmic projections and rugae were observed. These induced cells exhibited abundant cytoplasmic lysosomal enzymes, such as esterase,  phosphatase, alpha 1-antitrypsin, or lysozyme. The histiocytic nature of these induced cells was further confirmed by the increased expression of many monocyte/histiocyte markers, including CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD68, Mac387, and 1E9. In functional tests, the induced cells were shown to produce interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and/or prostaglandin E2. Phagocytosis was detected in less than 5% to 10% of the cells when Candida albicans was added to cultures.

Platelet to T. gondii ratios as low as 1:3 were toxic to the organisms with direct cell-cell contact essential for platelet-mediated cytotoxicity. Adherence of platelets to T. gondii and disruption of surface membranes and cytoplasmic contents of the organisms were observed ultrastructurally. Reactive oxygen species were not implicated in the platelet-mediated toxicity. The interaction of T. gondii with platelets resulted in a marked increase in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) production compared with that by unstimulated platelets. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors acetylsalicylic  and indomethacin inhibited platelet-mediated cytolytic activity as did the selective TXA2 synthetase inhibitor dazmegrel, indicating a role for thromboxane in the platelet-induced cytotoxicity. Further, toxoplasmacidal activity was retained in the TXA2 synthetase-containing microsomal fractions of platelets disrupted by freezing and thawing; cytolytic activity was absent in microsome-depleted platelet supernatant fractions. Both the TXA2-generating platelet microsome system and a stable TXA2 analogue induced damage to the cellular membranes of the Toxoplasma as noted by transmission electron microscopy. These findings suggest that platelets may play a role in the host defense against Toxoplasma and that release of thromboxane may be important in this cytolytic process.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3000638>[The other face of oxygen (1)].</a></h2><p>The other face this two-faced Janus, the oxygen, allows us, by now, to see dimly is the bad, aggressive one shown by its free radicals, should they escape the respiratory machine, or, rather, should they follow the respiratory explosion of leucocytes and macrophage, or the same compromission of the cellular structure.

Cells grown in medium with 20 micromol/l LA contained 2- to 3-fold more n-6 PUFA including 4-fold more . Cells grown in medium with 20 micromol/l LNA contained 4-fold more n-3 PUFA. Both LA and LNA enhanced phagocytosis and decreased oxidative burst, with little difference between the fatty acids.

In this study, we examined the effect of ASA on murine dextran sodium sulfate colitis. A mouse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol and post mortem assessment were used to assess disease severity, and lipid metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry. Decreased colitis activity was demonstrated by phenotype and MRI assessment in mice treated with ASA, and confirmed in postmortem analysis. Analysis of lipid mediators showed sustained formation of lipoxin A4 and an increase of DHA-derived 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic  (17-HDHA) after treatment with ASA. Furthermore, in vitro experiments in RAW264.7 murine macrophages demonstrated significantly increased phagocytosis activity after incubation with 17-HDHA, supporting its proresolution effect.

Resident cells are activated and inflammatory cells are recruited. Chemical mediators from the  cascade, prostaglandins, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and leukotrienes, are formed. Several of these metabolites are modulators of cellular functions, but when generated in sustained, excessive amounts, they contribute to enhanced vascular permeability and to the onset of pathophysiological responses. Another very active membrane-derived mediator is platelet-activating factor. This important mediator of immune and inflammatory responses may play a central role in uveitis due to cell priming, since interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and other as yet unidentified mediators are also being generated. The concomitant accumulation of these networks of mediators in various parts of the uveal tract leads to spreading of the intraocular inflammatory response and cellular damage. At both early and late stages of uveitis, the generation of free radicals is also a major contributor to the impairment of function. Free radicals are generated in two distinct sites: in the oxidative burst of recruited white cells and in free radical formation and lipid peroxidation in resident cells.

Virtually no PLA2 activity was detected in serum of immunologically naive or bacterially challenged hornworms. PLA2 activity was detected in cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions prepared from hemocytes. PLA2 activity in the cytosolic fraction (1.2 pmol/mg/h) was approximately 4-fold greater than in the membrane-enriched fraction. The cytosol-associated PLA2 activity was strongly inhibited in reactions conducted in the presence of the specific cytosolic PLA2 inhibitor methylarachidonyl fluorophosphate (MAFP) but not in the presence of the sPLA2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB). Conversely, the membrane-associated PLA2 activity was inhibited in reactions conducted in the presence of BPB but not in the presence of MAFP. While the cytosol-associated PLA2 was independent of calcium, the membrane-associated sPLA2 required calcium for full catalytic activity. Hornworms treated with either BPB, MAFP or the glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone were severely impaired (by 50 to 80% relative to controls) in their ability to form nodules in reaction to bacterial challenge. However, the immune-impairing influence of the inhibitors was reversed by treating larvae with , a precursor for eicosanoid biosynthesis. We infer that the biological significance of the sPLA2 (as well as the previously characterized cytosolic PLA2) relates to hydrolysis of polyunsaturated fatty acids from cellular phospholipids. Moreover, this enzyme may be the target of -impairing factors from the bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila. The fatty acids serve as precursors for the generation of eicosanoids responsible for mediating and coordinating cellular immune reactions to infection.Published 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12927381>Modulation of D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat using pharmacological agents that interfere with  metabolism or synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase.</a></h2><p>The D-penicillamine-induced autoimmune syndrome observed in Brown Norway (BN) rats is similar to an idiosyncratic reaction seen in some patients. We have previously shown that pretreatment of BN rats with aminoguanidine, an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, and misoprostol, a prostaglandin E (PGE) analog, completely prevented the development of D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity. In an effort to further understand the role of  metabolism and iNOS in the pathogenesis of D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity we had 3 objectives: (1) to test whether aminoguanidine and misoprostol could reverse D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity; (2) whether BN rats that had previously developed D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity could be protected on re-challenge with drug by pretreatment with aminoguanidine and misoprostol and (3) whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit PGE synthesis, would potentiate D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity. We found that neither aminoguanidine nor misoprostol had any significant effect on the speed of recovery from D-penicillamine-induced autoimmunity. Prevention of disease on re-challenge after a 4 week recovery was less effective than on initial treatment with 7/8 animals pretreated with aminoguanidine getting sick again, while only 5/13 animals pretreated with misoprostol became ill. The effect of aminoguanidine was not significantly different from control (16/17) but that of misoprostol was (P=0.002).

In our current study, we revealed that PLAA production was induced by the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. To determine the potential pro-apoptotic effects of PLAA induction by cisplatin, we utilized HeLa (Tet-off) cells overexpressing the plaa gene (plaa(high)) and compared them with control (plaa(low)) cells, which produce endogenous plaa from the chromosome. Cisplatin-stimulated plaa(high) cells contained significantly higher levels of DNA fragmentation, caspase 3, 8 and 9 activities, PLA(2) enzyme activity, and cytochrome c leakage from mitochondria than did the cisplatin-stimulated plaa(low) cells. Importantly, siRNA against PLAA (siRNA-PLAA) reduced the levels of cisplatin-induced PLAA, DNA fragmentation, and PLA(2) activation, while promoting cell viability in both plaa(high) and plaa(low) cells. Cisplatin-induced-cytochrome c leakage in plaa(high) cells was reduced by siRNA-PLAA and restored by the addition of exogenous  (AA), suggesting to us that PLAA induction by cisplatin promoted cytochrome c leakage/mitochondrial damage partially by accumulating AA. In addition, cisplatin-stimulated plaa(high) cells produced less cytoprotective clusterin than did the cisplatin-stimulated plaa(low) cells, and siRNA-PLAA promoted clusterin production from both plaa(high) and plaa(low) cells. We showed that clusterin reduced DNA fragmentation in cisplatin-stimulated plaa(high) and plaa(low) cells, which is consistent with the notion that clusterin promotes cancer chemoresistance. Furthermore, cisplatin-stimulated plaa(high) cells produced more IL-32 (a pro-apoptotic protein) than did cisplatin-stimulated plaa(low) cells, and siRNA-PLAA reduced IL-32 production from both plaa(high) and plaa(low) cells. Finally, our proteomic analysis revealed that cisplatin-stimulated plaa(high) cells contained higher levels of phosphorylated JNK/c-Jun and FasL than did plaa(low) cells treated the same way. In summary, our data indicated that PLAA induction enhanced cisplatin-induced-apoptosis through four pathways, namely by: 1) accumulation of AA and mitochondrial damage, 2) downregulation of the cytoprotective clusterin, 3) upregulation of the pro-apoptotic IL-32, and 4) induction of JNK/c-Jun signaling and FasL expression.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21232170>Modulatory effect of fatty acids on fungicidal activity, respiratory burst and TNF-Î± and IL-6 production in J774 murine macrophages.</a></h2><p>The reported effects of different families of fatty acids (FA; SFA, MUFA, n-3 and n-6 PUFA) on human health and the importance of macrophage respiratory burst and cytokine release to immune defence led us to examine the influence of palmitic  (PA), oleic  (OA), linoleic , , EPA and DHA on macrophage function.

These functions are signaled and coordinated by several biochemicals, including biogenic amines, insect cytokines, peptides, and prostaglandins (PGs). The actions of these mediators are coordinated within cells by various forms of cross-talk among the signaling systems and they result in effective reactions to infection. While this is well understood, we lack information on how immune-mediated recovery influences subsequent juvenile development in surviving insects. We investigated this point by posing the hypothesis that PG signaling is necessary for larval recovery, although the recovery imposes biological costs, registered in developmental delays and failures in surviving individuals. Here, we report that nodulation responses to infections by the bacterium, Serratia marcescens, increased over time up to 5 h postinfection, with no further nodulation; it increased in a linear manner with increasing bacterial dosages. Larval survivorship decreased with increasing bacterial doses. Treating larvae with the PG-biosynthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, led to sharply decreased nodulation reactions to infection, which were rescued in larvae cotreated with indomethacin and the PG-precursor, . Although nodulation was fully rescued, all bacterial challenged larvae suffered reduced survivorship compared to controls. Bacterial infection led to reduced developmental rates in larvae, but not pupae. Adult emergence from pupae that developed from experimental larvae was also decreased. Taken together, our data potently bolster our hypothesis.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662837>Proinflammatory actions of thromboxane receptors to enhance cellular immune responses.</a></h2><p>Metabolism of  by the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathway generates a family of prostanoid mediators. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act by inhibiting COX, thereby reducing prostanoid synthesis. The efficacy of these agents in reducing inflammation suggests a dominant proinflammatory role for the COX pathway. However, the actions of COX metabolites are complex, and certain prostanoids, such as PGE(2), in some circumstances actually inhibit immune and inflammatory responses. In these studies, we examine the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory actions of NSAIDs may be due, in part, to inhibition of thromboxane A(2) synthesis. To study the immunoregulatory actions of thromboxane A(2), we used mice with a targeted disruption of the gene encoding the thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptor. Both mitogen-induced responses and cellular responses to alloantigen were substantially reduced in TP(-/-) spleen cells. Similar attenuation was observed with pharmacological inhibition of TP signaling in wild-type splenocytes, suggesting that reduced responsiveness was not due to subtle developmental abnormalities in the TP-deficient mice. The absence of TP receptors reduced immune-mediated tissue injury following cardiac transplant rejection, an in vivo model of intense inflammation. Taken together, these findings show that thromboxane augments cellular immune responses and inflammatory tissue injury. Specific inhibition of the TP receptor may provide a more precise approach to limit inflammation without some of the untoward effects associated with NSAIDs.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2010845>Macrophage exposure to polymethyl methacrylate leads to mediator release and injury.</a></h2><p>To understand further the role of macrophages in the loosening of cemented arthroplasty, several in vitro effects of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particle exposure in these cells were studied. The kinetics of  and derived inflammatory mediator release was characterized following macrophage exposure to either PMMA or control polystyrene particles. Temporal release of radiolabeled products by [14C]arachidonate-labeled cells was determined by sequential scintillation counting. Significant dose-dependent release of  mediators by macrophages was observed within half an hour of exposure to either PMMA or styrene particles. Unexposed control cells incubated in media alone did not release detectable amounts of radiolabeled products. The leakage of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a marker of cell injury, was detected spectrophotometrically 4 h following exposure to PMMA but not styrene. PMMA-induced LDH release was dose dependent. In contrast, polystyrene exposure failed to increase LDH release above unexposed control cells. These in vitro studies reveal that macrophages rapidly released  and derived inflammatory mediators in response to both PMMA and styrene particles. However, cells exposed to PMMA are lethally damaged, as reflected by the subsequent leakage of their intracellular LDH. We propose that a similar sequence of events may occur when macrophages encounter PMMA particles at the bone-cement interface. This is characteristic of a foreign body granulomatous response.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18374420>Thromboxane A2: physiology/pathophysiology, cellular signal transduction and pharmacology.</a></h2><p>Thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), an unstable  metabolite, elicits diverse physiological/pathophysiological actions, including platelet aggregation and smooth muscle contraction. TXA(2) has been shown to be involved in allergies, modulation of acquired , atherogenesis, neovascularization, and metastasis of cancer cells. The TXA(2) receptor (TP) communicates mainly with G(q) and G(13), resulting in phospholipase C activation and RhoGEF activation, respectively. In addition, TP couples with G(11), G(12), G(13), G(14), G(15), G(16), G(i), G(s) and G(h). TP is widely distributed in the body, and is expressed at high levels in thymus and spleen. The second extracellular loop of TP is an important ligand-binding site, and Asp(193) is a key amino . There are two alternatively spliced isoforms of TP, TPalpha and TPbeta, which differ only in their C-terminals. TPalpha and TPbeta communicate with different G proteins, and undergo hetero-dimerization, resulting in changes in intracellular traffic and receptor protein conformations. TP cross-talks with receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGF receptor, to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. TP is glycosylated in the N-terminal region for recruitment to plasma membranes. Furthermore, TP conformation is changed by coupling to G proteins, showing several states of agonist binding. Finally, several drugs modify TP-mediated events; these include cyclooxygenase inhibitors, TXA(2) synthase inhibitors and TP antagonists. Some flavonoids of natural origin also have TP receptor antagonistic activity. Recent advances in TP research have clarified TXA(2)-mediated events in detail, and further study will supply more beneficial information about TXA(2) pathophysiology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10529362>Immunosuppressive effect of leukotriene B(4) receptor antagonist in vitro.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), which is an  metabolite produced by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and a well-characterized chemical mediator of inflammation, has been proposed to be an immune response modulator. Here we showed the constitutive expression of the LTB(4) receptor (LTB(4)R) in resting and activated T cells. We found that the LTB(4)R antagonist inhibited T cell proliferation induced by Con A, immobilized anti-CD3 mAb, or IL-2. This inhibitory effect was abolished by addition of LTB(4)R agonist. The LTB(4)R antagonist inhibited IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 production by anti-CD3-stimulated T cells and also inhibited IL-12-induced IFN-gamma production. Moreover, the LTB(4)R antagonist exerted an additive inhibitory effect to FK506 on T cell proliferation. These results suggest that LTB(4) is intrinsically involved in T cell activation to upregulate cytokine production and proliferation, and thus the LTB(4)R antagonist might be useful as an immunosuppressive agent.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242361>The dietary replacement of marine ingredients by terrestrial animal and plant alternatives modulates the antiviral immune response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).</a></h2><p>The effects of replacing marine ingredients by terrestrial ingredients on the health of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are poorly understood. During a 14-week trial, Atlantic salmon fed a fish meal-fish oil based diet (MAR) showed similar growth performance to others fed a plant protein/vegetable oil based diet (VEG), whereas poorer performance was observed in those fed an animal by-product meal/vegetable oil based diet (ABP). At the end of the trial, salmon were injected with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or the viral mimic polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic  (pIC) and sampled for head kidney RNA after 24Â h. The levels of 27 immune-related transcripts, and of 5 others involved in eicosanoid synthesis (including paralogues in both cases) were measured in the head kidney of the salmon using qPCR. All of the assayed immune-related genes and cox2 were pIC-induced, while the other eicosanoid synthesis-related genes were pIC-repressed. Linear regression was used to establish correlations between different immune transcripts, elucidating the cascade of responses to pIC and specialization among paralogues. Regarding the effect of diet on the antiviral immune response, pIC-treated fish fed diets ABP and VEG showed higher transcript levels of tlr3, irf1b, stat1a, isg15b, and gig1 compared to those fed diet MAR. We infer that the observed dietary immunomodulation could be due to the lower proportion of  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in diets ABP and VEG. Furthermore, our results suggest a major role of dietary ARA in Atlantic salmon , as low ARA proportion in diet VEG coincided with the highest pIC-induction of some immune transcripts (tlr7, stat1c, mxb, and gig1) and the lowest levels of transcripts encoding eicosanoid-synthesizing enzymes (5loxa, 5loxb, and pgds). In contrast, the high ARA/EPA ratio of diet ABP appeared to favor increased expression of transcripts involved in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (5loxa and 5loxb) and chemotaxis (ccl19b). In conclusion, our findings show that nutritionally balanced plant-based diets may enhance the immune response of Atlantic salmon. Future studies should explore the possible advantages of plant-based diets in Atlantic salmon exposed to a viral infection.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is a member of the eicosanoid family of oxygenated  derivatives generated through the action of cyclooxygenases (COXs), is frequently used to enhance the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced terminal maturation of moDCs. We show here that one effect of interleukin (IL)-4, which is used together with GM-CSF to generate moDCs, is the suppression of endogenous PGE2 production in moDCs. IL-4 inhibits the cytoplasmic form of phospholipase A2, the enzyme that specifically liberates  from membrane phospholipids. Although moDCs failed to mobilize endogenous , they converted exogenous  into PGE2 in a COX-1- and COX-2-dependent fashion. IL-4-mediated suppression of PGE2 biosynthesis in human moDCs explains the previously reported maturation-enhancing effect of exogenous PGE2.

It is beyond any doubt that CS act on many sites to help reverse the pathologic process of bronchial asthma. Corticosteroids enhance the beta-adrenergic response to relieve the muscle spasm. They also act by reversing the mucosal edema, decreasing vascular permeability by vasoconstriction, and inhibiting the release of LTC4 and LTD4. Corticosteroids reduce the mucus secretion by inhibiting the release of secretagogue from macrophages. Corticosteroids inhibit the late phase reaction by inhibiting the inflammatory response and interfering with chemotaxis. This action may be due to the inhibition of LTB4 release. The eosinopenic effect of corticosteroids may help to prevent the cytotoxic effect of the major basic protein and other inflammatory mediators released from eosinophils. Corticosteroids have no effect on the immediate hypersensitivity reaction and have no direct role in bronchial reactivity. By blocking the late reaction, they prevent the increased airway reactivity observed with late bronchial reactions. The limitation of using corticosteroids are their side effects. They vary from tolerable to life threatening side effects. Each tissue in the body is a target for corticosteroids. The mechanism of adverse effects have been studied in extensive detail but many questions are yet to be answered. Alternate-day therapy and inhalation therapy are meant to minimize these side effects. The expansion of using inhaled steroid therapy and finding some inhaled preparations that have even less systemic side effects seems a reasonable approach to deal with severe asthma.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7755552>Time-course changes in content and fatty  composition of phosphatidic  from rat thymocytes during concanavalin A stimulation.</a></h2><p>Several studies have shown the potential role of phosphatidic  (PA) as a second messenger in different cell types. Thus, PA has been shown to mimic physiological agonists leading to various cellular responses, such as neurotransmitter and hormone release, cell proliferation by modulating DNA or RNA synthesis, the expression of several proto-oncogenes and growth factors, and the stimulation of enzyme activities such as phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinases and cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase. Stimulation of [3H]arachidonate-labelled rat thymocytes with the mitogen lectin concanavalin A (con A) resulted in enhanced production of radiolabelled PA after only 5 min of activation. The radiolabelled PA increase corresponded to a real increase in PA mass as determined by GLC quantification of its fatty  content. In the presence of ethanol (0.5%), formation of phosphatidylethanol was not observed after 5 min of con A activation. Pretreatment of cells with R 59022 (10 microM), a diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase inhibitor, showed an inhibition in the formation of radiolabelled PA and in PA mass. These results suggest that the PLC-DAG kinase may be the pathway for PA synthesis in the first minutes of mitogenic thymocyte activation. A detailed analysis of the fatty  composition showed that the relative amount of unsaturated fatty acids was increased in PA from stimulated cells concomitantly with a decrease in saturated ones; in particular,  was increased approximately 2-fold only 2 min after con A addition whereas palmitic  was decreased for the whole period investigated (20 min). These changes favour the hydolysis of phosphoinositides rather than phosphatidylcholines by PLC. As PA remains a minor phospholipid, these changes are unlikely to affect cell membrane fluidity; but PA being now well recognized as a potential second messenger, its increased content as well as its increased unsaturation in the fatty acyl moiety might modulate several signalling pathways or the activity of enzymes such as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, controlling in this way the cellular level of cAMP, a negative regulator of blastic transformation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28065968>Therapeutic uses of pineapple-extracted bromelain in surgical care - A review.</a></h2><p>Bromelain is an extract obtained from the pineapple plant and is used as a traditional folk remedy for several ailments.

The influence of lipids on the immune response is both complex and diverse, with multiple studies pointing to the beneficial effects of long-chain fatty acids in . However, the mechanisms through which PUFAs modulate innate  and the effects of PUFA deficiencies on innate immune functions remain to be clarified. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa host-pathogen system, we present genetic evidence that a Delta6-desaturase FAT-3, through its two 18-carbon products--gamma-linolenic  (GLA, 18:3n6) and stearidonic  (SDA, 18:4n3), but not the 20-carbon PUFAs  (AA, 20:4n6) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n3)--is required for basal innate  in vivo. Deficiencies in GLA and SDA result in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, which is associated with reduced basal expression of a number of immune-specific genes--including spp-1, lys-7, and lys-2--that encode antimicrobial peptides. GLA and SDA are required to maintain basal activity of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which plays important roles in protecting metazoan animals from infections and oxidative stress. Transcriptional and functional analyses of fat-3-regulated genes revealed that fat-3 is required in the intestine to regulate the expression of infection- and stress-response genes, and that distinct sets of genes are specifically required for immune function and oxidative stress response. Our study thus uncovers a mechanism by which these 18-carbon PUFAs affect basal innate immune function and, consequently, the ability of an organism to defend itself against bacterial infections. The conservation of p38 MAP kinase signaling in both stress and immune responses further encourages exploring the function of GLA and SDA in humans.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8077660>Involvement of phospholipase D in the activation of transcription factor AP-1 in human T lymphoid Jurkat cells.</a></h2><p>The induction of the AP-1 transcription factor has been ascribed to the early events leading to T lymphocyte activation. We have examined the possibility that stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) may regulate activation of transcription factor AP-1 in human T cells by transfecting human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells with a plasmid containing an AP-1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. We have detected activatable PLD in Jurkat cells, and we have found that addition of phosphatidic  (PA), the physiologic product of PLD action on phospholipids, is rapidly incorporated into Jurkat cells and leads to activation of transcription factor AP-1. Treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 mAb activated both PLD and transcription factor AP-1. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of receptor-coupled PLD activation, blocked the anti-CD3-induced increases in both PLD activity and AP-1 enhancer activity. We found a good correlation in the transfected cells between PLD activation and induction of AP-1 enhancer activity under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, ethanol, an inhibitor of the PLD pathway, blocked the anti-CD3-stimulated AP-1 enhancer activity. However, this anti-CD3-mediated response was not inhibited by neomycin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The increases in AP-1 enhancer activity induced by PA or anti-CD3 mAb were efficiently abrogated by the presence of propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase and protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, the PA- and the anti-CD3-induced increases in AP-1 enhancer activity were blocked by the presence of PKC inhibitors or by PKC down-regulation. These data indicate that PLD stimulation can activate the transcription factor AP-1 in T lymphocytes, and suggest that the induction of AP-1 enhancer factor activity by PA is mediated via PKC stimulation, either through a direct activating effect of PA or through PA-derived diacylglycerol formation. These data also provide evidence for a role of PLD-derived lipids in the induction of AP-1 enhancer activity resulting from stimulation of the TCR/CD3 complex, suggesting that increased PLD activity can play an important role in T lymphocyte activation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1908458> release from diacylglycerol in human neutrophils. Translocation of diacylglycerol-deacylating enzyme activities from an intracellular pool to plasma membrane upon cell activation.</a></h2><p>We have studied the capacity of human neutrophils to release  from diacylglycerol, employing 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol and 1-[1-14C]stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as exogenous substrates. We have found that  is removed from diacylglycerol by the sequential action of two enzymes. First, the sn-1 position is split by 1-diacylglycerol lipase activity, and then,  is released from the resulting 2-monoacylglycerol by a 2-monoacylglycerol lipase. The specific activity of the 2-monoacylglycerol lipase, using 2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol as exogenous substrate, was at least 9-fold higher than that of 1-diacylglycerol lipase, indicating that the action of the 1-diacylglycerol lipase is the rate-limiting step in  release from diacylglycerol. Postnuclear supernatants from A23187-treated cells showed a 2.5-fold increase in both lipase activities. The -releasing diacylglycerol lipase system showed an optimum pH of 4.5 and was not inhibited by EGTA or stimulated by Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, or Co2+. However,  release was inhibited by Hg2+, suggesting the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in catalytic activity. The subcellular distribution of both 1-diacylglycerol lipase and 2-monoacylglycerol lipase activities was examined in resting and A23187-treated human neutrophils by fractionation of postnuclear supernatants on continuous sucrose gradients. Both lipases were localized mainly in the membrane of gelatinase-containing granules, which were resolved from cytosol, plasma membrane, phosphasomes, and specific and azurophilic granules. When neutrophils were stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187, a drastic shift of the 1-diacylglycerol lipase and 2-monoacylglycerol lipase toward the plasma membrane was detected. This shift was due to fusion of gelatinase-containing granules with the plasma membrane upon neutrophil stimulation. As a result of the membrane fusion process, the capacity to release  from diacylglycerol was increased. This translocation from the membrane of gelatinase-containing granules to the plasma membrane may play an important role in regulating the diacylglycerol level in stimulated human neutrophils.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3106472>Prostaglandin synthesis in human T cells: its partial inhibition by lectins and anti-CD3 antibodies as a possible step in T cell activation.</a></h2><p>The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat was used to study  (AA) metabolism. We demonstrated that Jurkat cells are able to convert AA into prostaglandins (PG) and thromboxanes. The presence of tritiated 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, PGA2 (B2), and thromboxane B2 in the culture medium was shown either by thin-layer chromatography after a 4-hr incubation period of [3H]AA-prelabeled Jurkat cells or by using specific radioimmuno assays. PG synthesis was inhibited by both indomethacin and niflumic , two cyclooxygenase inhibitors. AA metabolism through the cyclooxygenase pathway was followed during T cell activation. T cells were activated by lectins or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to trigger the T3-Ti complex and by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to mimic IL 1-dependent pathways. Our results show that lectins and anti-CD3 mAb both reduce the amount of PG released by the cells, whereas TPA did not. We confirmed that a combination of TPA and lectins or TPA and anti-CD3 mAb is necessary to obtain full activation of Jurkat cells if this event is monitored by using measurement of IL 2 synthesis. In addition, lectins and anti-CD3 mAb can be replaced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or niflumic . Indeed, a combination of TPA and one of these two drugs induced maximal IL 2 synthesis. These results thus suggest that a reduction in PG synthesis might be a prerequisite to allow the cascade of events involved in T cell activation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1830070> is essential for IgG Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by human monocytes.</a></h2><p>Phagocytosis is a specialized function of neutrophils and macrophages that requires coordination of multiple biochemical and biophysical events.

In an effort to address this complex question, we investigated the role of  (AA) in the uptake of yeast and IgG-coated E (EIgG) or C-coated E. Human monocytes, labeled with 3H AA, released this label during phagocytosis of yeast and EIgG, but not in response to EC3b. The PL inhibitors bromophenacyl bromide and manoalide abolished the release of 3H and inhibited phagocytosis of EIgG in parallel. Both drugs caused a similar inhibition of yeast-mediated 3H release but had little effect on yeast ingestion. Similar results were obtained with the inhibitor quinacrine (mepacrine). Exogenously added AA and dihomo-gamma-linolenic  restored bromophenacyl bromide-inhibited EIgG ingestion; arachidonate analogs eicosatrienoic  and eicosapentanoic  did not. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways for AA metabolism by indomethacin or BW755C did not affect EIgG phagocytosis, demonstrating that these major AA metabolic pathways are not involved in phagocytic signaling.

Dendritic cells (DCs) disintegrate these compartments, thereby eliminating the microbes, through auto/xenophagy, which also promotes chlamydial antigen presentation via MHC I. Here, we show that TNF-Î± controls this pathway by driving cytosolic phospholipase (cPLA)2-mediated  (AA) production. AA then impairs mitochondrial function, which disturbs the development and integrity of these energy-dependent parasitic inclusions, while a simultaneous metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis promotes DC survival. Tubulin deacetylase/autophagy regulator HDAC6 associates with disintegrated inclusions, thereby further disrupting their subcellular localisation and stability. Bacterial remnants are decorated with defective mitochondria, mito-aggresomal structures, and components of the ubiquitin/autophagy machinery before they are degraded via mito-xenophagy. The mechanism depends on cytoprotective HSP25/27, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and HDAC6 and promotes chlamydial antigen generation for presentation on MHC I.

Little is known about the significance and regulation of eicosanoid generation in response to nonclassical MC activation mechanisms.We sought to determine the regulation and significance of MC-derived eicosanoids synthesized in response to IL-33, a cytokine critical to innate type 2 immunity.We used an exÂ vivo model of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and an IL-33-dependent inÂ vivo model of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).IL-33 potently liberates AA and elicits LTC, PGD, and thromboxane A production by bone marrow-derived mast cells. Unexpectedly, the constitutive function of COX-1 is required for IL-33 to activate group IVa cytosolic phospholipase A with consequent AA release for synthesis of all eicosanoids, including CysLTs. In contrast, COX-1 was dispensable for FcÎµRI-driven CysLT production. Inhibition of COX-1 prevented IL-33-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase, an upstream effector of cytosolic phospholipase A, which was restored by exogenous PGH, implying that the effects of COX-1 required its catalytic function. Administration of a COX-1-selective antagonist to mice completely prevented the generation of both PGD and LTC in a model of AERD in which MC activation is IL-33 driven.MC-intrinsic COX-1 amplifies IL-33-induced activation in the setting of innate type 2 immunity and might help explain the phenomenon of therapeutic desensitization to aspirin by nonselective COX inhibitors in patients with AERD.Copyright Â© 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The cell has many common features with neutrophils but, unlike that cell type, eosinophils utilize VLA-4/VCAM-1 as an adherence pathway and have a number of other receptors not shared by neutrophils. These include recognition units for IgE (distinct from CD23), and receptors for IL-5, IL-3 and RANTES. Following stimulation with a variety of agents, eosinophils preferentially elaborate LTC4 as the major 5-lipoxygenase product of  and produce substantial amounts of PAF. Of particular interest is the ability of eosinophils to synthesize a number of cytokines. Thus eosinophils have marked pro-inflammatory potential. There is now convincing evidence that eosinophilia is T-cell dependent. The Th2-type cell, which selectively secretes IL-5 and IL-4, seems particularly involved. IL-5, IL-3 and GM-CSF are required for eosinophil maturation, and cause activation and prolonged survival of the mature cell. IL-5 is unique in that it promotes terminal differentiation of the committed eosinophil precursor and in vivo in mice appears to be sufficient on its own for eosinophil growth from uncommited stem cells. IL-4 selectively upregulates VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells thus augmenting VLA-4-dependent eosinophil adhesion. The role of eosinophils in disease is complex but in general their numbers are increased in helminthic parasitic disease and atopic allergy and asthma. Eosinophil products can produce many of the pathological features of asthma, and helminthic larvae coated with immunoglobulin or complement are particularly susceptible to eosinophil-mediated cytotoxicity.

Given the asymmetric distribution of fatty acids within phospholipids, where saturated fatty acids tend to be present at the sn-1 position, and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as those of the omega-3 and omega-6 series overwhelmingly localize in the sn-2 position, the phospholipase A reaction is of utmost importance as a regulatory checkpoint for the mobilization of these fatty acids and the subsequent synthesis of proinflammatory omega-6-derived eicosanoids on one hand, and omega-3-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators on the other. The great variety of phospholipase As, their differential substrate selectivity under a variety of pathophysiological conditions, as well as the different compartmentalization of each enzyme and accessibility to substrate, render this class of enzymes also key to membrane phospholipid remodeling reactions, and the generation of specific lipid mediators not related with canonical metabolites of omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids.

Nonspecific suppressor factors are generally produced by Ly 2+ (murine) or OKT8+ (human) T lymphocytes. One protein, soluble immune response suppressor (SIRS), is produced by T lymphocytes after incubation with mitogens, interferons, or histamine, and must be activated by peroxides to inhibit cell division or immune function. SIRS appears to inhibit cell division by causing oxidation of a portion of cellular protein sylfhydryls and, in particular, causes a decrease in intracellular levels of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. This decrease is readily reversed by sulhydryl reducing agents, such as 2-mercaptoethanol. The activity of SIRS and other suppressor factors is inhibited by growth factors, such as interleukin 2, and the activity of interleukin 2 is inhibited by antigen-nonspecific suppressor factors. Further, SIRS or SIRS-like proteins are produced during various diseases associated with suppressed immune responsiveness including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, schistosomiasis, and nephrotic syndrome.

The n-6 polyunsaturated fatty   gives rise to the eicosanoid family of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes and related metabolites) and through these regulates the activities of inflammatory cells, the production of cytokines and the various balances within the immune system. Fish oil and oily fish are good sources of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Consumption of these fatty acids decreases the amount of  in cell membranes and so available for eicosanoid production. Thus, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids act as  antagonists. Components of both natural and acquired , including the production of key inflammatory cytokines, can be affected by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Although some of the effects of n-3 fatty acids may be brought about by modulation of the amount and types of eicosanoids made, it is possible that these fatty acids might elicit some of their effects by eicosanoid-independent mechanisms. Such n-3 fatty -induced effects may be of use as a therapy for acute and chronic inflammation, and for disorders which involve an inappropriately activated immune response.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1602839>Modulation of age-related alterations in membrane composition and receptor-associated immune functions by food restriction in Fischer 344 rats.</a></h2><p>Food restriction is known to modulate aging and age-associated immune functions in rodents. In an attempt to understand the mechanism(s) through which food restriction delays age-associated loss of certain immune functions, lipid composition of spleen cells as well as binding of spleen cells to interleukin-2 (IL-2) and insulin were analyzed in four month-old and 19-month-old ad libitum fed (AL) and food-restricted (FR) Fischer-344 male rats. The results revealed that although AL-fed rats did not show a difference in age-related changes for IL-2 and insulin binding, the number of binding sites were significantly increased in the spleen cells of 19-month-old FR animals when compared with those of the 19-month-old AL group. When spleen cell phospholipid fractions were analyzed for fatty  composition, the spleen cells from FR animals consistently revealed higher linoleic  (18:2) levels and significantly lower  (20:4) and long chain fatty , docosatetraenoic  (22:4) levels in the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions than the spleen cells of the AL rats. Further, spleen cell plasma membranes of FR rats also exhibited similar changes showing higher 18:2 and lower 20:4 and 22:4 levels than the AL animals. Finally, spleen cells obtained from 19-month-old FR animals produced higher levels of IL-2 and lesser prostaglandin E2 when compared to 19-month-old AL animals. The above observations suggest that one of the mechanisms through which food restriction may delay the loss of age-associated immune functions is through modulation of the fatty acyl composition of phospholipid fractions of spleen cell membranes. This modification may facilitate binding of IL-2 and insulin to their receptors and thus may improve T cell proliferation and prevent or delay age-related loss in immune functions.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24024207>The immunobiology of prostanoid receptor signaling in connecting innate and adaptive .</a></h2><p>Prostanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs), and prostacyclins, are synthesized from  (AA) by the action of Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. They are bioactive inflammatory lipid mediators that play a key role in  and immunopathology. Prostanoids exert their effects on immune and inflammatory cells by binding to membrane receptors that are widely expressed throughout the immune system and act at multiple levels in innate and adaptive . The immunoregulatory role of prostanoids results from their ability to regulate cell-cell interaction, antigen presentation, cytokine production, cytokine receptor expression, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, cell-surface molecule levels, and cell migration in both autocrine and paracrine manners.

Growth of differentiating or non-differentiating U937 cells was not affected by enrichment with PUFA. However, in cells differentiated with 1,25-D3 plus IFN-gamma, prior enrichment with all three PUFA slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) increased the expression of the monocytic surface antigens CD11b and CD14 and generation of superoxide anion. The data indicate that although n-6 and n-3 PUFA are rapidly incorporated into phospholipids, they do not affect cell growth.

This study assessed omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in maternal milk in relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation and the development of allergic disease in their infants.This study randomised 95 pregnant women at risk of having an allergic infant, to daily supplements of 2.6 g omega-3 LCPUFA or a placebo of 2.7 g soya bean oil from gestational week 25 until 3 months of lactation. Breast milk samples were collected as colostrum, at one and 3 months. Milk fatty acids were related to allergic outcome in the infants at 24 months.Omega-3 milk fatty acids were higher in women who received omega-3 supplements than the placebo group (p < 0.01). Higher proportions of milk eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  and a lower /eicosapentaenoic  ratio were associated with an absence of IgE-associated disease in the infants.

We investigated whether SCF influenced the response of mouse mast cells to an IgE-independent stimulus, eosinophil-derived granule major basic protein (MBP). Mouse bone marrow cultured mast cells (BMCMC) were derived in either concanavalin-stimulated mouse spleen conditioned medium (CM) or SCF. The cloned growth, factor-independent mast cell line Cl.MC/C57.1 was also studied. BMCMC in SCF exhibited cytochemical staining properties, protease and histamine content, and increased serotonin uptake consistent with more mature differentiated mast cells as compared with BMCMC in CM or Cl.MC/ C57.1 cells. BMCMC in SCF released serotonin, 14C-labeled  metabolites and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on stimulation with MBP, while no response was seen from either BMCMC in CM or Cl.MC/C57.1 cells. All three mast cell populations released mediators on stimulation with the cationic MBP analog, poly-L-arginine, indicating that the cationic charge did not explain the selective response of BMCMC in SCF to eosinophil-derived granule MBP.

The cellular effects exerted by TNF depend, apart from NF-kappaB-directed gene transcription, largely on its ability to activate phospholipase A2(PLA2), yielding the release of  (AA) and its metabolites. AA metabolites, especially the leukotrienes, act as second messengers in TNF receptor signalling, as different inhibitors of AA metabolism impair a variety of TNF-induced biochemical events. The role, however, of AA and its metabolites in TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation is still obscure. Here we report that 4-bromophenacyl bromide (4-BPB; an inhibitor of PLA2), nordihydroguaretic  (NDGA; a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor), as well as MK-886 [an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP)] interfere with TNF-induced NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation. However, only 4-BPB inhibited the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB, whereas NDGA and MK-886 did not. Thus, different inhibitors interfere at different points in TNF-induced signalling leading to NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. Artificial induction of AA metabolism induced neither DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB nor NF-kappaB-dependent transactivation. It was concluded that although TNF-induced signalling to NF-kappaB-dependent transcription is sensitive to inhibitors of AA metabolism at multiple points during this signalling, AA release is essential but not sufficient for NF-kappaB-activation.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21554732>Expression of mutant alpha-synuclein modulates microglial phenotype in vitro.</a></h2><p>Increased reactive microglia are a histological characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD) brains, positively correlating with levels of deposited Î±-synuclein protein. This suggests that microglial-mediated inflammatory events may contribute to disease pathophysiology. Mutations in the gene coding for Î±-synuclein lead to a familial form of PD. Based upon our prior findings that Î±-synuclein expression regulates microglial phenotype we hypothesized that expression of mutant forms of the protein may contribute to the reactive microgliosis characteristic of PD brains.To quantify the effects of wild type and mutant Î±-synuclein over-expression on microglial phenotype a murine microglial cell line, BV2, was transiently transfected to express human wild type (WT), and mutant Î±-synuclein (A30P and A53T) proteins. Transfected cells were used to assess changes in microglia phenotype via Western blot analysis, ELISA, phagocytosis, and neurotoxicity assays.As expected, over-expression of Î±-synuclein induced a reactive phenotype in the transfected cells. Expression of Î±-synuclein increased protein levels of cycloxygenase-2 (Cox-2). Transfected cells demonstrated increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as increased nitric oxide production.

Our results showed that the primed M phi expressed both isozymes and responded to all challenges used to release a substantial amount of PGE2 (> 10 ng PGE2/10(6) cells/ml), whereas the control unprimed M phi responded to A23187 and  but not to PMA or latex beads to release PGE2. However, the primed M phi did not release PGE2 when triggered with nonphagocytosable particles (> or = 40 microns) or when pretreated with cytochalasin D before they were challenged with 1.1-micron beads. Furthermore, staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, did not inhibit the PGE2 release triggered by the beads. PMA-triggered PGE2 release by the primed M phi, in sharp contrast, was staurosporine-sensitive but cytochalasin D-resistant.

These Fc gamma Rs should transmit, upon binding of an appropriate ligand, a specific signal that leads to the regulation of macrophage functions, as the interaction of immune complex with cell surface receptor has been shown to lead to suppression of the humoral immune response or B cell differentiation, to the destruction of target cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, to activation of  metabolic cascade, to the phagocytosis of opsonized particles, or to the generation of superoxide anion. In this review, we first describe evidence that Fc gamma 2aR and Fc gamma 2bR are associated with casein kinase II and phospholipase A2 activity, respectively. We will then discuss a potential role for these enzymatic activities in signal transduction pathways that leads to the activation of the  metabolic cascade and adenylate cyclase, to the regulation of phagocytosis, and to the suppression of interferon-gamma action to induce Ia antigens.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7499867>Protein kinase C activation precedes  release during IgG-mediated phagocytosis.</a></h2><p>Previous studies demonstrated that both protein kinase C (PKC) and  (AA) are required for IgG-mediated phagocytosis by human monocytes. We have characterized a calcium-independent "phagocytic" phospholipase A2 (designated pPL) that mediates  release. The present studies were designed to order PKC and pPL in the phagocytic signaling pathway. The PKC inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C caused a coordinated decrease in phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes and  release. The PLA2 activators mastoparan and melittin restored phagocytosis to PKC-inhibited cells, but were ineffective in monocytes pretreated with the pPL inhibitor bromoenol lactone. Similarly, PKC activation with PMA and diacylglycerol enhanced phagocytosis in the absence, but not in the presence, of bromoenol lactone. These results indicate that pPL may be regulated by an upstream phosphorylation event. Thus, we examined the effects of Ab-opsonized glass bead ingestion, okadaic -mediated inhibition of phosphatases, and PMA treatment on the activity of pPL and on its distribution between the cytosolic and membrane-associated compartments. IgG-opsonized erythrocytes and okadaic  caused an overall increase in pPL activity, with a twofold increase in membrane-associated pPL. PMA treatment caused a 1.8-fold increase in membrane-associated pPL activity. Okadaic  and PMA mimic IgG-opsonized erythrocytes with respect to membrane activation of pPL, suggesting that pPL activity may be regulated by PKC. Collectively, these results indicate that pPL activity is modulated by PKC during IgG-mediated phagocytosis, and that the PKC requirement can be bypassed by direct activation of pPL.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3083694>Dexamethasone and hydrogen peroxide production by mesangial cells during phagocytosis.</a></h2><p>We have previously demonstrated that a high percentage of rat cultured mesangial cells phagocytized serum-treated zymosan (STZ) (L. Baud, J. Hagege, J. Sraer, E. Rondeau, J. Perez, and R. Ardaillou, J. Exp. Med. 158: 1836-1852, 1983). Phagocytosis resulted in stimulation of  metabolism with generation of H2O2. Exposure of mesangial cells to dexamethasone for 48 h produced a dose-dependent decrease in phagocytosis-induced production of H2O2 with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 32 nM. The decrease in H2O2 release was associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) E2 production. The effect of dexamethasone could be considered as due to receptor-mediated modulation of protein synthesis since dexamethasone was not active immediately but only after a lag period of 3 h; RU 38486, a potent competitor for dexamethasone receptors, counteracted the reduction in H2O2 generation; and actinomycin and cycloheximide both blunted the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone. Pretreatment of mesangial cells with dexamethasone also produced a dose-dependent decrease in the phagocytic capability of the cells (63% inhibition for 1 microM dexamethasone). However, the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on H2O2 production expressed as percentage of control was similar whether or not phagocytosis had been blocked by cytochalasin B. This result and also the fact that dexamethasone inhibited H2O2 production in cells triggered with soluble stimuli (A 23187 ionophore, PAF) suggested that the effect of dexamethasone on H2O2 generation was independent of that on phagocytosis. Addition of exogenous  reduced the effect of dexamethasone only when its conversion into PGE2 was inhibited by indomethacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23637858>Defective lung macrophage function in lung cancer Â± chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD/emphysema)-mediated by cancer cell production of PGE2?</a></h2><p>In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD/emphysema) we have shown a reduced ability of lung and alveolar (AM) macrophages to phagocytose apoptotic cells (defective 'efferocytosis'), associated with evidence of secondary cellular necrosis and a resultant inflammatory response in the airway. It is unknown whether this defect is present in cancer (no COPD) and if so, whether this results from soluble mediators produced by cancer cells. We investigated efferocytosis in AM (26 controls, 15 healthy smokers, 37 COPD, 20 COPD+ non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 8 patients with NSCLC without COPD) and tumor and tumor-free lung tissue macrophages (21 NSCLC with/13 without COPD). To investigate the effects of soluble mediators produced by lung cancer cells we then treated AM or U937 macrophages with cancer cell line supernatant and assessed their efferocytosis ability. We qualitatively identified  (AA) metabolites in cancer cells by LC-ESI-MSMS, and assessed the effects of COX inhibition (using indomethacin) on efferocytosis. Decreased efferocytosis was noted in all cancer/COPD groups in all compartments. Conditioned media from cancer cell cultures decreased the efferocytosis ability of both AM and U937 macrophages with the most pronounced effects occurring with supernatant from SCLC (an aggressive lung cancer type). AA metabolites identified in cancer cells included PGE2. The inhibitory effect of PGE2 on efferocytosis, and the involvement of the COX-2 pathway were shown. Efferocytosis is decreased in COPD/emphysema and lung cancer; the latter at least partially a result of inhibition by soluble mediators produced by cancer cells that include PGE2.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19803380>[Novel type of antimicrobial mechanism in host macrophages against mycobacterial infections].</a></h2><p>Macrophages (M(phi)s) play a central role as anti-microbial effector cells in the expression of host resistance to mycobacterial infections. With respect to antimicrobial effector molecules of host M(phi) against mycobacterial pathogens, recent studies suggest the possibility that the reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI)--and reactive oxygen intermediates-independent antimycobacterial mechanism(s) may be crucial for the antimycobacterial function of host M(phi). In this context, we previously found that free fatty acids (FFAs) such as  (AA) and linolenic  exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against mycobacterial organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). In addition, FFAs in combination with RNI played critical roles in manifestation of the activity of M(phi) against mycobacterial organisms. Moreover, our recent studies have shown the following findings. First, anti-MTB activity of IFN-gamma-activated M(phi)s was specifically blocked by arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone (aTFMK), an inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Second, ATP potentiated the anti-MAC bactericidal activity of M(phi)s cultivated in the presence of clarithromycin and rifamycin. This effect of ATP was closely related to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and was specifically blocked by aTFMK. Third, intramacrophage translocation of membranous AA molecules to MAC-containing phagosomes was also specifically blocked by aTFMK. In the confocal microscopic observation of MAC-infected M(phi)s, ATP enhanced the intracellular translocation of cPLA2 into MAC-containing phagosomes. These findings suggest that FFAs (especially AA) produced by the enzymatic action of cPLA2 play important roles as antimycobacterial effectors in the expression of M(phi) antimicrobial activity against mycobacterial pathogens.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915010>Evidence for inflammation-mediated memory dysfunction in gastropods: putative PLA2 and COX inhibitors abolish long-term memory failure induced by systemic immune challenges.</a></h2><p>Previous studies associate lipid peroxidation with long-term memory (LTM) failure in a gastropod model (Lymnaea stagnalis) of associative learning and memory. This process involves activation of Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), an enzyme mediating the release of fatty acids such as  that form the precursor for a variety of pro-inflammatory lipid metabolites. This study investigated the effect of biologically realistic challenges of L. stagnalis host defense response system on LTM function and potential involvement of PLA2, COX and LOX therein.Systemic immune challenges by means of Î²-glucan laminarin injections induced elevated H2O2 release from L. stagnalis circulatory immune cells within 3 hrs of treatment. This effect dissipated within 24 hrs after treatment. Laminarin exposure has no direct effect on neuronal activity. Laminarin injections disrupted LTM formation if training followed within 1 hr after injection but had no behavioural impact if training started 24 hrs after treatment. Intermediate term memory was not affected by laminarin injection. Chemosensory and motor functions underpinning the feeding response involved in this learning model were not affected by laminarin injection. Laminarin's suppression of LTM induction was reversed by treatment with aristolochic , a PLA2 inhibitor, or indomethacin, a putative COX inhibitor, but not by treatment with nordihydro-guaiaretic , a putative LOX inhibitor.A systemic immune challenge administered shortly before behavioural training impairs associative LTM function in our model that can be countered with putative inhibitors of PLA2 and COX, but not LOX. As such, this study establishes a mechanistic link between the state of activity of this gastropod's innate immune system and higher order nervous system function.

Along the colon crypt axis, and concomitant to the differentiation process, certain lipid species tightly linked to signaling (phosphatidylinositols and  (AA)-containing diacylglycerophospholipids), change following a rather simple mathematical expression. We extend here our observations to ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtn), a unique type of glycerophospholipid presenting a vinyl ether linkage at sn-1 position. PlsEtn distribution was studied in healthy, adenomatous, and carcinomatous colon mucosa sections by IMS. In epithelium, 75% of PlsEtn changed in a highly regular manner along the crypt axis, in clear contrast with diacyl species (67% of which remained constant). Consistently, AA-containing PlsEtn species were more abundant at the base, where stem cells reside, and decreased while ascending the crypt. In turn, mono-/diunsaturated species experienced the opposite change. These gradients were accompanied by a gradual expression of ether lipid synthesis enzymes. In lamina propria, 90% of stromal PlsEtn remained unchanged despite the high content of AA and the gradient in AA-containing diacylglycerophospholipids. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were severely affected in polyps and carcinoma. These results link PlsEtn species regulation to cell differentiation for the first time and confirm that diacyl and ether species are differently regulated. Furthermore, they reaffirm the observations on cell lipid fingerprint image sensitivity to predict cell pathophysiological status, reinforcing the translational impact both lipidome and IMS might have in clinical research.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To better characterize the negative signal delivered by soluble K20, we have investigated its effects on the phospholipid metabolism, both in Jurkat and CD4+ T cells. In CD3-activated T cells, K20 inhibited the increase of diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic  levels, but did not modify phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels, cytosolic Ca2+ raise, and inositolphosphates formation, indicating that K20 did not inhibit phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis by phospholipase C-gamma. Moreover, in these conditions, K20 increased phosphatidylethanolamine levels, without variation of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol, suggesting that K20 specifically increased the phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis from DAG. Thus, the effects of K20 on DAG and phosphatidic  levels resulted from an accelerated catabolism rather than from a defect of synthesis. That K20 acts solely at an early step of T cell activation, namely before the binding of IL-2 to its receptor, is supported by the observation that adding exogenous rIL-2 increased proliferation in spite of K20. These results suggest that the beta 1 integrin molecules interact with the membrane phospholipid metabolism and they appear to be the hallmark of a peculiar negative pathway of T cell activation, likely to play an important regulatory role mediated via the T cell integrin molecules.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17142783>Cyclooxygenase regulates cell surface expression of CXCR3/1-storing granules in human CD4+ T cells.</a></h2><p>Efficient migration of CD4+ T cells into sites of infection/inflammation is a prerequisite to protective . Inappropriate recruitment, on the other hand, contributes to inflammatory pathologies. The chemokine/chemokine receptor system is thought to orchestrate T cell homing. In this study, we show that most circulating human CD4+ T cells store the inflammatory chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR1 within a distinct intracellular compartment. Equipped with such storage granules, CD4+ T cells coexpressing both receptors increased from only 1% ex vivo to approximately 30% within minutes of activation with PHA or exposure to the cyclooxygenase (COX) substrate . Up-regulation was TCR independent and reduced by COX inhibitors at concentrations readily reached in vivo. The inducible inflammatory CXCR3(high)CXCR1+ phenotype identified nonpolarized cells, was preferentially triggered on CCR7+CD4+ T cells, and conferred increased chemotactic responsiveness. Thus, inducible CXCR3/1 expression occurs in a large fraction of CD4+ T cells.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their health benefits have remained unclear. Recent technological advances in lipidomic analytical strategies have resulted in the discovery of a range of bioactive mediators derived from EPA and DHA that possess potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties and that may be responsible, at least in part, for the beneficial effects observed. These mediators include resolvins, protectins and maresins, as well as EPA derivatives of classical  derived eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin E3 . The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the biosynthetic pathways and biological properties of these omega-3 mediators, with a particular focus on the emerging importance of the counter-regulatory role of omega-3 and -6 fatty acids in the spatial and temporal regulation of the inflammatory response. It will also provide an insight into a range of lipidomic approaches, which are currently available to analyse these fatty acids and their metabolites in biological matrices.Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Asthma is very heterogeneous; new theories and treatments are emerging. It is a growing epidemic among children and adults in the United States and the severity of asthma is caused by many factors such as lack of education, poor early recognition, decreased symptom awareness, improper medications, and phenotypic changes. Genetic variation, innate immune genes, those involved in tissue remodeling and  metabolism, and inflammatory mediators might contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) linked with asthma. This extensive review addresses concepts of the burden of asthma and sinusitis, altered innate , adaptive , asthma remodeling, the airway epithelium, the role of airway smooth muscle cells, united allergic airway, genetics, an integral part in asthma, and CRS.

This fatty  is also transferred from macrophages (Mphi) to lymphocytes (LY) in co-culture. This observation led us to investigate the effect of macrophages pre-loaded with AA on concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. The experiments were performed in co-culture. This condition reproduces the in vivo microenvironment in which the modulation of lymphocyte proliferation is dependent on the interaction with macrophages. Lymphocytes obtained from untreated rats or from intraperitoneally thioglycolate-injected rats (THIO-treated) were co-cultured with macrophages from the same rats. Firstly, macrophages were co-cultured for 48 h with Con A-stimulated lymphocytes in different proportions: 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 30% of 5 x 10(5) lymphocytes per well. At 1% proportion, macrophages caused maximum stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation; a four- to five-fold increase, for cells from both thioglycolate-treated and untreated rats, respectively, whereas at 20% it caused maximum inhibition. In addition, 1 or 20% macrophages were pre-loaded with several AA concentrations during a period of 6 h and co-cultured with lymphocytes. At 180 microM AA and 1% macrophages, lymphocyte proliferation was inhibited (by 25%), whereas at 20% macrophages, proliferation was increased, by 25- and three-fold, respectively, for cells from untreated and THIO-treated rats. AA added directly to the medium reduced lymphocyte proliferation, also being toxic to these cells at 100 microM. No toxic effects of AA were observed on macrophages. Additional evidence suggests that nitric oxide production is involved in the modulation of lymphocyte proliferation by AA-pre-loaded macrophages. These findings support the proposition that AA can directly modulate lymphocyte proliferation and the interaction between macrophages and lymphocytes.Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3082978>Interleukin 2 does not induce phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in activated T cells.</a></h2><p>Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and myoinositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate is thought to be a primary event in the activation of cells by some growth factors, mitogenic lectins, and oncogenes.

Because the mitogenic action of IL 2 resembles that of some growth factors, the possible role of phosphatidylinositol breakdown in the activation of T cells by IL 2 was examined. In human or murine IL 2-sensitive cells, incubation with IL 2 did not alter the rate of turnover of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, or phosphatidylcholine in 32PO4-loaded cells.

In contrast, under similar conditions, IL 2 induced significant increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation. Mitogenic lectins such as concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin gave significant changes in isotopic labeling of phosphoinositols, diacylglycerols, and phosphatidylinositols, indicating that phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis induced by mitogenic lectins was detectable in the assay systems.

Pigs were given TPN with soybean emulsion for 7 weeks, controls were given saline intravenously and consumed a similar caloric load in a standard oral diet. Spontaneous nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction increased 204% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from TPN animals compared to controls (p < 0.05), and 161% (p = 0.05) in alveolar macrophages.

The membrane lipid contents of linoleic  (18:2, n-6) increased, while  (20:4, n-6) tended to decrease both in MNC and lung tissue. Thus, linoleic  conversion did not lead to accumulation of arachidonate in the cell membranes.

Intraperitoneal challenge of passively sensitized rats with antigen caused the production of peptidoleukotrienes, leukotriene (LT)B4, thromboxane (TX)B2, and 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha in the peritoneal cavity. Pretreatment of the rats with thioglycollate i.p. markedly changed the amount of eicosanoids formed. When polymorphonuclear leukocytes were the predominant cell type in the peritoneal exudate, both LTC4 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were decreased by 75% each and TXB2 by 50%. When elicited macrophages were predominant, there was an additional reduction in LTC4 by 68% as compared with 18 hr after thioglycollate treatment, but no additional change in the other  metabolites. In vitro antigen challenge of passively sensitized mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells caused the release of LTC4, LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (5-HETE), and TXB2. Exposure to antigen of these mast cells in the presence of resident peritoneal macrophages markedly altered eicosanoid formation. Early in the time course (2 to 15 min), macrophages markedly enhanced all 5-lipoxygenase products. However, later in the time course (30 to 120 min), these products were decreased. This decrease was reversed by catalase and superoxide dismutase, which suggests the involvement of oxygen radicals. These active oxygen species also seemed to be generated by mast cells, because these enzymes caused an increase in 5-lipoxygenase products when mast cells were challenged alone. RIA of cyclooxygenase products showed that mast cells released only TXB2 when stimulated with antigen. When they were stimulated in the presence of macrophages, TXB2 and also PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were synthesized. Therefore, macrophages probably contribute the PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Because the same amount of TXB2 was generated whether macrophages were present or not, the mast cells seem to be the major source of this compound. These data indicate that macrophages and possibly polymorphonuclear leukocytes participate in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3748386>Dietary essential fatty acids, vitamin E, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</a></h2><p>Twenty patients with type I Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease received dietary supplementation with the essential fatty acids (EFA), linoleic and gamma-linolenic acids, and vitamin E.

We here report that PGE2, the major  metabolite released by antigen-presenting cells (APC), primes naive human T cells for enhanced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Unfractionated as well as CD45RO- CD31+ sort-purified neonatal CD4 T cells acquire the capacity to produce a large spectrum of cytokines after priming with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in the absence of both APC and exogenous cytokines. PGE2 primes naive T cells in a dose-dependent fashion for production of high levels of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, and very low levels of IL-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and TNF-beta. PGE2 does not significantly increase IL-4 production in priming cultures, whereas it suppresses IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Addition of a neutralizing mAb to IL-4 receptor in primary cultures, supplemented or not with PGE2, prevents the development of IL-4-producing cells but does not abolish the effects of PGE2 on IL-10 and IL-13 as well as T helper (Th)1-associated cytokines. Addition of exogenous IL-2 in primary cultures does not alter the effects of PGE2 on naive T cell maturation. Thus PGE2 does not act by increasing IL-4 production in priming cultures, and its effects are partly IL-4 independent and largely IL-2 independent. Together with the recent demonstration that PGE2 suppresses IL-12 production, our results strongly suggest that this endogenously produced molecule may play a significant role in Th subset development and that its stable analogs may be considered for the treatment of Th1-mediated inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22851816>PGI2 as a regulator of inflammatory diseases.</a></h2><p>Prostacyclin, or PGI(2), is an end product derived from the sequential metabolism of  via cyclooxygenase and PGI synthase (PGIS).

However, there is little known about the cellular components and genes associated with echinoderm . The 2013-2014 sea star wasting disease outbreak is an emergent, rapidly spreading disease, which has led to large population declines of asteroids in the North American Pacific. While evidence suggests that the signs of this disease, twisting arms and lesions, may be attributed to a viral infection, the host response to infection is still poorly understood. In order to examine transcriptional responses of the sea star Pycnopodia helianthoides to sea star wasting disease, we injected a viral sized fraction (0.2 Î¼m) homogenate prepared from symptomatic P. helianthoides into apparently healthy stars. Nine days following injection, when all stars were displaying signs of the disease, specimens were sacrificed and coelomocytes were extracted for RNA-seq analyses. A number of immune genes, including those involved in Toll signaling pathways, complement cascade, melanization response, and  metabolism, were differentially expressed. Furthermore, genes involved in nervous system processes and tissue remodeling were also differentially expressed, pointing to transcriptional changes underlying the signs of sea star wasting disease.

Recently, the molecular mechanisms underlying the PGE2 actions mediated by each EP subtype have been elucidated by studies using mice deficient in each EP subtype as well as several compounds highly selective to each EP subtype, and their findings now enable us to discuss how PGE2 initiates and exacerbates inflammation at the molecular level. Here, we review the recent advances in PGE2 receptor research by focusing on the activation of mast cells via the EP3 receptor and the control of helper T cells via the EP2/4 receptor, which are the molecular mechanisms involved in PGE2-induced inflammation that had been unknown for many years.

In the present study, Ruditapes philippinarum was used as the target bivalve to receive nitrite exposure at environmental concentration for 1 and 7 days. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected and analyzed by a digital gene expression (DGE) approach to describe the toxicity of nitrite on the bivalve at the gene level. In the N1 group, 185 DEGs were generated and enriched in six Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including oxidoreductase activity, heme binding, tetrapyrrole binding, iron ion binding, metal binding and cation binding. The DEGs in the N1 group were also enriched in two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, e.g.,  metabolism and ovarian steroidogenesis. In the N7 group, 81 DEGs were generated without any GO enrichment but were enriched in five KEGG pathways, including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, protein export, prion diseases, thyroid hormone synthesis and  metabolism. This suggested that nitrite exposure might cause adverse effects to the clams in several aspects, including oxidative damage, depressed , and disorders in cell proliferation, hormone metabolism and tissue regeneration. Evaluation of oxidative stress indicated that nitrite exposure actually induced redox state imbalance by enhancing the contents of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARSs) and glutathione (GSH), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) but not superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results will provide valuable gene references for further study on the toxicology mechanism of bivalves under environmental nitrite stress.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Macrophage participation in inflammation or tissue repair is directed by various extracellular signals and mediated by multiple intracellular pathways. Activation of group VIA phospholipase A (iPLAÎ²) causes accumulation of , lysophospholipids, and eicosanoids that can promote inflammation and pathologic states. We examined the role of iPLAÎ² in peritoneal macrophage immune function by comparing wild type (WT) and iPLAÎ² mouse macrophages. Compared with WT, iPLAÎ² macrophages exhibited reduced proinflammatory M1 markers when classically activated. In contrast, anti-inflammatory M2 markers were elevated under naÃ¯ve conditions and induced to higher levels by alternative activation in iPLAÎ² macrophages compared with WT. Induction of eicosanoid (12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2))- and reactive oxygen species (NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4))-generating enzymes by classical activation pathways was also blunted in iPLAÎ² macrophages compared with WT. The effects of inhibitors of iPLAÎ², COX2, or 12-LO to reduce M1 polarization were greater than those to enhance M2 polarization. Certain lipids (lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidic , and prostaglandin E) recapitulated M1 phenotype in iPLAÎ² macrophages, but none tested promoted M2 phenotype. These findings suggest that (a) lipids generated by iPLAÎ² and subsequently oxidized by cyclooxygenase and 12-LO favor macrophage inflammatory M1 polarization, and (b) the absence of iPLAÎ² promotes macrophage M2 polarization. Reducing macrophage iPLAÎ² activity and thereby attenuating macrophage M1 polarization might cause a shift from an inflammatory to a recovery/repair milieu.Â© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8690892>Antigen receptors on immature, but not mature, B and T cells are coupled to cytosolic phospholipase A2 activation: expression and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 correlate with lymphocyte maturation.</a></h2><p>The Ag receptors on mature B and T cells are not coupled to the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and  release. Moreover, phorbol esters such as PMA, which can activate cPLA2 via mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in most cell types, also failed to induce the release of arachidonate from mature cells, suggesting that the cPLA2 pathway may not be functional in mature lymphocytes. Interestingly, Western blot analysis revealed that cPLA2, which had previously been thought to be expressed ubiquitously, is not expressed in mature B or T cells and that cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression could not be up-regulated in lymphocytes following culture with a range of cytokines most likely to be involved in an immune response such as IL-1 alpha, IL-3, or TNF-alpha. In contrast, cPLA2 was shown to be expressed and activated in thymocytes and immature B cells under conditions in which ligation of the Ag receptors led to growth arrest and/or apoptosis.

CYP2J2 is anti-inflammatory in human peripheral blood monocytes. Bacterial LPS induced CYP2J2 mRNA and protein. The CYP2J2  products 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET inhibited LPS induced TNFÎ± release.

Ly6c(hi) and Ly6c(lo) monocytes, resident macrophages, and recruited dendritic cells all showed a dramatic change in their resolution signature following in vivo epoxI treatment. Markers of macrophage differentiation CD11b, MerTK, and CD103 were reduced, and monocyte-derived macrophages and resident macrophages ex vivo showed greatly impaired phagocytosis of zymosan and efferocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes following epoxI treatment.

The initial step of PAF formation is activation of phospholipase A2 in a calcium-dependent manner, yielding lyso-PAF. During this step  is also released and can be converted to its respective cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products. The lyso-PAF generated is then acetylated in position 2 of the glycerol backbone by a coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent acetyltransferase. An additional pathway may exist whereby PAF is generated de novo from 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol by phosphocholine transferase. PAF inactivation in cells and blood is by specific acetylhydrolases. PAF exhibits a variety of biological activities including platelet and leukocyte aggregation and activation, increased vascular permeability, respiratory distress, decreased cardiac output, and hypotension. In the kidney PAF can produce decreases in blood flow, glomerular filtration, and fluid and electrolyte excretion. Intrarenal artery injection of PAF may also result in glomerular accumulation of platelets and leukocytes and mild proteinuria. PAF increases prostaglandin formation in the isolated kidney and in cultured glomerular mesangial cells. PAF also causes contraction of mesangial cells. Upon stimulation with calcium ionophore the isolated kidney, isolated glomeruli and medullary cells, and cultured mesangial cells are capable of producing PAF. The potential role for PAF in renal physiology and pathophysiology requires further investigation that may be complicated by 1) the multiple interactions of PAF, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes and 2) the autocoid nature of PAF, which may restrict its action to its site of generation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22106101>Pharmacologic profile of OC000459, a potent, selective, and orally active D prostanoid receptor 2 antagonist that inhibits mast cell-dependent activation of T helper 2 lymphocytes and eosinophils.</a></h2><p>D prostanoid receptor 2 (DPâ) [also known as chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T helper 2 (Th2) cells (CRTH2)] is selectively expressed by Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils and mediates recruitment and activation of these cell types in response to prostaglandin Dâ (PGDâ).

Because HETEs have been shown to be rapidly metabolized and/or incorporated into cellular lipids in a variety of cell types, we have investigated the uptake, metabolism, and intracellular distribution of exogenous 12-HETE by human PBMC. [3H]-12-HETE was dose and time dependently incorporated by PBMC and also metabolized to more polar products. These polar metabolites were mainly released extracellularly and only marginally esterfied in phospholipids. Although [3H]-12-HETE radiolabel was preferentially associated with phosphatidylcholine, especially after prolonged labeling incubations or following successive short labeling pulses, a substantial amount of radiolabel was also found associated with phosphatidylinositol (20-50% of the labeled phospholipids). The stability of 12-HETE in the phospholipid pool was comparable to that reported for most other cell types, with 50% of the initial radiolabel being still present after 18 hr. Upon exposure to mitogenic activation, 12-HETE-labeled PBMC released unmodified 12-HETE from phosphatidylinositol. In addition, 12-HETE dose dependently inhibited the proliferative response of PBMC to Con A stimulation.

(AA) metabolism by cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LO) enzymes leads to the production of proinflammatory eicosanoids, and stimulates cytokine production and activation of microglia and astrocytes, thereby contributing to MS pathology. Current therapies target the immune system but do not specifically target AA-related inflammatory pathway. Corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently associated with immunomodulatory therapies to treat flu-like adverse effects. Few clinical and mounting preclinical data in MS show that AA metabolism contributes to immune system activation, demyelination and motor disabilities, and administration of NSAIDs reduces these symptoms. The beneficial effect of NSAIDs seems to be a prerogative of COX-2 selective inhibitors and suggests that NSAIDs selective for COX-2 may be more effective than mixed COX-1/2 inhibitors.Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex that phosphorylates the NF-kappaB inhibitors, triggering their conjugation with ubiquitin and subsequent degradation. Freed NF-kappaB dimers translocate to the nucleus and induce target genes, including the one for cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2), which catalyses the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, in particular PGE. At late stages of inflammatory episodes, however, COX2 directs the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cyclopentenone prostaglandins, suggesting a role for these molecules in the resolution of inflammation. Cyclopentenone prostaglandins have been suggested to exert anti-inflammatory activity through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma.

Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that will inhibit stimulus-induced Na+-H+ exchange and prevent an increase in cell pH. Amiloride has been shown to inhibit a number of protein kinases including the calcium phospholipid-dependent protein kinase.

Here we used next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to produce a transcriptome-wide profile of the immune response of the Staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis to White Band Disease (WBD) by comparing infected versus healthy (asymptomatic) coral tissues. The transcriptome of A. cervicornis was assembled de novo from A-tail selected Illumina mRNA-seq data from whole coral tissues, and parsed bioinformatically into coral and non-coral transcripts using existing Acropora genomes in order to identify putative coral transcripts. Differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the coral and non-coral datasets to identify genes that were up- and down-regulated due to disease infection. RNA-seq analyses indicate that infected corals exhibited significant changes in gene expression across 4% (1,805 out of 47,748 transcripts) of the coral transcriptome. The primary response to infection included transcripts involved in macrophage-mediated pathogen recognition and ROS production, two hallmarks of phagocytosis, as well as key mediators of apoptosis and calcium homeostasis.

In consequence, our results evidence the co-existence in blood of a genomic program mediating pro-fibrotic mechanisms and metabolic alterations in advanced cirrhosis. Monitoring expression levels of the genes involved in these programs could be of interest for predicting / monitoring cirrhosis evolution.

The effects of B. bassiana (ARSEF-1151) were expressed in a conidial dose-dependent manner on mortality of the larvae. An increased and faster mortality of the larvae followed B. bassiana (ARSEF-1151) infection when the spores were co-injected with the eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors (dexamethasone, naproxen, phenidone, esculetin). These compounds express different modes of action. These lethal effects were reversed when dexamethasone was injected with eicosanoid precursor  (20:4n-6). Nodulation is the predominant cellular reaction to bacterial and fungal injection in insects. Injection of each of five fungal species showed that nodulation intensity varies according to infecting fungal species.

However, in humans, similar dietary strategies may be impractical because of the high levels of fish oils required. In contrast, we believe that beneficial effects in humans may be attainable using new exotic fatty acids. Toward this end, we have focused on 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic  [5,11,14-ETA, 20:3(5,11,14)]. This fatty  is structurally analogous to 20:4(5,8,11,14) but lacks the delta-8 double bond essential for conversion to eicosanoids. To examine our hypothesis, diets containing the oil of Platycladus orientalis containing 3% 5,11,14-ETA, a matched control oil, fish oil, or safflower oil were fed to NZB mice. There was a dramatic delay in both the onset and the titer of direct Coombs' tests in mice fed P. orientalis oil. These were directly reflected by the abundance of 5,11,14-ETA in serum lipids. Most striking was the accumulation of 5,11,14-ETA in serum and tissue phospholipids. Though constituting only 3% of dietary fatty acids, 5,11,14-ETA was the most abundant long chain polyunsaturated fatty  in the serum phospholipids, suggesting that it very successfully competed with 20:4 as a constituent of membrane lipids. 5,11,14-ETA was incorporated into all tissue phospholipids examined except brain phosphatidyl inositol. Among tissues, liver showed the highest incorporation of 5,11,14-ETA into phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), yet spleen PE had a higher quantity of ETA than other tissues. Lesser arachidonate in spleen PS, heart PC, and heart PI showed the evidence of replacement by 5,11,14-ETA.

The deficient status of animals was demonstrated by a significant reduction in the pulmonary and hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of rats on selenium-deficient diet. Sham and smoke treatment did not influence the GSH-Px activity in either diet group. Elevated levels of blood carboxyhemoglobin and pulmonary aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in the smoke-exposed rats of both diet groups indicated effective inhalation of cigarette smoke by animals. Studies of the extracellular release of arachidonate metabolites by pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) indicated that resting cells released small amounts of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Upon phagocytic challenge by opsonized zymosan particles, the release of the three metabolites was substantially increased in all diet and treatment groups. While the release of cyclooxygenase products, PGE2 and TXB2, remained unaffected by cigarette smoke, an inhibition of approximately 50% in the release of lipoxygenase product, LTB4, was observed in cells from selenium-fed animals. In selenium-deficient animals, cigarette smoke almost completely inhibited (greater than 80%) the zymosan-stimulated release of LTB4 by PAMs and additionally caused about 50% reduction in TXB2 release. These results suggest a specific inhibition of lipoxygenase pathway by cigarette smoke in PAMs of selenium-fed rats and suggest that cigarette smoke may additionally impair enzymes of the cyclooxygenase pathway in PAMs of selenium-deficient animals.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25823439>Regulation of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation.</a></h2><p>The immune reactions that regulate atherosclerotic plaque inflammation involve chemokines, lipid mediators and costimulatory molecules. Chemokines are a family of chemotactic cytokines that mediate immune cell recruitment and control cell homeostasis and activation of different immune cell types and subsets. Chemokine production and activation of chemokine receptors form a positive feedback mechanism to recruit monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes into the atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, chemokine signalling affects immune cell mobilization from the bone marrow. Targeting several of the chemokines and/or chemokine receptors reduces experimental atherosclerosis, whereas specific chemokine pathways appear to be involved in plaque regression. Leukotrienes are lipid mediators that are formed locally in atherosclerotic lesions from . Leukotrienes mediate immune cell recruitment and activation within the plaque as well as smooth muscle cell proliferation and endothelial dysfunction. Antileukotrienes decrease experimental atherosclerosis, and recent observational data suggest beneficial clinical effects of leukotriene receptor antagonism in cardiovascular disease prevention. By contrast, other lipid mediators, such as lipoxins and metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids, have been associated with the resolution of inflammation. Costimulatory molecules play a central role in fine-tuning immunological reactions and mediate crosstalk between innate and adaptive  in atherosclerosis. Targeting these interactions is a promising approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis, but immunological side effects are still a concern. In summary, targeting chemokines, leukotriene receptors and costimulatory molecules could represent potential therapeutic strategies to control atherosclerotic plaque inflammation.Â© 2015 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2827648>Monosodium urate and calcium pyrophosphate crystals differentially activate the excitation-response coupling sequence of human neutrophils.</a></h2><p>The activation patterns of human neutrophils elicited by unopsonized monosodium urate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals were investigated. The parameters chosen, the mobilization of calcium and the synthesis of leukotrienes, are generally accepted to be relevant to the activation of the cells and their pathophysiological roles. Both particles were found to elicit increases in cytoplasmic free calcium and leukotriene synthesis. However, the rank order of potency of these two stimuli was found to be sharply dependent on the test chosen. Monosodium urate crystals were significantly more effective than calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in terms of calcium mobilization, while the latter are more potent at inducing leukotriene synthesis.

This T lymphocyte requires the delivery of two signals; the first can be provided by specific monoclonal antibodies or by mitogenic lectins, and the second by a phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). In other cells such as macrophages, the rise of intracellular calcium via the generation of IP3 and stimulation of protein kinase C can activate the phospholipase A2, a calcium-dependent enzyme. This enzyme initiates the release of reactive oxygen intermediates and metabolites of . In order to know whether this other metabolic pathway can be generated in T cells, we tested the capacity of different T-cell lines and clones to produce superoxide anion after stimulation by the above-mentioned activating agents. In this paper, we demonstrate that treatment of the Jurkat human cell line with Con A, PHA, and PMA results in a significant release of reactive oxygen metabolites. Of the various T-cell lines and clones tested, only Jurkat exhibited an oxidative burst. Moreover, none of the antibodies tested (anti-CD3, anti-CD2, and anti-CD28) and known to activate T cells, and none of the immune complexes was able to mediate such an effect. The existence of an oxidative metabolism in at least one T-cell line suggests that T-cell activation may in some instances use another metabolic pathway.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3102174>Phagocytic cell-derived inflammatory mediators and lung disease.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026610>Characterization of the effects of immunomodulatory drug fingolimod (FTY720) on human T cell receptor signaling pathways.</a></h2><p>Immune responses against gene therapy products limit its therapeutic efficacy and present a safety risk. Identification of agents that blunt immune reactions may aid in developing novel immunomodulatory therapies. Fingolimod (FTY720) is an FDA approved immunomodulatory drug for treating multiple sclerosis that inhibits lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues by down regulating sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor (S1PR). Recent studies found that FTY720 inhibits T cell activation (TCA) in a S1PR-independent manner; however, the mechanism is incompletely understood. Here we characterized the effects of FTY720 on human T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways. FTY720 inhibited both the TCR-dependent and independent activation of primary human T cells. FTY720 did not affect proximal TCR signaling events as measured by phosphorylation of Lck, ZAP-70 and LAT; however, inhibited PMA/Ionomycin induced distal TCR signaling as measured by IL-2, IFN-Î³ release and CD25 expression. FTY720 induced aberrant NFAT1, AP1 and NFÎºB activation which were associated with increased acetylation of histone (H3K9). Phosphorylated FTY720 did not inhibit TCA, and  did not rescue FTY720 mediated inhibition of TCA. These data suggest that FTY720 mediated inhibition of TCA is due to inhibition of distal TCR signaling.

PGE2, one of the PGs, is produced by the action of the enzyme PGE synthase and cyclooxigenase (COX) on  liberated from the membrane phospholipid by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). In the immune system, PGE2 is mainly produced by antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. PGE2 regulates immune responses, for example, the production of cytokines and chemokines and the expression of cytokine receptors and cell surface molecules, and the main action is mediated by intracellular accumulation of cyclic AMP via the activation of adenylate cyclase. The main function of PGE2 in the immune system is the suppression of Th1 activation and the enhancement of Th2 activation. Therefore, in this paper, PGE2, a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of Th1/Th2-related diseases, is highlighted.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235833>Purification and properties of lipoxygenase from wheat seedlings infected by Fusarium graminearum and treated by salicylic .</a></h2><p>Lipoxygenase from wheat seedlings in normal conditions, infected by Fusarium graminearum and treated by salicylic  was isolated.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the TLR system remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that some PGs may control TLR-mediated inflammatory events through modulation of TLR2 expression in brain immune cells. We first found that 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-PG J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) markedly altered the expression of TLR2 but not TLR4, TLR1, and TLR9 at the message and protein levels in activated glia. Down-regulation of TLR2 expression and downstream events of TLR2 activation, including phagocytosis by 15d-PGJ(2), were also observed in cells treated with representative TLR2 ligands such as lipoteichoic  and Pam(3)CSK(4). We further revealed that certain 15d-PGJ(2)-related PGs such as 15d-PGD(2) and PGD(2) also suppressed the ligand-stimulated increase of TLR2 expression, whereas PGE(2) and  acids did not. Interestingly, TLR2 expression was down-regulated even when such PGs were added at several hours after stimulator treatment. These findings appear to be independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and D prostanoid receptors (DPs) because potent synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, selective DP1 agonist, or DP2 agonist did not mimic the effects of such PGs on TLR2 expression.

Although the effects of leukotrienes on neutrophil chemotaxis and activation have been established, their role in modulating innate host defense mechanisms is poorly understood. In a previous study (M. Bailie, T. Standiford, L. Laichalk, M. Coffey, R. Strieter, and M. Peters-Golden, J. Immunol. 157:5221-5224, 1996), we used 5-lipoxygenase knockout mice to establish a critical role for endogenous leukotrienes in pulmonary clearance and alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the present study, we investigated the role of specific endogenous leukotrienes in phagocytosis of K. pneumoniae and explored the possibility that exogenous leukotrienes could restore phagocytosis in alveolar macrophages with endogenous leukotriene synthesis inhibition and enhance this process in leukotriene-competent cells. Rat alveolar macrophages produced leukotriene B4 (LTB4), LTC4, and 5-hydoxyeicosatetraenoic  (5-HETE) during the process of phagocytosis, and the inhibition of endogenous leukotriene synthesis with zileuton and MK-886 dramatically attenuated phagocytosis. We also observed a reduction in phagocytosis when we treated alveolar macrophages with antagonists to the plasma membrane receptors for either LTB4, cysteinyl-leukotrienes, or both. In leukotriene-competent cells, LTC4 augmented phagocytosis to the greatest extent, followed by 5-HETE and LTB4. These 5-lipoxygenase reaction products demonstrated similar relative abilities to reconstitute phagocytosis in zileuton-treated rat alveolar macrophages and in alveolar macrophages from 5-lipoxygenase knockout mice. We conclude that endogenous synthesis of all major 5-lipoxygenase reaction products plays an essential role in phagocytosis.

PUFA effects on T cells have been extensively studied, but their influence on human dendritic cells (DCs), which are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in initiating immune responses, has not been elucidated so far. Here we show that PUFAs of the n-3 and n-6 series ( and eicosapentaenoic ) affect human monocyte-derived DC differentiation and inhibit their activation by LPS, resulting in altered DC surface molecule expression and diminished cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the potency to stimulate T cells was markedly inhibited in PUFA-treated DCs. The PUFA-mediated block in LPS-induced DC activation is reflected by diminished TNF-alpha, IL-12p40, CD40, and COX-2 mRNA levels. Strikingly, typical LPS-induced signaling events such as degradation of IkappaB and activation of NF-kappaB were not affected by PUFAs, even though DC membrane lipid composition was markedly altered.  and eicosapentaenoic  both altered DC prostaglandin production, but inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases did not abolish PUFA effects, indicating that the observed PUFA actions on DCs were independent of autoregulation via eicosanoids.

Together, our results establish a pro-tumorigenic role of hematopoietic 5LO in the immune microenvironment and suggest 5LO inhibition as an avenue for future investigation in treatment of colorectal polyposis and cancer.Â©2011 AACR.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26523418>How the Mediterranean diet and some of its components modulate inflammatory pathways in arthritis.</a></h2><p>Arthritis encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by inflammation that leads not only to joint damage, bone erosion, severe pain and disability, but also affects other organs of the body, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of joint diseases are for the most part unknown, a number of nutrient and non-nutrient components of food have been shown to affect the inflammatory process and, in particular, to influence clinical disease progression. The Mediterranean diet model has already been linked to a number of beneficial health effects: both fat and non-fat components of the Mediterranean dietary pattern have been shown to exert important anti-inflammatory activities by affecting the  cascade, the expression of some proinflammatory genes, and the activity of immune cells. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular, have been shown to affect lymphocyte and monocyte functions, crucially involved in adaptive and innate . Although some aspects concerning the mechanisms of action through which the Mediterranean diet pattern exerts its beneficial effects remain to be elucidated, arthritis patients may potentially benefit from it in view of their increased cardiovascular risk and the treatment they require which may have side effects.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8355587>The esterified plasma fatty  profile is altered in early HIV-1 infection.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that alterations in micronutrient utilization occur in patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

Following interaction of the mitogen with its receptors, a transmembrane 'trigger-type' signal is propagated which has both positive and negative correlates. The negative signal occurs with high mitogen concentrations and is associated with membrane freezing, microtubular aggregation, receptor capping, adenylate cyclase activation, and cellular cyclic AMP increases. The positive signal occurs with optimal mitogen concentrations and is associated with changes in membrane permeability and transport with influx of calcium and potassium ion and efflux of sodium, in transport processes for glucose, amino acids, and nucleosides, and in a collected series of early membrane lipid changes which can be considered essential for the positive signal. These lipid changes include the uptake of  and other fatty acids, choline, phosphate and other molecules, their incorporation into membrane phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol (PI), and a turnover of PI with the production of inositol triphosphate, which can be related to calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol which activates a cytoplasmic protein kinase C. A key event associated with mitogen action is  release.  may give rise to prostaglandins and thromboxanes as part of negative components of the signal through effects on the adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP system.  gives rise to eicosanoids like 5-, 11-, possibly 12- and 15-hydroxyperoxy and hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acids and leukotrienes B4 and C4. The activation of the 5-lipoxygenase, a critical calcium-dependent step, leads via the production of 5-HPETE and 5-HETE to the activation of membrane and soluble guanylate cyclase and the production of cyclic GMP. Cyclic GMP appears to be essential for mitogen activation and is associated with cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase activation and the phosphorylation of a number of substrates. Calcium ion influx is clearly central to mitogen action. Calcium through its influx and mobilization from cellular stores is thought to contribute directly and indirectly through the action of calmodulin and protein kinase C to the activation of a number of enzymatic processes involved in the positive signal including phospholipase C, diglyceride kinase and lipase, 5-lipoxygenase, and guanylate cyclase.

When THP-1 cells were incubated over 4-7 days in 10% supernatant from lectin-activated human lymphocytes, their capacity to synthesize 5-lipoxygenase products was significantly increased. In contrast, the supernatant from nonactivated lymphocytes had no effect. The increase in capacity to synthesize 5-lipoxygenase products was mimicked by the addition of either granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3. These increases in synthetic capacity reflected increased enzymatic activity. Increased immunoreactive protein and mRNA for the enzymes 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein were also found in cells conditioned with activated lymphocyte supernatants. Furthermore, the increase in mRNA for both enzymes was not blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting that the effect on steady-state mRNA levels does not require the synthesis of new protein.

Xenorhabdus hominickii is an entomopathogenic bacterium that can suppress insect  by inhibiting PLA activity. However, little is known about target PLA types inhibited by X. hominickii. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine PLA types in the host insect, Spodoptera exigua using specific inhibitors. All developmental stages of S. exigua possessed significant PLA activities, with late larval stages showing relatively higher PLA activities. In different larval tissues, hemocytes had higher PLA activities than fat body, gut, or epidermis. Various developmental and tissue extracts exhibited differential susceptibilities to three different PLA inhibitors. Late larva-to-adult stages were highly susceptible to all three different types of PLA inhibitors. In contrast, extracts from egg and young larval stages were not susceptible to secretory PLA (sPLA) or calcium-independent cellular PLA (iPLA) inhibitors, although they were susceptible to a calcium-dependent cellular PLA (cPLA) inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner. Different tissues of fifth instars exhibited variation in susceptibility to inhibitors, with epidermal tissue being sensitive to cPLA inhibitor only while other tissues were sensitive to all three types of inhibitors. Bacterial challenge with heat-killed X. hominickii significantly increased PLA activity. However, live bacteria suppressed the induction of PLA activity. An organic extract of X. hominickii-culture broth inhibited the susceptibility of S. exigua to sPLA- and iPLA- specific inhibitors, but not to cPLA-specific inhibitor. Oxindole, a component of the organic extract, exhibited an inhibitory pattern similar to the organic extract. Taken together, our results indicate that S. exigua possesses different PLA types and that X. hominickii can inhibit PLAs susceptible to sPLA- and iPLA- specific inhibitors.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show evidence that interaction of fresh NK cells with membranes from sensitive or antibody (Ab)-coated targets generates eicosanoids through both cyclooxygenase (CO) and lipoxygenase (LO) pathways. Eicosanoid generation is attributable to PLA2 activation since pretreatment with PLA2 irreversible inhibitors, such as mepacrine or para-bromophenacylbromide (pBPB), completely blocks AA metabolite generation. The involvement of PLA2 or AA metabolites in the cytotoxic functions of rat NK cells has also been investigated. Treatment of effector cells with mepacrine or pBPB resulted in complete, irreversible, dose-dependent inhibition of both NK and ADCC activities, which were completely reversed by the addition of exogenous PLA2 or its hydrolysis products, AA and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). Among the metabolites of AA released by NK cells, the 5-LO product leukotriene B4 (LTB4) seems to play an important role in cytolytic activities of NK cells. Indeed, the LO inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA), totally abrogated both NK and ADCC activities, which were restored by the addition of exogenous LTB4. However, the failure of LTB4 to reverse mepacrine or pBPB-induced inhibition of NK and ADCC suggests that its effects could be mediated by PLA2. The results are consistent with a crucial role for the target-stimulated AA release as a fundamental step in the signal transduction pathway in NK cell.

Cytotoxic activity of spleen cells cultured in the presence of PGE2 or LTB4 is respectively decreased or increased.

The evidence reviewed in this paper indicates that, besides the action of complement fragments,  metabolites, formyl peptides and other bacterial products, the establishment of a gradient of ICAM-1 expression across the junctional epithelium and the expression of IL-8 in its superficial layers probably represent important regulatory mechanisms leading to PMN migration into the gingival sulcus. Such mechanisms can be regulated by the autocrine and paracrine action of some pro-inflammatory cytokines and could, possibly be initiated by specific bacteria-keratinocyte interactions. The advantage of such a redundant regulatory mechanism leading to PMN transepithelial migration is probably related to the key role of the neutrophil in the maintenance of a local host-parasite equilibrium on one side, and on the tissue injury associated with PMN persistence or random migration within periodontal tissues on the other.

They are produced by various cell types through distinct enzymatic pathways and act on target cells via specific G-protein-coupled receptors. Although originally recognized for their capacity to elicit biological responses such as vascular homeostasis, protection of the gastric mucosa and platelet aggregation, eicosanoids are now understood to regulate immunopathological processes ranging from inflammatory responses to chronic tissue remodelling, cancer, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disorders.

The proportions of all other fatty acids, apart from linoleic , and the proportion of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (approximately 35 g/100 g total fatty acids) were constant, and the n-6 to n-3 PUFA ratio was maintained as close to 7 as possible. The fatty  compositions of the serum and of spleen leukocytes were markedly influenced by that of the diet. Prostaglandin E2 production was enhanced from leukocytes from rats fed the ARA-rich diet and was decreased from leukocytes from the EPA- or DHA-fed rats. Replacing dietary ALA with EPA resulted in diminished ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer (NK) cell activity and a reduced cell-mediated immune response in vivo. In contrast, replacing ALA with DHA reduced ex vivo lymphocyte proliferation but did not affect ex vivo NK cell activity or the cell-mediated immune response in vivo. Replacement of a proportion of linoleic  with either gamma-linolenic  or ARA did not affect lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell activity, or the cell-mediated immune response. Thus, this study shows that different n-3 PUFA exert different immunomodulatory actions, that EPA exerts more widespread and/or stronger immunomodulatory effects than DHA, that a low level of EPA is sufficient to influence the immune response, and that the immunomodulatory effects of fish oil may be mainly due to EPA.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3924998>The role of  metabolism in the activities of interleukin 1 and 2.</a></h2><p>Several investigations have suggested that products of  metabolism have modulatory effects on the development of cellular . In this report we have studied the role of  metabolism in the specific effects of interleukin 1 (IL 1) induction of interleukin 2 (IL 2), and also IL 2 stimulation of proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Utilizing cell lines that are specifically responsive to IL 1 or IL 2, it was found that both interleukins stimulate lipoxygenation of  in their respective target cell. The ability of each interleukin to induce monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE) correlated with the induction of secondary lymphokine secretion. Utilizing selective and partially selective pharmacologic inhibitors of  metabolism, the data suggest that the participation of lipoxygenase activity is required for both IL 1 induction of IL 2 production and IL 2 regulation of proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion. The same requirement for lipoxygenase activity was seen when phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used as a secretory stimulant, suggesting a similar mode of action for stimulation-secretory activity between PMA and interleukins. Studies performed with an endogenous inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (15-HETE) demonstrated the requirement of this enzyme system for IL 2-dependent proliferation and IFN-gamma production. Although leukotrienes could replace IL 2 for IFN-gamma secretion, they had no effect on IL 2 growth promotion. The results suggest that both IL 1 and IL 2, and PMA, may share the lipoxygenase pathway of  metabolism which is a component of the intracellular signal transduction process that regulates secretory activity and/or cellular proliferation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826533>Elevated levels of endocannabinoids in chronic hepatitis C may modulate cellular immune response and hepatic stellate cell activation.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid (EC) system is implicated in many chronic liver diseases, including hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. Cannabis consumption is associated with fibrosis progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), however, the role of ECs in the development of CHC has never been explored. To study this question, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) were quantified in samples of HCV patients and healthy controls by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoaclyglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity was assessed by [3H]AEA and [3H]2-AG hydrolysis, respectively. Gene expression and cytokine release were assayed by TaqMan PCR and ELISpot, respectively. AEA and 2-AG levels were increased in plasma of HCV patients, but not in liver tissues. Hepatic FAAH and MAGL activity was not changed. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), ECs inhibited IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-2 secretion. Inhibition of IL-2 by endogenous AEA was stronger in PBMC from HCV patients. In hepatocytes, 2-AG induced the expression of IL-6, -17A, -32 and COX-2, and enhanced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) co-cultivated with PBMC from subjects with CHC.

It has been suggested that there is a causal relationship between n-6 PUFA intake and allergic disease, and there are biologically plausible mechanisms, involving eicosanoid mediators of the n-6 PUFA , that could explain this. Fish and fish oils are sources of long-chain n-3 PUFAs and these fatty acids act to oppose the actions of n-6 PUFAs. Thus, it is considered that n-3 PUFAs will protect against atopic sensitization and against the clinical manifestations of atopy. Evidence to examine this has been acquired from epidemiologic studies investigating associations between fish intake in pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and childhood, and atopic outcomes in infants and children and from intervention studies with fish oil supplements in pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and childhood, and atopic outcomes in infants and children. All five epidemiological studies investigating the effect of maternal fish intake during pregnancy on atopic or allergic outcomes in infants/children of those pregnancies concluded protective associations. One study investigating the effects of maternal fish intake during lactation did not observe any significant associations. The evidence from epidemiological studies investigating the effects of fish intake during infancy and childhood on atopic outcomes in those infants or children is inconsistent, although the majority of the studies (nine of 14) showed a protective effect of fish intake during infancy or childhood on atopic outcomes in those infants/children. Fish oil supplementation during pregnancy and lactation or during infancy or childhood results in a higher n-3 PUFA status in the infants or children. Fish oil provision to pregnant women is associated with immunologic changes in cord blood and such changes may persist. Studies performed to date indicate that provision of fish oil during pregnancy may reduce sensitization to common food allergens and reduce prevalence and severity of atopic dermatitis in the first year of life, with a possible persistence until adolescence with a reduction in eczema, hay fever, and asthma. Fish oil provision to infants or children may be associated with immunologic changes in the blood but it is not clear if these are of clinical significance and whether they persist. Fish oil supplementation in infancy may decrease the risk of developing some manifestations of allergic disease, but this benefit may not persist as other factors come into play. It is not clear whether fish oil can be used to treat children with asthma as the two studies conducted to date give divergent results. Further studies of increased long-chain n-3 PUFA provision in during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy are needed to more clearly identify the immunologic and clinical effects in infants and children and to identify protective and therapeutic effects and their persistence.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10834308>Prostaglandin E2 is variably induced by bacterial superantigens in bovine mononuclear cells and has a regulatory role for the T cell proliferative response.</a></h2><p>Signal transduction in antigen presenting cells via MHC class II molecules induces production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) known to possess immunoregulatory potential. Since Staphylococcus aureus superantigens (SAgs) utilize MHC class II molecules as primary ligands, we wanted to know whether PGE2 is induced after in vitro SAg stimulation of bovine blood mononuclear cells (boMNC), and whether this  metabolite modulates the preferential SAg-induced proliferative response of bovine CD8+ T cells. SEB as well as SEA induced maximal amounts of PGE2 on day 2 of culture (1-2.5 x 10(-8) mol/l per 2 x 10(5) boMNC). PGE2 production could be inhibited completely by indomethacin (10(-5) mol/l) causing enhanced proliferation of boCD4+ T cells (174%) as well as of boCD8+ T cells (122%) between day 4 and 6 of the in vitro culture, however, only in a subset of the tested animals. Notably, the striking preference of proliferation of boCD8+ over boCD4+ T cells following SAg stimulation remained largely unchanged after inhibition of endogenous PGE2 synthesis or after addition of exogenous PGE2. Higher concentrations of exogenously added PGE2 (> or = 10(-8) mol/l) inhibited the proliferation reaction, mainly due to an increased death rate of both CD4+ and CD8+ blasts. In contrast, lower PGE2 concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-9) mol/l even slightly enhanced the proliferation of both T cell subsets, depending on the individual cell donor. Summing up: These data show that SAgs, indeed, can induce PGE2 production in boMNC which can enhance or reduce the proliferative response of bovine CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30965086>The gut mucosal barrier of zebrafish (Danio rerio) responds to the time-restricted delivery of Lobosphaera incisa-enriched diets.</a></h2><p>Recent studies in mammalian models revealed compelling evidence that along with the intrinsic characteristics of diets, the time of their delivery could have a profound impact on their benefits. In this study, we explored a time-dependent modulation of the gut mucosal barrier by delivering diets enriched with the green microalga (Lobosphaera incisa) either in a time-restricted regime or randomly to zebrafish (Danio rerio). The basal diet was enriched with microalgal biomass through two inclusion levels (i.e., 10% and 15% w/w), and the feeding trial lasted for six weeks. The control group was fed with the basal diet. After collection of tissue samples at week 6, the remaining fish were challenged by intraperitoneal injection of Streptococcus inaie. A histological analysis of the gut structure revealed that the fish that received the microalgae randomly exhibited shorter villi length. Genes coding for  were modulated in the gut by dietary treatments. Notably, the transcript levels of lysozyme, Î²-defensin and hepcidin were significantly higher in the group subjected to the time-restricted feeding regime. Dietary microalgae affected the fatty  content in the gut, particularly the level of  (ARA), and the time-restricted feeding influenced its accumulation. Groups that received diets enriched with 15% microalgae, regardless of the feeding strategy, displayed a significantly higher resistance to S. inaie 16 days post-infection, though differences between the delivery strategies were pronounced during the early stage of infection. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of L. incisa modulated some of the features of the gut mucosal barrier of zebrafish, and the time of delivery appeared to have a considerable influence on immunomodulatory functions.Copyright Â© 2019.

Generation of a unique eicosanoid profile with different biological effects by administration of FA precursors other than  is one approach under investigation. In addition to their role as eicosanoid precursors, FA are of major importance in maintaining cell membrane structure, are key determinants of membrane bound enzyme activity and receptor expression. FA can exert these functions directly and therefore may themselves be important regulators of immune responses. For example, certain FA influence cytokine production and proliferation of human T lymphocytes in a manner that is direct and not due to their conversion to eicosanoids.

The latter play an important role in vascular homeostasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. As little is known about the functional importance of extra-vascular sources of lipid epoxides, we focused on determining whether lipid epoxide-generating CYP isoforms are expressed in human monocytes/macrophages. Epoxides were generated by freshly isolated human monocytes and production increased markedly during differentiation to macrophages. Mass spectrometric analysis identified CYP2S1 as a novel macrophage CYP and CYP2S1-containing microsomes generated epoxides of , linoleic and eicosapentaenoic . Macrophage CYP2S1 expression was increased by LPS and IFN-Î³ (classically activated), and oxidized LDL but not IL-4 and IL-13 (alternatively activated), and was colocalised with CD68 in inflamed human tonsils but not in breast cancer metastases. Prostaglandin (PG) E(2) is an immune modulator factor that promotes phagocytosis and CYP2S1 can metabolize its immediate precursors PGG(2) and PGH(2) to 12(S)-hydroxyheptadeca-5Z,8E,10E-trienoic  (12-HHT). We found that CYP inhibition and siRNA-mediated downregulation of CYP2S1 increased macrophage phagocytosis and that the latter effect correlated with decreased 12-HHT formation. Although no Cyp2s1 protein was detected in aortae from wild-type mice it was expressed in aortae and macrophage foam cells from ApoE(-/-) mice. Consistent with these observations CYP2S1 was colocalised with the monocyte marker CD68 in human atherosclerotic lesions.

Treatment of these cells with human recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) resulted in an increase in phagocytosis and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated superoxide anion production at 12 h and growth retardation occurring at 24 h. Moreover, TNF induced a moderate increase of CD14 surface antigen expression, used as a phenotypic marker of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulated a rapid rise in cytosolic free Ca++ ([Ca++]i) of 308 +/- 93 nM in TNF-treated cells compared to untreated cells (33 +/- 8 nM, n = 4). The effect of TNF was dose and time dependent, evident after 12 h and maximal at 48 h. The enhanced PAF-induced [Ca++]i rise was inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist L-659,989 and EGTA, indicating receptor-dependent Ca++ influx. Furthermore, L-659,989 and PAF inhibited specific 3H-labeled PAF binding in TNF-treated, but not in untreated cells. Consistently, PAF stimulated  release only in TNF-treated cells. Preincubation of cells with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies abolished TNF-induced effects, but failed to block lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a bone resorbing mediator, has been implicated in the loosening process. Investigations have shown that macrophage phagocytosis of cement particles leads to production of bone-resorbing mediators other than PGE2. In this study, conditioned medium from macrophages exposed to crushed simplex cement particles stimulated osteoblasts to release radiolabeled  and metabolites. Incubation of osteoblasts in conditioned medium from macrophages exposed to cement particles small enough to be phagocytized increased PGE2 release 80-fold over unexposed osteoblasts (P < 0.001). Incubation of osteoblasts in conditioned medium from macrophages exposed to particles too large to be phagocytized, or to bone cement filtrate, did not stimulate PGE2 release. We propose that the role of the macrophage in aseptic loosening is primarily to recognize the mechanical failure of the cement mantle by phagocytosis of cement particles and subsequent production of small amounts of specific mediators.

Furthermore, in mast cells lacking group V secretory PLA(2), the time course of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and of cPLA(2)alpha was markedly truncated, leading to attenuation of eicosanoid generation in response to stimulation through TLR2, but not through c-kit or FcepsilonRI. These findings provide the first dissection of the mechanisms of TLR-dependent rapid eicosanoid generation, which is MyD88-dependent, requires cPLA(2)alpha, and is amplified by group V sPLA(2) through its regulation of the sequential phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 and cPLA(2)alpha. The findings support the suggestion that group V sPLA(2) regulates innate immune responses.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9479444>Structure and mechanism of lipoxygenases.</a></h2><p>In mammals, lipoxygenases catalyze the formation of hydroperoxides as the first step in the biosynthesis of several inflammatory mediators. The substrate of this reaction, , is the key precursor of two families of potent physiological effectors. It is the branch point between two central pathways: one, involving the enzyme cyclooxygenase, leads to the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes; the other, involving lipoxygenases, leads to the synthesis of leukotrienes and lipoxins, compounds that regulate important cellular responses in inflammation and . While aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds are potent inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, no effective pharmacological inhibitor of lipoxygenase is presently available. Lipoxygenases are large non-heme, iron-containing enzymes that use molecular oxygen for the diooxygenation of  to form hydroperoxides, the first step in the biosynthetic pathways leading to leukotrienes and lipoxins. Because of the importance of these compounds, lipoxygenases have been the subject of extensive study: from detailed kinetic measurements to cloning, expression, and site-directed mutagenesis. The sequences of over 50 lipoxygenases have been reported. In addition, the structure of soybean lipoxygenase-1, determined by X-ray diffraction methods, has recently been reported. The structure revealed that the 839 amino acids in the protein are organized in two domains: a beta-sheet N-terminal domain and a large, mostly helical C-terminal domain. The iron is present in the C-terminal domain facing two internal cavities that are probably the conduits through which the fatty  and molecular oxygen gain access to the metal. Models of the mammalian lipoxygenases based on the soybean structure provide clues about the structural determinants of the positional specificity of the enzyme, and can be used as targets for the design of more effective inhibitors.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11050654>Effect of fatty acids on leukocyte function.</a></h2><p>Fatty acids have various effects on immune and inflammatory responses, acting as intracellular and intercellular mediators. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the omega-3 family have overall suppressive effects, inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation, antibody and cytokine production, adhesion molecule expression, natural killer cell activity and triggering cell death. The omega-6 PUFAs have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects. The most studied of these is  that can be oxidized to eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes, all of which are potent mediators of inflammation. Nevertheless, it has been found that many of the effects of PUFA on immune and inflammatory responses are not dependent on eicosanoid generation. Fatty acids have also been found to modulate phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, cytokine production and leukocyte migration, also interfering with antigen presentation by macrophages. The importance of fatty acids in immune function has been corroborated by many clinical trials in which patients show improvement when submitted to fatty  supplementation. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain fatty  modulation of immune response, such as changes in membrane fluidity and signal transduction pathways, regulation of gene transcription, protein acylation, and calcium release. In this review, evidence is presented to support the proposition that changes in cell metabolism also play an important role in the effect of fatty acids on leukocyte functioning, as fatty acids regulate glucose and glutamine metabolism and mitochondrial depolarization.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2126984>The in vitro development of cytotoxicity in response to granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor or interferon gamma in the peripheral blood monocytes of patients with solid tumors: modulation by  metabolic inhibitors.</a></h2><p>The capacity of granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) to elicit monocyte cytotoxicity in vitro in the peripheral blood monocytes of patients with solid tumors was investigated.

In this work, we report that cells deficient in membrane ethanolamine plasmalogen demonstrate a reduced capacity to phagocytize opsonized zymosan particles. Amelioration of plasmalogen deficiency in these cells by incubation with lysoplasmalogen results in a significant augmentation of the phagocytic capacity of the cells. In parallel with these increases, restoration of plasmalogen levels in the cells also increases the number and size of lipid rafts in the membrane, reduces membrane fluidity down to levels found in cells containing normal plasmalogen levels, and improves receptor-mediated signaling. Collectively, these results suggest that membrane plasmalogen level determines characteristics of the plasma membrane such as fluidity and the formation of microdomains that are necessary for efficient signal transduction leading to optimal phagocytosis by macrophages.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3928965>Binding of iron beads to sialic  residues on macrophage membranes stimulates  metabolism.</a></h2><p>Phagocytosis of carbonyl iron beads by rat alveolar macrophages induces the production of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites of  (AA). To study the relationship between the phagocytic event and AA metabolite production, rat alveolar macrophages were pretreated with cytochalasin D, which suppresses particle internalization, but not binding to the plasma membrane. The cells were then challenged with iron particles. Binding of the particles, without internalization, was a stimulus sufficient to initiate the AA metabolic cascade; this was true for cyclo- as well as for lipoxygenase pathways. To characterize the receptor responsible for iron bead binding to membranes, macrophages were pretreated with the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin. This treatment suppressed iron bead binding, phagocytosis, and the production of AA metabolites. Succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, which binds only to N-acetylglucosamine, prevented none of these events. Wheat germ agglutinin alone had a stimulatory activity on AA metabolism which was biphasic in nature, i.e., production of cyclooxygenase metabolites first and then leukotriene B4 upon rechallenge. Succinylated wheat germ agglutinin was devoid of such an effect on AA metabolism. Thus, AA metabolite production by alveolar macrophages during phagocytosis seems to be stimulated by initial binding of particles to the plasma membrane. Membrane-bound sialic  residues appear to be instrumental in binding of carbonyl iron beads with consequent initiation of the AA metabolic cascade.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19951072>Propofol suppresses prostaglandin E(2) production in human peripheral monocytes.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandin E(2) secreted from monocytes/macrophages plays important roles in  and in inflammation.

Macrophages from BALB/c mice produced greater amounts of PGE(2) than those from any other strains of mice, including C57BL/6, after LPS stimulation. In accordance with the amount of PGE(2) produced, macrophage-derived IL-12 and T cell-derived IFN-gamma production were more strongly suppressed in BALB/c macrophages than in C57BL/6 macrophages. When macrophages were treated with indomethacin or EP4 antagonist, Th1 cytokines were more markedly increased in cells from BALB/c mice than in those from C57BL/6 mice.

Studies in human autoimmune disease have been less dramatic; however, human trials have been subject to uncontrolled dietary and genetic backgrounds, infection and other environmental influences, and basic trial designs have been inadequate. The impact of dietary fatty acids on animal autoimmune disease models appears to depend on the animal model and the type and amount of fatty acids fed. Diets low in fat, essential fatty -deficient, or high in n-3 fatty acids from fish oils increase the survival and reduce disease severity in spontaneous autoantibody-mediated disease, whilst linoleic -rich diets appear to increase disease severity. In experimentally-induced T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, essential fatty -deficient diets or diets supplemented with n-3 fatty acids appear to augment disease, whereas n-6 fatty acids prevent or reduce the severity. In contrast, in both T-cell and antibody-mediated auto-immune disease the desaturated and elongated metabolites of linoleic  are protective. Suppression of autoantibody and T lymphocyte proliferation, apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by high-dose fish oils are all likely mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids ameliorate autoimmune disease. However, these could be undesirable long-term effects of high-dose fish oil which may compromise host . The protective mechanism(s) of n-6 fatty acids in T-cell- mediated autoimmune disease are less clear, but may include dihomo-gamma-linolenic - and -sensitive immunoregulatory circuits such as Th1 responses, TGF beta 1-mediated effects and Th3-like responses. It is often claimed that n-6 fatty acids promote autoimmune and inflammatory disease based on results obtained with linoleic  only. It should be appreciated that linoleic  does not reflect the functions of dihomo-gamma-linolenic and , and that the endogenous rate of conversion of linoleic to  is slow (Hassam et al. 1975, 1977; Phylactos et al. 1994; Harbige et al. 1995). In addition to effects of dietary fatty acids on immunoregulation, inflammation as a consequence of immune activation in autoimmune disease may also be an important mechanism of action whereby dietary fatty acids modulate disease activity. In conclusion, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction pathways, production of eicosanoids and cytokines, and the action of antioxidant enzymes are all mechanisms by which dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may exert effects on the immune system and autoimmune disease. Probably the most significant of these mechanisms in relation to our current understanding of immunoregulation and inflammation would appear to be via fatty  effects on cytokines. The amount, type and balance of dietary fatty acids and associated antioxidant nutrients appear to impact on the immune system to produce immune-deviation or immunosuppressive effects, and to reduce immune-mediated inflammation which will in turn affect the susceptibility to, or severity of, autoimmune disease.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2138984>[The role of  derivatives in the system of  and its changes in aging].</a></h2><p>The most eminent accessible results ot few last decades concerning the significance of the  metabolites (AAM) for the cell function are summarized in the review.

Study of the genetic susceptibility to CRS might be a valuable strategy to understand the pathogenesis of this burdensome disorder. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the current literature regarding the genetics of CRS in a comprehensive fashion. The most promising findings from candidate gene studies include the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), as well as genes involved in antigen presentation, innate and adaptive immune responses, tissue remodeling, and  metabolism. We also review the few hypothesis-independent genetic studies of CRS (ie, linkage analysis and pooling-based genome-wide association studies). Interpretation of the current literature is limited by challenges with study design, sparse replication, few functional correlates of associated polymorphisms, and inadequate examination of linkage disequilibrium or expression quantitative trait loci for reported associations. Given the relationship of CRS to other airway disorders with well-characterized genetic components (eg, asthma), study of the genetics of CRS deserves increased attention and investment, including the organization of large, detailed, and collaborative studies to advance knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie this disorder.Copyright Â© 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

The binding of foreign organisms to phagocytic leukocytes initiates a complex signaling cascade which ultimately results in the entrapment and destruction of the pathogen. The signal transduction pathway mediating phagocytosis is the subject of intense investigation and is known to include protein tyrosine kinases, GTP-binding proteins, protein kinase C (PKC), actin polymerization and membrane movement. A rapidly expanding body of evidence suggests that phospholipases play an integral role in phagocytosis by generating essential second messengers. Here we review the data linking activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase C (PLC) phospholipase D (PLD), and phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) to antibody (IgG)-mediated phagocytosis. Evidence is presented that (1) PLA2-derived  (AA) stimulates NADPH oxidase and membrane redistribution during phagocytosis, (2) the inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) products of PLC activate NADPH oxidase and PKC, and (3) sequential activation of PLD and phosphatidic  phosphohydrolase may provide an alternative pathway for generation of DAG. Additionally, considerable evidence exists that wortmannin, a PI(3)K inhibitor, depresses phagocytosis. This finding is discussed in the context of the extensive effects PI(3)K products have on endocytosis and exocytosis and the potential role of membrane redistribution in phagocytosis. Finally, a model is presented which integrates data obtained from a variety of phagocytic systems and illustrates potential interactions that may exist between phospholipase-derived second messengers and signaling events required for phagocytosis.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1705249>Substance P increases and prolongs increased output of T4 (CD4) lymphocytes from lymph nodes of sheep in vivo: is it a mediator of immunological memory?</a></h2><p>There are receptors on lymphocytes for substance P which are found both on small recirculating and on blast lymphocytes. The principal effect of substance P on lymphocytes appears to be a stimulating one, both in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo administration of substance P to sheep by acute infusion into cannulated afferent lymphatics of peripheral lymph nodes has been found to stimulate efferent lymph flow and the output into efferent lymph of both small recirculating and blast lymphocytes. We here report that substance P both enhances and prolongs the enhancement of the output of T4 (CD4) lymphocytes from lymph nodes of sheep in vivo. This output-stimulating effect appears to be specific to T4 (CD4) lymphocytes and is associated with a depressant effect on the output of T8 (CD8) and B lymphocytes. The output-stimulating effect on small T4 (CD4) lymphocytes is quite prolonged, lasting in excess of 96 h after a single 50 micrograms acute infusion. A brief post-infusion depression in T4 (CD4) lymphocyte output is associated with an equally brief, but marked, elevation in the output into efferent lymph of the  metabolite, thromboxane B2. The output-stimulating effect of substance P on blast T lymphocytes is confined to the T4 (CD4) blast lymphocytes. Substance P or a similar molecule may be of value when a specific T4 (CD4) lymphocyte output stimulant effect is desired. A single prior (6 days) acute infusion of substance P into a popliteal lymph node via its cannulated afferent lymphatic produced profound changes in the response to nodal drainage area immunization with killed S. muenchen bacteria. The latent period prior to increased antibody production was abolished, as was the standard post-immunization 'shutdown' period of decreased output of lymphocytes into efferent lymph.

The omega-3 PUFAs, primarily docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), suppress breast carcinoma tumorigenesis and tumor cell proliferation, although the effect of DHA may be partly ascribed to increased amounts of EPA derived from DHA. Both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors suppress tumorigenesis and/or tumor proliferation, with the latter being more active. Thus, -derived eicosanoids play an important role in breast cancer, and the balance of the various eicosanoids may be a critical determinant of cell proliferation. However, the exact mechanism by which fatty acids and eicosanoid synthesis inhibitors exert stimulatory and inhibitory effects on breast carcinoma is still not well understood.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15703198>Polyunsaturated fatty acids interfere with formation of the immunological synapse.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert inhibitory effects on T cell-mediated immune responses.

In T cells treated with the PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5,n-3) and  (20:4,n-6), stimulated by superantigen-presenting cells or APCs, relocalization to the IS of distinct molecules [F-actin, talin, leukocyte functional antigen-1alpha, clusters of differentiation (CD)3epsilon] was inhibited markedly compared with cells treated with saturated fatty , whereas relocalization of protein kinase Ctheta to the IS remained unaffected. CD3-induced, sustained phosphorylation of nucleotide exchange factor Vav, which controls cytoskeletal rearrangements underlying IS formation, was significantly reduced in EPA-treated Jurkat and peripheral blood T cells. In addition, T cell raft disruption by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin treatment and experiments with a chimeric linker for activation of T cell proteins, which is resistant to PUFA effects on lipid rafts, revealed modifications of lipid rafts as a crucial factor for PUFA-mediated inhibition of APC-stimulated cytoskeletal rearrangements. Furthermore, the efficiency of T cell/APC conjugate formation was significantly reduced with EPA-treated T cells, as was stimulation of CD69 expression, which is not altered following antibody-mediated T cell activation. In conclusion, PUFA treatment of T cells qualitatively and quantitatively alters IS formation, thereby extending T cell signaling defects to pathways that are not intrinsically altered in PUFA-treated T cells when stimulated by antibodies.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9363294>n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cytokine production in health and disease.</a></h2><p>-derived eicosanoids modulate the production of pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines. Overproduction of these cytokines is associated with both septic shock and chronic inflammatory diseases. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic , which are found in fish oils, suppress the production of -derived eicosanoids and EPA is a substrate for the synthesis of an alternative family of eicosanoids. Thus, dietary fats which are rich in n-3 PUFAs have the potential to alter cytokine production. Animal studies have provided a great deal of evidence that feeding plant or fish oils rich in n-3 PUFAs does alter the ex vivo production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6 and IL-2, but many contradictory observations have been made; it is most likely that the discrepancies in the literature result from differences in the cell types and experimental protocols used. Human studies provide more consistent data: several studies have shown that supplementation of the diet of healthy volunteers results in reduced ex vivo production of IL-1, IL-6, TNF and IL-2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Similar findings have been made in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Animal studies indicate that dietary fish oil reduces the response to endotoxin and to pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in increased survival; such diets have been beneficial in some models of bacterial challenge, chronic inflammation and auto-.

These derive from distinct intracellular lipid pools. To study the source of rapid and slow DG, we have used a unique probe, protein I, a porin that is the major outer membrane protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Treatment of neutrophils with protein I inhibits exocytosis and homotypic cell adhesion provoked by FMLP without inhibiting assembly of the NADPH oxidase responsible for O2-. generation. DG turnover in PMN labeled with [3H]arachidonate and [14C]glycerol was profoundly altered by protein I. Whereas the rapid peak of DG was only modestly diminished (FMLP vs. FMLP plus protein I = DG labeled with [3H] (3H-a.a.-DG): 142 +/- 14% SEM vs. 125 +/- 22%; DG labeled with the glycerol backbone with [14C]glycerol (D-14C-G): 125 +/- 10% SEM vs. 107 +/- 8.5% SEM), the slow rise in both 3H-a.a.-DG and D-14C-G was essentially abolished.

In animals, phosphatidylcholine (PC) deficiency results in a similar phenotype. PCs surround the core of VLDL consisting of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesteryl-esters (CEs). We determined the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K on these lipids in the human liver and serum and on hepatic gene expression and studied the effect of TM6SF2 knockdown on hepatocyte handling of these lipids.Liver biopsies were taken from subjects characterized with respect to the TM6SF2 genotype, serum and liver lipidome, gene expression and histology. In vitro, after TM6SF2 knockdown in HuH-7 cells, we compared incorporation of different fatty acids into TGs, CEs, and PCs.The TM6SF2 and TM6SF2 groups had similar age, gender, BMI and HOMA-IR. Liver TGs and CEs were higher and liver PCs lower in the TM6SF2 than the TM6SF2 group (p<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were deficient in liver and serum TGs and liver PCs but hepatic free fatty acids were relatively enriched in PUFA (p<0.05). Incorporation of PUFA into TGs and PCs in TM6SF2 knockdown hepatocytes was decreased (p<0.05). Hepatic expression of TM6SF2 was decreased in variant carriers, and was co-expressed with genes regulated by PUFAs.Hepatic lipid synthesis from PUFAs is impaired and could contribute to deficiency in PCs and increased intrahepatic TG in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers.Copyright Â© 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

We assessed associations of FADS gene cluster polymorphisms and fasting serum PUFA concentrations in a fully ascertained, geographically isolated founder population of European descent. Concentrations of 22 PUFAs were determined by gas chromatography, of which ten fatty acids and five ratios defining FADS1 and FADS2 activity were tested for genetic association against 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 224 individuals. A cluster of SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium in the FADS1 gene (rs174537, rs174545, rs174546, rs174553, rs174556, rs174561, rs174568, and rs99780) were strongly associated with  (AA) (P = 5.8 x 10(-7) - 1.7 x 10(-8)) among other PUFAs, but the strongest associations were with the ratio measuring FADS1 activity in the omega-6 series (P = 2.11 x 10(-13) - 1.8 x 10(-20)). The minor allele across all SNPs was consistently associated with decreased omega-6 PUFAs, with the exception of dihomo-gamma-linoleic  (DHGLA), where the minor allele was consistently associated with increased levels.

Prostaglandin (PG) E2 is the most abundant eicosanoid in the inflammatory milieu due to the robust production elicited by pathogen-associated molecular patterns on cells of the innate immune system. The different functions and cell distribution of E prostanoid receptors explain the difficulty encountered thus far to delineate the actual role of PGE2 in the immune response. The biosynthesis of eicosanoids includes as the first step the Ca(2+)- and kinase-dependent activation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2, which releases  from membrane phospholipids, and later events depending on the transcriptional regulation of the enzymes of the cyclooxygenase routes, where PGE2 is the most relevant product. Acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner in macrophages, PGE2 induces a regulatory phenotype including the expression of interleukin (IL)-10, sphingosine kinase 1, and the tumor necrosis factor family molecule LIGHT. PGE2 also stabilizes the suppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, inhibits the release of IL-12 p70 by macrophages and dendritic cells, and may enhance the production of IL-23. PGE2 is a central component of the inflammasome-dependent induction of the eicosanoid storm that leads to massive loss of intravascular fluid, increases the mortality rate associated with coinfection by Candida ssp. and bacteria, and inhibits fungal phagocytosis. These effects have important consequences for the outcome of infections and the polarization of the immune response into the T helper cell types 2 and 17 and can be a clue to develop pharmacological tools to address infectious, autoimmune, and autoinflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19071132>Eicosanoids mediate nodulation reactions to a mollicute bacterium in larvae of the blowfly, Chrysomya megacephala.</a></h2><p>Nodulation is the temporally and quantitatively most important cellular defense response to bacterial, fungal and some viral infections in insects. We tested the hypothesis that prostaglandins and other eicosanoids are responsible for mediating nodulation reactions to bacterial infection in larvae of the blowfly Chrysomya megacephala. Third-instar larvae treated with Ureaplasma urealyticum formed nodules in a challenge dose-dependent manner. Nodulation was evoked shortly after injection and reached a maximum of approximately 25 nodules/larva within 8h. Larvae treated with the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone and the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin and piroxicam were impaired in their ability to form nodules following U. urealyticum infection. The number of nodules decreased with increasing doses of piroxicam. Contrarily, treating larvae with the lipooxygenase inhibitor, esculetin, and the dual cyclooxygenase/lipooxygenase inhibitor, phenidone did not influence nodulation reactions to infection. Supplying dexamethasone-treated larvae with the eicosanoid precursor, , reversed the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on nodulation.

Four strains of mice differing in resistance to in vivo L. donovani infection were studied. Normal macrophages from all strains converted 20:4 to prostanoids and this was augmented by L. donovani infection. Although cells from each strain synthesized elevated levels of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), there were differences with respect to relative increases of this product, with infected macrophages from the C3H/HeJ strain showing the smallest increase above basal levels. These results indicate that macrophages from mouse strains with distinct levels of in vivo resistance to L. donovani all respond to infection with augmented prostanoid synthesis. Although some heterogeneity in strain-specific PGE2 responses to in vitro infection were observed (with respect to increases in PGE2 synthesis above basal levels), it is unlikely that differential resistance of these strains to in vivo infection is strictly related to these relative differences.

This production was time-dependent, ceased after a couple of hours, and was due to interaction with immunoglobulins G (IgG) because neither immobilized antigen alone nor immunoglobulins M with or without complement-derived fragments were efficient stimuli. Cultivation of macrophages on immobilized IgG for 24 hr caused desensitization of the response to an unrelated stimulus like zymosan. Desensitization was due neither to inhibition of binding and uptake of zymosan nor to alterations of NADPH oxidase. In fact, macrophages cultivated on immobilized IgG bound and internalized zymosan and responded to PMA with production of superoxide anion normally. Desensitization was not specific for casein-elicited macrophages because both resident peritoneal and Corynebacterium parvum-activated macrophages underwent desensitization if cultivated for 24 hr on immobilized immune complexes. Desensitization on immobilized IgG was maximal after 24 hr, lasted up to 3 days in culture, and was reversed by detaching macrophages from the IgG surface and further cultivating them in normal tissue culture plastic. Scavengers of products of the oxygen metabolism such as superoxide dismutase and catalase and inhibitors of  metabolism such as indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic  did not prevent desensitization. In addition, the zymosan-stimulated release of  was suppressed after cultivation on immobilized IgG for 24 hr; also in this case, the response to PMA was conserved. Contrary to cultivation on immobilized IgG, cultivation of macrophages on fragments derived from C3 was not accompanied by desensitization of the response to zymosan. These results indicate that although the interaction of Fc receptors with their ligands does not impair binding and uptake of zymosan, alterations in the sequence of signals which leads to the activation of the oxygen metabolism can occur, causing a complete dissociation between phagocytosis and stimulation of the oxygen metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474159>Fatty  status in infancy is associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity.</a></h2><p>We investigated the association of early serum fatty  composition with the risk of type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Our hypothesis was that fatty  status during infancy is related to type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity and that long-chain n-3 fatty acids, in particular, are associated with decreased risk.We performed a nested case-control analysis within the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention Study birth cohort, carrying HLA-conferred susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (nÂ =Â 7782). Serum total fatty  composition was analysed by gas chromatography in 240 infants with islet autoimmunity and 480 control infants at the age of 3 and 6Â months. Islet autoimmunity was defined as repeated positivity for islet cell autoantibodies in combination with at least one of three selected autoantibodies. In addition, a subset of 43 infants with primary insulin autoimmunity (i.e. those with insulin autoantibodies as the first autoantibody with no concomitant other autoantibodies) and a control group (nÂ =Â 86) were analysed. A third endpoint was primary GAD autoimmunity defined as GAD autoantibody appearing as the first antibody without other concomitant autoantibodies (22 infants with GAD autoimmunity; 42 infants in control group). Conditional logistic regression was applied, considering multiple comparisons by false discovery rate <0.05.Serum fatty  composition differed between breastfed and non-breastfed infants, reflecting differences in the fatty  composition of the milk. Fatty acids were associated with islet autoimmunity (higher serum pentadecanoic, palmitic, palmitoleic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher :docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3  ratios increased risk). Furthermore, fatty acids were associated with primary insulin autoimmunity, these associations being stronger (higher palmitoleic , cis-vaccenic, , docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher Î±-linoleic  and :docosahexaenoic and n-6:n-3  ratios increased risk). Moreover, the quantity of breast milk consumed per day was inversely associated with primary insulin autoimmunity, while the quantity of cow's milk consumed per day was directly associated.Fatty  status may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity. Fish-derived fatty acids may be protective, particularly during infancy. Furthermore, fatty acids consumed during breastfeeding may provide protection against type 1 diabetes-associated autoimmunity.

Phagocytosis entails two major steps, the internalization of microbes and the subsequent killing of them via formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we posed the hypothesis that eicosanoids mediate ROS production by activating NADPH-dependent oxidase (NOX) and tested the idea in the model insect, Spodoptera exigua. A NOX gene (we named SeNOX4) was identified and cloned, yielding a full open reading frame encoding 547 amino  residues with a predicted molecular weight of 63,410Da and an isoelectric point at 9.28. A transmembrane domain and a large intracellular domain containing NADPH and FAD-binding sites were predicted. Phylogenetic analysis indicated SeNOX4 clusters with other NOX4 genes. SeNOX4 was expressed in all life stages except eggs, and exclusively in hemocytes. Bacterial challenge and, separately,  (AA, a precursor of eicosanoid biosynthesis) injection increased its expression. The internalization step was assessed by counting hemocytes engulfing fluorescence-labeled bacteria. The phagocytic behavior was inhibited by dsRNA suppression of SeNOX4 expression and, separately by dexamethasone (DEX, a specific inhibitor of eicosanoid biosynthesis) treatments. However, injecting AA to dsSeNOX4-treated larvae did not rescue the phagocytic activity. Hemocytic ROS production increased following bacterial challenge, which was sharply reduced in dsSeNOX4-treated, and separately, in DEX-treated larvae. AA partially reversed the suppressed ROS production in dsSeNOX4-treated larvae. Treating larvae with either the ROS-suppressing dsSeNOX4 construct or DEX rendered experimental larvae unable to inhibit bacterial proliferation in their hemocoels. We infer that eicosanoids mediate ROS production during phagocytosis by inducing expression of SeNOX4.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the aim of the present studies was to investigate the effect of exogenous and endogenously produced H2O2 on the phagocytic capacity and glucose release of perfused cirrhotic rat livers in comparison with that on the controls.Complete septal cirrhosis was achieved by oral treatment of rats with thioacetamide for 6 months. The phagocytic capacity of the perfused livers was measured by the uptake of colloidal carbon. During the continuous perfusion with colloidal carbon, either H2O2 or benzylamine was added to the perfusion medium for a limited time period. The latter functioned as an endogenous H2O2 donor.In control rats exogenous and endogenously produced H2O2 caused a transient stimulation of the hepatic colloidal carbon uptake as well as of the glucose release. Inhibition of the catalase by aminotriazol doubled the changes evoked by H2O2, whereas blockade of the Kupffer cells by GdCl3 drastically reduced its stimulatory effect. Cirrhotic livers took up less colloidal carbon and released lower amounts of glucose than the controls when stimulated by exogenous H2O2. The inhibition of the nitric oxide synthetase augmented the H2O2-induced effect in controls as well as in the cirrhotic livers by 250% and 620% (colloidal carbon uptake) and 340% and 760% (glucose release), respectively. The blockade of the eicosanoid production by indomethacin and caffeic  drastically increased the glucose release and the colloidal carbon uptake in controls and, in absolute terms, to a lesser extent in cirrhotic livers.

We have shown that uptake and esterification of radiolabeled , palmitic, and oleic acids by the Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii H99 wild-type strain and its PLB1 deletion mutant strain (the Deltaplb1 strain) are independent of PLB1, except under hyperosmolar stress. Similarly, PLB1 was required for metabolism of 1-palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), which is toxic to eukaryotic cell membranes, under hyperosmolar conditions. During both logarithmic and stationary phases of growth, the physiologically relevant phospholipids, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, were taken up and metabolized via PLB1. Exogenous DPPC did not enhance growth in the presence of glucose as a carbon source but could support it for at least 24 h in glucose-free medium. Detoxification of LysoPC by reacylation occurred in both the H99 wild-type and the Deltaplb1 strains in the presence of glucose, but PLB1 was required when LysoPC was the sole carbon source. This indicates that both energy-independent (via PLB1) and energy-dependent transacylation pathways are active in cryptococci. Phospholipase A(1) activity was identified by PLB1-independent degradation of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine, but the arachidonoyl LysoPC formed was not detoxified by reacylation. Using the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1, we demonstrated the PLB1-dependent incorporation of macrophage-derived  into cryptococcal lipids during cryptococcus-phagocyte interaction. This pool of arachidonate can be sequestered for eicosanoid production by the fungus and/or suppression of host phagocytic activity, thus diminishing the immune response.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21384129>"Sebocytes' makeup": novel mechanisms and concepts in the physiology of the human sebaceous glands.</a></h2><p>The pilosebaceous unit of the human skin consists of the hair follicle and the sebaceous gland. Within this "mini-organ", the sebaceous gland has been neglected by the researchers of the field for several decades. Actually, it was labeled as a reminiscence of human development ("a living fossil with a past but no future"), and was thought to solely act as a producer of sebum, a lipid-enriched oily substance which protects our skin (and hence the body) against various insults. However, due to emerging research activities of the past two decades, it has now become evident that the sebaceous gland is not only a "passive" cutaneous "relic" to establish the physico-chemical barrier function of the skin against constant environmental challenges, but it rather functions as an "active" neuro-immuno-endocrine cutaneous organ. This review summarizes recent findings of sebaceous gland research by mainly focusing on newly discovered physiological functions, novel regulatory mechanisms, key events in the pathology of the gland, and future directions in both experimental and clinical dermatology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22802958>8,9-Epoxyeicosatrienoic  inhibits antibody production of B lymphocytes in mice.</a></h2><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), synthesized from  by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases, are converted to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase.

In vertebrates, phospholipase A (PLA) releases  (AA) from phospholipids (PLs) for biosynthesis of various eicosanoids. However, little AA is found in PLs of lepidopteran insects. Spodoptera exigua, a lepidopteran insect, is known to use eicosanoids to mediate . Although AA was not detected in PLs of hemocytes and fat body (two immune tissues) of naÃ¯ve larvae, it was detected at small but significant level after bacterial infection, suggesting induction of AA biosynthesis for . Based on a mammalian AA biosynthetic pathway, this study hypothesizes that AA is synthesized from C18 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) precursor by subsequent desaturation and elongation reactions because PLs of S. exigua larvae are rich in linoleic . After inhibiting PLA activity to prevent release of free fatty acids, different PUFA precursors were injected to S. exigua larvae followed by assessment of eicosanoid-mediated cellular immune response. Ï-6 PUFAs were effective in inducing immune response whereas Î±-linolenic  (an Ï-3 PUFA) was not. Several fatty acyl desaturases (SeDESs) have been predicted from S. exigua transcriptomes. Specific inhibitors against Î5 or Î6 DESs inhibited eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) specific to Î5 or Î6 DES genes significantly suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune responses. Four very long chain fatty  elongase genes (SeEloV-Aâ¯â¼â¯SeEloV-D) were predicted. Among respective RNAi treatments of these genes, only one RNAi treatment specific to type 5 elongase (SeEloV-B) suppressed eicosanoid-mediated immune response. These results suggest that S. exigua larvae can synthesize AA from linoleic  via Î5- and Î6-desaturations by SeDESs along with chain elongation by SeEloV-B. Finally, this study showed significant fitness cost of uncontrolled AA biosynthesis. AA injection alone without bacterial challenge significantly induced both cellular and humoral immune responses. This unnecessary energy expense due to free AA resulted in reduced pupal size and decreased adult egg production. The detrimental effect of free AA explains physiological significance of little AA content in lepidopteran insects except for life-or-death situation such as pathogen infection.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While most well studied in mammals, PGs exert important actions in insects and virtually all other invertebrates. We have been researching the mechanisms of PG actions in established insect cell lines and reported earlier that two PGs, PGA(1) and PGE(1), influence gene and protein expression in HzAM1 cells. Here we report on further experiments with three 2-series PGs, PGA(2), PGE(2) and PGF(2Î±). In separate experiments we treated cells with each of the three PGs for 12 and 24h and then analyzed cell lysates by 2-D electrophoresis. Analysis of the gels by Delta2D software showed that PGA(2) influenced expression of 60 proteins while PGE(2) and PGF(2Î±) treatments led to expression changes for only a few proteins. All spots representing changes in protein expression were processed for analysis by MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Bioinformatic analysis of the resulting sequences yielded in silico identifications of all proteins. The apparent changes in some proteins were confirmed by quantitative PCR, which demonstrated that changes in protein expression were parallel to changes in mRNA expression. We assorted the proteins into functional categories, including 1/cell structure and function; 2/cell protection and ; 3/energetics and metabolism; 4/nucleotide processing; 5/protein action and processing and 6/signal transduction. These findings substantially extend our idea that one mechanism of PG actions in insect cells is the modulation of gene and protein expression.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8995361>Depletion of human monocyte 85-kDa phospholipase A2 does not alter leukotriene formation.</a></h2><p>Human monocytes possess several acylhydrolase activities and are capable of producing both prostanoids (PG) and leukotriene (LT) products upon acute stimulation with calcium ionophore, A23187 or phagocytosis of zymosan particles. The cytosolic 85-kDa phospholipase (PLA) A2 co-exists with the 14-kDa PLA2 in the human monocyte, but their respective roles in LT production are not well understood. Reduction in 85-kDa PLA2 cellular protein levels by initiation site-directed antisense (SK 7111) or exposure to the 85-kDa PLA2 inhibitor, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), prevented A23187 or zymosan-stimulated monocyte prostanoid formation. In contrast, neither treatment altered stimulated LTC4 production. This confirmed the important role of the 85-kDa PLA2 in prostanoid formation but suggests that it has less of a role in LT biosynthesis. Alternatively, treatment of monocytes with the selective, active site-directed 14-kDa PLA2 inhibitor, SB 203347, prior to stimulation had no effect on prostanoid formation at concentrations that totally inhibited LT formation. Addition of 20 microM exogenous  to monocytes exposed to SK 7111 or SB 203347 did not alter A23187-induced PGE2 or LTC4 generation, respectively, indicating that these agents had no effect on downstream -metabolizing enzymes in this setting. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the 85-kDa PLA2 may play a more significant role in the formation of PG than LT. Further, utilization of SB 203347 provides intriguing data to form the hypothesis that a non-85-kDa PLA2 sn-2 acyl hydrolase, possibly the 14-kDa PLA2, may provide substrate for LT formation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3485879>Prostaglandin E2 as an immunomodulating factor released in vitro by human glioma cells.</a></h2><p>Cultured human glioma cells were found to produce soluble factors that can modulate the in vitro proliferative response of purified T lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA).

While feeding on a diet containing high PUFA concentrations significantly reduced the likelihood of becoming infected, the infection success in the next generation increased whenever the maternal diet contained PUFAs. We suggest that this opposing effect was caused by a trade-off between reproduction and  in the second generation.Considering the direct and maternal effects of dietary PUFAs on host and parasite we propose that host - parasite interactions and thus disease dynamics under natural conditions are subject to the availability of dietary PUFAs.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22186239>Pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp.</a></h2><p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages.

We demonstrated that activation of fresh peripheral blood rat NK cells by cross-linking with the anti-NKR-P1A 3.2.3 mAb induced calcium-dependent AA release, which is due to the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), and diacylglycerol/monoacylglycerol lipase. We also documented the presence of a type II sPLA2 activity in the supernatant fluids from NKR-P1A-activated rat NK cells, suggesting that AA and lysophospholipids could be mobilized from the outside of the cell. The involvement of AA-generating enzymes in NKR-P1A-induced cytotoxic functions was also investigated. Treatment of effector cells with arachidonyl trifluoromethylketone, a cPLA2 inhibitor; p-bromophenacylbromide, a sPLA2 inhibitor; or RHC80267, a diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, led to a partial inhibition of the redirected lysis against P815 target cells as well the granule content release induced by NKR-P1A cross-linking.

In this process fatty  derivatives positively and negatively regulate DC emigration. In the present study we investigated whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a family of nuclear receptors activated by naturally occurring derivatives of , could control DC migration from the peripheral sites of Ag capture to the draining lymph nodes (DLNs). First, we show that murine epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) express PPAR gamma, but not PPAR alpha, mRNA, and protein. Using an experimental murine model of LC migration induced by TNF-alpha, we show that the highly potent PPAR gamma agonist rosiglitazone specifically impairs the departure of LCs from the epidermis. In a model of contact allergen-induced LC migration, PPAR gamma activation not only impedes LC emigration, and their subsequent accumulation as DCs in the DLNs, but also dramatically prevents the contact hypersensitivity responses after challenge. Finally, after intratracheal sensitization with an FITC-conjugated Ag, PPAR gamma activation inhibits the migration of DCs from the airway mucosa to the thoracic LNs and also profoundly reduces the priming of Ag-specific T lymphocytes in the DLNs.

Previous reports suggest that the immunodepression is caused by inhibition of the eicosanoid pathway that is known to be critically important to mediate cellular . This study focused on the inhibitory effect of X. nematophilus on PLA2 activity of Spodoptera exigua. The PLA2 activity was functionally associated with the activation cascade of prophenoloxidase (pPO). Dexamethasone (DEX), a specific PLA2 inhibitor, inhibited pPO activation completely at the higher doses of approximately 2.4 muM in vitro condition. The inhibitory effect of DEX was reversed by the addition of , the catalytic product of PLA2. By means of this in vitro PLA2 inhibitor assay system, two different PLA2 inhibitors were used to compare their inhibitory effects on the hemolymph PLA2 of S. exigua. p-Bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), a specific inhibitor of secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), significantly inhibited pPO activation, but methylarachidonyl fluorophosphates (MAFP), a specific inhibitor of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), did not show any inhibitory effect. BPB also inhibited pPO activation of the plasma, though much higher PO activation and its inhibition by BPB was found in the hemocytes.

Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that piroxicam, as well as other NSAIDs, may be useful for chemoprevention of colon cancer. While there is less information regarding NSAIDs for chemoprevention of urinary bladder malignancy, there are compelling data which suggest that this should be evaluated. A major effect of NSAIDs is inhibition of cyclooxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme for conversion of  to important signal molecules, including prostaglandins, which profoundly affect cellular functions in many tissues. The initial enzyme reaction leading to formation of prostaglandin H can be accompanied by cooxidation of xenobiotics resulting in extrahepatic and local tissue production of reactive products which are carcinogenic. The end product prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), are biological modifiers which can significantly affect cell proliferation and tumor growth. High levels of PGE2 stimulate growth of certain tumor cell lines while inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with indomethacin or piroxicam can cause suppression. The mechanisms for this effect are unclear. Studies in cultured cells exposed to indomethacin show inhibition of G1-to-S phase progression of the cell cycle and a reduction in overall DNA synthesis. It is unclear whether this effect on cell growth results from some direct action of the NSAID or a reduction in prostaglandins or indirectly from modulation of important control signals, such as calcium flux. In addition to cyclooxygenase, NSAIDs can inhibit activity of other enzymes, including phosphodiesterases and cyclic GMP-AMP protein kinases, which may be central to cancer initiation and promotion. NSAIDs can also interfere with transmembrane ion fluxes and with cell-to-cell binding. Prostaglandins can modulate a variety of immunological responses and thereby play an important role in host antitumor . For example, high levels of tissue PGE2 are frequently associated with suppression of immune surveillance and killing of malignant cells. Conversely, immune responses are generally enhanced by drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. PGE2 can act as a feedback inhibitor for cellular immune processes, such as T-cell proliferation, lymphokine production, and cytotoxicity. This effect is also seen for macrophage activity and natural killer cell toxicity. In general, either increased production of PGE2 or increased sensitivity to normal amounts of PGE2 results in depressed cellular . Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (NSAIDs) such as piroxicam which decrease PGE2 production can stimulate cellular immune function both in vitro and in vivo. A variety of tumor cell lines and human malignancies produce large quantities of prostaglandins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21121930>Genome-wide methylation profile of nasal polyps: relation to aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics.</a></h2><p>In addition to the dysregulation of  metabolism in aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA), aspirin acetylsalicylic  (ASA) exerts effects on inflammation and ; however, many of these effects are unknown.The aim of the study was to evaluate the methylation status of whole genome in blood and polyp tissues with and without aspirin hypersensitivity.Genome-wide DNA methylation levels in nasal polyps and peripheral blood cells were examined by microarray analysis using five subjects with AIA and four subjects with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA).In the nasal polyps of the patients with AIA, hypermethylation was detected at 332 loci in 296 genes, while hypomethylation was detected at 158 loci in 141 genes.

Effects of the pharmacological manipulation of  metabolism on the cytological response to inflammatory stimuli.</a></h2><p>It is generally accepted that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act by the inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis. However, this hypothesis may not apply to all NSAIDs at all doses. It has thus been proposed that, in high doses, NSAIDs counteract inflammation by the inhibition of the activity of inflammatory cells such as the neutrophil. Neutrophils are activated by a 'twin signal' which is a part of a general stimulus response coupling mechanism involving phospholipid remodelling. This 'twin signal' consists of the mobilisation of intracellular calcium and the activation of protein kinase C. NSAIDs inhibit the aggregation of neutrophils in vivo and in vitro, and show additive effects with stable prostaglandins on the inhibition of the generation of superoxide anion, a product of inflammation. Binding studies have shown that the mechanism of this effect appears to be an interference with the ligand-receptor site modulated by the G protein. Activation of the cells of the marine sponge, which are not responsive to stable prostaglandins and do not contain a cyclo-oxygenase, can be inhibited by NSAIDs. Therefore, further investigation of this interesting hypothesis should help to clarify the precise mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27276431>Reduction of Arachidonate Is Associated With Increase in B-Cell Activation Marker in Infants: A Randomized Trial.</a></h2><p>Infants who are not breast-fed benefit from formula with both docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n3) and  (ARA; C20:4n6).

Suppression, particularly of cell-mediated , occurred at dose levels previously found to be subtumorigenic in mice, as evidenced by suppressed lymphoproliferative and delayed hypersensitivity responses. In addition, benzidine exposure was found to decrease host resistance, including resistance to the growth of transplantable tumor cells and infection with Listeria. These data suggest that the development of neoplastic disease may be facilitated by the ability of benzidine to alter the immune response. The mechanism(s) responsible for immunosuppression by benzidine, however, is probably not the same as that responsible for its direct carcinogenicity. The addition of benzidine in vitro to mitogen-activated lymphocytes mimicked the suppression of lymphocyte responsiveness in vivo. In vitro studies suggested that alterations in metabolites of the /lipoxygenase pathway were responsible for the immune alterations. Benzidine and the lipoxygenase inhibitor NDGA inhibited  metabolism and the mitogen response in lymphocytes, whereas the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin was ineffective. Addition of 8brcGMP partially restored benzidine-suppressed responses, whereas  potentiated the suppression. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that alterations in lymphocyte functions may occur as a result of quantitative changes or depletion of conversion products in the arachidonate/lipoxygenase pathway induced by the addition of compounds that serve as co-oxidative substrates for hydroperoxidases, the prototype being benzidine.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9118658>Ulinastatin, a human trypsin inhibitor, inhibits endotoxin-induced thromboxane B2 production in human monocytes.</a></h2><p>Ulinastatin has an inhibitory effect on certain cytokines produced from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin)-stimulated human monocytes.

Accordingly, mice lacking COX2 were more susceptible to A. phagocytophilum, had a defect in IL-18 secretion and exhibited splenomegaly and damage to the splenic architecture. Remarkably, Salmonella-induced NLRC4 inflammasome activation was not affected by either chemical inhibition or genetic ablation of genes associated with PGE2 biosynthesis and signaling. This divergence in immune circuitry was due to reduced levels of the PGE2-EP3 receptor during Salmonella infection when compared to A. phagocytophilum.

The n-6 PUFA  (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related compounds that have important roles in inflammation and in the regulation of . Feeding fish oil results in partial replacement of AA in cell membranes by EPA. This leads to decreased production of AA-derived mediators, through several mechanisms, including decreased availability of AA, competition for cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, and decreased expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX. This alone is a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 FA. However, n-3 FA have a number of other effects that might occur downstream of altered eicosanoid production or might be independent of this effect. For example, dietary fish oil results in suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines and can modulate adhesion molecule expression. These effects occur at the level of altered gene expression. Fish oil feeding has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of some animal models of autoimmune disease and to protect against the effects of endotoxin. Clinical studies have reported that oral fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis and among some asthmatics, supporting the idea that the n-3 FA in fish oil are anti-inflammatory.

It provides a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds. Polyphenols regulate immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. They inactivate NF-ÎºB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and modulate mitogen-activated protein Kinase (MAPk) and  acids pathways. Polyphenolic compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AkT), inhibitor of kappa kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (IKK/JNK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which is a protein complex that controls protein synthesis, and JAK/STAT. They can suppress toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. Their antioxidant activity and ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute as well to their anti- properties. They inhibit certain enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species ROS production like xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase (NOX) while they upregulate other endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Px). Furthermore, they inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) leading to a reduction in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) and  antagonism. The effects of these biologically active compounds on the immune system are associated with extended health benefits for different chronic inflammatory diseases. Studies of plant extracts and compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to  such as diabetes, obesity, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23447381>Distinct modulation of human myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells by anandamide in multiple sclerosis.</a></h2><p>The immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has always been thought to be driven by chronically activated and autoreactive Th-1 and Th-17 cells.

A potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of byssinosis.</a></h2><p>One of the major host-defense functions of alveolar macrophages is the phagocytosis and clearance of inhaled particles deposited in the lower airways and alveolar spaces. Recent studies have indicated that the condensed tannins present in cotton mill dust stimulate the secretion of neutrophil chemotactic factor and  from resident rabbit alveolar macrophages and that these responses may contribute to the acute pulmonary inflammatory reaction associated with byssinosis. To characterize further the effect of tannin on macrophage function, the ability of tannin to modulate alveolar macrophage spreading and phagocytosis in vitro was examined. Tannin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of alveolar macrophage spreading with nearly complete inhibition occurring at concentrations of 12.5 micrograms/ml. This inhibitory effect of tannin was not reversed with removal of tannin. Furthermore addition of tannin to previously spread macrophages actively caused the macrophages to round up. Examination of the structure of alveolar macrophages exposed to tannin by scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed blebs on the surface of the cells and the loss of most of the cellular organelle structure, as compared to control macrophages. Tannin also modulated the ability of the alveolar macrophages to phagocytize unopsonized latex microspheres. The effect of tannin was biphasic. At the lowest concentration examined (3 micrograms/ml), tannin significantly enhanced phagocytosis of the latex microspheres. However, as the concentration was increased, phagocytosis decreased almost exponentially until at 50 micrograms/ml phagocytosis was significantly inhibited compared to control macrophages. These data indicate that tannin present in inhaled cotton mill dust could significantly decrease the ability of resident alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and thereby clear inhaled dust particles. This inhibitory effect would increase the time that particles remain exposed in the lower airway and alveolar spaces and thereby increase the time that potentially toxic compounds in the dust have to exert their biologic effect.

Previous work in our laboratory has provided experimental support for the suggestion that the entry of unsaturated fatty acids into growing, normal and neoplastic cells may be regulated by AFP. In the actual study we have examined the role of human serum albumin (HSA) as a carrier protein, when compared to AFP, on the uptake (binding and internalization) of fatty acids by resting and PHA-activated human lymphocytes. Radioiodinated human HSA and tritiated oleic and  acids were used under different experimental conditions to follow the binding of the protein and fatty acids (FA) to cells. Time-course uptake at 4 degrees C of HSA and of oleic and  acids bound to HSA (FA/HSA molar ratio = 1) by either resting or activated T-lymphocytes exhibited a steady state of binding. The amount of FA bound was much greater than the corresponding amount of HSA, suggesting that T-lymphocytes bear distinct binding sites for albumin and fatty acids. A saturable process of FA binding was observed at constant unbound FA concentration in the incubation medium when the HSA-to-FA molar ratio was fixed at 1 and the concentrations of both HSA and FA were increased simultaneously. This saturable component of binding reflects an intrinsic regulatory effect of HSA, probably operating throughout the interaction of the protein with specific cell receptors. At varying unbound FA concentrations, binding curves showed two distinct components: a non-linear portion which could indicate the presence of a saturable process operating at low concentrations of unbound, free FA, followed by a second part which increased linearly with the concentration of unbound FA. The amount of FA bound at 4 degrees C and bound and internalized at 37 degrees C by both types of cell was considerably higher in the presence than in the absence of carrier proteins. On the contrary, carrier proteins were without effect on the distribution pattern of internalized oleic or . Taken together, these observations suggest that: (i) the binding and entry of FA into cells is enhanced by the two carrier-proteins at low concentrations of free, unbound fatty acids in the vicinity of the cell surface, and (ii) fatty- uptake seems regulated by a dual-receptor mechanism involving HSA and/or AFP receptors as well as plasma-membrane FA-binding proteins.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31499202>Effect of vitamin D3 on  and antioxidant capacity of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii after transplantation: Insights from LC-MS-based metabolomics analysis.</a></h2><p>Postoperative care is a critical step of pearl culture that ultimately determines culture success.

The production of TNFÎ± was lower in C. albicans-stimulated cPLA2Î±(+/+) than cPLA2Î±(-/-) macrophages due to an autocrine effect of prostaglandins that increased cAMP to a greater extent in cPLA2Î±(+/+) than cPLA2Î±(-/-) macrophages. For global insight, differential gene expression in C. albicans-stimulated cPLA2Î±(+/+) and cPLA2Î±(-/-) macrophages (3 h) was compared by microarray. cPLA2Î±(+/+) macrophages expressed 86 genes at lower levels and 181 genes at higher levels than cPLA2Î±(-/-) macrophages (â¥2-fold, p<0.05). Several pro-inflammatory genes were expressed at lower levels (TnfÎ±, Cx3cl1, Cd40, Ccl5, Csf1, Edn1, CxCr7, Irf1, Irf4, Akna, IfnÎ³, several IFNÎ³-inducible GTPases). Genes that dampen inflammation (Socs3, Il10, Crem, Stat3, Thbd, Thbs1, Abca1) and genes involved in host defense (Gja1, Csf3, Trem1, Hdc) were expressed at higher levels in cPLA2Î±(+/+) macrophages. Representative genes expressed lower in cPLA2Î±(+/+) macrophages (TnfÎ±, Csf1) were increased by treatment with a prostacyclin receptor antagonist and protein kinase A inhibitor, whereas genes expressed at higher levels (Crem, Nr4a2, Il10, Csf3) were suppressed. The results suggest that C. albicans stimulates an autocrine loop in macrophages involving cPLA2Î±, cyclooxygenase 1-derived prostaglandins and increased cAMP that globally effects expression of genes involved in host defense and inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10380910>Protein kinase C and a calcium-independent phospholipase are required for IgG-mediated phagocytosis by Mono-Mac-6 cells.</a></h2><p>Mono-Mac-6 (MM6) human monocytes ingest IgG-opsonized particles better than other human cell lines. We compared the phagocytic signaling pathway in MM6 with human monocytes. MM6 expressed FcgammaRI at levels similar to monocytes, whereas FcRgammaII expression was approximately double. MM6 ingested IgG-opsonized erythrocytes (EIgG) in a calcium-independent manner. Incubation of MM6 with bromoenol lactone, an inhibitor of the phagocytic phospholipase (pPL), coordinately decreased phagocytosis and pPL activity. This inhibition was overcome by exogenous , suggesting that phagocytosis requires pPL activation and  release. MM6 phagocytosis was inhibited with staurosporine and activated with diacylglycerol, supporting a role for protein kinase C (PKC) in this process. The pPL activators mastoparan and melittin restored phagocytosis to PKC-inhibited cells, suggesting that pPL lies downstream from PKC. These results suggest that the MM6 signal transduction pathway for IgG-mediated phagocytosis is similar to that of monocytes (PKC-->pPL-->-->phagocytosis). The results are discussed in the context of the finding that MM6 exhibit low phagocytosis relative to monocytes and thus may represent an attractive cell line for molecular manipulation in "recovery of function" studies.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2854003>Natural host resistance and in vivo selection of malignant tumour cells.</a></h2><p>In cells transformed in vitro by different agents we have identified two discrete characteristics essential for in vivo selection by the effectors of host natural resistance. These two biochemically distinct characteristics, ie resistance to hydrogen peroxide and ability to secrete E type prostaglandin (PGE) in contact with NK cells, macrophages and neutrophils, may both be expressed either in about 100% of cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, or in less than 0.1% of cells transformed spontaneously. The expression of these characteristics provides the cells with selective advantages in vivo and determines the level of their tumorigenic activity and experimental metastasis-forming activity. These characteristics are apparently necessary, but insufficient, for spontaneous metastasizing activity. Demonstrated NK resistance of malignant cell variants is directly connected with their ability to produce PGE. The in vitro transformed cells which do not possess these qualities apparently have no ability for in vivo survival and growth.

A supply of these fatty acids in infant formula (typically following breast milk as a model with ARA > DHA) is thought to be important since endogenous synthesis is insufficient to maintain tissue levels equivalent to breast-fed infants. Intervention studies assessing the impact of DHA- and ARA-supplemented formulas have resulted in numerous positive developmental outcomes (closer to breast-fed infants) including measures of specific cognition functions, visual acuity, and immune responses. A critical analysis of outcome assessment tools reveals the essentiality of selecting appropriate, focused techniques in order to provide accurate evaluation of DHA- and ARA-supplemented formulas.

Eicosanoid biosynthesis begins with a C20 precursor,  (5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic : AA). AA is usually released from phospholipids at sn-2 position by catalytic activity of phospholipase A (PLA). Although various PLAs classified into 16 gene families (= Groups) are known in various biological systems, few PLAs are known in insects. Only two PLAs involved in intracellular calcium independent PLA (iPLA) group have been identified in lepidopteran insects with well known eicosanoid physiology. This study reports the first secretory PLA (sPLA) in lepidopteran insects. A partial open reading frame (ORF) of PLA was obtained by interrogating Spodoptera exigua transcriptome. Subsequent 3'-RACE resulted in a full ORF (Se-sPLA2A) encoding 194 amino  sequence containing signal peptide, calcium-binding domain, and catalytic site. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Se-sPLAA was clustered with other Group III sPLAs. Se-sPLAA was expressed in most larval instars except late last instar. Its expression was inducible by immune challenge and juvenile hormone analog injection. RNA interference of Se-sPLAA significantly suppressed cellular immunity and impaired larval development.

Cyclosporin A, at the same concentrations that were effective in inhibiting stimulated RNA and DNA synthesis, suppressed one of the earliest events occurring in stimulated lymphocytes, i.e., enhanced incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids into membrane phospholipids. Whereas cyclosporin A significantly inhibited the incorporation of  into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in concanavalin A-, anti-immunoglobulin-, and A 23187-stimulated cells, it proved to be ineffective in inhibiting the incorporation of arachidonate into phosphatidylinositol.

The free oxygen radicals liberated, mainly O2- and H2O2, lead to chemoluminescence, which is thus a measure of activation. Chemoluminescence also depends on  metabolism, and this depends on phospholipase A2 (PLA2). We modified monocyte activity in monkeys by injecting them i.v. with this enzyme and observed that 30 min after injection, the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood monocytes and the chemoluminescence they emitted was greater than that of controls.

There is evidence that unsaturated fatty acids, particularly AA, released from membrane phospholipids are required to activate the respiratory burst of macrophages. The data reported here indicate that peritoneal macrophages harvested 30 min after i.p. injection of PLA2 can phagocytose Candida albicans more efficiently and emit more chemoluminescence (CL) than normal cells when stimulated by zymosan. PLA2 injection also enhances the CL of peritoneal cells from mice already stimulated by immunomodulators such as trehalose dimycolate (TDM), bestatin, or oncostatic drugs such as aclacinomycin (ACM). CL is not sensitive to potassium cyanide (KCN), but is inhibited by catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA) and high doses of indomethacin (10(-3) M). In vivo PLA2 treatment stimulates the synthesis of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase derivatives of AA metabolism (PGE2, 6-keto, PGF1 alpha TXB2 and LTC4). Inhibitors of AA metabolism (NDGA, indomethacin) modulate the production of free oxidizing radicals in this experimental model, partly because of their effect on AA metabolism, as determined by the measuring immunoreactive products. However, this work indicates that the effects of these inhibitors, which have been extensively used in CL studies, should be interpreted with caution, since their specificity for AA metabolism is relative.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7520927>Functional characterization of peripheral circulating and liver recruited neutrophils in endotoxic rats.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil accumulation in tissue is a hallmark of inflammation and is associated with a variety of pathological conditions. In bacterial infection neutrophils are selectively attracted in large numbers to phagocytose and kill invading microorganisms. However, activated neutrophils can also cause injury to tissues. To investigate functional alterations in liver recruited neutrophils (PMNs), we studied the functional characteristics of circulating blood and liver sequestered PMNs in terms of host defense mechanisms, such as nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (SO) generation, beta 2 integrin expression, phagocytosis, and eicosanoid profile. Cells were isolated from rats infused with a nonlethal dose (320 micrograms/kg) of E. coli endotoxin (ET) or pyrogen-free saline for 90 min. Liver PMNs produced significantly more NO both in the absence and in the presence of an in vitro endotoxin challenge than did blood PMNs. No significant difference was observed in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated SO generation. Endotoxin infusion significantly up-regulated the expression of CD11b/c in circulating and even more so in liver PMNs. Phagocytosis was significantly enhanced by in vivo ET treatment in blood PMNs, and liver PMNs showed even greater phagocytic activity than blood PMNs or Kupffer cells. The percent distribution of prostaglandins D2 and E2 of total 14C-eicosanoids was significantly higher and that of thromboxane B2 and 5-, 12-, and 15-HETEs was significantly lower in liver than in blood PMNs. Our study demonstrates several functional differences between liver-recruited and circulating PMNs in an acute endotoxic model.

DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production in a dose-dependent manner: half-maximal inhibition was obtained by using the fatty acids at the dose of 10 micrograms/ml without significant effects on cell viability. EPA inhibited IL-2 production by PBMC of only some donors. Incubation of cells in the presence of oleic, stearic, and palmitic acids, which are not PG precursors, did not affect mitogen-induced IL-2 production. A progressive increase in incorporation of DGLA into cellular lipids was observed over a 48-h incubation period. IL-2 production was reduced also when PBMC were pretreated overnight with DGLA or AA and washed before exposure to PHA. Whereas addition of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, at the time of mitogenic stimulation led to increased IL-2 production and prevented mitogen- and fatty -induced increases in PGE release, it had no significant effect on the capacity of the fatty acids to suppress IL-2 production. Time course experiments showed that DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production even at times of minimal or no PGE release by the treated cultures. Moreover, DGLA and AA inhibited IL-2 production by the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat which, when appropriately induced, is able to release high levels of IL-2 in the absence of accessory cells and measurable PGE production. Taken together, these data indicate that essential fatty acids inhibit IL-2 production directly without conversion into their cyclo-oxygenase pathway products, and suggest that human lymphocyte function may be altered profoundly by small changes in their fatty  profile.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2433163>Substance P and immunoregulation.</a></h2><p>Peptides released from peripheral nerve endings in mammals, including the tachykinin substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), are potent mediators of smooth muscle and vascular functions.

It consisted of a nonphagocytic inflammatory response (NPIR) followed by a phagocytic inflammatory response (PIR) in the dermis and an epidermal NPIR. The dermal NPIR comprised edema, hyperemia, and hyperalgesia followed by hypoalgesia. Antiserotonin agents inhibited the hypoalgesia and part of the edema. These findings and histological observations suggested that dermal mast cells were injured by C. The hyperalgesia and part of the edema were sensitive to arachidonate cyclooxygenase inhibitors (AACOIs). It is speculated that injured mast cells metabolize  and reactive intermediates, not prostaglandins, mediate the NPIR hyperalgesia and part of the edema. The dermal PIR consisted of mobilization of neutrophils, edema, hyperalgesia, mobilization of monocytes, and proliferation of fibroblasts and vascular tissue. Selective drug actions revealed that the edema, hyperalgesia, and monocyte mobilization of the PIR depended on the mobilization of neutrophils. After the mobilization of neutrophils, AACOIs reduced edema formation and hyperalgesia.  metabolism by neutrophils is speculated to produce the mediators of phagocytic inflammatory (PI) edema and hyperalgesia. Monocyte function was associated with cessation of PI edema formation and phagocytosis of neutrophils and cellular debris. Interleukin 1 is speculated to mediate the adherence of neutrophils to injured dermal endothelium. The epidermal NPIR consisted of edema, hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis.

Kinetic analysis demonstrated that LO inhibitors blocked an early event in the activation of the lytic mechanism but did not impair conjugate formation. LO inhibitors also did not affect subsequent chromium release, indicating that their site of inhibition was the NK cell and not the TC. The lipoxygenase products 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic  (5-HPETE) and leukotriene-B4 significantly enhanced NK activity, with 5-HPETE being the more effective. Other LO products tested included 15-HPETE and the hydroxy derivatives 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) and 5-HETE. These LO metabolites were either without effect on NK-CMC or inhibitory, depending upon the concentration. Additionally, we examined the ability of 5-HPETE to circumvent the effects of LO inhibitors and found that, in the presence of NDGA, ETYA or quercetin, 5-HPETE significantly (p less than 0.001) restored lytic activity. Inhibitors of LTB4 and LTC4 synthesis, diethylcarbamazine and U-60,257 respectively, produced no inhibition of NK activity. In fact, U-60,257 significantly (p less than 0.05) enhanced NK-CMC.

Similar conditions were applied to investigate a possible involvement of a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) acting as an additional alternative pathway during human T cell activation. Our results show that  or its derivatives are released after CD2 triggering. This release is largely independent of PLC activation and is mediated by a PLA2 because: 1) phosphatidylcholine is the preferential source of [3H]arachidonate release; 2) [3H] release and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis are blocked by two inhibitors of solubilized PLA2, mepacrine, and 4-p-bromophenacylbromide; and 3) we evidenced a PLA2 activity in cell homogenates. Extracellular calcium appears to play a critical role because the effects of CD2 mAb were inhibited in a Ca2(+)-depleted medium. In contrast, protein kinase C is not implicated since PMA, a protein kinase C activator, neither stimulated  release nor modulated CD2-induced  release. Cyclic AMP which has been proved to regulate the activity of the PLC in T lymphocytes does not appear to play an important role in the regulation of PLA2 activity since PGE2 has only a minimal effect on [3H]-arachidonate release.

Since at least one of the COX enzymes is often expressed at high level in human cancers, the enzymes were ascribed a causal role in tumor etiology and progression.

In addition, by inhibiting the release of prostaglandins from the tumor and by blocking COX activity in immune effector cells, NSAIDs may also bias the function of immune cells towards a more tumoricidal phenotype.

NSAIDs are known to inhibit the metabolism of  to prostaglandins, which in turn modulate a variety of macrophage functions. Studies presented here examine the effects of tolmetin administration on peritoneal resident and post-surgical leukocyte functions, such as phagocytosis, the release of superoxide anion and tumoricidal activity. Rats, either non-surgical or following peritoneal surgery, were injected i.p. with tolmetin. At various times after treatment, the rats were sacrificed and peritoneal cells collected by lavage. The phagocytic capability of peritoneal leukocytes was transiently decreased 5-7 days after the administration of tolmetin to normal animals. However, administration of tolmetin during surgery extended the length of time that phagocytic capability was enhanced. In non-surgical controls, there was an elevation in superoxide anion release and tumoricidal activity 24 h after tolmetin administration. Superoxide anion release was suppressed at days 5 and 7 after treatment, but returned to control levels by day 14. Intraoperative administration of tolmetin significantly elevated superoxide anion release at days 3 and 5, phagocytosis at days 7 and 14 and tumoricidal activity at day 3. These studies suggest that compounds which suppress prostaglandin synthesis can modulate the function of resident and post-surgical peritoneal cells.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1312103>Bacterial lipopolysaccharide up-regulates platelet-activating factor-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization and eicosanoid release in human Mono Mac 6 cells.</a></h2><p>When human monocytic Mono Mac 6 cells were treated with bacterial LPS (10 ng/ml, 72 h), they showed an increase in phagocytic activity, superoxide anion production, and expression of monocyte/macrophage-associated cell surface Ag.

Synthesis of C3 and factor B in cord blood monocytes was unaffected by lipid A (the active moiety of LPS extracted by the Westphal procedure). In contrast, adult monocytes increased C3 synthesis by 11.5-fold and factor B synthesis by 3.1-fold in response to LPS. This difference in cord blood monocyte response to LPS was specific in that other LPS-induced monocyte functions (superoxide production and phagocytosis) were stimulated comparably in both cord blood and adult monocytes by LPS. To characterize further this regulatory difference, the roles of LPS precursors,  metabolites, and of factor(s) released by adult monocytes were examined. Precursors of the lipid portion of LPS (lipid X and lipid Y), LPS isolated by trichloroacetic  extraction, and endotoxin-associated protein (EAP) increased C3 and factor B synthesis in cord blood monocytes. Inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway (dexamethasone, ETYA) but not of the cyclooxygenase pathway (indomethacin) abrogated the response of adult monocytes to lipid A and EAP and of cord blood monocytes to EAP. Finally, co-incubation of adult monocytes and cord blood monocytes in LPS-containing medium resulted in enhancement of C3 and factor B synthesis in cord blood monocytes. These data suggest that the difference in LPS response between cord blood and adult monocytes may result from differences in lipid processing or protein recognition of LPS, differences in the production of lipoxygenase pathway products, and/or one or more regulatory factors. The availability of human mononuclear phagocytes which exhibit distinct differences in biosynthetic responsiveness to LPS should permit investigation of the molecular mechanism(s) by which LPS affects C3 and factor B gene expression.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10507617>Effect of short-term enteral feeding with eicosapentaenoic and gamma-linolenic acids on alveolar macrophage eicosanoid synthesis and bactericidal function in rats.</a></h2><p>Because vasoactive eicosanoids derived from  present in immune cell phospholipids promote lung inflammation in critically ill patients, novel experimental diets containing eicosapentaenoic  from fish oil and gamma-linolenic  from borage oil have been designed to limit  metabolism.

The periodate-treated erythrocytes exhibited a remarkable increase in rosette attachment to resident mouse peritoneal macrophages in the absence of serum. The relationship between the oxidation of the membrane constituents and the macrophage recognition of these cells was investigated. Periodate treatment of erythrocytes in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene, an inhibitor of lipid oxidation, did not affect the subsequent attachment of the erythrocytes to the macrophages. Reduction of the periodate-treated erythrocytes with borohydride or cyanoborohydride did not affect the erythrocyte attachment. Neuraminidase treatment of erythrocytes before periodate did not affect the attachment either. On reduction of the disulfides of the membrane proteins with dithiothreitol, the periodate-treated erythrocytes lost their ability to attach to the macrophages. Erythrocytes treated with an SH-oxidizing agent, diamide, were then examined for the macrophage recognition. The diamide-treated cells also showed rosette attachment to the macrophages in the absence of serum, but did not when reduced with dithiothreitol.

In these studies we analyzed the interaction of activated normal human lymphocytes and/or soluble products of lymphocyte activation on the contractile activity of isolated rat atria. The results indicate that phytohemagglutinin activated lymphocytes of the CD4 phenotype exert a positive inotropic effect on spontaneously beating atria. This effect is linked to steps of lymphocyte activation that precede cell division. Soluble factors released to the supernatant of stimulated lymphocytes can substitute for the intact cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) appears to be an important component of the active supernatants, as their activity can be reduced by monoclonal anti-IL-2 or by preincubation of the heart tissue with monoclonal anti-IL-2 receptor (anti-Tac). Highly purified IL-2 was active at 10 units/ml. In order to induce a positive inotropic effect at lower doses of natural or recombinant IL-2 (2-3 units/ml), synergic factors were required (2 x 10(-6) M , AA, or Ca ionophore A 23187). Indirect evidence indicates that IL-2 exerts its biologic effect by turning on the phosphoinositide cycle and activating protein kinase C in the heart tissue target.

The bacterium produces secondary metabolites to inhibit target insect phospholipase A (PLA) and induce immunosuppression, which is required for the pathogenicity of this bacterium-nematode complex. However, it was unclear if immunosuppressive intensity of the bacteria was correlated with their insecticidal potency. We compared six different X. nematophila strains inhibiting the immune responses of the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) to explain their virulence variations. In addition to four known strains obtained from the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection, we identified two new strains (SK1 and SK2) of X. nematophila from two different isolates of S. carpocapsae. Although all six strains were virulent, they showed significant variation in median lethal bacterial dosage (LD). The LD of most strains was 15-30â¯CFU/larva, however, the LD of the SK1 strain was more than two-fold higher against S. exigua larvae. Immunosuppressive activities of the six strains were measured by comparing hemocyte-spreading behavior and nodule formation; the SK1 strain was significantly less potent than other bacterial strains. These suppressed hemocyte behaviors were recovered by adding  (a catalytic product of PLA) into all six strains. Bacterial culture broth was fractionated with different organic solvents and the ability to inhibit immune response and PLA activity were assessed. All organic extracts had immunosuppressive activities and PLA-inhibitory activities. GC-MS analysis showed that these organic extracts possessed a total of 87 different compounds. There were variations in chemical components among the six bacterial strains. Organic extracts of SK1 strain, which exhibited the lowest virulence, contained the least number of secondary metabolites.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The hyperinflammation is characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines, -derived eicosanoids, and other inflammatory mediators, while the immunosuppression is characterized by impairment of antigen presentation and of T helper cell type-1 responses. Long-chain n-3 FA from fish oil decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids. They act both directly (by replacing  as an eicosanoid substrate and by inhibiting  metabolism) and indirectly (by altering the expression of inflammatory genes through effects on transcription factor activation). Thus, long-chain n-3 FA are potentially useful anti-inflammatory agents and may be of benefit in patients at risk of developing sepsis. As such, an emerging application of n-3 FA is in surgical or critically ill patients where they may be added to parenteral or enteral formulas. Parenteral or enteral nutrition including n-3 FA appears to preserve immune function better than standard formulas and appears to partly prevent some aspects of the inflammatory response.

The shift toward the cyclooxygenase pathway was not seen after 2 wk of dietary restriction and was reversed if PCM animals were fed the control diet for 1 wk.

Present studies investigate the influence of TLR2 ligands on leukotrienes (LT) formation in human monocytes. LTs are proinflammatory mediators derived from  (AA), which is released from membranes by phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes. Pretreatment of MM6 cells with the TLR2 ligands LTA, FSL-1, or Pam(3)CSK(4) resulted in an up to two- to threefold enhancement of ionophore-induced LT formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and to an augmentation of ionophore-induced AA release with similar kinetics. Also in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC), TLR2 activators increased LT formation. Studies with PLA(2) inhibitors indicated that the increase of AA release is a result of enhanced activity of group IV cPLA(2) in MM6 cells. TLR2 ligands elicited the time-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways, which led to phosphorylation of cPLA(2)alpha at Ser(505). Simultaneous inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways prevented the increase of cPLA(2)alpha phosphorylation and the augmentation of AA release. TLR2 ligand-induced increase of AA release was blocked by a neutralizing anti-hTLR2 antibody, indicating that TLR2 mediates augmented cPLA(2) activation and subsequent LT biosynthesis.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656045>Proresolving lipid mediators and mechanisms in the resolution of acute inflammation.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory responses, like all biological cascades, are shaped by a delicate balance between positive and negative feedback loops.

Indeed, the resolution phase of inflammation is just as actively orchestrated and carefully choreographed as its induction and inhibition. In this review, we explore the immunological consequences of omega-3-derived specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) and discuss their place within what is currently understood of the role of the -derived prostaglandins, lipoxins, and their natural C15-epimers.

We postulated that integrating pathway-based methods with GWASs of pulmonary function and airflow obstruction would identify a broader repertoire of genes and processes influencing these traits. We performed two independent GWASs of lung function and applied gene set enrichment analysis to one of the studies and validated the results using the second GWAS. We identified 131 significantly enriched gene sets associated with lung function and clustered them into larger biological modules involved in diverse processes including development, , cell signaling, proliferation and . We found that enrichment of gene sets was not driven by GWAS-significant variants or loci, but instead by those with less stringent association P-values. Next, we applied pathway enrichment analysis to a meta-analyzed GWAS of airflow obstruction. We identified several biologic modules that functionally overlapped with those associated with pulmonary function. However, differences were also noted, including enrichment of extracellular matrix (ECM) processes specifically in the airflow obstruction study. Network analysis of the ECM module implicated a candidate gene, matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP10), as a putative disease target. We used a knockout mouse model to functionally validate MMP10's role in influencing lung's susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced emphysema. By integrating pathway analysis with population-based genomics, we unraveled biologic processes underlying pulmonary function traits and identified a candidate gene for obstructive lung disease.Â© The Author 2015.

Pigs were fed HFD (~4570 kcal/pig/day) or lean (~2000 kcal/pig/day) diet for a total of 9 estrous cycles (~6 months). To determine the effect of cycle stage on cytokines and the microbiome, animals had samples collected during cycles 7 and 9 on certain days of the cycle: D1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18.

The most important properties of pathological Alzheimer's disease are the extracellular deposits of amyloid Ã¢-protein plaque aggregates along with other unknown mutated proteins, which are implicated in  and inflammation. Mast cells are found in the brain of all mammalian species and in the periphery, and their biological mediators, including cytokines/chemokines,  products and stored enzymes, play an import role in Alzheimer's disease. Cytokines/chemokines, which are generated mostly by microglia and astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease, contribute to nearly every aspect of neuroinflammation and amyloid Ã¢-protein plaque aggregates may induce in mast cells the release of a plethora of mediators, including pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, CXCL8 and CCL2-3-4. These proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are prominent mediators of neuroinflammation in brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, and their inhibition may be associated with improved recovery.

In mammalian cells, such as macrophages, these lipid-rich organelles are formed in response to host-pathogen interaction during infectious diseases and are sites for biosynthesis of  (AA)-derived inflammatory mediators (eicosanoids). Less clear are the functions of LBs in pathogenic lower eukaryotes. In this study, we demonstrated that LBs, visualized by light microscopy with different probes and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are produced in trypomastigote forms of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas' disease, after both host interaction and exogenous AA stimulation. Quantitative TEM revealed that LBs from amastigotes, the intracellular forms of the parasite, growing in vivo have increased size and electron-density compared to LBs from amastigotes living in vitro. AA-stimulated trypomastigotes released high amounts of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and showed PGE2 synthase expression. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated increased unsaturated lipid content and AA incorporation in stimulated parasites. Moreover, both Raman and MALDI mass spectroscopy revealed increased AA content in LBs purified from AA-stimulated parasites compared to LBs from unstimulated group. By using a specific technique for eicosanoid detection, we immunolocalized PGE2 within LBs from AA-stimulated trypomastigotes. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that LBs from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are not just lipid storage inclusions but dynamic organelles, able to respond to host interaction and inflammatory events and involved in the AA metabolism. Acting as sources of PGE2, a potent immunomodulatory lipid mediator that inhibits many aspects of innate and adaptive , newly-formed parasite LBs may be implicated with the pathogen survival in its host.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1627206>Nutrition and inflammatory events: highly unsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 vs omega-6) in surgical injury.</a></h2><p>Given the poor prognosis and high cost of care for patients with acute inflammatory responses (often leading to organ failure and/or allograft rejection), immunomodulation of this hyperresponse represents an important priority for research in nutritional medicine. The primary goal of nutritional support in inflammatory disease is to provide adequate energy, particularly through use of novel lipids (to alter eicosanoid pathway toward a more regulated inflammatory state), and protein to meet endogenous requirements for tissue repair IL-1 production, and restored cellular function, thus preventing secondary infection (52). Manipulation of macrophage eicosanoid production by use of omega-3 PUFA may reduce the cellular immune response (by competing with , which produces inflammatory eicosanoids of the 2- and 4-series), whereas inclusion of MCT found in coconut oil may lower the  content of membrane phospholipids.

Prostaglandin (PG)-E(2) may be secreted by DC into the microenvironment, considerably influencing DC phenotype and function, and thus determining the fate of adaptive . Since propofol suppresses PGE(2) production in murine macrophages, the primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether propofol also suppresses PGE(2) production in DC. Assuming a positive finding of such suppression, we tested whether this also leads to alterations of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 production and DC surface marker expression, both of which can be modulated by PGE(2). In bone marrow-derived DC, propofol significantly suppressed the PGE(2) production after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) protein expression and  release were unaffected, while COX enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by propofol. The propofol-induced COX inhibition did not lead to the increased production of cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene-B(4). Endogenous COX inhibition with propofol, as well as with the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, did not affect IL-12 and IL-10 production from DC. The surface expression of I-A(b) and CD40 on DC was not changed, while that of CD86 slightly increased, with both propofol and NS-398; expression of CD80 was not affected with propofol, but increased slightly with NS-398. Finally, endogenous COX inhibition with either propofol or NS-398 did not significantly affect the ability of DC to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation. It is concluded that the intravenous anesthetic propofol suppresses COX enzyme activity in DC, with no consequences with respect to IL-12/IL-10 production and allogeneic T-cell proliferation, while minimal consequences were observed in surface molecule expression.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27784678>Oxyradical stress increases the biosynthesis of 2-arachidonoylglycerol: involvement of NADPH oxidase.</a></h2><p>NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived oxyradicals contribute to atherosclerosis by oxidizing low-density lipoproteins (LDL), leading to their phagocytosis by vascular macrophages. Endocannabinoids, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), might be an important link between oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that 2-AG biosynthesis in macrophages is enhanced following ligation of oxidized LDL by scavenger receptors via a signal transduction pathway involving Nox-derived ROS that activates diacylglycerol lipase-Î² (DAGL-Î²), the 2-AG biosynthetic enzyme. To test this idea, we challenged macrophage cell lines and murine primary macrophages with a xanthine oxidase system or with nonphysiological and physiological Nox stimulants [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and  (AA)]. Each stressor increased cellular superoxide levels and enhanced 2-AG biosynthetic activity in a Nox-dependent manner. Levels of cytosolic phospholipase A-dependent AA metabolites (eicosanoids) in primary macrophages were also dependent on Nox-mediated ROS. In addition, 2-AG levels in DAGL-Î²-overexpressing COS7 cells were attenuated by inhibitors of Nox and DAGL-Î². Furthermore, ROS induced by menadione (a redox cycling agent) or PMA could be partially attenuated by the cannabinoid 1/2 receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2). Finally, cells that overexpress Nox2 components (Phox-COS7) synthesized larger amounts of 2-AG compared with the parental COS7 cells. Together, the results suggest a positive correlation between heightened oxygen radical flux and 2-AG biosynthesis in macrophage cell lines and primary macrophages. Because of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects associated with 2-AG, the increased levels of this bioactive lipid might be an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Thus oxyradical stress may be counteracted by the enhanced endocannabinoid tone.Copyright Â© 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22904297>Specific lipid mediator signatures of human phagocytes: microparticles stimulate macrophage efferocytosis and pro-resolving mediators.</a></h2><p>Phagocytes orchestrate acute inflammation and host defense. Here we carried out lipid mediator (LM) metabololipidomics profiling distinct phagocytes: neutrophils (PMN), apoptotic PMN, and macrophages. Efferocytosis increased specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPM) biosynthesis, including Resolvin D1 (RvD1), RvD2, and RvE2, which were further elevated by PMN microparticles. Apoptotic PMN gave elevated prostaglandin E(2), lipoxin B(4) and RvE2, whereas zymosan-stimulated PMN showed predominantly leukotriene B(4) and 20-OH-leukotriene B(4), as well as lipoxin marker 5,15-diHETE. Using deuterium-labeled precursors (d(8)-, d(5)-eicosapentaenoic , and d(5)-docosahexaenoic ), we found that apoptotic PMN and microparticles contributed to SPM biosynthesis during efferocytosis. M2 macrophages produced SPM including maresin-1 (299 Â± 8 vs 45 Â± 6 pg/2.5 Ã 10(5) cells; P < .01) and lower amounts of leukotriene B(4) and prostaglandin than M1. Apoptotic PMN uptake by both macrophage subtypes led to modulation of their LM profiles. Leukotriene B(4) was down-regulated in M2 (668 Â± 81 vs 351 Â± 39 pg/2.5 Ã 10(5) cells; P < .01), whereas SPM including lipoxin A(4) (977 Â± 173 vs 675 Â± 167 pg/2.5 Ã 10(5) cells; P < .05) were increased. Conversely, uptake of apoptotic PMN by M2 macrophages reduced (â¼ 25%) overall LM. Together, these results establish LM signature profiles of human phagocytes and related subpopulations.

We investigated the potential of a common plant-pathogen system, Arabidopsis thaliana infected with the virulent bacteria Pseudomonas syringae, regarding its response towards a homeopathic treatment. A. thaliana plants were treated with homeopathic preparations before and after infection. Outcome measure was the number of P. syringae bacteria in the leaves of A. thaliana, assessed in randomized and blinded experiments. After a screening of 30 homeopathic preparations, we investigated the effect of Carbo vegetabilis 30x, Magnesium phosphoricum 30x, Nosode 30x, Biplantol (a homeopathic complex remedy), and Biplantol 30x on the infection rate in five or six independent experiments in total. The screening yielded significant effects for four out of 30 tested preparations. In the repeated experimental series, only the homeopathic complex remedy Biplantol induced a significant reduction of the infection rate (p = 0.01; effect size, d = 0.38). None of the other four repeatedly tested preparations (Carbo vegetabilis 30x, Magnesium phosphoricum 30x, Nosode 30x, Biplantol 30x) yielded significant effects in the overall evaluation. This phytopathological model yielded a small to medium effect size and thus might be of interest for homeopathic basic research after further improvement. Compared to Bion (a common SAR inducer used as positive control), the magnitude of the treatment effect of Biplantol was about 50%. Thus, homeopathic formulations might have a potential for the treatment of plant diseases after further optimization.

Immunoreactivity tests of peptides against bacterial components of Gram+ and Gram- bacteria were performed in order to demonstrate their functional recognition. All peptides strongly reacted against all bacteria, and besides the recognition of the amino-terminal region, we were able to demonstrate a second epitope site in the middle of the receptor.

However, the role of LDs in fish  remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24â¯h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and lipid catabolic (PPARÎ±, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of lipid transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500â¯Î¼M) of exogenous lipid mix (LM; oleic  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA]â¯=â¯2:1:1), and were then transferred to a lipid-free medium and incubated for 24â¯h. LD size and number increased with the increase in lipid levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1Î², which were expressed at their highest levels in 300â¯Î¼M exogenous lipid mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA,  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300â¯Î¼M), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The early effects of the two mitogens on the biosynthesis of phosphoinositides were different. DxS enhanced the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in C3H/HeJ and C3H/HePAS cells, whereas LPS did not modify the levels of these components. When mixed with DxS, LPS reduced the effects of this stimulant. Analysis of the metabolism of fatty acids gave opposite results. Incorporation of arachidonate in all phospholipids, and particularly in phosphatidic , was inhibited in the two cell types after incubation with DxS, but was enhanced in C3H/HePAS and remained unchanged in C3H/HeJ cells after incubation with LPS. This activation of acyltransferases by LPS in B lymphocytes from endotoxin-responsive mice was inhibited when DxS was added in the stimulating mixture. The outcome of these opposite biochemical effects of LPS and DxS on the mitogenic responses of B cells was also examined. Preincubation with DxS for a 15-min period blocked the mitogenic effect of LPS in C3H/HePAS cells, whereas preincubation with LPS blocked the mitogenic effect of DxS in C3H/HeJ cells.

In fluorescence-based assays, recombinant Sj-FABPc was found to bind 11-(dansylamino)undecanoic  (DAUDA), inducing a shift in peak fluorescence emission from 543 to 493 nm. A similar spectral change was observed in dansyl-amino-octanoic  (in which the dansyl fluorophore is attached at the alpha-carbon rather than the omega-carbon of DAUDA), indicating that the ligand enters entirely into the binding site. Sj-FABPc also bound the naturally fluorescent cis-parinaric , as well as oleic  and , by competition, but not all-trans-retinol. Dissociation constants were, for cis-parinaric , K(d)=2.5+/-0.1 microM (mean+/-S.E.M.) and an apparent stoichiometry consistent with one binding site per molecule of Sj-FABPc and, for oleic , K(i) approximately 80 nM. A deletion mutant from which alpha-II was absent failed to bind ligand. Sj-FABPc modelled well to known structures of the protein family; an unusually solvent-exposed Trp side chain was evident adjacent to the presumptive portal through which ligand is thought to enter and leave. Intrinsic fluorescence analyses of Sj-FABPc and of the deletion mutant (from which Trp-27 is absent) confirmed the unusual disposition of this side chain. Virtually all members of the FABP/P2/CRBP/CRABP protein family have prominent hydrophobic side chains in this position, with the exception of liver FABP and ileal FABP, which instead have charged side chains. Liver FABP is known to be distinct from other members of the protein family in that it does not seem to contact membranes to collect and deposit its ligand.

In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty  () in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A.

Experiments were also performed to study the effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin on both random lymphocyte migration and lymphocyte migration in the presence of PGE2. The responses of cloned lymphocytes to PGE2 and LTB4 were compared with those of unsensitized lymph node lymphocytes. PGE2 at 100 ng/ml significantly inhibited (p less than 0.001) the in vitro migration of helper clones of T lymphocytes, but had no effect on random migration of cytotoxic T cells or helper independent cytotoxic (HIT) cloned cells.

We examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in regulating the synthesis of PAF by stimulated monocytes. 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, which directly activate PKC, stimulated the synthesis of PAF. Sphingosine, a long-chain amine that inhibits PKC, blocked both the binding of phorbol esters to monocytes and the synthesis of PAF in response to PMA (half-maximal inhibition at 5 to 10 microM and complete inhibition at 10 to 30 microM sphingosine). Thus, the activation of PKC was necessary and sufficient for PAF synthesis in response to phorbol ester. Sphingosine also blocked PAF synthesis in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 and opsonized zymosan particles by specific inhibition of PKC. Two other PKC inhibitors, stearylamine and staurosporine, also blocked PAF synthesis following A23187 or opsonized zymosan stimulation. These experiments demonstrated that PKC activation was required for PAF synthesis in response to the calcium signal generated by A23187 or a receptor-mediated agonist, opsonized zymosan. The synthesis of PAF and leukotriene B4 were temporally coupled following cell stimulation. Further, production of these two lipid mediators, and the release of , were inhibited in parallel by sphingosine. Thus, PKC regulate the synthesis of both PAF and leukotriene B4 at a common step, probably phospholipase A2.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149823>Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: Effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is a condition which contributes to a range of human diseases. It involves a multitude of cell types, chemical mediators, and interactions. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) are omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. These fatty acids are able to partly inhibit a number of aspects of inflammation including leukocyte chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte-endothelial adhesive interactions, production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the n-6 fatty  , production of inflammatory cytokines, and T-helper 1 lymphocyte reactivity. In addition, EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that often have lower biological potency than those produced from  and EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving mediators called resolvins, protectins and maresins. Mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of marine n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane phospholipid fatty  composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so reducing expression of inflammatory genes, activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ and binding to the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. These mechanisms are interlinked, although the full extent of this is not yet elucidated. Animal experiments demonstrate benefit from marine n-3 fatty acids in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma. Clinical trials of fish oil in RA demonstrate benefit, but clinical trials of fish oil in IBD and asthma are inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy.

Macrophages engulf immunoglobulin G (IgG)-opsonized particles through the action of the receptors for the Fc of IgG (FcÎ³Rs). Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is a classical lipid chemoattractant derived from . Leukotriene B(4) receptor 1 (BLT1), a high affinity LTB(4) receptor, is expressed in a variety of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Although LTB(4) has been shown to enhance macrophage phagocytosis, few studies have investigated the intracellular mechanisms involved in this in detail. Furthermore, there have been no reports of the direct cross-talk between LTB(4)-BLT1 and IgG-FcÎ³Rs signaling. Here, we show that FcÎ³Rs-dependent phagocytosis was attenuated in BLT1-deficient macrophages as compared with wild-type (WT) cells. Moreover, cross-talk between LTB(4)-BLT1 and IgG-FcÎ³Rs signaling was identified at the level of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and Rac, downstream of Syk. In addition, the trimeric G(i) protein (G(i)) was found to be essential for BLT1-dependent phagocytosis. Surprisingly, we found that LTB(4)-BLT1 signaling restores phagocytosis in the absence of FcÎ³Rs signaling.

The lipid-laden cells were compared to control cells for secretory functions of macrophages that could be important in the atherosclerotic artery.

Coincident with a maximum phagocytic uptake of 56% by 12 hours, there was secretion of a significant amount of neutral protease (1.37 +/- 0.2 mg [3H]-casein degraded/10(6) cells, P = 0.05). In contrast to these delayed effects, coincubation of PMO with S. epidermidis resulted in a significant increase in both LTB4 and LTC4 synthesis above that of controls, with 6.33 +/- 1.20 ng LTB4/10(6) cells (P less than 0.01) and 2.06 +/- 0.68 ng LTC4/10(6) cells (P = 0.014) being generated by three hours. The generation of these lipoxygenase products was both time and dose dependent, and the rapid production and release of the potently chemotactic LTB4 is consistent with the observed clinical response, where a rapid influx of PMN into the peritoneal cavity occurs during episodes of peritonitis, while the generation of LTC4 may contribute to the hyperemia and interstitial edema. In contrast, although there was a time dependent rise in cyclooxygenase product generation by unstimulated cells, a dose dependent inhibition of synthesis was clearly demonstrated when cells were incubated with bacteria, with a mean 40% reduction in generation of PGE2 and a mean 34% reduction in TXB2 generation (P = 0.01 and P less than 0.025, respectively). It was demonstrated that the inhibition was not due to lack of available substrate and that the generation of eicosanoids was unrelated to phagocytosis, bacterial/PMO contact or bacterial surface characteristics.

There is a strong comorbidity between major depression and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The present study has been carried out in order to examine PUFA levels in CFS. In twenty-two CFS patients and 12 normal controls we measured serum PUFA levels using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We found that CFS was accompanied by increased levels of omega6 PUFAs, i.e. linoleic  and  (AA), and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), i.e. oleic . The EPA/AA and total omega3/omega6 ratios were significantly lower in CFS patients than in normal controls. The omega3/omega6 ratio was significantly and negatively correlated to the severity of illness and some items of the FibroFatigue scale, i.e. aches and pain, fatigue and failing memory. The severity of illness was significantly and positively correlated to linoleic and , oleic , omega9 fatty acids and one of the saturated fatty acids, i.e. palmitic . In CFS subjects, we found significant positive correlations between the omega3/omega6 ratio and lowered serum zinc levels and the lowered mitogen-stimulated CD69 expression on CD3+, CD3+ CD4+, and CD3+ CD8+ T cells, which indicate defects in early T cell activation. The results of this study show that a decreased availability of omega3 PUFAs plays a role in the pathophysiology of CFS and is related to the immune pathophysiology of CFS. The results suggest that patients with CFS should respond favourably to treatment with--amongst other things--omega3 PUFAs, such as EPA and DHA.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27826011>Roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, and persistent inflammation in circulatory and renal tissues is an important pathophysiological basis for DN. The essence of the microinflammatory state is the innate immune response, which is central to the occurrence and development of DN. Members of the inflammasome family, including both "receptors" and "regulators", are key to the inflammatory immune response. Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and other inflammasome components are able to detect endogenous danger signals, resulting in activation of caspase-1 as well as interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-18 and other cytokines; these events stimulate the inflammatory cascade reaction, which is crucial for DN. Hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which then mediates the occurrence and development of DN through the K channel model, the lysosomal damage model and the active oxygen cluster model. In this review, we survey the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in various signalling pathways and highlight different aspects of their influence on DN. We also explore the important effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome on kidney function and structural changes that occur during DN development and progression. It is becoming more evident that NLRP3 inflammasome targeting has therapeutic potential for the treatment of DN.Copyright Â© 2016.

It has been implicated to play a protective role in a variety of inflammatory mediated diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, neural damage, and myocardial infarctions. Here we show that 15d-PGJ2 also plays a role in Salmonella infection. Salmonella enterica Typhimurium is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen that is able to survive and replicate inside phagocytic immune cells, allowing for bacterial dissemination to systemic sites. Salmonella species cause a wide range of morbidity and mortality due to gastroenteritis and typhoid fever. Previously we have shown that in mouse models of typhoid fever, Salmonella infection causes a major perturbation in the prostaglandin pathway. Specifically, we saw that 15d-PGJ2 production was significantly increased in both liver and feces. In this work we show that 15d-PGJ2 production is also significantly increased in macrophages infected with Salmonella. Furthermore, we show that the addition of 15d-PGJ2 to Salmonella infected RAW264.7, J774, and bone marrow derived macrophages is sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial colonization. We also show evidence that 15d-PGJ2 is reducing bacterial uptake by macrophages. 15d-PGJ2 reduces the inflammatory response of these infected macrophages, as evidenced by a reduction in the production of cytokines and reactive nitrogen species. The inflammatory response of the macrophage is important for full Salmonella virulence, as it can give the bacteria cues for virulence. The reduction in bacterial colonization is independent of the expression of Salmonella virulence genes SPI1 and SPI2, and is independent of the 15d-PGJ2 ligand PPAR-Î³. 15d-PGJ2 also causes an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in infected macrophages. In conclusion, we show here that 15d-PGJ2 mediates the outcome of bacterial infection, a previously unidentified role for this prostaglandin.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569626>Combination of physical activity, nutrition, or other metabolic factors and vaccine response.</a></h2><p>A number of lifestyle factors that reduce cancer risk in the primary prevention setting may be potential new targets for use in combination with cancer vaccines.

As an active innate immune reaction to challenge, inflammation gives rise to clinical cardinal signs: rubor, calor, dolor, tumor and functio laesa. Termination of acute inflammation was previously recognized as a passive process; a natural decay of pro-inflammatory signals. We now understand that the natural resolution of inflammation involves well-integrated, active, biochemical programs that return tissues to homeostasis. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the role of endogenous lipid mediators that modulate cellular fate and inflammation. Biosynthesis of eicosanoids and other lipids in exudates coincides with changes in the types of inflammatory cells. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by an active class switch in lipid mediators, such as classic prostaglandins and leukotrienes, to the production of proresolution mediators. Endogenous pro-resolving lipid mediators, including -derived lipoxins, aspirin-triggered lipoxins, Ï3-eicosapentaenoic -derived resolvins of the E-series, docosahexaenoic -derived resolvins of the D-series, protectins and maresins, are biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. Depending on the type of injury and the type of tissue, the initial cells that respond are polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes/macrophages, epithelial cells or endothelial cells. The selective interaction of specific lipid mediators with G protein-coupled receptors expressed on innate immune cells (e.g. G protein-coupled receptor 32, lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor2, chemokine-like receptor 1, leukotriene B4 receptor type 1 and cabannoid receptor 2) induces cessation of leukocyte infiltration; vascular permeability/edema returns to normal with polymorphonuclear neutrophil death (mostly via apoptosis), the nonphlogistic infiltration of monocyte/macrophages and the removal (by macrophages) of apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils, foreign agents (bacteria) and necrotic debris from the site. While an acute inflammatory response that is resolved in a timely manner prevents tissue injury, inadequate resolution and failure to return tissue to homeostasis results in neutrophil-mediated destruction and chronic inflammation. A better understanding of the complex mechanisms of lipid agonist mediators, cell targets and actions allows us to exploit and develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat human inflammatory diseases, including periodontal diseases.Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
