Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's , the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic  enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and .We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids, lithocholic and . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's .These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's , along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate .

The main therapies include bile  sequestrants, such as colestyramine and colesevelam, which may be given in combination with the opioid receptor agonist loperamide. Some patients are refractory to conventional treatments. We report the use of the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  in a patient with refractory bile  diarrhea and subsequent intestinal failure. A 32-year-old woman with quiescent colonic Crohn's  and a normal terminal ileum had been diagnosed with severe bile  malabsorption and complained of watery diarrhea and fatigue. The diarrhea resulted in hypokalemia and sodium depletion that made her dependent on twice weekly intravenous fluid and electrolyte infusions. Conventional therapies with colestyramine, colesevelam, and loperamide had no effect. Second-line antisecretory therapies with pantoprazole, liraglutide, and octreotide also failed. Third-line treatment with obeticholic  reduced the number of stools from an average of 13 to an average of 7 per 24 h and improved the patient's quality of life. The fluid and electrolyte balances normalized. The effect was sustained during follow-up for 6 mo with treatment at a daily dosage of 25 mg. The diarrhea worsened shortly after cessation of obeticholic .

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human  is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly ). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to  (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular . Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic , p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic , indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS.

This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P = .002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P = .049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3 months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P = 0.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE.

Given that liver transplantation (LT) is the only treatment that offers a survival benefit in PSC patients with hepatic dysfunction, management decisions in IBD patients' post-LT for PSC are frequently encountered. One such consideration is the risk of CRC in this immunosuppressed cohort. With most studies showing an increased risk of CRC post-LT in these IBD patients, a closer look at the associated risk factors of CRC and the adopted surveillance strategies in this subset of patients is warranted. Low-dose ursodeoxycholic  has shown a potential chemopreventive effect in PSC-IBD patients pre-LT; however, a favorable effect remains to be seen in post-LT group. Also, further studies are necessary to assess the benefit of 5 aminosalicylate therapy.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis, rarely occurs in UC. We present two PBC cases of 67 and 71 years who suffered from long-standing UC.

The patients started ursodeoxycholic  (13 mg/kg/day) with complete response. During follow-up, both patients remained asymptomatic with normal blood biochemistry. Although PSC is the most common hepatobiliary manifestation among patients with UC, physicians must keep also PBC in mind in those with unexplained cholestasis and repeatedly normal MRCP.

Rats were administered DCA for three days intracolonically and then treated daily with CPM (40 and 100 mg/kg) or gabapentin (70 mg/kg) (positive control) by oral gavage for 17 days.

DCA induced changes in the colonic immune response characterized by increased expression of the cytokine  and the inducible enzyme , which was reduced by the treatments. DCA also decreased the gut expression of the mucins  and , which was normalized by CPM, whereas gabapentin only increased significantly . Moreover, DCA increased the expression of , which was decreased to basal levels by all the treatments. However, the serotonin receptor , which was also elevated, was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating no effect through this signalling pathway. In conclusion, CPM ameliorated the visceral hypersensitivity and the referred pain caused by DCA, being as effective as the control drug.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a naturally occurring bile  with anti- actions, has been proposed as a potential new therapy for IBD. However, its effects on monocyte function are not yet known. Primary monocytes from healthy volunteers or cultured U937 monocytes were treated with either the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα (5 ng/ml) or the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml) for 24 h, in the absence or presence of UDCA (25-100 μM). IL-8 release into the supernatant was measured by ELISA. mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR and changes in cell signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting. Toxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. UDCA treatment significantly attenuated TNFα-, but not LPS-driven, release of IL-8 from both primary and cultured monocytes. UDCA inhibition of TNFα-driven responses was associated with reduced IL-8 mRNA expression. Both TNFα and LPS stimulated NFκB activation in monocytes, while IL-8 release in response to both cytokines was attenuated by an NFκB inhibitor, BMS-345541. Interestingly, UDCA inhibited TNFα-, but not LPS-stimulated, NFκB activation. Finally, TNFα, but not LPS, induced phosphorylation of TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF2), while UDCA cotreatment attenuated this response. We conclude that UDCA specifically inhibits TNFα-induced IL-8 release from monocytes by inhibiting TRAF2 activation. Since such actions would serve to dampen mucosal immune responses in vivo, our data support the therapeutic potential of UDCA for IBD.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26618920>Introduction: understanding mechanisms of the actions of rifaximin in selected gastrointestinal .</a></h2><p>Historically, the beneficial effects of the nonsystemic oral agent rifaximin on various gastrointestinal (GI) disorders have been attributed to direct antibiotic activity on gut microbiota.

As preparation, the literature was searched for publications related to rifaximin, its mechanisms of action, and its efficacy in travellers' diarrhoea, hepatic encephalopathy and other cirrhosis-related complications,  and irritable  syndrome.Gut microbiota dysbiosis and proinflammatory activities are thought to significantly contribute to  pathophysiology of these conditions. Rifaximin may resolve gut microbiota dysbiosis by promoting GI colonisation of beneficial bacterial species without drastic alterations in overall diversity. Rifaximin-induced changes in the production and metabolism of bacteria-produced agents (e.g. , lipopolysaccharides) also may help preserve normal gut microbiota. Rifaximin may suppress local and systemic  processes by preserving epithelial function (e.g. limiting bacterial translocation), modulating bacterial virulence and reducing proinflammatory cytokine production.The commonality of pathological mechanisms underlying multiple GI  and the ability of rifaximin to modulate the gut microenvironment (i.e. gut microenvironment modulator) may explain its diverse efficacy profile.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28060943>Farnesoid X Receptor Activation Attenuates Intestinal Ischemia Reperfusion Injury in Rats.</a></h2><p>The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is abundantly expressed in the ileum, where it exerts an enteroprotective role as a key regulator of intestinal innate immunity and homeostasis, as shown in pre-clinical models of .

Vehicle or OCA (INT-747, 2*30mg/kg) was administered by gavage 24h and 4h prior to IRI. The following end-points were analyzed: 7-day survival; biomarkers of enterocyte viability (L-lactate, I-FABP); histology (morphologic injury to villi/crypts and villus length); intestinal permeability (Ussing chamber); endotoxin translocation (Lipopolysaccharide assay); cytokines (IL-6, IL-1-β, TNFα, IFN-γ IL-10, IL-13); apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3); and autophagy (LC3, p62).It was found that intestinal IRI was associated with high mortality (90%); loss of intestinal integrity (structurally and functionally); increased endotoxin translocation and pro- cytokine production; and inhibition of autophagy. Conversely, OCA-pretreatment improved 7-day survival up to 50% which was associated with prevention of epithelial injury, preserved intestinal architecture and permeability.

Changes in mucosal 5-HT (serotonin) signalling occur in animal models of colitis and in humans suffering from IBD. Melatonin is co-released with 5-HT from the mucosa and has a wide variety of actions in the GI tract. Here, we examined how melatonin signalling is affected by colitis and determined how this relates to 5-HT signalling.Using electroanalytical approaches, we investigated how 5-HT release, reuptake and availability as well as melatonin availability are altered in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Studies were conducted to explore if melatonin treatment during active colitis could reduce the severity of colitis.We observed an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in melatonin availability in DSS-induced colitis. A significant reduction in 5-HT reuptake was observed in DSS-induced colitis animals. A reduction in the content of 5-HT was observed, but no difference in tryptophan levels were observed. A reduction in -stimulated 5-HT availability and a significant reduction in mechanically-stimulated 5-HT and melatonin availability were observed in DSS-induced colitis. Orally or rectally administered melatonin once colitis was established did not significantly suppress inflammation.Our data suggest that DSS-induced colitis results in a reduction in melatonin availability and an increase in 5-HT availability, due to a reduction/loss of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 enzyme, 5-HT content and 5-HT transporters. Mechanosensory release was more susceptible to inflammation when compared with chemosensory release.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214994>[CLINICAL CASE OF COMBINATION OF PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS WITH NONSPECIFIC ULCERATIVE COLITIS IN TWINS MONOZYGOTIC].</a></h2><p>The article presents discussion of basic hypotheses of pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC): genetically conditioned pathology, autoimmune pathology, result of  reaction in bile ducts, cholangiopathy. The authors presents a clinical case of monozygotic twins with association of PSC and nonspecific ulcerative colitis (NUC). The first twin had a severe course of PSC and mild course of NUC; he died due to bacterial complications of cholangitis. The second twin--patient B--had an opposite situation: severe course of NUC, while PSC was suspected only after determination of cholestasis biochemical markers. As soon as cholestasis was revealed, patients B was treated with Ursofalk and Budenofalk (2001). He received Salofalk as a remedy of basic therapy for NUC. Repeated liver biopsy (2005) showed no progression of PSC, but there were present minimal biochemical signs of cholestasis. So, it is necessary to investigate the first degree relatives of patients with PSC.

The  activity index was assessed by daily change in body weight and rectal bleed score and change in length of colon. Oxidative stress markers (reduced glutathione, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite, and catalase and myeloperoxidase enzyme activity), serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels in blood serum, and cardiac hemodynamic were performed on last day.The administration of DNBS intra-rectally in rats produced loss of body weight and bloody diarrhea with significant increase in oxidative stress markers in the colon. CDCA (10 and 20mg/kg) and NaHS (10 and 30 μmol/kg) significantly attenuated DNBS-induced UC in rats. The combination of CDCA (10mg/kg) and NaHS (10 μmol/kg) showed synergetic effect whereas; dl-propargylglycine reversed the protective effect of CDCA.The observed beneficial effects following CDCA may be due to its action through activation of CSE enzyme which leads to hydrogen sulfide generation.Copyright © 2015 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Due to our incomplete understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this , the therapeutic options are still rather limited. Bile acids play a key role in mediating cholangiocellular and hepatocellular injury in cholangiopathies such as PSC. Therefore, strategies targeting bile composition and homeostasis are valid approaches in PSC. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the paradigm therapeutic bile  and its role in medical therapy of PSC is still under debate. Promising novel bile -based therapeutic options include 24-norursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA), a side chain-shortened C23 homologue of UDCA, and bile  receptor/farnesoid X receptor agonists (e.g. obeticholic ). Other nuclear receptors such as fatty -activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, vitamin D receptor and vitamin A receptors (retinoic  receptor, retinoid X receptor) are also of potential interest and can be targeted by already available drugs. Furthermore, drugs targeting the gut-liver axis (e.g. intregrin blockers such as vedolizumab, antibiotics) appear promising, based on the close link of PSC to  and the emerging relevance of the gut microbiome for the development of PSC. Finally, fibrosis represents a valid therapeutic target for anti-fibrotic drugs (e.g. simtuzumab) in PSC as paradigm fibro-obliterative .

Management strategies to reduce recurrence after LT were classified according to grade and level of evidence.Survival rates post-LT are approximately 90% and 70% at 1 and 5 years and recurrent  occurs in a range of 10-50% of patients with AILD. Recurrent AIH is associated with elevated liver enzymes and IgG before LT, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the explants and lack of steroids after LT (Grade B). Tacrolimus use is associated with increased risk; use of ciclosporin and preventive ursodeoxycholic  with reduced risk of PBC recurrence (all Grade B). Intact colon, active ulcerative colitis and early cholestasis are associated with recurrent PSC (Grade B).Recommendations based on grade A level of evidence are lacking.

We investigated whether tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a secondary bile  with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal nuclear receptor and bile  transporter expression and assessed its therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's  (CD). Gene expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and vitamin D receptor and the bile  transporters apical sodium-dependent bile  transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2 cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of TNF mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF mice and wild-type littermates were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile  transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their downregulation. TNF mice displayed altered ileal bile  homeostasis that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and bile  transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile  homeostasis under  conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis.

The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti- and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic  responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti- efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti- actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, lithocholic , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal  responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29688473>Detection of Gut Dysbiosis due to Reduced Clostridium Subcluster XIVa Using the Fecal or Serum Bile  Profile.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis, especially a reduced Clostridium subcluster XIVa (XIVa), has been reported in several gastrointestinal .

Its pathogenesis remains largely unknown, although frequent concomitant IBD hints towards common factors underlying gut and bile duct inflammation. Considering the mounting evidence on the involvement of the intestinal microbiota in initiating and determining IBD phenotype, we investigated intestinal microbiota composition in patients with PSC.Stool samples were collected from 147 individuals (52 patients with PSC, 52 age, gender and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers, 13 UC and 30 patients with Crohn's ). An independent validation cohort of 14 PSC and 14 matched controls was recruited. 16S rDNA sequencing of faecal DNA was performed (Illumina MiSeq).The microbiota of patients with PSC was characterised by decreased microbiota diversity, and a significant overrepresentation of Enterococcus (p=3.76e-05), Fusobacterium (p=3.76e-05) and Lactobacillus (p=0.0002) genera. This dysbiosis was present in patients with PSC with and without concomitant IBD and was distinct from IBD, and independent of treatment with ursodeoxycholic . A decision tree based on abundances of these three genera allowed reliable classification in the validation cohort. In particular, one operational taxonomic unit belonging to the Enterococcus genus was associated with increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (p=0.048), a marker of  severity.We here present the first report of PSC-associated faecal dysbiosis, independent from IBD signatures, suggesting the intestinal microbiota could be a contributing factor in PSC pathogenesis.

High-level fecal  (DCA) caused by HFD contributes to the colonic  injury of IBD; however, the mechanism concerning the initiation of  response by DCA remains unclear. In this study, we sought to investigate the role and mechanism of DCA in the induction of inflammation  promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here, we, for the first time, showed that DCA dose-dependently induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and highly pro- cytokine-IL-1β production in macrophages. Mechanistically, DCA-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting cathepsin B release at least partially through sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2. Colorectal instillation of DCA significantly increased mature IL-1β level in colonic tissue and exacerbated DSS-induced colitis, while  blockage of NLRP3 inflammasome or macrophage depletion dramatically reduced the mature IL-1β production and ameliorated the aggravated  injury imposed by DCA. Thus, our findings show that high-level fecal DCA may serve as an endogenous danger signal to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and contribute to HFD-related colonic inflammation.
