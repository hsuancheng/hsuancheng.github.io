Five men and two women were seated upright for 15 min and then performed 15 min of right-legged knee extension exercise at 40, 60 and 75% of their maximal workload (WL(max)). Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA V) and blood pressure in the radial artery were recorded. The CCP was calculated by linear extrapolation from 1 min recordings of pairs of systolic and diastolic pressure and MCA V waveforms from both the right and the left MCA. In both arteries, the CCP increased (right MCA, +6.6 +/- 8.5 mmHg, P = 0.023; left MCA, +7.3 +/- 9.1 mmHg, P = 0.016) during 75% WL(max) without changes in resistance-area product, while femoral vascular resistance of the non-exercising leg decreased (from 0.32 +/- 0.07 to 0.18 +/- 0.05 mmHg min ml(1); P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in CCP between the right and left MCA (P = 0.31). These findings suggest an increase in cerebral vascular tone in both the right and the left MCA from rest to exercise despite a decrease in vascular resistance of the systemic vasculature. In addition, the increases in CCP were related to the increases in plasma noradrenaline concentrations (right, P = 0.001; left, P = 0.025) and decreases in the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (right, P = 0.008; left, P = 0.086), but not to changes in mean arterial pressure (right, P = 0.282; left, P = 0.564) or adrenaline concentrations (right, P = 0.138; left, P = 0.108). We consider that an exercise-induced increase in cerebral vascular tone serves to protect the blood-brain  from the exercise-induced hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19403604>Jugular venous overflow of noradrenaline from the brain: a neurochemical indicator of cerebrovascular sympathetic nerve activity in humans.</a></h2><p>A novel neurochemical method was applied for studying the activity of sympathetic nerves in the human cerebral vascular system. The aim was to investigate whether noradrenaline plasma kinetic measurements made with internal jugular venous sampling reflect cerebrovascular sympathetic activity. A database was assembled of fifty-six healthy subjects in whom total body noradrenaline spillover (indicative of whole body sympathetic nervous activity), brain noradrenaline spillover and brain lipophlic noradrenaline metabolite (3,4-dihydroxyphenolglycol (DHPG) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG)) overflow rates were measured. These measurements were also made following ganglion blockade (trimethaphan, n = 6), central sympathetic inhibition (clonidine, n = 4) and neuronal noradrenaline uptake blockade (desipramine, n = 13) and in a group of patients (n = 9) with pure autonomic failure (PAF). The mean brain noradrenline spillover and brain noradrenaline metabolite overflow in healthy subjects were 12.5 +/- 1.8, and 186.4 +/- 25 ng min(-1), respectively, with unilateral jugular venous sampling for both. Total body noradrenaline spillover was 605.8 ng min(-1) +/- 34.4 ng min(-1). As expected, trimethaphan infusion lowered brain noradrenaline spillover (P = 0.03), but perhaps surprisingly increased jugular overflow of brain metabolites (P = 0.01). Suppression of sympathetic nervous outflow with clonidine lowered brain noradrenaline spillover (P = 0.004), without changing brain metabolite overflow (P = 0.3). Neuronal noradrenaline uptake block with desipramine lowered the transcranial plasma extraction of tritiated noradrenaline (P = 0.001). The PAF patients had 77% lower brain noradrenaline spillover than healthy recruits (P = 0.06), indicating that in them sympathetic nerve degeneration extended to the cerebral circulation, but metabolites overflow was similar to healthy subjects (P = 0.3). The invariable discordance between noradrenline spillover and noradrenaline metabolite overflow from the brain under these different circumstances indicates that the two measures arise from different sources, i.e. noradrenaline spillover originates from the cerebral vasculature outside the blood-brain , and the noradrenaline metabolites originate primarily from brain noradrenergic neurons. We suggest that measurements of transcranial plasma noradrenaline spillover have utility as a method for assessing the sympathetic nerve activity of the cerebral vasculature.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22834013>Exploiting nutrient transporters at the blood-brain  to improve brain distribution of small molecules.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is a major physiological  for drugs that target CNS receptors or enzymes.

Choroid plexus is cited as being a "sink" for heavy metals and excess minerals, serving to minimize accumulation of these potentially toxic agents in the brain. An understanding of how low doses of contaminant metals might alter transport of other solutes in the choroid plexus is limited. Using primary cultures of epithelial cells isolated from neonatal rat choroid plexus, our objective was to characterize modulation of apical uptake of the model organic cation choline elicited by low concentrations of the contaminant metal cadmium (CdCl₂). At 50-1,000 nM, cadmium did not directly decrease or increase 30-min apical uptake of 10 μM [(3)H]choline. However, extended exposure to 250-500 nM cadmium increased [(3)H]choline uptake by as much as 75% without marked cytotoxicity. In addition, cadmium induced heat shock protein 70 and heme oxygenase-1 protein expression and markedly induced metallothionein gene expression. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine attenuated stimulation of choline uptake and induction of stress proteins. Conversely, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) enhanced stimulation of choline uptake and induction of stress proteins. Cadmium also activated ERK1/2 MAP kinase. The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 diminished ERK1/2 activation and attenuated stimulation of choline uptake. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 activation abated stimulation of choline uptake in cells exposed to cadmium with BSO. These data indicate that in the choroid plexus, exposure to low concentrations of cadmium may induce oxidative stress and consequently stimulate apical choline transport through activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22897747>Pharmacological characterization of designer cathinones in vitro.</a></h2><p>Designer β-keto amphetamines (e.g. cathinones, 'bath salts' and 'research chemicals') have become popular recreational drugs, but their pharmacology is poorly characterized.We determined the potencies of cathinones to inhibit DA, NA and 5-HT transport into transporter-transfected HEK 293 cells, DA and 5-HT efflux from monoamine-preloaded cells, and monoamine receptor binding affinity.Mephedrone, methylone, ethylone, butylone and naphyrone acted as non-selective monoamine uptake inhibitors, similar to cocaine. Mephedrone, methylone, ethylone and butylone also induced the release of 5-HT, similar to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) and other entactogens. Cathinone, methcathinone and flephedrone, similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine, acted as preferential DA and NA uptake inhibitors and induced the release of DA. Pyrovalerone and 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) were highly potent and selective DA and NA transporter inhibitors but unlike amphetamines did not evoke the release of monoamines. The non-β-keto amphetamines are trace amine-associated receptor 1 ligands, whereas the cathinones are not. All the cathinones showed high blood-brain  permeability in an in vitro model; mephedrone and MDPV exhibited particularly high permeability.Cathinones have considerable pharmacological differences that form the basis of their suggested classification into three groups. The predominant action of all cathinones on the DA transporter is probably associated with a considerable risk of addiction.© 2012 The Authors.

This work studied the mechanisms of PQ uptake and efflux in a rat's BBB cell model, the RBE4 cells. PQ is believed to enter cells using the basic or neutral amino acid or polyamine transport systems or through the choline-uptake system. In contrast, PQ efflux from cells is reported to be mediated by P-glycoprotein. Therefore, we evaluated PQ-induced cytotoxicity and the effect of some substrates/blockers of these transporters (such as arginine, L-valine, putrescine, hemicholinium-3 and GF120918) on such cytotoxicity. RBE4 cells were shown to be extremely resistant to PQ after 24 h of exposure; even at concentrations as high as 50 mM approximately 45% of the cells remained viable. Prolonging exposure until 48 h elicited significant cytotoxicity only for PQ concentrations above 5 mM. Although hemicholinium-3, a choline-uptake system inhibitor, significantly protected cells against PQ-induced toxicity, none of the effects were observed for arginine, L-valine or putrescine. Meanwhile, inhibiting the efflux pump P-glycoprotein using GF120918 significantly enhanced PQ-induced cytotoxicity. In conclusion, PQ used the choline-uptake system, instead of the transporters for the basic or neutral amino acids or for the polyamines, to enter RBE4 cells. P-glycoprotein extrudes PQ back to the extracellular medium. However, this efflux mechanism only partially explains the observed RBE4 resistance to PQ.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373638>Early therapeutic plasma exchange in septic shock: a prospective open-label nonrandomized pilot study focusing on safety, hemodynamics, vascular  , and biologic markers.</a></h2><p>Given the pathophysiological key role of the host response to an infection rather than the infection per se, an ideal therapeutic strategy would also target this response. This study was designed to demonstrate safety and feasibility of early therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in severely ill individuals with septic shock.This was a prospective single center, open-label, nonrandomized pilot study enrolling 20 patients with early septic shock (onset < 12 h) requiring high doses of norepinephrine (NE; > 0.4 μg/kg/min) out of 231 screened septic patients. Clinical and biochemical data were obtained before and after TPE. Plasma samples were taken for ex-vivo stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to analyze   (immunocytochemistry and transendothelial electrical resistance (TER)). Cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). An immediate response was defined as > 20% NE reduction from baseline to the end of TPE.TPE was well tolerated without the occurrence of any adverse events and was associated with a rapid reduction in NE (0.82 (0.61-1.17) vs. 0.56 (0.41-0.78) μg/kg/min, p = 0.002) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The observed 28-day mortality was 65%. Key proinflammatory cytokines and permeability factors (e.g., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1b, and angiopoietin-2) were significantly reduced after TPE, while the protective antipermeability factor angiopoietin-1 was not changed. Ex-vivo stimulation of HUVECs with plasma obtained before TPE induced substantial cellular hyperpermeability, which was completely abolished with plasma obtained after TPE.Inclusion of early septic shock patients with high doses of vasopressors was feasible and TPE was safe. Rapid hemodynamic improvement and favorable changes in the cytokine profile in patients with septic shock were observed. It has yet to be determined whether early TPE also improves outcomes in this patient cohort. An appropriately powered multicenter randomized controlled trial is desirable.Clinicaltrials.gov,  .

We show that intravenous (IV) injection of rats with Ad5 vectors causes a novel rapid shock reaction that involves hypotension, hemoconcentration, tissue edema, and vasocongestion, with notable pathology in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal system. We show for the first time that this reaction is dependent on platelet-activating factor (PAF), a lipid signaling molecule that is a known shock inducer. Ad upregulated PAF within 5 minutes in vivo, and antagonists of the PAF receptor were able to prevent Ad-induced shock. Ad upregulated PAF via the reticuloendothelial system (RES), because splenectomy or depletion of phagocytes blocked the ability of Ad to induce both PAF and shock. Rats were considerably more sensitive to Ad-induced shock than were mice, but PAF mediated shock in both species. Other Ad-induced innate immune responses such as cytokine induction and thrombocytopenia were not mediated by PAF. In summary, systemic IV injection of Ad stimulates the RES to upregulate PAF within a matter of minutes, which results in shock. The identification of this novel pathway suggests strategies to improve the safety of systemic gene therapy with Ad vectors.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711715>Does β2-adrenergic stimulation attenuate fluid extravasation during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass?

Cold-induced reduction in endothelial   may play a role. β(2)-adrenergic activation elevates cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which maintains endothelial  properties. In this study, we tested whether β-adrenergic stimulation could influence the increase in fluid extravasation observed during hypothermic CPB.Fourteen pigs randomly received terbutaline infusion (T-group) (n=7) or a control infusion (C-group) (n=7). All animals were given 60 min of normothermic CPB, followed by 90 min of hypothermic CPB.

Values presented as mean ± SD. Repeated measure analysis of variance was performed and a t-test used when appropriate.The commencement of normothermic CPB resulted in a 20% hemodilution, with an abrupt increase in fluid requirements during the first 10 min. FER increased from 0.18 (0.06) pre-bypass to 0.78 (0.27) ml/kg/min (T-group) (p=0.002) and from 0.16 (0.05) to 0.93 (0.26) ml/kg/min (C-group) (p<0.001) with no between-group differences.

On the assumption that the transdermal transfer rate constant (k2) would be constant (independent of formulation), the drug release rate constant from patch formulation (k1) was predicted to be almost equal to the k2 value (k1≈k2) in the brand formulation, but 2- to 4-fold higher than the k2 value (k1>k2) in the two generic formulations. Under normal conditions, there would be no marked difference in the plasma concentration profiles among the formulations. However, under conditions where transdermal transfer is increased (that is, higher k2), the plasma tulobuterol concentration was predicted to increase more rapidly, with higher C(max), and then to decrease more rapidly in the elimination phase after applying the generic formulations compared with the brand formulation. These different behaviors would be seen because the transdermal transfer of the generic formulations would be affected by k2, whereas k1 is still rate-determining for the brand formulation.

Both features can be evoked by pneumolysin (PLY), an important virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We hypothesized that platelet-activating factor (PAF) and associated downstream signaling pathways play a role in the PLY-induced development of acute lung injury.Controlled, ex vivo laboratory study.Female Balb/C mice, 8-12 wks old.Ventilated and blood-free-perfused lungs of wild-type and PAF receptor-deficient mice were challenged with recombinant PLY.Intravascular PLY, but not the pneumolysoid Pd-B (PLY with a Trp-Phe substitution at position 433), caused an impressive dose-dependent increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and increased PAF in lung homogenates, as detected by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The pressor response was reduced in lungs of PAF receptor-deficient mice and after PAF receptor blockade by BN 50730. PLY and exogenous PAF increased thromboxane B2 in lung effluate, and thromboxane receptor inhibition by BM 13505 diminished the pressor response to PLY. Differential inhibition of intracellular signaling steps suggested significant contribution of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and protein kinase C and of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway to PLY-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. Unrelated to the pulmonary arterial pressor response, microvascular leakage of PLY was diminished in lungs of PAF receptor-deficient mice as well.PAF significantly contributed to PLY-induced acute injury in murine lungs.

The transcript level of CTL1 in a conditionally immortalized rat retinal capillary endothelial cell line (TR-iBRB2) is more than 100-fold greater than that of CTL3 and CTL4, and no expression of organic cation transporter (OCT) mRNA was detected. The apparent influx permeability clearance of [(3)H]choline in the rat retina was found to be 271 microl/(min x g retina). The [(3)H]choline uptake by TR-iBRB2 cells was Na(+)-independent, potential-dependent, and concentration-dependent with Michaelis-Menten constants of 6.44 microM and 99.7 microM, and inhibited by several organic cations but not tetraethylammonium. The inhibition of CTL1 mRNA by small interfering RNA had little effect on the [(3)H]choline uptake by TR-iBRB2 cells. Rat CTL1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes exhibited an increase in the [(3)H]choline uptake by 45% compared with a control. In conclusion, our findings are consistent with Na(+)-independent choline transport being the mechanism for blood-to-retina transport of choline at the inner BRB.

This report focuses on 1) BBB penetration of bPiDDB; 2) the mechanism of permeation; and 3) comparison of bPiDDB to the cations choline and N-octylnicotinium iodide (NONI), both of which are polar, charged molecules that undergo facilitated BBB transport. The BBB permeation of [(3)H]choline, [(3)H]NONI, and [(14)C]bPiDDB was evaluated using in situ rat brain perfusion methods. Cerebrovascular permeability surface-area product (PS) values for [(3)H]choline, [(3)H]NONI, and [(14)C]bPiDDB were comparable (1.33 +/- 0.1, 1.64 +/- 0.15, and 1.3 +/- 0.3 ml/s/g, respectively). To ascertain whether penetration was saturable, unlabeled substrate was added to the perfusion fluid. Unlabeled choline (500 microM) reduced the PS of [(3)H]choline to 0.15 +/- 0.06 microl/s/g (p < 0.01). Likewise, unlabeled bPiDDB (500 microM) reduced the PS of [(14)C]bPiDDB to 0.046 +/- 0.005 microl/s/g (p < 0.01), whereas unlabeled NONI reduced the PS for [(3)H]NONI by approximately 50% to 0.73 +/- 0.31 microl/s/g. The PS of [(14)C]bPiDDB was reduced (p < 0.05) in the presence of 500 microM choline, indicating that the BBB choline transporter may be responsible for the transport of bPiDDB into brain. Saturable kinetic parameters for [(14)C]bPiDDB were similar to those for [(3)H]choline.

In agreement with the PM residency of SMS2, we show that both SM and CPE synthase activities are enhanced at the surface of SMS2-overexpressing HeLa cells. Our findings reveal an unexpected diversity in substrate specificity among SMS family members that should enable the design of specific inhibitors to target the biological role of each enzyme individually.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177788>Central and peripheral endocannabinoids and cognate acylethanolamides in humans: association with race, adiposity, and energy expenditure.</a></h2><p>Peripheral and central endocannabinoids and cognate acylethanolamides (AEs) may play important but distinct roles in regulating energy balance.We hypothesized that in humans central/peripheral endocannabinoids are differently associated with adiposity and energy expenditure and differ by race.We examined associations of arachindonoylethanolamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, palmitoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) assayed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with race, adiposity, and energy expenditure.In this monitored clinical inpatient study, CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture in 27 individuals (12 Caucasian, 11 American Indian, and four African-American). Twenty-four hour and sleep energy expenditure were measured by indirect calorimetry in a respiratory chamber.Samples were analyzed from a previous study originally designed to test a blood-brain  leptin transport deficit in human obesity.CSF (but not peripheral) 2-arachidonoylglycerol was significantly increased in American Indians compared with Caucasians (18.48 ± 6.17 vs. 10.62 ± 4.58 pmol/ml, P < 0.01). In the whole group, peripheral AEs were positively but in CSF negatively associated with adiposity. However, in multivariate models adjusted for the other peripheral and CSF AEs, peripheral arachindonoylethanolamide was the only AE significantly associated with adiposity. Interestingly, CSF OEA concentrations were positively associated with adjusted 24 hour and sleep energy expenditure (r = 0.47, P < 0.05; r = 0.42, P < 0.05), but peripheral OEA was not.These data indicate a central alteration of the endocannabinoid system in American Indians and furthermore show that AEs in both compartments play an important but distinct role in human energy balance regulation.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158531>Histamine Induces Vascular Hyperpermeability by Increasing Blood Flow and Endothelial  Disruption In Vivo.</a></h2><p>Histamine is a mediator of allergic inflammation released mainly from mast cells. Although histamine strongly increases vascular permeability, its precise mechanism under in vivo situation remains unknown. We here attempted to reveal how histamine induces vascular hyperpermeability focusing on the key regulators of vascular permeability, blood flow and endothelial . Degranulation of mast cells by antigen-stimulation or histamine treatment induced vascular hyperpermeability and tissue swelling in mouse ears. These were abolished by histamine H1 receptor antagonism. Intravital imaging showed that histamine dilated vasculature, increased blood flow, while it induced hyperpermeability in venula. Whole-mount staining showed that histamine disrupted endothelial  formation of venula indicated by changes in vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) localization at endothelial cell junction. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) by L-NAME or vasoconstriction by phenylephrine strongly inhibited the histamine-induced blood flow increase and hyperpermeability without changing the VE-cadherin localization. In vitro, measurements of trans-endothelial electrical resistance of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) showed that histamine disrupted endothelial . Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) or Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), NOS attenuated the histamine-induced  disruption.

Commonly used isotonic crystalloids are only marginally effective and contribute to fluid excess syndrome. In patients with decreased cardiovascular reserve, fluid therapy alone is not sufficient to maintain end-organ perfusion. Therefore, inotropes or vasoactive drugs are used to supplement fluid infusion. Recent animal data suggest that coinfusion of adrenergic agents modulate the distribution of fluid between the vascular and extravascular/interstitial compartments after a fluid bolus. We sought to determine if this effect would translate in humans by coadministering a β-adrenergic agonist with fluid.Nine healthy volunteers (aged 21-50 years) were randomly paired and received either a continuous isoproterenol infusion (ISO: 0.05 μg/kg per minute) or 0.9% saline (control [CON]) 30min prior to a 25 mL/kg 0.9% NaCl fluid bolus.

Here, using a wide range of biochemical and morphological approaches applied in both mouse models and cultured endothelial cells, we addressed the mechanisms of PAF-induced disruption of interendothelial junctions (IEJs) and of increased endothelial permeability. The formation of interendothelial gaps filled with filopodia and lamellipodia is the cellular event responsible for the disruption of endothelial . We observed that PAF ligation of its receptor induced the activation of the Rho GTPase Rac1. Following PAF exposure, both Rac1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 were found associated with a membrane fraction from which they co-immunoprecipitated with PAF receptor. In the same time frame with Tiam1-Rac1 translocation, the junctional proteins ZO-1 and VE-cadherin were relocated from the IEJs, and formation of numerous interendothelial gaps was recorded. Notably, the response was independent of myosin light chain phosphorylation and thus distinct from other mediators, such as histamine and thrombin. The changes in actin status are driven by the PAF-induced localized actin polymerization as a consequence of Rac1 translocation and activation. Tiam1 was required for the activation of Rac1, actin polymerization, relocation of junctional associated proteins, and disruption of IEJs. Thus, PAF-induced IEJ disruption and increased endothelial permeability requires the activation of a Tiam1-Rac1 signaling module, suggesting a novel therapeutic target against increased vascular permeability associated with inflammatory diseases.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27936185>Hedgehog Signaling Overcomes an EZH2-Dependent Epigenetic  to Promote Cholangiocyte Expansion.</a></h2><p>Developmental morphogens play an important role in coordinating the ductular reaction and portal fibrosis occurring in the setting of cholangiopathies. However, little is known about how membrane signaling events in ductular reactive cells (DRCs) are transduced into nuclear transcriptional changes to drive cholangiocyte maturation and matrix deposition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanistic links between cell signaling events and epigenetic regulators in DRCs.Using directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), isolated DRCs, and in vivo models, we examine the mechanisms whereby sonic hedgehog (Shh) overcomes an epigenetic  in biliary precursors and promotes both cholangiocyte maturation and deposition of fibronectin (FN).We demonstrate, for the first time, that Gli1 influences the differentiation state and fibrogenic capacity of iPSC-derived hepatic progenitors and isolated DRCs. We outline a novel pathway wherein Shh-mediated Gli1 binding in key cholangiocyte gene promoters overcomes an epigenetic  conferred by the polycomb protein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and initiates the transcriptional program of cholangiocyte maturation. We also define previously unknown functional Gli1 binding sites in the promoters of cytokeratin (CK)7, CK19, and FN. Our in vivo results show that EZH2 KO mice fed the choline-deficient,  supplemented (CDE) diet have an exaggerated cholangiocyte expansion associated with more robust ductular reaction and increased peri-portal fibrosis.We conclude that Shh/Gli1 signaling plays an integral role in cholangiocyte maturation in vitro by overcoming an EZH2-dependent epigenetic  and this mechanism also promotes biliary expansion in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746385>Functional expression of choline transporter like-protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>In this study, we examined the molecular and functional characterization of choline transporter in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). Choline uptake into hBMECs was a saturable process that was mediated by a Na(+)-independent, membrane potential and pH-dependent transport system. The cells have two different [(3)H]choline transport systems with Km values of 35.0 ± 4.9 μM and 54.1 ± 8.1 μM, respectively. Choline uptake was inhibited by choline, acetylcholine (ACh) and the choline analog hemicholinium-3 (HC-3). Various organic cations also interacted with the choline transport system. Choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 mRNA were highly expressed, while mRNA for high-affinity choline transporter 1 (CHT1) and organic cation transporters (OCTs) were not expressed in hBMECs. CTL1 and CTL2 proteins were localized to brain microvascular endothelial cells in human brain cortical sections. Both CTL1 and CTL2 proteins were expressed on the plasma membrane and mitochondria. CTL1 and CTL2 proteins are mainly expressed in plasma membrane and mitochondria, respectively. We conclude that choline is mainly transported via an intermediate-affinity choline transport system, CTL1 and CTL2, in hBMECs. These transporters are responsible for the uptake of extracellular choline and organic cations. CTL2 participate in choline transport mainly in mitochondria, and may be the major site for the control of choline oxidation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Both the permeation profiles across the hairless mouse skin and the release profiles from the devices were measured under well-controlled in vitro conditions. The release rate of the drug from the devices was appreciably higher than the penetration rate across the intact skin, indicating the skin-controlled delivery systems. However the deviation between the release rate and the permeation rate differs depending upon the system design. The brand patch showed the least difference between the release and permeation profiles among the brand and three generic devices examined. From the in vitro permeation profiles for both intact and stripped skins, the diffusion coefficient and the partition coefficient were evaluated on the basis of bi-layer skin model. The effect of the stratum corneum thickness was then simulated by SKIN-CAD. The simulated profile has suggested that the clinical performance for transdermal tulobuterol delivery is influenced not only by the thickness of the stratum corneum but by the device design as well. This is particularly the case for the stratum corneum, thinner than about 10 microm or damaged skin with the decreased  capacity.

It is prescribed for the treatment of severe persistent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Different methods were used to prepare (R)-(-)-salmeterol such as: mixing a sample of 4-benzyloxy-3-hydroxymethyl-ω-bromoacetophenone with sodium lauryl sulfate and the mixture was added to the microbial culture of Rhodotorula rubra, treatment of p-hydroxyacetophenone with Eschenmoser's salt and carbonate exchange resin followed by a sequence of supported reagents and scavenging agents or via Rh-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation. The enantioselective synthesis of (S)-salmeterol was achieved via asymmetric reduction of the azidoketone 4 by Pichia angusta yeast. Physical characteristics of salmeterol xinafoate were confirmed via: X-ray powder diffraction pattern, thermal analysis and UV, vibrational, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopical data. Initial improvement in asthma control may occur within 30 min following oral inhalation of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone propionate.

The apparent brain uptake clearance (CL(app,br)) was decreased as a  of the dose of donepezil, suggesting an involvement of a saturable transport process via transporter(s) in the penetration across the blood-brain  (BBB). Consistent with in vivo results, the uptake of substrates for organic cation transporters was significantly reduced by donepezil in both MBEC4 cells (i.e., a model for BBB) and HEK 293 cells expressing the transporters found in the brain, indicative of the involvement of organic cation transporters in the transport of the drug. Furthermore, donepezil transport was enhanced (p < 0.01) in HEK 293 cells expressing rOCNT1, rOCTN2, or rCHT1. The CL(app,br) was reduced up to 52.8% of the control in rats that had been pretreated with choline, while the CL(app,br) was unaffected with pretreatments with organic cations other than choline, suggesting that choline and donepezil share a common transport mechanism in the penetration across the BBB in vivo.

In the present study 7-fluoro-marsanidine is further characterised in vivo to investigate its pharmacological effects on extracellular noradrenaline (NA) levels at frontal cortex in conscious freely moving rats using the technique of in vivo brain microdialysis. Peripheral administration of 7-fluoro-marsanidine via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at the dose of 0.1mg/kg slightly, but non-significantly, decreased extracellular NA level (maximum by 17% at 20 min) in rat frontal cortex compared to basal level. At a higher dose of 1mg/kg, 7-fluoro-marsanidine reduced cortical NA level (maximum by 73% at 40 min) significantly as compared to basal level between 20 and 80 min. In addition, systemic administration of 7-fluoro-marsanidine at both the doses produced rapid onset of sedation in rats. These data suggest that 7-fluoro-marsanidine is able to cross the blood-brain  and, by acting as an α2-AR agonist, reduces extracellular NA levels in rat frontal cortex in a dose related manner.

X-band continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the disordered samples has been used to continuously monitor the full radical pair EPR spectrum during progress of the decay after temperature step reaction initiation. The decay to a diamagnetic state is complete and no paramagnetic intermediate states are detected. The decay exhibits three kinetic regimes in the measured temperature range, as follows. i), Low temperature range, 190 < or = T < or = 207 K: the decay is biexponential with constant fast (0.57 +/- 0.04) and slow (0.43 +/- 0.04) phase amplitudes. ii), Transition temperature range, 207 < T < 214 K: the amplitude of the slow phase decreases to zero with a compensatory rise in the fast phase amplitude, with increasing temperature. iii), High temperature range, T > or = 214 K: the decay is monoexponential. The observed first-order rate constants for the monoexponential (k(obs,m)) and the fast phase of the biexponential decay (k(obs,f)) adhere to the same linear relation on an lnk versus T(-1) (Arrhenius) plot. Thus, k(obs,m) and k(obs,f) correspond to the same apparent Arrhenius prefactor and activation energy (logA(app,f) (s(-1)) = 13.0, E(a,app,f) = 15.0 kcal/mol), and therefore, a common decay mechanism. We propose that k(obs,m) and k(obs,f) represent the native, forward reaction of the substrate through the radical rearrangement step. The slow phase rate constant (k(obs,s)) for 190 < or = T < or = 207 K obeys a different linear Arrhenius relation (logA(app,s) (s(-1)) = 13.9, E(a,app,s) = 16.6 kcal/mol). In the transition temperature range, k(obs,s) displays a super-Arrhenius increase with increasing temperature. The change in E(a,app,s) with temperature and the narrow range over which it occurs suggest an origin in a liquid/glass or dynamical transition. A discontinuity in the activation  for the chemical reaction is not expected in the transition temperature range. Therefore, the transition arises from a change in the properties of the protein. We propose that a protein dynamical contribution to the reaction, which is present above the transition temperature, is lost below the transition temperature, owing to an increase in the activation energy  for protein motions that are coupled to the reaction. For both the fast and slow phases of the low temperature decay, the dynamical transition in protein motions that are obligatorily coupled to the reaction of the Co(II)-substrate radical pair lies below 190 K.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494451>Reappraisal of the acute, moderate intensity exercise-catecholamines interaction effect on speed of cognition: role of the vagal/NTS afferent pathway.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26935825>Epinephrine increases contextual learning through activation of peripheral β2-adrenoceptors.</a></h2><p>Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase knockout (Pnmt-KO) mice are unable to synthesize epinephrine and display reduced contextual fear.

In addition, freezing response in Pnmt-KO mice was much lower than in WT mice. Freezing induced by epinephrine was blocked by sotalol in Pnmt-KO mice. Epinephrine and fenoterol treatment restored glycemic response in Pnmt-KO mice. Re-exposure to shock context did not induce a significant difference in freezing in Pnmt-KO mice treated with dobutamine and vehicle.Aversive memories are best retained if moderately high plasma epinephrine concentrations occur at the same moment as the aversive stimulus.

However, experimental and clinical evidence support the notion that cholinergic activity plays a key role in the pathophysiology of manganese-induced neurotoxicity. Manganese acts as a chemical stressor in cholinergic neurons in a region-specific manner causing breakdown of the cellular homeostatic mechanisms. In fact, a number of cholinergic synaptic mechanisms are putative targets for manganese activity: presynaptic choline uptake, quantal release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, postsynaptic binding of acetylcholine to receptors and its synaptic degradation by acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, manganese significantly influences astrocytic choline transport systems and astrocytic acetylcholine-binding proteins. Thus, manganese exerts its effect on the highly dynamic reciprocal relationship between astrocytes and cholinergic neurons. Cholinergic afferents are crucial in the  of locomotion, cognition, emotion and behavioral response, and therefore, it is not surprising that the anatomical selectivity of most manganese-induced cholinergic effects is compatible with the clinical correlates of manganism, which involves impairment of emotional response, decline in higher cortical functions and movement disorder. Manganism, also referred to as Parkinson's-like disorder, is initially manifested by a neuropsychiatric syndrome (locura manganica), the most frequent symptoms and signs of which are compulsive behavior, emotional lability, visual hallucinations and flight of ideas, cognitive decline and memory loss. These signs and symptoms are followed by an extrapyramidal syndrome, which shares numerous clinical and pathophysiological characteristics with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). This natural history of disease could be a clinical reflection of the preferential involvement of the cholinergic systems, initially in the septo-hippocampus and later in the basal ganglia.

Thyroid hormone plays a key role in stimulating myelination during development and also controls the expression of important genes involved in myelin repair in adults. Because endogenous thyroid hormone in excess lacks a generally useful therapeutic index, it is not used clinically for indications other than hormone replacement; however, selective thyromimetics such as sobetirome offer a therapeutic alternative. Sobetirome is the only clinical-stage thyromimetic that is known to cross the blood-brain- (BBB) and we endeavored to increase the BBB permeability of sobetirome using a prodrug strategy. Ester prodrugs of sobetirome were prepared based on literature reports of improved BBB permeability with other carboxylic acid containing drugs and BBB permeability was assessed in vivo. One sobetirome prodrug,  ester 11, was found to distribute more sobetirome to the brain compared to an equimolar peripheral dose of unmodified sobetirome. In addition to enhanced brain levels, prodrug 11 displayed lower sobetirome blood levels and a brain/serum ratio that was larger than that of unmodified sobetirome. Thus, these data indicate that an ester prodrug strategy applied to sobetirome can deliver increased concentrations of the active drug to the central nervous system (CNS), which may prove useful in the treatment of CNS disorders.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Their chemical structures were confirmed using (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, IR, and HRMS. In the biodistribution study, 10 min after intravenous administration of dexibuprofen (11.70 mg/kg) and its prodrugs (the dose of each compound was equivalent to 11.70 mg/kg of dexibuprofen) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, the dexibuprofen concentrations in the brain and plasma were measured. The C(brain)/C(plasma) ratios of prodrugs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 17.0-, 15.7-, 7.88-, 9.31-, and 3.42-fold higher than that of dexibuprofen, respectively (P<0.01). Thus, each of the prodrugs exhibited a significantly enhanced brain distribution when compared with dexibuprofen. In the pharmacokinetic study, prodrug 1 exhibited a brain-targeting index of 11.19 {DTI=(AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma))(1)/(AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma))(dexibuprofen)}.The -related structures may play an important role in transport across the brain blood .</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23658950>Optimization and characterization of a triazole urea inhibitor for diacylglycerol

messengers in the nervous system. The two principle ECs thus far identified in
mammals are -arachidonoyl- (anandamide) and
2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). These compounds have been implicated in various
physiological and pathological functions including appetite, pain, sensation,
memory, and addiction. Because ECs are synthesized and released on demand and then
rapidly degraded to terminate signaling, the metabolic pathways that govern EC
turnover directly influence the magnitude and duration of neuronal signaling events.
There is strong evidence that two serine hydrolases, diacylglycerol lipase-alpha and
-beta (DAGL-α and -β)  as 2-AG synthetic enzymes both
 and . However, because
constitutive gene disruption, the only currently available means to investigate
DAGL-α/β biology due to a lack of selective chemical inhibitors, can
result in compensatory effects and network-wide changes, there is still uncertainty
surrounding the extent to which DAGL-α/β contribute to 2-AG-mediated
signaling. In an effort to provide chemical tools for manipulation of DAGL-β
activity, we initiated a competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) screen
of triazole urea compounds to identify selective enzyme inhibitors. This campaign,
made possible by previous inhibitor development efforts for LYPLA1/2 (ML211), PAFAH2 (ML225), and ABHD11
(ML226) based on the triazole urea scaffold, yielded the medchem
optimized probe ML294 (SID 125269120). ML294 is highly potent against its target enzyme (IC50 = 56
nM ; 12 nM ), and is active
, showing both oral bioavailability and blood-brain
 penetration. Out of more than 20 serine hydrolases (SHs) profiled by
gel-based competitive ABPP, ML294 is observed to have one anti-target,
alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 6 (ABHD6). Otherwise, ML294 is at least 35-fold selective for all other brain SHs

assessed by gel-based competitive ABPP and 7-fold selective vs. its closest homolog,
DAGL-α. To control for ABHD6-directed activity in biological studies, we
also developed a structurally related ABHD6-selective control
“anti-probe”, ML295, also based on the

We hypothesized that terbutaline, a β2-adrenoceptor agonist, induces cerebellar degeneration not only in neonatal rats, but also in adult rats. Nine-week-old adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and infused with 25% mannitol via the left common carotid artery. Thirty seconds later, terbutaline was infused via the same artery. Dark-stained Purkinje cells were observed in the entire cerebellum on day 3. Prominent Bergmann glial cells accompanied by swelling of the glial processes were present, and were closely associated with the dark-stained Purkinje cells. These findings were found continuously throughout day 30. Ultrastructurally, dilated Golgi vesicles and/or endoplasmic reticulum and large lamella bodies were present in both severely changed and slightly changed Purkinje cells. Bergmann glial cells in the area of synaptic contacts of the severely changed Purkinje cells showed swelling. The Bergmann glial process in close contact with the slightly changed Purkinje cell dendrite in molecular layer showed slight swelling, and large lamella bodies in the dendrite were observed close to the dendritic spines. These findings may suggest that terbutaline induced a failure of Bergmann glial cell and resulted in dark cell degeneration of the Purkinje cells due to glutamate excitotoxicity.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572792>Supplemental feeding of phospholipid-enriched alkyl phospholipid from krill relieves spontaneous atopic dermatitis and strengthens skin intercellular lipid barriers in NC/Nga mice.</a></h2><p>Plasmalogen (Pls) is a glycerophospholipid derived from alkyl phospholipid (Alk) with antioxidant functions in vivo.

Administration of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) limits the transport of endogenous tryptophan (TRP) across the blood brain  by competition with other LNAAs and subsequently decreases serotonergic neurotransmission. A recent discussion on the specificity and efficacy of the ATD paradigm for inhibition of central nervous 5-HT has arisen.

We tested ATD Moja-De (TRP-) in two strains of mice: C57BL/6J, and BALB/cJ, which are reported to have impaired 5-HT synthesis and a more anxious phenotype relative to other strains of mice. ATD Moja-De lowered brain TRP, significantly decreased 5-HT synthesis as indexed by 5-HTP levels after decarboxlyase inhibition, and lowered 5-HT and 5-HIAA in both strains of mice, however more so in C57BL/6J than in BALB/cJ. Dopamine and its metabolites as well as norepinephrine were not affected. A balanced (TRP+) control mixture did not raise 5-HT or 5-HIAA.

A review of its mode of action.</a></h2><p>DSP4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride) is a selective neurotoxin for the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system in the rodent and bird brain. It readily passes the blood-brain  and cyclizes to a reactive aziridinium derivative that is accumulated into the noradrenergic nerve terminals via the noradrenaline transporter. DSP4 is also an irreversible inhibitor of this transporter. Within the nerve terminals the aziridinium derivative reacts with unknown vital cellular components, destroying the terminals. At the dose 50 mg/kg i.p. this is characterized by a rapid and long-lasting loss of noradrenaline and a slower decrease in the dopamine-β-hydroxylase enzyme activity and immunoreactivity in the regions innervated from locus coeruleus. The tissue level of noradrenaline is reduced to 10-30% of the normal value. The extraneuronal concentration is, on the other hand, increased due to inflow from non-lesioned regions. Like the peripheral sympathetic nerves the non-locus coeruleus noradrenergic systems in the rodent brain is resistant to the neurotoxic action of DSP4. Serotoninergic and dopaminergic nerves are only slightly or not at all affected by DSP4. The neurotoxic effect is counteracted by pretreatment with noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (e.g., desipramine). MAO-B inhibitors of the N-propargylamine type (e.g., selegiline) also counteract the DSP4-induced neurotoxicity with another, yet unknown mechanism. Because of its selectivity for the locus coeruleus system DSP4 is a useful tool in studies of the functional role of this noradrenergic system in the brain.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19098897>Direct observation of the nanoscale dynamics of membrane lipids in a living cell.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol-mediated lipid interactions are thought to have a functional role in many membrane-associated processes such as signalling events.

Specifically, relationships between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) norepinephrine (NE) and CSF cortisol were examined in cognitively normal participants and participants with AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We hypothesized that there would a positive association between these 2 measures in cognitively normal controls and that this association would be altered in AD.Four hundred twenty-one CSF samples were assayed for NE and cortisol in controls (n = 305), participants with aMCI (n = 22), and AD dementia (n = 94). Linear regression was used to examine the association between CSF cortisol and NE, adjusting for age, sex, education, and body mass index.Contrary to our hypothesis, CSF cortisol and NE levels were not significantly associated in controls. However, higher cortisol levels were associated with higher NE levels in AD and aMCI participants. Regression coefficients ± standard errors for the change in cortisol per 100-pg/mL increase in NE are as follows: controls 0.0 ± 0.2, P = 1.0; MCI, 1.4 ± 0.7, P = .14; and AD 1.1 ± 0.4, P = .032.

Because brainstem noradrenergic stimulatory regulation of the HPA axis is substantially increased by both acute and chronic stress, these findings are also consistent with AD participants experiencing higher levels of acute and chronic stress.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23224983>L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine corrects neurochemical abnormalities in a Menkes disease mouse model.</a></h2><p>Menkes disease is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy caused by mutations in a copper-transporting adenosine triphosphatase gene, ATP7A. Among its multiple cellular tasks, ATP7A transfers copper to dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) within the lumen of the Golgi network or secretory granules, catalyzing the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. In a well-established mouse model of Menkes disease, mottled-brindled (mo-br), we tested whether systemic administration of L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS), a drug used successfully to treat autosomal recessive norepinephrine deficiency, would improve brain neurochemical abnormalities and neuropathology.At 8, 10, and 12 days of age, wild-type and mo-br mice received intraperitoneal injections of 200μg/g body weight of L-DOPS, or mock solution. Five hours after the final injection, the mice were euthanized, and brains were removed. We measured catecholamine metabolites affected by DBH via high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, and assessed brain histopathology.Compared to mock-treated controls, mo-br mice that received intraperitoneal L-DOPS showed significant increases in brain norepinephrine (p < 0.001) and its deaminated metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol (p < 0.05). The ratio of a non-beta-hydroxylated metabolite in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, to the beta-hydroxylated metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol, improved equivalently to results obtained previously with brain-directed ATP7A gene therapy (p < 0.01). However, L-DOPS treatment did not arrest global brain pathology or improve somatic growth, as gene therapy had.We conclude that (1) L-DOPS crosses the blood-brain  in mo-br mice and corrects brain neurochemical abnormalities, (2) norepinephrine deficiency is not the cause of neurodegeneration in mo-br mice, and (3) L-DOPS treatment may ameliorate noradrenergic hypofunction in Menkes disease.Copyright © 2012 American Neurological Association.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27321288>Damage of vascular endothelial  induced by explosive blast and its clinical significance.</a></h2><p>In recent years, injuries induced by explosive blast have got more and more attention owing to weapon development and frequent terrorist activities.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) can regulate endothelial  , but the sources of the S1P that provide this activity in vivo and its importance in modulating different inflammatory responses are unknown. We report here that mutant mice engineered to selectively lack S1P in plasma displayed increased vascular leak and impaired survival after anaphylaxis, administration of platelet-activating factor (PAF) or histamine, and exposure to related inflammatory challenges. Increased leak was associated with increased interendothelial cell gaps in venules and was reversed by transfusion with wild-type erythrocytes (which restored plasma S1P levels) and by acute treatment with an agonist for the S1P receptor 1 (S1pr1). S1pr1 agonist did not protect wild-type mice from PAF-induced leak, consistent with plasma S1P levels being sufficient for S1pr1 activation in wild-type mice. However, an agonist for another endothelial cell Gi-coupled receptor, Par2, did protect wild-type mice from PAF-induced vascular leak, and systemic treatment with pertussis toxin prevented rescue by Par2 agonist and sensitized wild-type mice to leak-inducing stimuli in a manner that resembled the loss of plasma S1P.

Damage to the GCX occurs due to a variety of causes including hypoxia, ischemia-reperfusion, stress-related sympathoadrenal activation, and inflammation. Tranexamic acid (TXA) may prevent GCX degradation. The therapeutic window for TXA administration and the mechanism of action has been under review. Membrane-anchored proteases (sheddases) are key components in endothelial cell biology including the regulation of vascular permeability. The effect of TXA administration on stress-related GCX damage, and the role of sheddases in this process was studied in a cell-based model.Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to hydrogen peroxide and/or epinephrine (EPI) to stimulate postshock reperfusion. TXA was added at various times after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and/or EPI exposure. GCX degradation was indexed by syndecan-1 and hyaluronic acid release. Activation of endothelial sheddases was indexed by A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase-17 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in culture supernatants.Exposure of HUVEC to either/both EPI and H2O2 resulted in a cellular stress and GCX disruption demonstrated by increased levels of syndecan-1 shedding, hyaluronic acid release, tumor necrosis factor-α release. Shedding of these GCX components was associated with increased activity of both A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase-17 and matrix metalloproteinase. Disruption of the GCX was further demonstrated via fluorescent imaging, which demonstrated disruption after exposure to either/both H2O2 and EPI. Early administration of either TXA or doxycycline resulted in preservation of the GCX. Late administration of TXA had no effect, whereas doxycycline had some residual protective effect.Tranexamic acid as a serine protease inhibitor prevented GCX degradation via inhibition of endothelial sheddase activation. This effect was not apparent when TXA was administered greater than 60 minutes after "simulated" reperfusion.

PAF has been reported to increase the permeability of the blood-brain  (BBB) via incompletely characterized mechanisms. We investigated the effect of PAF on rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVEC), a critical component of the BBB. PAF produced a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca concentration; the effect was prevented by the PAF receptor antagonist, WEB2086. The effect of PAF on cytosolic Ca was abolished in Ca-free saline or in the presence of L-type voltage-gated Ca channel inhibitor, nifedipine, indicating that Ca influx is critical for PAF-induced increase in cytosolic Ca. PAF produced RBMVEC depolarization; the effect was inhibited by WEB2086. In cells loaded with [(4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluoro-fluorescein)diacetate] (DAF-FM), a nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive fluorescent dye, PAF increased the NO level; the effect was prevented by WEB2086, nifedipine or by l-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase. Immunocytochemistry studies indicate that PAF reduced the immunostaining of ZO-1, a tight junction-associated protein, increased F-actin fibers, and produced intercellular gaps. PAF produced a decrease in RBMVEC monolayer electrical resistance assessed with Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS), indicative of a disruption of endothelial  . In vivo studies indicate that PAF increased the BBB permeability, assessed with sodium fluorescein and Evans Blue methods, via PAF receptor-dependent mechanisms, consequent to Ca influx and increased NO levels.

These include direct negative feedback effect of glucocorticoids on brain structures regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. However, since the blood-brain- is impermeable to circulating catecholamines, the role of circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine in feedback regulation of the sympathoadrenal system activity is unclear. Here we show that vagal innervation of the adrenal medulla combined with the presence of β-adrenergic receptors on vagal sensory neurons, the epinephrine-induced activation of vagal afferents, and increased plasma epinephrine levels following subdiaphragmatic vagotomy indicate that sensory fibers of the vagus nerve participate in the monitoring of plasma and tissue catecholamine concentrations. Furthermore, it shows that signaling transmitted by vagal afferents regulates sympathoadrenal system activity at the level of the brain.

In this study, we used intact mouse pulmonary endothelial cells (ECs) as well as endothelial plasma membrane patches and subcellular fractions to define a new microdomain of plasmalemma proper where the two proteins colocalize and to demonstrate how PAF-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production fine-tunes ECs  as gatekeepers of vascular permeability. Using fluorescence microscopy and immunogold labeling electron microscopy (EM) on membrane patches we demonstrate that PAF-R is organized as clusters and colocalizes with a subcellular pool of eNOS, outside recognizable vesicular profiles. Moreover, PAF-induced acid sphingomyelinase activation generates a ceramide-based microdomain on the external leaflet of plasma membrane, inside of which a signalosome containing eNOS shapes PAF-stimulated NO production. Real-time measurements of NO after PAF-R ligation indicated a rapid (5 to 15 min) increase in NO production followed by a > 45 min period of reduction to basal levels. Moreover, at the level of this new microdomain, PAF induces a dynamic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser, Thr and Tyr residues of eNOS that correlates with NO production.

Visualization of specific receptor subtypes by positron emission tomography (PET) has potential to assist with diagnosis of such neurodegenerative diseases and with design of suitable therapeutic approaches. The goal of our study was to evaluate in vivo the potential of (18)F-labelled (+)- and (-)-norchloro-fluoro-homoepibatidine ([(18)F]NCFHEB) in comparison to 2-[(18)F]F-A-85380 as PET tracers.

Here we found that the transfection efficiency of DC-Chol-DOPE/DNA lipoplexes increases in serum. To provide insight into the mechanism of lipoplex-serum interaction, several state-of-the-art methodologies have been applied. The nanostructure of DC-Chol-DOPE/DNA lipoplexes was found to be serum-resistant as revealed by high resolution synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering, while dynamic light scattering measurements showed a marked size increase of complexes. The structural stability of DC-Chol-DOPE/DNA lipoplexes was confirmed by electrophoresis on agarose gel demonstrating that plasmid DNA remained well protected by lipids. Proteomics experiments showed that serum proteins competed for the cationic surface of lipid membranes leading to the formation of a rich a 'protein corona'. Combining structural results with proteomics findings, we suggest that such a protein corona can promote large aggregation of intact lipoplexes. According to a recently proposed size-dependent mechanism of lipoplex entry within cells, protein corona-induced formation of large aggregates most likely results in a switch from a clathrin-dependent to caveolae-mediated entry pathway into the cells which is likely to be responsible for the observed transfection efficiency boost. As a consequence, we suggest that surface adsorption of protein corona can have a high biological impact on serum-resistant cationic formulations for in vitro and in vivo lipid-mediated gene delivery applications.Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Sandwich cultures of endothelial cells and pericytes of precapillary arteriolar or postcapillary venular origin from human myocardium as models of the respective vascular walls (sandwich cultures of precapillary arteriolar or postcapillary venular origin) were exposed to thrombin and components of the acutely activatable inflammatory system, and their hydraulic conductivity (L(P)) was registered. L(P) of SC-PAO remained low under all conditions (3.24 ± 0.52·10(-8)cm·s(-1)·cmH(2)O(-1)). In contrast, in the venular wall model, PGE(2), platelet-activating factor (PAF), leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), IL-6, and IL-8 induced a prompt, concentration-dependent, up to 10-fold increase in L(P) with synergistic support when combined. PAF and LTB(4) released by metabolically cooperating platelets, and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) caused selectively venular endothelial cells to contract and to open their clefts widely. This breakdown of the   was preventable and even reversible within 6-8 h by the presence of 50 μM quercetin glucuronide (QG). LTB(4) synthesis was facilitated by biochemical involvement of erythrocytes. Platelets segregated in the arterioles and PMNs in the venules of blood-perfused human myocardium (histological studies on donor hearts refused for heart transplantation). Extrapolating these findings to the coronary microcirculation in vivo would imply that the latter's complex functionality after accumulation of blood borne inflammatory mediators can change rapidly due to selective breakdown of the postcapillary venular . The resulting inflammatory edema and venulo-thrombosis will severely impair myocardial performance. The protection afforded by QG could be of particular relevance in the context of cardiosurgical intervention.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204955>The "Gut Feeling": Breaking Down the Role of Gut Microbiome in Multiple Sclerosis.</a></h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology. Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as a potential factor in the development of MS, with a number of studies having shown that patients with MS exhibit gut dysbiosis. The gut microbiota helps the host remain healthy by regulating various functions, including food metabolism, energy homeostasis, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, inhibition of  by pathogenic organisms, and shaping of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Alteration of the gut microbiota, and subsequent changes in its metabolic network that perturb this homeostasis, may lead to intestinal and systemic disorders such as MS. Here we discuss the findings of recent MS microbiome studies and potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota can predispose to, or protect against, MS. These findings highlight the need of an improved understanding of the interactions between the microbiota and host for developing therapies based on gut commensals with which to treat MS.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26967254>Increased Nanoparticle Delivery to Brain Tumors by Autocatalytic Priming for Improved Treatment and Imaging.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  (BBB) is partially disrupted in brain tumors. Despite the gaps in the BBB, there is an inadequate amount of pharmacological agents delivered into the brain. Thus, the low delivery efficiency renders many of these agents ineffective in treating brain cancer. In this report, we proposed an "autocatalytic" approach for increasing the transport of nanoparticles into the brain. In this strategy, a small number of nanoparticles enter into the brain via transcytosis or through the BBB gaps. After penetrating the BBB, the nanoparticles release BBB modulators, which enables more nanoparticles to be transported, creating a positive feedback loop for increased delivery. Specifically, we demonstrated that these autocatalytic brain tumor-targeting poly(amine-co-ester) terpolymer nanoparticles (ABTT NPs) can readily cross the BBB and preferentially accumulate in brain tumors at a concentration of 4.3- and 94.0-fold greater than that in the liver and in brain regions without tumors, respectively. We further demonstrated that ABTT NPs were capable of mediating brain cancer gene therapy and chemotherapy. Our results suggest ABTT NPs can prime the brain to increase the systemic delivery of therapeutics for treating brain malignancies.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28746893>In vitro vascular toxicity of tariquidar, a potential tool for in vivo PET studies.</a></h2><p>The P-glicoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor tariquidar is used to detect functional alterations of blood brain  pumps in PET imaging. The doses required, however, up to 4-fold higher than those already used in clinical trials to reverse multidrug resistance, cause syncopal episode and hypotension. Therefore, the effects of these doses toward the vasculature were investigated and an in-depth analysis of tariquidar-mediated effects on A7r5 and EA.hy926 cells viability, on the mechanical activity of freshly and cultured rat aorta rings and on L-type Ca current [I] of A7r5 cells has been performed. In both A7r5 and EA.hy926 cells, tariquidar was not cytotoxic up to 1μM concentration. On the contrary, at 10μM, it caused apoptosis already after 24h treatment. In fresh aorta rings, 10μM tariquidar partially relaxed phenylephrine-, but not 60mM K (K60)-induced contraction. In rings treated with 10μM tariquidar for 7days, the contractile response to both phenylephrine and K60 remained unchanged. Finally, tariquidar did not modify I intensity and kinetics. In conclusion, Tariquidar might exert both cytotoxic and acute, weak vascular effects at concentrations comparable to those employed in PET imaging. This implies that caution should be exercised when using it as diagnostic tool.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we tested the hypothesis that TSP1 inhibits eNOS activation and endothelial-dependent arterial relaxation.Acetylcholine (ACh)-stimulated activation of eNOS and agonist-driven calcium transients in endothelial cells were inhibited by TSP1. TSP1 also inhibited eNOS phosphorylation at serine(1177). TSP1 treatment of the endothelium of wild-type and TSP1-null but not CD47-null arteries inhibited ACh-stimulated relaxation. TSP1-null vessels demonstrated greater endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation compared with the wild type. Conversely, TSP1-null arteries demonstrated less vasoconstriction to phenylephrine compared with the wild type, which was corrected upon inhibition of eNOS. In TSP1-null mice, intravenous TSP1 blocked ACh-stimulated decreases in blood pressure, and both intravenous TSP1 and a CD47 agonist antibody acutely elevated blood pressure in mice.TSP1, via CD47, inhibits eNOS activation and endothelial-dependent arterial relaxation and limits ACh-driven decreases in blood pressure. Conversely, intravenous TSP1 and a CD47 antibody increase blood pressure. These findings suggest that circulating TSP1, by limiting endogenous NO production, functions as a pressor agent supporting blood pressure.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28385597>Ester-to-amide rearrangement of -derived prodrugs of sobetirome with increased blood-brain  penetration.</a></h2><p>Current therapeutic options for treating demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) do not stimulate myelin repair, thus creating a clinical need for therapeutic agents that address axonal remyelination.

Phorbol esters are known to stimulate PAF production. Moreover, the ability of repeated applications of phorbol esters to induce a sustained inflammatory response is crucial to their tumorigenic activity. We therefore examined whether PAF acts as a mediator of phorbol ester-induced inflammation and tumorigenesis. While PAF receptor knockout mice (PAFR(-/-)) showed an expected but modest reduction in the acute inflammatory response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), these mice exhibited a surprising increase in inflammation following chronic PMA application. This increased inflammation was documented by a number of findings that included: increased skin thickness, increased myeloperoxidase activity and expression and increased expression of known inflammatory mediators. Interestingly, vehicle-treated PAFR(-/-) mice also exhibited modest increases in levels of inflammatory markers. This suggests that the platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) acts to suppress chronic inflammation in response to other stimuli, such as  disruption. The idea that chronic PAFR activation is anti-inflammatory was documented by repetitive topical PAFR agonist administration that resulted in reduced myeloperoxidase activity in skin. We next utilized a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/PMA carcinogenesis protocol to demonstrate that PAFR(-/-) mice exhibit significantly increased tumor formation and malignant progression compared with wild-type control mice. These studies provide evidence for two important, unexpected and possibly interrelated pathological roles for the PAFR: first, the PAFR acts to suppress PMA-induced chronic inflammation; secondly, the PAFR acts to suppress neoplastic development in response to chemical carcinogens.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910525>A model of the isolated perfused rat small intestine.</a></h2><p>Intestinal edema remains a serious clinical problem, and novel approaches to study its pathophysiology are needed. It was our aim to develop a long-term stable isolated perfused rat small bowel preparation permitting analysis of vascular, luminal, interstitial, and lymphatic compartments and to demonstrate the utility of this model by studying the effects of the proinflammatory mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF). A temperature-controlled chamber with an integrated balance was designed to perfuse isolated intestines through the mesenteric artery and the gut lumen. Steroids or oxygen carriers were not needed. Functional and morphological integrity of the tissue was preserved for several hours as confirmed by oxygen consumption, venous lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, arterial and venous pH, lactose digestion and galactose uptake, intravascular and luminal pressures, maintained fluid homeostasis, gut motility, and quantitative light microscopic analysis. Administration of PAF caused typical effects such as vasoconstriction, gut atony, and loss of galactose uptake. PAF also elicited a transient loss of 20% of the perfusate liquid from the mesenteric vascular bed, two-thirds of which were transferred to the lumen. All these responses were entirely reversible. This new model provides detailed insights into the  of the small intestine and will allow to study fundamental processes such as fluid homeostasis,  functions, transport mechanisms, and immune responses in this organ. Using this model, here we show a dramatic and yet reversible response of the rat small bowel to PAF, suggesting luminal water clearance as a novel safety factor in the intestine that may be of clinical relevance.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24856780>Electropolymerized carbonic anhydrase immobilization for carbon dioxide capture.</a></h2><p>Biomimetic carbonation carried out with carbonic anhydrase (CA) in CO2-absorbing solutions, such as methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), is one approach that has been developed to accelerate the capture of CO2.

The mechanism(s) by which brain cytokines are induced during a peripheral immune challenge remains unclear since microorganisms/cytokines do not cross the blood-brain  (BBB). Recent studies indicate that central beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ADRs) may mediate brain interleukin-1beta (IL-1) production. This has direct implications for the production of brain cytokines during a peripheral immune response since peripheral pathogens and cytokines rapidly stimulate brainstem catecholamine neurons via peripheral nerves and circumventricular pathways. Studies here examine the role of central beta-ADRs in regulating brain cytokine production following peripheral Escherichia coli (E. coli) challenge. Rats were centrally administered propranolol (beta-ADR antagonist) or vehicle followed by peripheral E. coli or saline and sacrificed 6h later for measurement of cytokines. Pre-treatment with propranolol completely blocked the induction of brain IL-1 following E. coli. Surprisingly, central propranolol also attenuated E. coli-induced peripheral cytokines. To examine whether the attenuated peripheral cytokine response following central propranolol administration was due leakage of propranolol into the general circulation and blockade of peripheral beta-blockade, nadolol (beta-ADR antagonist that does not cross the BBB) was administered peripherally prior to E. coli. Nadolol administration did not block central cytokine production following E. coli, but instead enhanced both peripheral and central proinflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, central administration of isoproterenol (beta-ADR agonist) results in a time-dependent increase in brain IL-1 production. These data demonstrate central beta-ADRs may play a critical role to induce brain IL-1, while peripheral beta-ADRs inhibit cytokine response to bacterial challenge.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19119182>Non-oxidative cerebral carbohydrate metabolism.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27744187>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of bambuterol analogues as novel inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase.</a></h2><p>An increase activity of butyrylcholinesterase is believed to contribute to Alzheimer's disease.

We first assessed the effect of treatment with each Lactobacillus on L. monocytogenes counts in host tissues and showed that each decreases L. monocytogenes systemic dissemination in orally inoculated mice. A whole genome intestinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that each Lactobacillus changes expression of a specific subset of genes during infection, with IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) being the most affected by both lactobacilli. We also examined microRNA (miR) expression and showed that three miRs (miR-192, miR-200b, and miR-215) are repressed during L. monocytogenes infection. Treatment with each Lactobacillus increased miR-192 expression, whereas only L. casei association increased miR-200b and miR-215 expression. Finally, we showed that treatment with each Lactobacillus significantly reshaped the L. monocytogenes transcriptome and up-regulated transcription of L. monocytogenes genes encoding enzymes allowing utilization of intestinal carbon and nitrogen sources in particular genes involved in propanediol and  catabolism and cobalamin biosynthesis.

Ammonia and other nitrogen-based compounds are thought to be essential etiological factors when dysmetabolized in the liver, they provoke highly undesirable neuroglial transmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Proton MR spectroscopy (HMRS) is a noninvasive in vivo method of analyzing the metabolic spectrum of neuronal tissue and its pathological changes even before overt clinical symptoms occur and can be seen in morphological MR examination. Myoinositol (ml) is one of the metabolites that can be identified with HMRS. It is considered a glial marker, directly involved in compensation processes to overcome toxic effects of hepatic metabolites which had crossed the brain-blood . Thus, ml may be a crucial prognostic factor for patients with HE.

Experimentally, we found that physiological NA concentrations were sufficient to induce SMC contraction and produced significant decreases in L and increases in ϕ. Simulation results based on 3D confocal images of the extracellular volume showed a corresponding increase in K, attributed to the opening of the ECM. Conversion of permeabilities to layer-specific resistances revealed that although the total wall resistance increased, medial resistance decreased, suggesting an increase in intimal resistance upon application of NA.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Iron in the human body is sequestered by transferrins and lactoferrin, limiting bacterial growth. An increase in the availability of iron in the intestine by bleeding, surgery, or under stress leads to an increase in the growth and virulence of many pathogens. Under these high iron conditions, LAB are rapidly out-competed; for the levels of probiotic bacteria to be maintained under high iron conditions they must be able to respond by increasing growth rate to compete with the normal flora. Despite this, iron-responsive genera are poorly characterised as probiotics.Here, we show that a panel of probiotics are not able to respond to increased iron availability, and identify an isolate of Streptococcus thermophilus that can increase growth rate in response to increased iron availability. The isolate of S. thermophilus selected was able to reduce epithelial cell death as well as NF-κB signalling and IL-8 production triggered by pathogens. It was capable of crossing an epithelial cell  in conjunction with E. coli and downregulating Th1 and Th17 responses in primary human intestinal leukocytes.We propose that an inability to compete with potential pathogens under conditions of high iron availability such as stress and trauma may contribute to the lack of efficacy of many LAB-based probiotics in treating disease. Therefore, we offer an alternative paradigm which considers that probiotics should be able to be competitive during periods of intestinal bleeding, trauma or stress.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20514790>A nonsteroidal lamellar matrix cream containing palmitoylethanolamide for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.</a></h2><p>Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting a predominantly pediatric population and characterized by a cycle of flare and remission. Pruritus associated with AD results in substantial quality of life, societal, financial and emotional burdens for patients and their caregivers. Daily management of AD is usually based on application of an emollient and a topical corticosteroid, topical immunomodulator and/or oral antihistamine for the management of flares. A new nonsteroidal lamellar matrix cream has been introduced for use in a variety of dermatologic conditions including AD. Its ingredients mimic stratum corneum components which may help repair and restore skin   and decrease transepidermal water loss. This article reviews the role of topical therapy in AD management, and evaluates the usefulness of the lamellar matrix cream in reducing time to flare, limiting the use of agents with greater side-effect profiles and lowering the overall cost of treatment.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17727820>Discovery of a novel nicotinic receptor antagonist for the treatment of nicotine addiction: 1-(3-Picolinium)-12-triethylammonium-dodecane dibromide (TMPD).</a></h2><p>Limitations in efficacy and high relapse rates of currently available smoking cessation agents reveal the need for more efficacious pharmacotherapies. One strategy is to develop subtype-selective nicotinic receptor (nAChR) antagonists that inhibit nicotine-evoked dopamine (DA) release, the primary neurotransmitter involved in nicotine reward. Simple alkylation of the pyridino N-atom converts nicotine from a potent agonist into a potent antagonist. The classical antagonists, hexamethonium and decamethonium, differentiate between peripheral nAChR subtypes. Using a similar approach, we interconnected varying quaternary ammonium moieties with a lipophilic linker to provide N,N'-bis-nicotinium analogs, affording a lead compound, N,N'-dodecyl-1,12-diyl-bis-3-picolinium dibromide (bPiDDB), which inhibited nicotine-evoked DA release and decreased nicotine self-administration. The current work describes a novel compound, 1-(3-picolinium)-12-triethylammonium-dodecane dibromide (TMPD), a hybrid of bPiDDB and decamethonium. TMPD completely inhibited (IC(50)=500 nM) nicotine-evoked DA release from superfused rat striatal slices, suggesting that TMPD acts as a nAChR antagonist at more than one subtype. TMPD (1 microM) inhibited the response to acetylcholine at alpha3beta4, alpha4beta4, alpha4beta2, and alpha1beta1varepsilondelta receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. TMPD had a 2-fold higher affinity than choline for the blood-brain  choline transporter, suggesting brain bioavailability. TMPD did not inhibit hyperactivity in nicotine sensitized rats, but significantly and specifically decreased nicotine self-administration. Together, the results suggest that TMPD may have the ability to reduce the rewarding effect of nicotine with minimal side effects, a pharmacological profile indicative of potential clinical utility for the treatment of tobacco dependence.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24021572>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 protects against anaphylactic shock through suppression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in mice.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P(2)) is expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). However, the role of S1P(2) in vascular  integrity and anaphylaxis is not well understood. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) generates nitric oxide to mediate vascular leakage, compromising survival in patients with anaphylaxis. We recently observed that endothelial S1P(2) inhibits Akt, an activating kinase of eNOS.We tested the hypothesis that endothelial S1P(2) might suppress eNOS, exerting a protective effect against endothelial  disruption and anaphylaxis.Mice deficient in S1P(2) and eNOS underwent antigen challenge or platelet-activating factor (PAF) injection. Analyses were performed to examine vascular permeability and the underlying mechanisms.S1pr2 deletion augmented vascular leakage and lethality after either antigen challenge or PAF injection. PAF injection induced activation of Akt and eNOS in the aortas and lungs of S1pr2-null mice, which were augmented compared with values seen in wild-type mice. Consistently, PAF-induced increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in the aorta was enhanced in S1pr-null mice. Genetic Nos3 deletion or pharmacologic eNOS blockade protected S1pr2-null mice from aggravation of  disruption after antigen challenge and PAF injection. ECs isolated from S1pr2-null mice exhibited greater stimulation of Akt and eNOS, with enhanced nitric oxide production in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate or PAF, compared with that seen in wild-type ECs. Moreover, S1pr2-deficient ECs showed more severe disassembly of adherens junctions with augmented S-nitrosylation of β-catenin in response to PAF, which was restored by pharmacologic eNOS blockade.S1P(2) diminishes harmful robust eNOS stimulation and thereby attenuates vascular  disruption, suggesting potential usefulness of S1P(2) agonists as novel therapeutic agents for anaphylaxis.Copyright © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Mast cells (MCs) are involved in AD both by releasing Th2 polarizing cytokines and generating pruritus symptoms through release of histamine and tryptase. A link between MCs and skin  defects was recently uncovered, with histamine being found to profoundly contribute to the skin  defects.Palmitoylethanolamide and related lipid mediators are endogenous bioactive compounds, considered to play a protective homeostatic role in many tissues: evidence collected so far shows that the anti-inflammatory effect of palmitoylethanolamide depends on the down-modulation of MC degranulation.Based on this background, the purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to determine if the endogenous levels of palmitoylethanolamide and other bioactive lipid mediators are changed in the skin of AD dogs compared to healthy animals; (b) to examine if MC number is increased in the skin of AD dogs and, if so, whether it depends on MC in-situ proliferation.The amount of lipid extract expressed as percent of biopsy tissue weight was significantly reduced in AD skin while the levels of all analyzed bioactive lipid mediators were significantly elevated, with palmitoylethanolamide showing the highest increase.In dogs with AD, the number of MCs was significantly increased in both the subepidermal and the perifollicular compartments and their granule content was significantly decreased in the latter. Also, in situ proliferation of MCs was documented.The levels of palmitoylethanolamide and other bioactive lipid mediators were shown to increase in AD skin compared to healthy samples, leading to the hypothesis that they may be part of the body's innate mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis when faced with AD-related inflammation. In particular, the increase may be considered a temptative response to down-regulating the observed elevation in the number, functionality and proliferative state of MCs in the skin of AD dogs. Further studies are warranted to confirm the hypothesis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406094>The Beta Agonist Lung Injury TrIal (BALTI)--prevention trial protocol.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury complicates approximately 25-30% of subjects undergoing oesophagectomy.

In contrast, it has been found in healthy humans that plasma concentrations of VEGF decrease upon hypoxia under in vivo conditions, indicating that systemic VEGF concentration may be differently regulated than cellular expression. To test the effect of blood glucose levels on VEGF concentrations in vivo, we examined plasma VEGF changes upon brief hyper- and hypoglycemia in healthy male subjects. We rapidly induced in a crossover design hypoglycemia by insulin bolus application of 0.1 U/kg or hyperglycemia by dextrose infusion in 24 healthy young men. Plasma VEGF concentrations were measured at baseline, at the target glucose concentration of <2.2 mmol/L or >10 mmol/L, and after further 5 and 10 minutes. Plasma VEGF concentrations decreased upon hyperglycemia as compared with euglycemic baseline (P = .027), whereas during hypoglycemic condition, there was a trend for an increase (P = .091). Analysis for repeated measurements including both conditions revealed a differential regulation of plasma VEGF levels upon glycemic condition (P = .035). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that systemic VEGF concentration may be differentially regulated than expression on cellular basis. Because VEGF is a candidate hormone for regulating glucose passage across the blood-brain  under critical conditions, it possibly acts as a neuroprotective controller for constant cerebral glucose supply.

Various methods of bypassing the BBB are under investigation. One approach is intranasal administration, where the olfactory region of the nasal cavity extends up to the cranial cavity and provides direct access to the brain. The pharmacokinetics of this transport and factors that determine transport rates and capacity is of vital importance for evaluating the clinical value of this route. Here, the pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered imatinib has been explored. Imatinib is distributed into the brain following intravenous administration, and then rapidly removed. Following intravenous administration, the brain/plasma ratio for imatinib was calculated to be 2% and remained at this ratio for 30min. The brain/plasma ratio following intranasal administration, however, was found to be 5.3% and remained at this ratio for up to 90min. Imatinib was found to be rapidly transported into the brain via the olfactory region, by shutting down the nose-to-blood-to-brain transport with epinephrine. The increased brain concentration of imatinib (0.33μg/g tissue) achieved by intranasal administration, compared with an IV injection, is likely to provide a model for developing a wide range of CNS active molecules that were previously removed from consideration as drug candidates due to their lack of CNS access. Furthermore, brain imatinib levels were increased by co-administration of the p-gp substrates, elacridar and pantoprazole, showing that both compounds were able to inhibit the elimination of imatinib from the brain.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The sphingolipid most commonly used as a foodstuff is glucosylceramide from plant sources, which is composed of sphingoid bases that are distinctive from those found in mammals. Although the structure of sphingoid bases in higher plants is more complicated than the structure of those in mammals, the fate of dietary sphingolipids of plant origin is still not understood. In the present study, we investigated the absorption of 4,8-sphingadienine that originated from maize glucosylceramide in the rat intestine by using a lipid absorption assay of lymph collected from the thoracic duct. The cumulative recovery of 4,8-sphingadienine in the lymph was lower than that of sphingosine. Verapamil, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, significantly increased the absorption of 4,8-sphingadienine but did not affect the absorption of sphingosine. Plant-derived sphingoid bases were detected in the ceramide fraction of lymph fluid by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results indicate that 4,8-sphingadienine that originates from the glucosylceramide of higher plants is poorly absorbed in the intestine because of efflux by P-glycoprotein and can be incorporated into a ceramide moiety, at least in part, in intestinal endothelial cells.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18756515>Alterations of Fc gamma receptor I and Toll-like receptor 4 mediate the antiinflammatory actions of microglia and astrocytes after adrenaline-induced blood-brain  opening in rats.</a></h2><p>Blood-brain  (BBB) opening occurs under many physiological and pathological conditions. BBB opening will lead to the leakage of large circulating molecules into the brain parenchyma. These invasive molecules will induce immune responses. Microglia and astrocytes are the two major cell types responsible for immune responses in the brain, and Fc gamma receptor I (FcgammaRI) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are the two important receptors mediating these processes. Data suggest that activation of the FcgammaRI pathway mediates antiinflammatory processes, whereas activation of TLR4 pathway leads to proinflammatory activities. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that BBB opening could lead to alterations in FcgammaRI and TLR4 pathways in microglia and astrocytes, thus limiting excessive inflammation in the brain. The transient BBB opening was induced by adrenaline injection through a caudal vein in Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that the FcgammaRI pathway was significantly activated in both microglia and astrocytes, as exhibited by the up-regulation of FcgammaRI and its key downstream molecule Syk, as well as the increased production of the effector cytokines, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4. Interestingly, after transient BBB opening, TLR4 expression was also increased. However, the expression of MyD88, the central adapter of the TLR4 pathway, was significantly inhibited, with decreased production of the effector cytokines IL-12a and IL-1beta. These results indicate that, after transient BBB opening, FcgammaRI-mediated antiinflammatory processes were activated, whereas TLR4-mediated proinflammatory activities were inhibited in microglia and astrocytes.

Intracellular concentrations of Nimodipine in normal and PAF injured RBMECs were estimated by LC-MS/MS analytical method to estimate BBB permeability.

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA and protein expression levels in RBMECs were assayed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry respectively. Results showed that after RBMECs were incubated with 1 μM PAF for 24h, cell survival rate was decreased, and intracellular concentrations of Nimodipine were increased evidently. Rhodamine 123 accumulation between normal and PAF injured cells has no significant difference, but ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expression were increased remarkably in PAF injured cells, which could be inhibited by PAF antagonists.

It is thought that NO diffuses freely across cell membranes, but it may also permeate through low resistant membrane pathways. Here, we describe the participation of connexin (Cx)-formed channels in the NO transport across cell membranes and between endothelial and smooth muscle cells. We used a water-soluble NO donor of high molecular weight (S-nitrosylated albumin, BSA-NO) that does not permeate through cell membranes or Cx-based channels and the NO-sensitive dye 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate to detect changes of intracellular NO concentration. We found that NO generated in the extracellular space was not detected intracellularly in Cx-deficient HeLa cells, suggesting that cell membrane represents a significant diffusion  for NO transfer. However, Cx-based channels provide efficient pathways for NO signaling because NO opened and permeated hemichannels expressed in HeLa cells transfected with Cx43, Cx40, or Cx37. In contrast, NO closed hemichannels of HeLa-Cx32 cells, which otherwise are permeable to NO if are opened by a divalent cation-free extracellular solution. Consistent with this, blockade of Cx-based channels abolished the myoendothelial NO transfer and associated NO-dependent vasodilation induced by acethylcholine. These results indicate that Cx-based channels play a key role in the NO-dependent tonic control of vascular  and may direct the NO signal to specific targets, which provides a novel mechanistic basis for the critical role of Cxs in cell-cell communication in the vessel wall.

Activated glial cells may release also pro-angiogenic molecules. The role of angiogenesis in AD is still controversial: although angiogenesis brings oxygen and nutrients to injured tissue, it may also exacerbate reactive gliosis. Moreover, by altering blood-brain  permeability pro-angiogenic mediators promote passage of inflammatory/immune-competent cells into the brain, thereby exacerbating gliosis. The release of proangiogenic factors during astrogliosis may thus be a key-step in controlling AD progression. The endogenous fatty acid amide, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), is a pleiotropic mediator exerting anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antiangiogenic effects in several in vitro and in vivo models of chronic-degenerative disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of PEA in AD angiogenesis and neuroinflammation by using conditioned medium from untreated and Aβ-treated C6 rat astroglioma cells and HUVEC human endothelial cells. PEA (10<sup>-8</sup>-10<sup>-6</sup> M) concentration-dependently reduced expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic markers in Aβ (1 μg/mL)-stimulated C6 cells. Moreover, culture medium from PEA-treated C6 cells reduced HUVEC cell proliferation as compared to cells treated with conditioned medium from Aβ-treated C6 cells. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that PEA treatment inhibited nuclear levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (the main pro-angiogenic pathway) and cytoplasmic vascular endothelial growth factor in HUVEC cells receiving C6 conditioned medium. Finally, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha inhibitor GW6471, added to Aβ-treated C6 cells blocked all PEA effects in this model, suggesting that PEA acts through a proliferator-activated receptor alpha-dependent mechanism on astroglial cells.

The mechanism(s) for this rapid onset edema may involve more than just increased fluid filtration. Lung endothelial cell permeability is regulated by pressure-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Herein, we demonstrate that pressure-dependent NOS activation contributes to vascular failure and PE in a model of acute heart failure (AHF) caused by hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Acute hypertension was induced by norepinephrine (NE) infusion and resulted in an increase in LVEDP and pulmonary artery pressure (P) that were associated with a rapid fall in PO, and increases in lung wet/dry ratio and injury scores. Heart failure (HF) lungs showed increased nitrotyrosine content and ROS levels. L-NAME pretreatment mitigated the development of PE and reduced lung ROS concentrations to sham levels. Apocynin (Apo) pretreatment inhibited PE. Addition of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to AHF rats lung lysates and pretreatment of AHF rats with folic acid (FA) prevented ROS production indicating endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling. Pressure-dependent NOS activation leads to acute endothelial hyperpermeability and rapid PE by an increase in NO and ROS in a model of AHF. Acute increases in pulmonary vascular pressure, without NOS activation, was insufficient to cause significant PE. These results suggest a clinically relevant role of endothelial mechanotransduction in the pathogenesis of AHF and further highlights the concept of active  failure in AHF.

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 5-mm left lateral craniotomy, and TBI was induced by lateral fluid percussion. TBI produced apnea (17±5 sec) and a delayed righting reflex (479±21 sec). Thirty minutes post-TBI, rats were randomized to receive intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (alcohol, emulphor, and saline; 1:1:18) or a selective inhibitor of 2-AG (JZL184, 16 mg/kg) or AEA (URB597, 0.3 mg/kg) degradation. At 24 h post-TBI, animals showed significant neurological and -behavioral impairment as well as disruption of blood-brain  (BBB) integrity. Improved neurological and -behavioral  was observed in JZL184-treated animals. BBB integrity was protected in both JZL184- and URB597-treated animals. No significant differences in ipsilateral cortex messenger RNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX2) and protein expression of COX2 or NOX2 were observed across experimental groups. Astrocyte and microglia activation was significantly increased post-TBI, and treatment with JZL184 or URB597 blocked activation of both cell types. These findings suggest that EC degradation inhibition post-TBI exerts neuroprotective effects. Whether repeated dosing would achieve greater protection remains to be examined.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26147243>Mono- and Cocultures of Bronchial and Alveolar Epithelial Cells Respond Differently to Proinflammatory Stimuli and Their Modulation by Salbutamol and Budesonide.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in transport and effectiveness of salbutamol sulfate (SAL) and budesonide (BD) following stimulation with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in mono- and coculture models of bronchial and alveolar epithelium. Primary bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, grown at air interface on filters, either as monocultures or in coculture with airway smooth muscle cells or alveolar macrophages, respectively, were stimulated with TGF-β. The biological response was modulated by depositing aerosolized SAL and BD on bronchial and alveolar models, respectively.  integrity, permeability to fluorescein-Na, transport of the deposited drug, and the pharmacological response to SAL (cAMP and IL-8 levels) or BD (IL-6 and -8 levels) were measured. While stimulation with TGF-β did not have any significant effect on the transepithelial electrical resistance and permeability to fluorescein-Na in mono- and coculture models, transport of SAL and BD were affected in cultures from some of the patients (6 out of 12 for bronchial and 2 out of 4 for alveolar cells). The bronchial coculture showed a better responsiveness to SAL in terms of cAMP release than the monoculture. In contrast, the difference between alveolar mono- and cocultures to TGF-β mediated interleukin release and its modulation by BD was less pronounced. Our data point to intrinsic differences in the transport of, and responsiveness to, SAL and BD when epithelial cell cultures originate from different patients. Moreover, if the biological responses (e.g., IL-8, cAMP) involve communication between different cell types, coculture models are more relevant to measure such effects than monocultures.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896522>Molecular and functional characterization of choline transporter in the human trophoblastic cell line JEG-3 cells.</a></h2><p>Choline is essential for the synthesis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC), the methyl donor betaine and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which is involved in several vital biological functions that play key roles in fetal development. In this study, we examined the molecular and functional characteristics of choline uptake in the human trophoblastic cell line JEG-3.We examined [(3)H]choline uptake in the human trophoblastic cell line JEG-3. The expression of CTL1 and CTL2 was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunocytochemistry.We demonstrated that JEG-3 cells take up [(3)H] choline by a saturable process that is mediated by a Na(+)-independent and pH-dependent transport system. The cells have two different [(3)H] choline transport systems, high- and low-affinity, with Km values of 28.4 ± 5.0 μM and 210.6 ± 55.1 μM, respectively. Cationic compounds and hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) inhibited choline uptake. Choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 mRNA and protein were highly expressed in JEG-3 cells and were localized to the plasma membrane.The present results suggest that choline is mainly transported via a high-affinity choline transport system (CTL1) and a low-affinity choline transport system (CTL2) in human trophoblastic JEG-3 cells.

Maximum concentration of camphecene in blood and organs was reached after 1.5-2 h of its administration, and the maximal content of the agent in the organs investigated was observed in the kidneys. The content of the substance in the lungs was comparable to that in the liver. Also, camphecene was found in brain in high concentration, thus allowing assumption of its ability to penetrate the blood-brain  and to exert its antiviral properties in the organ. Camphecene glucuronide and iminoacid had concentration-time profiles similar to that of their precursor, their content being maximal in kidney and liver and 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than in lungs and brain.

Conventional ventilation was applied for 30 min followed by different ventilation strategies for 90 min: conventional ventilation, high-volume ventilation with or without 6 cmH2O PEEP.Protein fluxes across the alveolar and microvascular barriers were evaluated by scintigraphy. High-volume ventilation resulted in immediate leakage of 99mTc-albumin from alveolar spaces and increased pulmonary uptake of systemic 111In-transferrin.

Our primary goals were to examine the degree to which acute pain affects recovery from skin  disruption, and the potential mediating impact of cortisol and catecholamines.Healthy non-smokers aged 18-43 (N = 53, 65% women) underwent a 3-minute cold pressor pain stimulus to their foot. Tape-stripping of forearm skin occurred at two separate locations: before (site 1) and after (site 2) the pain stimulus. Transepidural water loss (TEWL) was assessed at baseline (pre-stripping), immediately post-stripping, and at 75 min to determine skin  recovery. Cortisol and catecholamine responses were obtained from multiple saliva and plasma samples, respectively.Contrary to expectations, greater pain was associated with faster skin  recovery, even after controlling for demographics, mood, anxiety, and other factors. Those who reported higher pain showed faster recovery at site 2 compared to a) individuals who experienced lower pain; and b) their own recovery at site 1. Greater increase in norepinephrine (but not in cortisol) was also associated with faster recovery at site 2, and mediated the impact of pain on recovery.Results bolster evidence that acute pain can affect immune-related processes. It is possible that acute pain may speed recovery from dermal abrasions, although pain is likely to impair recovery from more severe wounds.

In rats, immobilization (IMMO) stress activates the PNMT gene in the adrenal medulla via Egr-1 and Sp1 induction. Yet, elevated Epi induced by acute and chronic stress is associated with stress induced, chronic illnesses of cardiovascular, immune, cancerous, and behavioral etiologies. Major sources of Epi include the adrenal medulla and brainstem. Although catecholamines do not cross the blood-brain , circulating Epi from the adrenal medulla may communicate with the central nervous system and stress circuitry by activating vagal nerve β-adrenergic receptors to release norepinephrine, which could then stimulate release of the same from the nucleus tractus solitarius and locus coeruleus. In turn, the basal lateral amygdala (BLA) may activate to stimulate afferents to the hypothalamus, neocortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and other brain regions sequentially. Recently, we have shown that repeated IMMO or force swim stress may evoke stress resiliency, as suggested by changes in expression and extinction of fear memory in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm. However, concomitant adrenergic changes seem stressor dependent. Present studies aim to identify stressful conditions that elicit stress resiliency versus stress sensitivity, with the goal of developing a model to investigate the potential role of Epi in stress-associated illness. If chronic Epi over expression does elicit illness, possibilities for alternative therapeutics exist through regulating stress-induced Epi expression, adrenergic receptor  and/or corticosteroid effects on Epi, adrenergic receptors and the stress axis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23992543>Blunted glucagon but not epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia occurs in youth with less than 1 yr duration of type 1 diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Glycemic control is limited by the  of hypoglycemia.

However, a  to widespread clinical use of this technique is the lack of robust quantification methods that yield reproducible results in an institution-independent manner. The main goal of this study was to develop a standardized and fully automated approach (LCModel-based) for quantitative prostate (1) H-MRSI. To this end, a dedicated basis set was constructed by the combination of simulated (citrate, Cit; choline, Cho, and creatine, CR) and experimentally acquired (spermine, Spm) spectra. The overlapping Spm, Cho, and Cr could be resolved and quantified individually, thus allowing for the independent assessment of glandular (Cit and Spm) and proliferative (Cho) components. Several metabolite ratios were calculated and compared to the histologic findings of prostatectomy specimens from 10 prostate cancer patients with Gleason scores (3 + 3) and (3 + 4). The Cho mole fraction and the Cho/(Cit + Spm) ratio were found to best discriminate between prostate cancer and healthy tissue. The comparison between the quantitative MRSI results and the histologic findings suggests that no correlation exists between the detected metabolic alterations and the Gleason score of low-grade tumors.Copyright © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23115643>Influenza infects lung microvascular endothelium leading to microvascular leak: role of apoptosis and claudin-5.</a></h2><p>Severe influenza infections are complicated by acute lung injury, a syndrome of pulmonary microvascular leak. The pathogenesis of this complication is unclear. We hypothesized that human influenza could directly infect the lung microvascular endothelium, leading to loss of endothelial  . We infected human lung microvascular endothelium with both clinical and laboratory strains of human influenza. Permeability of endothelial monolayers was assessed by spectrofluorimetry and by measurement of the transendothelial electrical resistance. We determined the molecular mechanisms of flu-induced endothelial permeability and developed a mouse model of severe influenza. We found that both clinical and laboratory strains of human influenza can infect and replicate in human pulmonary microvascular endothelium, leading to a marked increase in permeability. This was caused by apoptosis of the lung endothelium, since inhibition of caspases greatly attenuated influenza-induced endothelial leak. Remarkably, replication-deficient virus also caused a significant degree of endothelial permeability, despite displaying no cytotoxic effects to the endothelium. Instead, replication-deficient virus induced degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-5; the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton were unaffected. Over-expression of claudin-5 was sufficient to prevent replication-deficient virus-induced permeability. The -protective agent formoterol was able to markedly attenuate flu-induced leak in association with dose-dependent induction of claudin-5. Finally, mice infected with human influenza developed pulmonary edema that was abrogated by parenteral treatment with formoterol. Thus, we describe two distinct mechanisms by which human influenza can induce pulmonary microvascular leak.

Bronchial epithelial cells are first-line  against invasive pathogen and also have immunomodulatory . However, whether albuterol and fenoterol (two SABAs) have modulatory effects on RANTES and IP-10 expression in bronchial epithelial cells is unknown. The human bronchial epithelial cell lines, BEAS-2B cells, were pre-treated with different concentrations of albuterol, fenoterol or dibutyryl-cAMP (a cyclic AMP analog) before polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation. In some condition, BEAS-2B cells were pre-treated with ICI-118551, a selective β2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, 30 min before albuterol or fenoterol treatment. The levels of RANTES and IP-10 were measured by ELISA. Intracellular signaling was investigated using cAMP assay, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor, and western blot. Albuterol and fenoterol suppressed poly I:C-induced RANTES and IP-10 expression of BEAS-2B cells. ICI-118551 could partly reverse the suppressive effects of albuterol and fenoterol on RANTES and IP-10 expression. Albuterol and fenoterol increased intracellular cAMP levels. Dibutyryl-cAMP conferred the similar effects of albuterol and fenoterol. Western blot revealed that albuterol suppressed p-ERK, p-JNK and pp38, and also their associated kinase expression. Albuterol had no effect on pp65 expression. Albuterol and fenoterol could suppress poly I:C-induced RANTES and IP-10 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells via at least partly the β2-adrenoreceptor-cAMP and the MAPK pathways, implicating that albuterol and fenoterol could exert anti-inflammatory effect and benefit asthmatic patients by suppressing RANTES and IP-10 expression.

Here we report the development of a highly effective oral insulin formulation using choline and geranate (CAGE) ionic liquid. CAGE significantly enhanced paracellular transport of insulin, while protecting it from enzymatic degradation and by interacting with the mucus layer resulting in its thinning. In vivo, insulin-CAGE demonstrated exceptional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcome after jejunal administration in rats.

Cell death by necrosis and apoptosis occurs in alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs of patients with ALI.

The main goal of this study was to determine whether activation of the Fas/Fas ligand pathway in the lungs could alter the  of the lung epithelium, and the mechanisms involved. The results show that Fas activation alters the alveolar  integrity and impairs the ability of the lung alveolar epithelium to reabsorb fluid from the air spaces. This result was dependent on the presence of a normal Fas receptor and was not affected by inflammation induced by Fas activation. Alteration of the fluid transport properties of the alveolar epithelium was partially restored by β-adrenergic stimulation. Fas activation also caused apoptosis of alveolar endothelial cells, but this effect was less pronounced than the effect on the alveolar epithelium.

Here, we evaluated the effects of olmesartan treatment using an in vivo electron spin resonance (ESR)/spin probe technique. Two groups of SHRSP were treated with either olmesartan (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or hydralazine (Hyd, 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1))/hydrochlorothiazide (HCT, 4.5 mg (-1)kg day(-1)) for 30 days (n=5 for each). Systolic blood pressure decreased similarly in both groups after treatment. Heart rate and urinary norepinephrine (NE) excretion increased in rats treated with Hyd/HCT, but not in those treated with olmesartan. The in vivo ESR signal decay rates of the blood-brain -permeable spin probe methoxycarbonyl-PROXYL were significantly higher in SHRSP brains than in age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat brains (P<0.01; n=6 for each). Olmesartan attenuated the ESR signal decay rates in SHRSP brains, but Hyd/HCT did not. Intracerebroventricular infusion of active form of olmesartan, RNH-6270, reduced blood pressure and NE excretion, and the ESR signal decay rate was reduced in SHRSP brains.

It has been suggested that exercise-induced changes in serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and noradrenaline (NA) concentrations contribute to the onset of fatigue during prolonged exercise. Serotonin has been linked to fatigue because of its documented role in sleep, feelings of lethargy and drowsiness, and loss of motivation, whereas increased DA and NA neurotransmission favors feelings of motivation, arousal, and reward. 5-HT has been shown to increase during acute exercise in running rats and to remain high at the point of fatigue. DA release is also elevated during exercise but appears to fall at exhaustion, a response that may be important in the fatigue process. The rates of 5-HT and DA/NA synthesis largely depend on the peripheral availability of the amino acids tryptophan (TRP) and tyrosine (TYR), with increased brain delivery increasing serotonergic and DA/NA activity, respectively. TRP, TYR, and the branched-chained amino acids (BCAAs) use the same transporter to pass through the blood-brain , meaning that the plasma concentration ratio of these amino acids is thought to be a very important marker of neurotransmitter synthesis. Pharmacological manipulation of these neurotransmitter systems has provided support for an important role of the CNS in the development of fatigue. Work conducted over the last 20 y has focused on the possibility that manipulation of neurotransmitter precursors may delay the onset of fatigue. Although there is evidence that BCAA (to limit 5-HT synthesis) and TYR (to elevate brain DA/NA) ingestion can influence perceived exertion and some measures of mental performance, the results of several apparently well-controlled laboratory studies have yet to demonstrate a clear positive effect on exercise capacity or performance. There is good evidence that brain neurotransmitters can play a role in the development of fatigue during prolonged exercise, but nutritional manipulation of these systems through the provision of amino acids has proven largely unsuccessful.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898606>Choline-derivate-modified nanoparticles for brain-targeting gene delivery.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23144756>Structural insight into the Clostridium difficile  utilisation microcompartment.</a></h2><p>Bacterial microcompartments form a protective proteinaceous  around metabolic enzymes that process unstable or toxic chemical intermediates.

The C. difficile eut operon displays regulatory genetic elements and protein encoding regions in common with homologous loci found in the genomes of other bacteria, including the enteric pathogens Salmonella enterica and Enterococcus faecalis. The crystal structures of two microcompartment shell proteins, CD1908 and CD1918, and an uncharacterised protein with potential enzymatic activity, CD1925, were determined by X-ray crystallography. CD1908 and CD1918 display the same protein fold, though the order of secondary structure elements is permuted in CD1908 and this protein displays an N-terminal β-strand extension. These proteins form hexamers with molecules related by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. The structure of CD1925 has a cupin β-barrel fold and a putative active site that is distinct from the metal-ion dependent catalytic cupins. Thin-section transmission electron microscopy of Escherichia coli over-expressing eut proteins indicates that CD1918 is capable of self-association into arrays, suggesting an organisational role for CD1918 in the formation of this microcompartment.

Paradoxically, it also contains nicotine, an anti-inflammatory alkaloid. There is increasing evidence that smokers have a lower incidence of some inflammatory diseases, including ulcerative colitis, and the protective effect involves the activation of a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway that requires the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on immune cells. Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to insulin resistance. Nicotine significantly improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in genetically obese and diet-induced obese mice, which is associated with suppressed adipose tissue inflammation. Inflammation that results in disruption of the epithelial  is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease, and nicotine is protective in ulcerative colitis. This article summarizes current evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Selective agonists for the α7nAChR could represent a promising pharmacological strategy for the treatment of inflammation in obesity and ulcerative colitis. Nevertheless, we should keep in mind that the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine could be mediated via the expression of several nAChRs on a particular target cell.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17932396>The low density lipoprotein receptor is not necessary for maintaining mouse brain polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations.</a></h2><p>The brain cannot synthesize n-6 or n-3 PUFAs de novo and requires their transport from the blood. Two models of brain fatty acid uptake have been proposed. One requires the passive diffusion of unesterified fatty acids through endothelial cells of the blood-brain , and the other requires the uptake of lipoproteins via a lipoprotein receptor on the luminal membrane of endothelial cells. This study tested whether the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) is necessary for maintaining brain PUFA concentrations. Because the cortex has a low basal expression of LDLr and the anterior brain stem has a relatively high expression, we analyzed these regions separately. LDLr knockout (LDLr(-/-)) and wild-type mice consumed an AIN-93G diet ad libitum until 7 weeks of age. After microwaving, the cortex and anterior brain stem (pons and medulla) were isolated for phospholipid fatty acid analyses. There were no differences in phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, , or choline glycerophospholipid esterified PUFA or saturated or monounsaturated fatty acid concentrations in the cortex or brain stem between LDLr(-/-) and wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that the LDLr is not necessary for maintaining brain PUFA concentrations and suggest that other mechanisms to transport PUFAs into the brain must exist.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29538236>Excess sodium is deleterious on endothelial and glycocalyx  : A microfluidic study.</a></h2><p>Hypernatremia is a common problem affecting critically ill patients, whether due to underlying pathology or the subsequent result of hypertonic fluid resuscitation. Numerous studies have been published, suggesting that hypernatremia may adversely affect the vascular endothelial glycocalyx. Our study aimed to evaluate if high sodium concentration would impair the endothelial and glycocalyx   and if stress conditions that simulate the shock microenvironment would exacerbate any observed adverse effects of hypernatremia.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured in microfluidic channels subjected to flow conditions overnight to stimulate glycocalyx growth. Cells were then subjected to sodium (Na) concentrations of either 150 mEq/L or 160 mEq/L, with Hepes solution applied to media to maintain physiologic pH. Subsets of HUVEC were also exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and epinephrine (HR + Epi) to simulate shock insult, then followed by Na treatment. Perfusate was then collected 60 minutes and 120 minutes following treatments. Relevant biomarkers were then evaluated and HUVEC underwent fluorescent staining followed by microscopy.Glycocalyx degradation as indexed by hyaluronic acid and syndecan-1 was elevated in all subgroups, particularly those subjected to HR + Epi with Na 160 mEq/L. Thickness of the glycocalyx as evaluated by fluorescent microscopy was reduced to half of baseline with Na 160 mEq/L and to one third of baseline with additional insult of HR + Epi. Endothelial activation/injury as indexed by soluble thrombomodulin was elevated in all subgroups. A profibrinolytic coagulopathy phenotype was demonstrated in all subgroups with increased tissue plasminogen activator levels and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels.Our data suggest that hypernatremia results in degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx with further exacerbation by shock conditions. A clinical study using clinical measurements of the endothelial glycocalyx in critically ill or injured patients with acquired hypernatremia would be warranted.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29470266>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a newly defined syndrome; therefore, this transient clinical condition is not well known and probably underdiagnosed. It develops quickly with symptoms that are usually indistinguishable from eclampsia. Nurses need to be knowledgeable and aware of identifying symptoms and appropriate treatment. The condition is thought to share pathophysiology with eclampsia, and it is suggested that endothelial dysfunction combined with hypertension causes disruption in the blood brain  resulting in cerebral edema. Seizures develop secondary to cerebral edema, and mark later stages of the disease. Treatment is aimed at reducing blood pressure (BP) with antihypertensive therapy and seizure control with magnesium sulfate. When PRES is treated early, symptoms typically disappear within a few days and imaging studies normalize in several weeks. Permanent brain damage can occur if diagnosis and treatment are delayed. If PRES is suspected, thorough focused assessments and increased communication among the healthcare team are essential for patient care. When pregnant or postpartum women present with elevated BP accompanied with neurologic symptoms, imaging studies should be considered. An exemplar case is presented of a woman with normal prenatal course that is complicated by rapidly developing preeclampsia, eclampsia, and PRES.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23838633>Insulin versus glucagon crosstalk: central plus peripheral mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Plasma glucose level depends on the peripheral intra-islet crosstalk between A cells (glucagon) + B-cells (insulin) and D-cells (somatostatin). Gastrointestinal hormones (secretin, CCK-PZ, gastrin, and serotonin) modulate the glucose- and amino acids-induced secretions of insulin and glucagon, respectively. Serotonin (5-HT) arose from the enterochromaffin cells during postprandial periods excites basal but inhibits excited B-cells. Serotonin excites adrenal glands that release adrenaline (Ad) + dopamine (DA). The former is positively correlated with hyperglycemia, whereas DA antagonizes this effect. Noradrenaline (NA) released from both sympathetic nerves and adrenal glands modulates the Ad release from this latter and excites A-cells. Thus, NA attenuates the hyperglycemic effects triggered by Ad. Dopamine released from both sources, adrenal glands and peripheral sympathetic nerves, antagonizes Ad-induced hyperglycemia plus the NA-triggered glucagon secretion. Both plasma insulin and glucagon cross the blood-brain  and excite A5(NA) and C1(Ad) neurons, respectively. C1 (Ad) neurons send excitatory drives to both islet A-cells and adrenal glands. Both central nervous system A5(NA) and C1(Ad) nuclei interchange inhibitory axons. Predominance of the former redounds in hyperinsulinism plus hypoglycemia, whereas the latter axis is responsible for hyperglucagonemia + hyperglycemia. In addition, the dorsal raphe serotonergic and the median raphe serotonergic nuclei interchange excitatory axons with the C1 (Ad) and the A5(NA) neurons, respectively. Hence, the former binomial axis (responsible for uncoping stress) is positively correlated with the hyperglycemic syndrome, whereas the A5(NA) + median raphe serotonergic binomial is correlated with hypoglycemia. Hence, the insulin resistance disorder should be underlain by the overactivity of both axes simultaneously. The above pathophysiological mechanisms are consistent with the successful neuropharmacological manipulations addressed to treat these neuroendocrine syndromes. Finally, one of the showiest findings derived from our research work arises from the unbalance between the DA versus 5-HT circulating parameters demonstrating that absolute predominance of the former is always paralleled by hypoglycemia (endogenous depression syndrome), whereas the opposite profile is registered in mammals affected by hyperglycemia (dysthymic depression and uncoping stress syndromes).</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20235532>Computational mapping of the conformational transitions in agonist selective pathways of a G-protein coupled receptor.</a></h2><p>The active state conformation of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is influenced by the chemical structure and the efficacy of the bound ligand. Insight into the active state conformation as well as the activation pathway for ligands with different efficacies is critical in designing functionally specific drugs for GPCRs. Starting from the crystal structure of the beta2-adrenergic receptor, we have used coarse grain computational methods to understand the modulation of the potential energy landscape of the receptor by two full agonists, two partial agonists, and an inverse agonist. Our coarse grain method involves a systematic conformational spanning of the receptor transmembrane helices followed by an energy minimization and ligand redocking in each sampled conformation. We have derived the activation pathways for several agonists and partial agonists, using a Monte Carlo algorithm, and these are in agreement with fluorescence spectroscopy measurements. The calculated pathways for the full agonists start with an energy downhill step leading to a stable intermediate followed by a  crossing leading to the active state. We find that the  crossing involves breaking of an interhelical hydrogen bond between helix5 and helix6, and polarization of the binding site residues by water facilitates the  crossing. The uphill step in the partial agonist salbutamol induced activation is distinct from full agonist norepinephrine, and originates from steric hindrance with the aromatic residues on helix6. Virtual ligand screening with the salbutamol-stabilized conformation shows enrichment of noncatechol agonists over the norepinephrine-stabilized conformation. Our computational method provides an unprecedented opportunity to derive hypotheses for experiments and also understand activation mechanisms in GPCRs.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656559>The use of PEGylated liposomes to prolong circulation lifetimes of tissue plasminogen activator.</a></h2><p>Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a widely used thrombolytic agent, has an application limit due to short half-life.

In addition, distearolyphosphatidyl -N-poly(ethylene glycol) 2000 (DSPE-PEG 2000) was included to give steric  to liposomes. Physicochemical characteristics such as particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and long-term storage stability at 4 degrees C were investigated.

In vivo pharmacokinetic properties of tPA and the effect of PEG on the blood circulation of tPA-loaded in liposomes in circulation were also evaluated. Both conventional liposomes (EPCL) and PEGylated liposomes (EPC-PEGL) were proper as an injectable formulation with small particle size. Loading process of tPA into liposomes did not alter fibrinolytic activity of intact tPA. Encapsulation of tPA into EPCL and EPC-PEGL prolonged half-life of tPA by 16 and 21 folds compared with free tPA, respectively.

Both astroglia and microglia, in particular, constitute an important source of inflammatory mediators and may have fundamental roles in central nervous system (CNS) disorders from neuropathic pain and epilepsy to neurodegenerative diseases. Glial cells respond also to pro-inflammatory signals released from cells of immune origin. In this context, mast cells are of particular relevance. These immune-related cells, while resident in the CNS, are able to cross a compromised blood-spinal cord and blood-brain  in cases of CNS pathology. Emerging evidence suggests the possibility of mast cell-glia communication, and opens exciting new perspectives for designing therapies to target neuroinflammation by differentially modulating the activation of non-neuronal cells normally controlling neuronal sensitization-both peripherally and centrally. This review aims to provide an overview of recent progress relating to the pathobiology of neuroinflammation, the role of glia, neuro-immune interactions involving mast cells and the possibility that glia-mast cell interactions contribute to exacerbation of acute symptoms of chronic neurodegenerative disease and accelerated disease progression, as well as promotion of pain transmission pathways.

Male Wistar rats, either control or exposed to crowding stress for 7 days prior to treatment, were used in these experiments. All compounds were injected i.p. Cyclooxygenase COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, piroxicam and compound NS-398, IL-1beta and IL-1beta receptor antagonist (IL-1betaRA) were injected 15 min before phenylephrine. Plasma ACTH and serum corticosterone levels were measured 1 h after phenylephrine or IL-1beta injection. Phenylephrine, in respective higher dose administered systemically (0.4 mg/kg i.p.) was almost equally effective as given i.c.v. (30 microg) in stimulating ACTH and corticosterone secretion. Likewise, the extent of the involvement of PG generated by COX-1 and COX-2 in the phenylephrine-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion was similar after systemic or i.c.v. treatment under both resting and stress conditions. Piroxicam, stronger than compound NS-398, reduced the i.p. phenylephrine-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion. IL-1beta receptor antagonist (50 microg/kg i.p.) did not significantly affect the inhibitory action of piroxicam on the i.p. phenylephrine-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion in control rats, but significantly enhanced the inhibition evoked by piroxicam in stressed rats. IL-1beta (2.5 microg/kg i.p.) significantly increased ACTH and corticosterone secretion under basal conditions. Crowding stress for 7 days markedly impaired the IL-1beta-induced ACTH and corticosterone secretion. The mechanism of the stimulatory action of i.p. IL-1beta, which does not cross the blood-brain , may comprise both central and peripheral components of the HPA axis. These results suggest that under basal conditions IL-1beta is not markedly involved in the alpha(1)-adrenergic agonist-induced stimulation of the HPA axis activity.

To gain molecular insight into these processes toward development of potential therapeutic targets, reactions of the cryotrapped (S)-2-aminopropanol substrate radical EAL from Salmonella typhimurium are addressed over a temperature (T) range of 220-250 K by using T-step reaction initiation and time-resolved, full-spectrum electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The observed substrate radical reaction kinetics are characterized by two pairs of biexponential processes: native decay to diamagnetic products and growth of a non-native radical species and Co(II) in cobalamin. The multicomponent low-T kinetics are simulated by using a minimal model, in which the substrate-radical macrostate, S, is partitioned by a free-energy  into two sequential microstates: 1) S, a relatively high-entropy/high-enthalpy microstate with a protein configuration that captures the nascent substrate radical in the terminal step of radical-pair separation; and 2) S, a relatively low-enthalpy/low-entropy microstate with a protein configuration that enables the rearrangement reaction. The non-native, destructive reaction of S at T ≤ 250 K is caused by a prolonged lifetime in the substrate-radical capture state. Monotonic S decay over 278-300 K indicates that the free-energy  to S and S interconversion is latent at physiological T-values. Overall, the low-temperature studies reveal two protein-configuration microstates and connecting protein-configurational transitions that specialize the S macrostate for the dual functional roles of radical capture and rearrangement enabling. The identification of new, to our knowledge, intermediate states and specific protein-fluctuation contributions to the reaction coordinate represent an advance toward development of novel therapeutic targets in EAL.Copyright © 2018 Biophysical Society.

Here we report that platelet activating factor (PAF) transiently opened BBB and facilitated neuroprotectant edaravone penetration into the brain. Intravenous infusion with PAF induced a transient BBB opening in rats, reflected by increased Evans blue leakage and mild edema formation, which ceased within 6 h. Furthermore, rat regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) declined acutely during PAF infusion, but recovered slowly. More importantly, this transient BBB opening significantly increased the penetration of edaravone into the brain, evidenced by increased edaravone concentrations in tissue interstitial fluid collected by microdialysis and analyzed by Ultra-performance liquid chromatograph combined with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Similarly, incubation of rat brain microvessel endothelial cells monolayer with 1 μM PAF for 1 h significantly increased monolayer permeability to (125)I-albumin, which recovered 1 h after PAF elimination. However, PAF incubation with rat brain microvessel endothelial cells for 1 h did not cause detectable cytotoxicity, and did not regulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1, matrix-metalloproteinase-9 and P-glycoprotein expression. In conclusion, PAF could induce transient and reversible BBB opening through abrupt rCBF decline, which significantly improved edaravone penetration into the brain. Platelet activating factor (PAF) transiently induces BBB dysfunction and increases BBB permeability, which may be due to vessel contraction and a temporary decline of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) triggered by PAF. More importantly, the PAF induced transient BBB opening facilitates neuroprotectant edaravone penetration into brain.

NAEs include anti-inflammatory and analgesic palmitoylethanolamide, anorexic oleoylethanolamide, stearoylethanolamide, and the endocannabinoid anandamide. Traumatic brain injury (TBI), associated with a high morbidity and mortality and no specific therapeutic treatment, has become a pressing public health and medical problem. TBI is a complex process evoking systemic immune responses as well as direct local responses in the brain tissues. The direct (primary) damage disrupts the blood-brain  (BBB), injures the neurons and initiates a cascade of inflammatory reactions including chemokine production and activation of resident immune cells. The effect of TBI is not restricted to the brain; it can cause multi-organ damage and evoke systemic immune response with cytokine and chemokine production. This facilitates the recruitment of immune cells to the site of injury and progression of the inflammatory reaction. Depending on severity, TBI induces immediate neuropathologic effects that, for the mildest form, may be transient; however, with increasing severity, these injuries cause cumulative neural damage and degeneration. Moreover, TBI leads to increased catabolism of phospholipids, resulting in a series of phospholipid breakdown products, some of which have potent biological activity. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury resulting from stroke leads to metabolic distress, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, making it likely that multiple therapeutic intervention strategies may be needed for successful treatment. Current therapeutic strategies for stroke need complimentary neuroprotective treatments to provide a better outcome. Prior studies on NAEs have demonstrated neurotrophic/neuroprotective activities across a broad spectrum of cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative and acute cerebrovascular disorders. The present review will summarize our knowledge of the biological role of these lipid signaling molecules in brain and highlights their therapeutic effect from multipotential actions on neuronal cell death and neuroinflammatory pathways.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In an ex-vivo model, intraluminal nifedipine has been shown to relax the ureter. Chitosan is the deacetylation product of chitin and can alter bladder urothelium. This study examines the effect of nifedipine on peristalsis before and after pretreating the ureter with chitosan.Intact 4-cm tubular porcine ureteral segments were placed in a novel organ bath. To induce peristalsis, phenylephrine (10 μM) was added. Chitosan (0.5% [w/v], 30 minutes) or Krebs (control) was then used to treat the urothelium. The rate and amplitude of ureteral peristalsis was then measured. Intraluminal nifedipine (1 μM) was then added to the intraluminal reservoir. Peristaltic rate and amplitude and the time to aperistalsis were measured. Methylene blue was then added after treatment with chitosan or control to measure diffusion.After Krebs pretreatment, intraluminal nifedipine (1 μM) significantly reduced peristaltic frequency (p = 0.0184) but did not stop peristalsis after 60 minutes of exposure in six trials. After chitosan, nifedipine (1 μM) stopped ureteral peristalsis within an average of 12.30 ± 4.72 minutes. Chitosan alone did not cause aperistalsis.

The aim of this study therefore is to evaluate the protective effects of nebivolol against cold restraint stress (CRS)-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Rats were restrained, and maintained at 4°C for 3 h. Nebivolol (5 mg/kg, p.o.) was suspended in 0.5% aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose and was administered 30 min before CRS. Nebivolol exhibited gastroprotective effects as evidenced by significant decreases in ulcer index as well as free and total acid output, and pepsin activity in gastric juice in addition to gastric mucosal malondialdehyde concentration, with concomitant increases in gastric juice pH and mucin concentration along with gastric mucosal reduced glutathione and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations compared with CRS rats. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that nebivolol treatment markedly enhanced heme oxygenase-1 as well as cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 expressions. The protective effects of nebivolol were confirmed by gastric histopathological examination. Pretreatment with N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine, a NO synthase inhibitor, partly altered the protection afforded by nebivolol. In conclusion, nebivolol protected rats' gastric mucosa against CRS-induced gastric ulceration possibly through anti-oxidant activity, enhancement of gastric mucosal  and reduction in acid secretory parameters.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To assess whether this effect is applicable to the brain, we used high-speed amperometry to measure the changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc) levels of oxygen and glucose induced by intravenous injections of NE in awake freely moving rats. We found that NE at low doses (2-18 μg/kg) induces correlative increases in NAc oxygen and glucose, suggesting local vasodilation and enhanced entry of these substances in brain tissue from the arterial blood. By using temperature recordings from the NAc, temporal muscle, and skin, we show that this central effect is associated with strong skin vasoconstriction and phasic increases in intrabrain heat production, indicative of metabolic neural activation. A tight direct correlation between NE-induced changes in metabolic activity and NAc levels of oxygen and glucose levels suggests that local cerebral vasodilation is triggered via a neurovascular coupling mechanism. Our data suggest that NE, by changing vascular tone and cardiac activity, triggers a visceral sensory signal that rapidly reaches the central nervous system via sensory nerves and induces neural activation. This neural activation leads to a chain of neurovascular events that promote entry of oxygen and glucose in brain tissue, thus preventing any possible metabolic deficit during functional activation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using high-speed amperometry and thermorecording in freely moving rats, we demonstrate that intravenous norepinephrine at physiological doses induces rapid correlative increases in nucleus accumbens oxygen and glucose levels coupled with increased intrabrain heat production. Although norepinephrine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, by changing cardiac activity and vascular tone, it creates a sensory signal that reaches the central nervous system via sensory nerves, induces neural activation, and triggers a chain of neurovascular events that promotes intrabrain entry of oxygen and glucose.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24901844>Mice lacking inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors exhibit dry eye.</a></h2><p>Tear secretion is important as it supplies water to the ocular surface and keeps eyes moist. Both the parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways contribute to tear secretion. Although intracellular Ca2+ elevation in the acinar cells of lacrimal glands is a crucial event for tear secretion in both the pathways, the Ca2+ channel, which is responsible for the Ca2+ elevation in the sympathetic pathway, has not been sufficiently analyzed. In this study, we examined tear secretion in mice lacking the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) types 2 and 3 (Itpr2-/-;Itpr3-/-double-knockout mice). We found that tear secretion in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways was abolished in Itpr2-/-;Itpr3-/- mice. Intracellular Ca2+ elevation in lacrimal acinar cells after acetylcholine and epinephrine stimulation was abolished in Itpr2-/-;Itpr3-/- mice.

Inflammatory cell infiltration into the lacrimal glands and elevation of serum autoantibodies, a representative marker for Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in humans, were also detected in older Itpr2-/-;Itpr3-/- mice.

The loss of synapses is an important event in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Here we show that aggregated recombinant human αSN, but not βSN, triggered synapse damage in cultured neurons as measured by the loss of synaptic proteins. Pre-treatment with the selective cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) inhibitors AACOCF3 and MAFP protected neurons against αSN-induced synapse damage. Synapse damage was associated with the αSN-induced activation of synaptic cPLA2 and the production of prostaglandin E2. The activation of cPLA2 is the first step in the generation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and PAF receptor antagonists (ginkgolide B or Hexa-PAF) also protect neurons against αSN-induced synapse damage. αSN-induced synapse damage was also reduced in neurons pre-treated with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (squalestatin). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that αSN triggered synapse damage via hyperactivation of cPLA2. They also indicate that αSN-induced activation of cPLA2 is influenced by the cholesterol content of membranes.

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated as an important lipid mediator in the formation of pulmonary and extrapulmonary edema. Ostensibly, the PAF-induced signaling pathways in endothelial cells utilize similar structures and molecules including acid sphingomyelinase, ceramide, caveolae, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and nitric oxide, in pulmonary and systemic microvessels. Yet, the constituents of these signaling pathways act and respond in distinctly different and frequently opposing ways in the lung versus organs of the systemic circulation. By confronting seemingly discrepant findings from the literature, we reconstruct the differential signaling pathways by which PAF regulates edema formation in the systemic and the pulmonary vascular bed, and trace this dichotomy from the level of myosin light chain kinase via the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and sphingomyelinase signaling to the level of caveolar trafficking. Here, we propose that PAF regulates vascular   in individual organs by opposing signaling pathways that culminate in increased respectively decreased nitric oxide synthesis in the systemic and the pulmonary endothelium. The present review may provide a physiological explanation for the overall disappointing results of previous pharmacological strategies in conditions of generalized  failure such as sepsis, and instead advertises the development of organ-specific interventions by targeting the individual composition or trafficking of endothelial caveolae.Copyright 2010 S.

This complex condition is characterized by significant blood brain  leakage that stems from cerebral ischemia, inflammation, and redox imbalances in the traumatic penumbra of the injured brain. Recovery of  after TBI is partly through neuronal plasticity. In order to test whether treatments that enhance plasticity might improve functional recovery, a controlled cortical impact (CCI) in adult mice, as a model of TBI, in which a controlled cortical impactor produced full thickness lesions of the forelimb region of the sensorimotor cortex, was performed. Once trauma has occurred, combating these exacerbations is the keystone of an effective TBI therapy. The endogenous fatty acid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is one of the members of N-acyl- family that maintain not only redox balance but also inhibit the mechanisms of secondary injury. Therefore, we tested whether PEA shows efficacy in a mice model of experimental TBI. PEA treatment is able to reduced edema and brain infractions as evidenced by decreased 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining across brain sections. PEA-mediated improvements in tissues histology shown by reduction of lesion size and improvement in apoptosis level further support the efficacy of PEA therapy. The PEA treatment blocked infiltration of astrocytes and restored CCI-mediated reduced expression of PAR, nitrotyrosine, iNOS, chymase, tryptase, CD11b and GFAP. PEA inhibited the TBI-mediated decrease in the expression of pJNK and NF-κB.

It is caused by damage to the alveolar  with subsequent alveolar flooding leading to the development of refractory hypoxaemia. beta Agonists stimulate alveolar fluid clearance in animal models of lung injury. In a clinical trial (BALTI-1), intravenous beta agonists reduced extravascular lung water, an effect that took 72 h in contrast with what animal studies suggest. One possible explanation for the delay in change in extravascular lung water is the time required for salbutamol to stimulate alveolar epithelial repair.To investigate whether salbutamol can stimulate alveolar epithelial repair in vivo and in vitro.Intravenous salbutamol reduced measures of alveolar-capillary permeability in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In vitro, salbutamol stimulated both wound repair, and spreading and proliferation of A549 cells and distal lung epithelial cells. Lung lavage fluid from patients treated with salbutamol enhanced wound repair responses compared with placebo treated patients in vitro by an interleukin 1beta dependent mechanism.Our in vivo and in vitro work suggests that salbutamol may stimulate epithelial repair--potentially a pharmacological first in ARDS.

The effect of T/HS on the endothelium (endotheliopathy of trauma [EoT]) is of intense research interest and may lead to EoT-directed therapies. Administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in trauma patients is associated with a survival benefit and fewer complications if given early after injury. Mechanisms for this protective effect include the antifibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory effects of TXA. We hypothesized that "early" administration of TXA would abrogate vascular endothelial cell activation and injury after T/HS. This was studied in vitro.Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide and/or epinephrine to stimulate post-T/HS oxidant exposure and/or sympathoadrenal activation. TXA was added 15 minutes, 60 minutes, or 120 minutes after H2O2 and/or epinephrine challenge. Endothelial cell injury was indexed by cell monolayer permeability, intracellular adhesion molecule expression, soluble thrombomodulin, syndecan release (marker for glycocalyx injury), tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and angiopoietin-2/angiopoietin-1 ratio (APO-2/APO-1).Endothelial activation and injury as indexed by permeability, ICAM expression, soluble thrombomodulin were increased by H2O2 and/or epinephrine exposure. Biomarkers of endothelial coagulation profile (tPA/PAI-1) demonstrated a profibrinolytic profile (increased tPA and tPA/PAI-1 ratio) after challenge by H2O2 and/or epinephrine. Vascular "leakiness" as indexed by APO-2/APO-1 ratio was also evident. The most profound effects were noted with H2O2/epinephrine exposure.

Blood-borne proinflammatory cytokines, markers of inflammation, induce cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) activity in perivascular macrophages of the blood-brain . COX-2 generates prostaglandin E(2), which may enter the brain and increase sympathetic nerve activity. We examined the contribution of this mechanism to augmented sympathetic drive in rats after myocardial infarction (MI). Approximately 24 hours after acute MI, rats received an intracerebroventricular injection (1 microL/min over 40 minutes) of clodronate liposomes (MI+CLOD) to eliminate brain perivascular macrophages, liposomes alone, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid. A week later, COX-2 immunoreactivity in perivascular macrophages and COX-2 mRNA and protein had increased in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus of MI rats treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid or liposomes alone compared with sham-operated rats. In MI+CLOD rats, neither perivascular macrophages nor COX-2 immunoreactivity was seen in the paraventricular nucleus, and COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were similar to those in sham-operated rats. Prostaglandin E(2) in cerebrospinal fluid, paraventricular nucleus neuronal excitation, and plasma norepinephrine were less in MI+CLOD rats than in MI rats treated with artificial cerebrospinal fluid or liposomes alone but more than in sham-operated rats. Intracerebroventricular CLOD had no effect on interleukin 1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA and protein in the paraventricular nucleus or plasma interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which were increased in MI compared with sham-operated rats. In normal rats, pretreatment with intracerebroventricular CLOD reduced (P<0.05) the renal sympathetic, blood pressure, and heart rate responses to intracarotid artery injection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (0.5 microg/kg); intracerebroventricular liposomes had no effect.

High dietary intake of cholesterol is such a factor that has been shown to increase or decrease the risk of PD. However, because circulating cholesterol does not cross the blood-brain , the mechanisms linking dietary cholesterol to the pathogenesis of PD remain to be understood. In contrast to cholesterol, the oxidized cholesterol metabolites (oxysterols), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), can cross the blood-brain  and may place the brain at risk of degeneration. In this study, we incubated the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h with 24-OHC, 27-OHC, or a mixture of 24-OHC plus 27-OHC, and have determined effects on tyrosine hydroxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis) levels, alpha-synuclein levels, and apoptosis. We demonstrate that while 24-OHC increases the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, 27-OHC increases levels of alpha-synuclein, and induces apoptosis. Our findings show for the first time that oxysterols trigger changes in levels of proteins that are associated with the pathogenesis of PD.

In the LG tumor group, similar changes in metabolic concentrations were detected, although the alterations were more pronounced. The LG tumors also had higher concentrations of choline, taurine, and lactate. Subdividing the LG and HG tumors into large and small tumors revealed a significant increase in choline and decrease in glutamate as the LG tumors increased in size. Our results show that metabolic profiles produced by (1)H MRS can be used to distinguish between two distinct glioblastoma phenotypes.

Experimental liver disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal microbiota depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut microbiota diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut microbiota composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human NASH, nor did it augment the intestinal  integrity or intestinal inflammation. In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to microbiota proficient control mice. This phenotype was driven by pronounced neutrophil infiltration, while AB treatment only slightly increased monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) abundance.

Ionic liquids were recently used to enhance transdermal drug delivery by improving drug solubility. In the present study, safe and effective ionic liquids for transdermal absorption were obtained as salts generated by a neutralization reaction between highly biocompatible aliphatic carboxylic acids (octanoic acid or isostearic acid) and aliphatic amines (diisopropanolamine or triisopropanolamine) (Medrx Co., Ltd., 2009). The mechanism of skin permeability enhancement by ionic liquids was investigated by hydrophilic phenol red and hydrophobic tulobuterol. Further, the skin permeation enhancing effect was remarkably superior in the acid excess state rather than the neutralization state. Infrared absorption spectrum analysis confirmed that ionic liquids/aliphatic carboxylic acid/aliphatic amine are coexisting at all mixing states. In the acid excess state, ionic liquids interact with aliphatic carboxylic acids via hydrogen bonds. Thus, the skin permeation enhancing effect is not caused by the ionic liquid alone. The "liquid salt mixture," referred to as a complex of ingredients coexisting with ionic liquids, forms a molecular assembly incorporating hydrophilic drug.

After 1 min of CPR, 10 of the piglets received 0.4 U/kg of arg(8)-vasopressin (V group), and 10 piglets received 0.4 U/kg of arg(8)-vasopressin, 1 min later followed by 20 µg/kg body weight of adrenaline, and another 1 min later continuous administration (10 µg/kg/min) of adrenaline (VA group). After 8 min of CPR, the piglets were defibrillated and monitored for another 3 h. Then they were killed and the brain immediately removed pending histological analysis.During CPR, the VA group had higher mean blood pressure and cerebral cortical blood flow (CCBF) but similar coronary perfusion pressure. After restoration of spontaneous circulation there was no difference in the pressure variables, but CCBF tended to be (36% ± 16%) higher in the V group. Neuronal injury and signs of a disrupted blood-brain  (BBB) were greater, 20% ± 4% and 21% ± 4%, respectively, in the VA group.

The serotonin (5-HT) producing small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor cell line KRJ-1 has been used in in vitro proliferation and secretion studies, but its use in in vivo models has been hampered by problems related to the xeno- and tumor formation. This may be overcome by the encapsulation of tumor cells into alginate microspheres, which can  as bioreactors and protect against the host immune system. We used alginate encapsulation of KRJ-1 cells to achieve long-term functionality, growth and survival. Different conditions, including capsule size, variations in M/G content, gelling ions (Ca(2+) /Ba(2+)) and microcapsule core properties, and variations in KRJ-1 cell condition (single cells/spheroids) were tested. Viability and cell growth was evaluated with MTT, and confocal laser scanner microscopy combined with LIVE/DEAD viability stains. 5-HT secretion was measured to determine functionality. Under all conditions, single cell encapsulation proved unfavorable due to gradual cell death, while encapsulation of aggregates/spheroids resulted in surviving, functional bioreactors. The most ideal spheroids for encapsulation were 200-350 μm. Long-term survival (>30 days) was seen with solid Ca(2+) /Ba(2+) microbeads and hollow microcapsules. Basal 5-HT secretion was increased (sixfold) after hollow microcapsule encapsulation, while Ca(2+) /Ba(2+) microbeads was associated with normal basal secretion and responsiveness to cAMP/PKA activation. In conclusion, encapsulation of KRJ-1 cells into hollow microcapsules produces a bioreactor with a high constitutively activate basal 5-HT secretion, while Ca(2+) /Ba(2+) microbeads provide a more stable bioreactor similar to non-encapsulated cells. Alginate microspheres technology can thus be used to tailor different functional bioreactors for both in vitro and in vivo studies.© 2012 Japanese Cancer Association.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19524267>Lipoxin a(4) attenuates microvascular fluid leak during inflammation.</a></h2><p>The release of proinflammatory cytokines during inflammation disturbs the endothelial  and can initiate significant intravascular volume loss. Proinflammatory cytokines also induce the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as lipoxin, which promote the resolution of inflammation. Our hypothesis is that lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) reverses the increased microvascular fluid leak observed during inflammatory conditions.Microvascular fluid leak (L(p)) was measured in rat mesenteric venules using a micro-cannulation technique. L(p) was measured under the following conditions: (1) LXA(4) (100 nM) alone (n = 5), (2) LXA(4) (100 nM) administered after endothelial hyperpermeability induced by a continuous perfusion of 10 nM platelet activating factor (PAF) (n = 5), (3) LXA(4) (100 nM) perfused after inflammation induced by a systemic bolus of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n = 5), and (4) LXA(4) (100 nM) perfused after LPS-induced inflammation during inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (n = 4).LXA(4) alone slightly increased L(p) from baseline (L(p)-baseline = 1.05 +/- 0.03, L(p)-LXA(4) = 1.55 +/- 0.04; P < 0.0001). PAF increased L(p) 4-fold (L(p)-baseline = 1.20 +/- 0.10, L(p)-PAF = 4.49 +/- 0.95; P < 0.0001). LXA(4) administration after PAF decreased L(p) 66% versus PAF alone (from 4.49 +/- 0.95 to 1.54 +/- 0.13; P = 0.0004). LPS-induced inflammation increased L(p) over 2-fold (L(p)-baseline = 1.05 +/- 0.03, L(p)-LPS = 2.27 +/- 0.13; P < 0.0001). LXA(4) administration after LPS decreased L(p) 42% versus LPS alone (from 2.27 +/- 0.13 to 1.31 +/- 0.05; P < 0.0001).

The activity of LXA(4) may be partly mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway. These data support an anti-inflammatory role for LXA(4) and suggests a potential pharmacologic role for LXA(4) during inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23940649>Phospholipid metabolism in an industry microalga Chlorella sorokiniana: the impact of inoculum sizes.</a></h2><p>Chlorella sorokiniana is an important industry microalga potential for biofuel production. Inoculum size is one of the important factors in algal large-scale culture, and has great effects on the growth, lipid accumulation and metabolism of microalgae. As the first  of cell contents, membrane plays a vital role in algal inoculum-related metabolism. The knowledge of phospholipids, the main membrane component and high accumulation of phospholipids as the major content of total lipids mass in some microalgae, is necessary to understand the role of membrane in cell growth and metabolism under different inoculum density. Profiling of C. sorokiniana phospholipids with LC-MS led to the identification of 119 phospholipid species. To discover the phospholipid molecules most related to change of inoculum sizes, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was employed and the results revealed that inoculum sizes significantly affected phospholipid profiling. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidyl-  (PE) and several phosphatidylcholine (PC) species might play an important role under our experimental conditions. Further analysis of these biomarkers indicated that cell membrane status of C. sorokiniana might play an important role in the adaption to the inoculum sizes. And the culture with inoculum size of 1 × 10(6) cells mL(-1) presented the best membrane status with the highest content of PC and PG, and the lowest content of PE. We discovered that the inoculum size of 1 × 10(6) cells mL(-1) might provide the best growth condition for C. sorokiniana. Also we proposed that PG, PE and several PC may play an important role in inoculum-related metabolism in C. sorokiniana, which may work through thylakoid membrane and photosynthetic pathway.

In contrast to the intestinal mucosa, pulmonary epithelia are only covered by a thin film of lining fluid. Submersed cell culture systems would not allow to studying the deposition of aerosol particles and their effects on this delicate epithelial tissue. We developed a new Pharmaceutical Aerosol Deposition Device on Cell Cultures (PADDOCC) to mimic the inhalation of a single metered aerosol dose and its subsequent deposition on filter-grown pulmonary epithelial cell monolayers exposed to an air-liquid interface. The reproducibility of deposition of these dry powder aerosols and subsequent drug transport across Calu-3 monolayers with commercially available dry powder inhalers containing salbutamol sulphate or budesonide could be demonstrated.

An inherited deficiency of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) causes mucopolysaccharidosis type VII that is characterized by increased systemic and CNS storage of glycosaminoglycans. We previously showed that the neonate uses the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor to transport phosphorylated GUS (P-GUS) across the BBB and that this transporter is lost with maturation. Induction of expression of this BBB transporter would make enzyme replacement therapy in the adult possible. Here, we tested pharmacological manipulation with epinephrine to restore functional transport of P-GUS across the adult BBB. Epinephrine (40 nmol) coinjected i.v. with (131)I-P-GUS induced the transport across the BBB in 8-week-old mice. The brain influx rate of (131)I-P-GUS (0.29 mul/g per min) returned to the level seen in neonates. Capillary depletion showed that 49% of the (131)I-P-GUS in brain was in brain parenchyma. No increases of influx rate or the vascular space for (125)I-albumin, a vascular marker, was observed with epinephrine (40 nmol), showing that enhanced passage was not caused by disruption of the BBB. Brain uptake of (131)I-P-GUS was significantly inhibited by M6P in a dose-dependent manner, whereas epinephrine failed to increase brain uptake of nonphosphorylated GUS. Thus, the effect of epinephrine on the transport of (131)I-P-GUS was ligand specific. These results indicate that epinephrine restores the M6P receptor-mediated functional transport of (131)I-P-GUS across the BBB in adults to levels seen in the neonate.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21380808>Disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton and monolayer  integrity induced by PAF and the protective effect of ITF on intestinal epithelium.</a></h2><p>To explore whether platelet-activating factor (PAF) can disrupt the intestinal epithelial  directly and is associated with structural alterations of the F-actin-based cytoskeleton, and to observe the protective effect of intestinal trefoil factor (ITF), we establish an intestinal epithelia  model using Caco-2 cells in vitro.

PAF significantly increased paracellular permeability, at the same time, F-actin and tight junction proteins were disrupted. It was thought that ITF could reverse the high permeability by restoring normal F-actin, ZO-1 and Claudin-1 structures. These results collectively demonstrated that PAF plays an important role in the regulation of mucosal permeability and the effects of PAF are correlated with structural alterations of the F-actin-based cytoskeleton and of tight junctions.

Accordingly, common sets of upregulated inflammatory cytokines are found in serum, vitreous and aqueous samples obtained from subjects with DR, and these cytokines can have multiple interactions to impact the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, based on previously published data, we investigated the effects of Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid amide that belongs to the N-acyl- family, on DR in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. PEA (10mg/kg) was administered orally daily starting 3 days after the iv administration of STZ. The rats were killed 15 and 60day later and eyes were enucleated to evaluate, through immunohistochemical analysis, the key inflammatory events involved in the breakdown of blood retinal  (BRB). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of VEGF, ICAM-1, nitrotyrosine (a marker of peroxynitrite), and tight junctions in the retina of STZ-treated rats. Of interest, the extent of injury was significantly reduced after treatment with PEA. Altogether, this study provides the first evidence that PEA attenuates the degree of inflammation while preserving the blood-retinal  in rats with experimental DR.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We present evidences that the current view of the membrane as a  of permeability that contains an aqueous solution of macromolecules may be replaced by one in which the membrane plays a structural and functional role. Although this idea has been previously suggested, the present is the first systematic work that puts into relevance the relation water-membrane in terms of thermodynamic and structural properties of the interphases that cannot be ignored in the understanding of cell . To pursue this aim, we introduce a new definition of interphase, in which the water is organized in different levels on the surface with different binding energies. Altogether determines the surface free energy necessary for the structural response to changes in the surrounding media. The physical chemical properties of this region are interpreted in terms of hydration water and confined water, which explain the interaction with proteins and could affect the modulation of enzyme activity. Information provided by several methodologies indicates that the organization of the hydration states is not restricted to the membrane plane albeit to a region extending into the cytoplasm, in which polar head groups play a relevant role. In addition, dynamic properties studied by cyclic voltammetry allow one to deduce the energetics of the conformational changes of the lipid head group in relation to the head-head interactions due to the presence of carbonyls and phosphates at the interphase. These groups are, apparently, surrounded by more than one layer of water molecules: a tightly bound shell, that mostly contributes to the dipole potential, and a second one that may be displaced by proteins and osmotic stress. Hydration water around carbonyl and phosphate groups may change by the presence of polyhydroxylated compounds or by changing the chemical groups esterified to the phosphates, mainly choline,  or glycerol. Thus, surface membrane properties, such as the dipole potential and the surface pressure, are modulated by the water at the interphase region by changing the structure of the membrane components. An understanding of the properties of the structural water located at the hydration sites and the functional water confined around the polar head groups modulated by the hydrocarbon chains is helpful to interpret and analyze the consequences of water loss at the membranes of dehydrated cells. In this regard, a correlation between the effects of water activity on cell growth and the lipid composition is discussed in terms of the recovery of the cell volume and their viability. Critical analyses of the properties of water at the interface of lipid membranes merging from these results and others from the literature suggest that the interface links the membrane with the aqueous soluble proteins in a functional unit in which the cell may be considered as a complex structure stabilized by water rather than a water solution of macromolecules surrounded by a semi permeable .</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775525>Ingestion of (n-3) fatty acids augments basal and platelet activating factor-induced permeability to dextran in the rat mesenteric vascular bed.</a></h2><p>Loss of intestinal   and subsequent edema formation remains a serious clinical problem leading to hypoperfusion, anastomotic leakage, bacterial translocation, and inflammatory mediator liberation. The inflammatory mediator platelet activating factor (PAF) promotes eicosanoid-mediated edema formation and vasoconstriction. Fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty acids (FA) favor the production of less injurious eicosanoids but may also increase intestinal paracellular permeability. We hypothesized that dietary (n-3) FA would ameliorate PAF-induced vasoconstriction and enhance vascular leakage of dextran tracers. Rats were fed either an (n-3) FA-rich diet (EPA-rich diet; 4.0 g/kg EPA, 2.8 g/kg DHA) or a control diet (CON diet; 0.0 g/kg EPA and DHA) for 3 wk. Subsequently, isolated and perfused small intestines were stimulated with PAF and arterial pressure and the translocation of fluid and macromolecules from the vasculature to lumen and lymphatics were analyzed. In intestines of rats fed the EPA-rich diet, intestinal phospholipids contained up to 470% more EPA and DHA at the expense of arachidonic acid (AA). The PAF-induced increase in arterial pressure was not affected by the EPA-rich diet. However, PAF-induced fluid loss from the vascular perfusate was higher in intestines of rats fed the EPA-rich diet. This was accompanied by a greater basal loss of dextran from the vascular perfusate and a higher PAF-induced transfer of dextran from the vasculature to the lumen (P = 0.058) and lymphatics. Our data suggest that augmented intestinal  permeability to fluid and macromolecules is a possible side effect of (n-3) FA-rich diet supplementation.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752492>An allosteric model for control of pore opening by substrate binding in the EutL microcompartment shell protein.</a></h2><p>The  utilization (Eut) microcompartment is a protein-based metabolic organelle that is strongly associated with pathogenesis in bacteria that inhabit the human gut. The exterior shell of this elaborate protein complex is composed from a few thousand copies of BMC-domain shell proteins, which form a semi-permeable diffusion  that provides the interior enzymes with substrates and cofactors while simultaneously retaining metabolic intermediates. The ability of this protein shell to regulate passage of substrate and cofactor molecules is critical for microcompartment , but the details of how this diffusion  can allow the passage of large cofactors while still retaining small intermediates remain unclear. Previous work has revealed two conformations of the EutL shell protein, providing substantial evidence for a gated pore that might allow the passage of large cofactors. Here we report structural and biophysical evidence to show that , the substrate of the Eut microcompartment, acts as a negative allosteric regulator of EutL pore opening. Specifically, a series of X-ray crystal structures of EutL from Clostridium perfringens, along with equilibrium binding studies, reveal that  binds to EutL at a site that exists in the closed-pore conformation and which is incompatible with opening of the large pore for cofactor transport. The allosteric mechanism we propose is consistent with the cofactor requirements of the Eut microcompartment, leading to a new model for EutL . Furthermore, our results suggest the possibility of redox modulation of the allosteric mechanism, opening potentially new lines of investigation.© 2015 The Protein Society.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21166930>Beta-adrenergic stimulation contributes to maintenance of endothelial  functions under baseline conditions.</a></h2><p>cAMP signaling within the endothelium is known to reduce paracellular permeability and to protect against loss of  functions under various pathological conditions.

This cAMP signal is steered toward effectors that promote junctional integrity and is inactivated before it accesses microtubules, where the cAMP signal causes phosphorylation of tau, leading to microtubule disassembly and  disruption. During infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a type III secretion system to inject a soluble AC, ExoY, into the cytosol of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. ExoY generates a cAMP signal that disrupts the endothelial cell . We tested the hypothesis that this ExoY-dependent cAMP signal causes phosphorylation of tau, without inducing phosphorylation of membrane effectors that strengthen endothelial  .

AC6 was resolved in caveolin-rich lipid raft fractions with calcium channel proteins and the cell adhesion molecules N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and activated leukocyte adhesion molecule. VE-cadherin was excluded from the caveolin-rich fractions and was detected in the bulk plasma membrane fractions. The actin binding protein, filamin A, was detected in all membrane fractions. Isoproterenol activation of ACs promoted filamin phosphorylation, whereas thrombin inhibition of AC6 reduced filamin phosphorylation within the membrane fraction. In contrast, ExoY produced a cAMP signal that did not cause filamin phosphorylation yet induced tau phosphorylation. Hence, our data indicate that cAMP signals are strictly compartmentalized; whereas cAMP emanating from transmembrane ACs activates -enhancing targets, such as filamin, cAMP emanating from soluble ACs activates -disrupting targets, such as tau.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25071367>N-palmitoylethanolamine and N-acetylethanolamine are effective in asteatotic eczema: results of a randomized, double-blind, controlled study in 60 patients.</a></h2><p>Asteatotic eczema (AE) is characterized by itchy, dry, rough, and scaling skin.

However, recently it has been demonstrated that, when applied directly via the nasal passages in the rat, dopamine exerts neurochemical and behavioural action, including increases of dopamine in striatal subregions, antidepressive-like action, and increased behavioral activity. These effects could potentially be mediated by exogenous dopamine acting as a direct agonist at postsynaptic dopamine receptors. However, it is also possible that intranasally applied dopamine acts indirectly via the modulation of the activity of dopaminergic cell bodies. To approach this question, the present study used rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nigrostriatal tract, as these lesions lead to pharmacologically stimulated behavioural asymmetries which are specific for direct and indirect dopamine agonists. We found that 7 days of repeated treatment with intranasal dopamine induced a sensitization of the turning response to amphetamine, but not to apomorphine. Furthermore, intranasal dopamine dose-dependently increased the use of the forepaw ipsilateral to the 6-OHDA-lesioned side of the brain. These results suggest that intranasally administered dopamine acts via an indirect mechanism of action, putatively by increasing the release of endogenous dopamine in the brain.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25712316>Modulation of the activity of moxifloxacin and solithromycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model of Streptococcus pneumoniae naive and induced biofilms.</a></h2><p>Bacterial biofilms developing in the bronchial tree of patients experiencing acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECBs) are suggested to cause relapses and recurrences of the disease because the matrix  impairs antibiotic access to the offending organisms. We examined whether bronchodilators could modulate pneumococcal biofilm development and antibiotic action using an in vitro model.Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from patients hospitalized for AECBs and two reference strains (ATCC 49619 and R6) were screened for biofilm formation (multi-well plates; 2-11 days of growth). Ipratropium and salbutamol (alone or in combination) were added at concentrations of 1.45 and 7.25 mg/L, respectively (mimicking those in the bronchial tree), and their effects were measured on biofilm formation and modulation of the activity of antibiotics [full antibiotic concentration-dependent effects (pharmacodynamic model)] with a focus on moxifloxacin and solithromycin. Bacterial viability and biomass were measured by the reduction of resazurin and crystal violet staining, respectively. Release of sialic acid (from biofilm) and neuraminidase activity were measured using enzymatic and HPLC-MS detection of sialic acid.All clinical isolates produced biofilms, but with fast disassembly if from patients who had received muscarinic antagonists. Ipratropium caused: (i) reduced biomass formation and faster biofilm disassembly with free sialic acid release; and (ii) a marked improvement of antibiotic activity (bacterial killing and biomass reduction). Salbutamol stimulated neuraminidase activity associated with improved antibiotic killing activity (reversed by zanamivir) but modest biomass reduction.Ipratropium and, to a lesser extent, salbutamol may cooperate with antibiotics for bacterial clearance and disassembly of pneumococcal biofilms.© The Author 2015.

Indeed vertebrates, including humans, preferentially use docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) over other long-chain n-3 PUFA for the genesis of their neuronal and retinal membranes. The grey mouse lemur is a nocturnal prosimian primate originating from Madagascar. The increased use of this omnivorous primate in nutritional studies (chronic caloric restriction, n-3 fatty acids supplementation), justifies the interest of determining their fatty acids body composition. In the present study, we report the fatty acid composition in lipid classes from the main target tissues (brain, retina, liver and adipose tissue) of six adult mouse lemurs raised under laboratory nutritional conditions. Among the main findings, n-6-docosapentaenoic acid (n-6-DPA; 22:5n-6) is very low in the brain cortex and retina, whereas there is a very high accumulation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in the neural tissues compared to liver and plasma. In particular, DHA accounts for about one half of the total fatty acids in the retina  glycerophospholipids. This high concentration clearly indicates that DHA is efficiently transferred from blood lipids to the outer segment of the mouse lemur retina. We conclude that the mouse lemur n-3 PUFA metabolism efficiently drives DHA to neural tissues, through the blood-brain  and the blood-retina .</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28367972>A brain-sparing diphtheria toxin for chemical genetic ablation of peripheral cell lineages.</a></h2><p>Conditional expression of diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is widely used for tissue-specific ablation of cells. However, diphtheria toxin (DT) crosses the blood-brain , which limits its utility for ablating peripheral cells using Cre drivers that are also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). Here we report the development of a brain-sparing DT, termed BRAINSPAReDT, for tissue-specific genetic ablation of cells outside the CNS. We prevent blood-brain  passage of DT through PEGylation, which polarizes the molecule and increases its size. We validate BRAINSPAReDT with regional genetic sympathectomy: BRAINSPAReDT ablates peripheral but not central catecholaminergic neurons, thus avoiding the Parkinson-like phenotype associated with full dopaminergic depletion. Regional sympathectomy compromises adipose tissue thermogenesis, and renders mice susceptible to obesity. We provide a proof of principle that BRAINSPAReDT can be used for Cre/DTR tissue-specific ablation outside the brain using CNS drivers, while consolidating the link between adiposity and the sympathetic nervous system.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26363074>Substrate-induced unlocking of the inner gate determines the catalytic efficiency of a neurotransmitter:sodium symporter.</a></h2><p>Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) mediate reuptake of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and are targets for several therapeutics and psychostimulants. The prokaryotic NSS homologue, LeuT, represents a principal structural model for Na(+)-coupled transport catalyzed by these proteins. Here, we used site-directed fluorescence quenching spectroscopy to identify in LeuT a substrate-induced conformational rearrangement at the inner gate conceivably leading to formation of a structural intermediate preceding transition to the inward-open conformation. The substrate-induced, Na(+)-dependent change required an intact primary substrate-binding site and involved increased water exposure of the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 5. The findings were supported by simulations predicting disruption of an intracellular interaction network leading to a discrete rotation of transmembrane segment 5 and the adjacent intracellular loop 2. The magnitude of the spectroscopic response correlated inversely with the transport rate for different substrates, suggesting that stability of the intermediate represents an unrecognized rate-limiting  in the NSS transport mechanism.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710070>TNF-α receptor 1 knockdown in the subfornical organ ameliorates sympathetic excitation and cardiac hemodynamics in heart failure rats.</a></h2><p>In systolic heart failure (HF), circulating proinflammatory cytokines upregulate inflammation and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity in cardiovascular regions of the brain, contributing to sympathetic excitation and cardiac dysfunction. Important among these is the subfornical organ (SFO), a forebrain circumventricular organ that lacks an effective blood-brain  and senses circulating humors. We hypothesized that the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the SFO contributes to sympathetic excitation and cardiac dysfunction in HF rats. Rats received SFO microinjections of a TNFR1 shRNA or a scrambled shRNA lentiviral vector carrying green fluorescent protein, or vehicle. One week later, some rats were euthanized to confirm the accuracy of the SFO microinjections and the transfection potential of the lentiviral vector. Other rats underwent coronary artery ligation (CL) to induce HF or a sham operation. Four weeks after CL, vehicle- and scrambled shRNA-treated HF rats had significant increases in TNFR1 mRNA and protein, NF-κB activity, and mRNA for inflammatory mediators, RAS components and c-Fos protein in the SFO and downstream in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, along with increased plasma norepinephrine levels and impaired cardiac , compared with vehicle-treated sham-operated rats. In HF rats treated with TNFR1 shRNA, TNFR1 was reduced in the SFO but not paraventricular nucleus, and the central and peripheral manifestations of HF were ameliorated. In sham-operated rats treated with TNFR1 shRNA, TNFR1 expression was also reduced in the SFO but there were no other effects. These results suggest a key role for TNFR1 in the SFO in the pathophysiology of systolic HF. Activation of TNF-α receptor 1 in the subfornical organ (SFO) contributes to sympathetic excitation in heart failure rats by increasing inflammation and renin-angiotensin system activity in the SFO and downstream in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Cytokine receptors in the SFO may be a target for central intervention in cardiovascular conditions characterized by peripheral inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22785226>Aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 reduces mucosal inflammation and promotes resolution in a murine model of acute lung injury.</a></h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe illness with excess mortality and no specific therapy. Protective actions were recently uncovered for docosahexaenoic acid-derived mediators, including D-series resolvins. Here, we used a murine self-limited model of hydrochloric acid-induced ALI to determine the effects of aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1; 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) on mucosal injury. RvD1 and its receptor ALX/FPR2 were identified in murine lung after ALI. AT-RvD1 (~0.5-5 μg kg(-1)) decreased peak inflammation, including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils by ~75%. Animals treated with AT-RvD1 had improved epithelial and endothelial  integrity and decreased airway resistance concomitant with increased BALF epinephrine levels. AT-RvD1 inhibited neutrophil-platelet heterotypic interactions by downregulating both P-selectin and its ligand CD24. AT-RvD1 also significantly decreased levels of BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, Kupffer cells, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and decreased nuclear factor-κB-phosphorylated p65 nuclear translocation. Taken together, these findings indicate that AT-RvD1 displays potent mucosal protection and promotes catabasis after ALI.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18649123>Can ultrasound solve the transport  of the neural retina?</a></h2><p>Intravitreal injection of nonviral gene complexes may be promising in the treatment of retinal diseases. This study investigates the permeation of lipoplexes and polystyrene nanospheres through the neural retina and their uptake by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) either with or without ultrasound application.Anterior parts and vitreous of bovine eyes were removed. The neural retina was left intact or peeled away from the RPE. (Non)pegylated lipoplexes and pegylated nanospheres were applied. After 2 h incubation, the RPE cells were detached and analyzed for particle uptake by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.The neural retina is a significant transport  for pegylated nanospheres and (non)pegylated lipoplexes. Applying ultrasound improved the permeation of the nanoparticles up to 130 nm.Delivery of liposomal DNA complexes to the RPE cells is strongly limited by the neural retina. Ultrasound energy may be a useful tool to improve the neural retina permeability, given the nucleic acid carriers are small enough.

However, it should be mentioned that pharmacological models do not always take into account the complexity of the disease process. In the present paper, we demonstrated that repeated but not acute treatment with a low dose of reserpine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) led to a pharmacological model of depression which was based on its inhibitory effect on the vesicular monoamine transporter 2, and monoamines depleting action in the brain. In fact, we observed that chronic treatment with a low dose of reserpine induced a distinct depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST), and additionally, it produced a significant decrease in the level of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in the brain structures. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) and its close methyl derivative, 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) are exo/endogenous amines present naturally in the mammalian brain which demonstrated a significant antidepressant-like effect in the FST and the reserpine model of depression in the rat. Both compounds, TIQ and 1MeTIQ, administered chronically in a dose of 25 mg/kg (i.p.) together with reserpine completely antagonized reserpine-produced depression as assessed by the immobility time and swimming time. Biochemical data were in agreement with behavioral experiments and demonstrated that chronic treatment with a low dose of reserpine in contrast to acute administration produced a significant depression of monoamines in the brain structures and impaired their metabolism. These neurochemical effects obtained after repeated reserpine (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) in the brain structures were completely antagonized by joint TIQ or 1MeTIQ (25 mg/kg i.p.) administration with chronic reserpine. A possible molecular mechanism of action of TIQ and 1MeTIQ responsible for their antidepressant action is discussed. On the basis of the presented behavioral and biochemical studies, we suggest that both compounds may be effective for the therapy of depression in clinic as new antidepressants which, when administered peripherally easily penetrate the blood-brain , and as endogenous compounds may not have adverse side effects.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20073555>Drug transport across pulmonary epithelial cell monolayers: effects of particle size, apical liquid volume, and deposition technique.</a></h2><p>Pulmonary cell cultures are increasingly used to predict in vivo drug absorption after inhalation, similar to intestinal cell culture models that have already been well established to predict oral drug absorption. In contrast to the intestinal , however, the so-called air-blood  of the lung is covered only with a thin film of liquid, on which the aerosol particles are deposited. The aim of this study was to investigate the relevance of this apical liquid film on the drug absorption rate when deposited as a dry powder formulation on pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro.Budesonide and salbutamol sulfate were chosen as model drugs, and for each drug three generic aerosol powder formulations were used. Filter-grown monolayers of the human bronchial epithelial cell line Calu-3 were used as a model, using various volumes of apical liquid.Although proven to be bioequivalent in vivo for each of the two drugs, the generic dry powder fomulations showed strikingly different epithelial transport rates in vitro, depending on the amount of apical liquid and the deposition technique, and suggesting that the dissolution of the aerosol particles in the apical liquid volume was rate limiting for the overall absorption rate. However, we found that the absorption rates of the formulations were similar after aerosolization and deposition in a multistage liquid impinger, which simulates more realistically the detachment of the drug crystals from the carrier lactose and their aerodynamic particle size-dependent deposition in the respiratory tract following inhalation from a dry powder inhaler. These data demonstrate the need for improved in vitro test systems to allow deposition of aerosol particles on the air-liquid interface cultivated cell monolayers by simultaneously taking into account aerodynamic properties.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25840881>A vascular lesion mimicking a primitive brain tumour in a patient examined by (18)F-choline PET/CT and MRI.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552220>Partial functional recovery after complete spinal cord transection by combined chondroitinase and clenbuterol treatment.</a></h2><p>Spinal cord injury not only disrupts axonal tracts but also causes gliotic, fibrotic, and Schwannotic scarring with resulting deposition of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) which prevent axonal reconnection and recovery of locomotor . Here, we determined whether recovery of locomotor  could be promoted after complete transection, by degrading CSPGs enzymatically within the injury site with chondroitinase ABC (chABC) together with treatment with the beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol, a neuroprotective agent which can promote regrowth of lower motoneurons. Partial recovery of locomotor  was observed 8-12 weeks postinjury only after combined chABC and clenbuterol treatment. The recovery of locomotor  coincided with the presence of axons caudal to the injury site arising from neurons of the reticular, vestibular, and red nuclei also only with combined chABC and clenbuterol treatment. Axons myelinated by Schwann cells were most prominent in the transection site in the combined treatment group. Clenbuterol treatment activated cAMP response element binding protein within retrogradely traced neurons which has been associated with axonal regrowth. ChABC treatment decreased scarring due to both CSPG and collagen deposition as well as the gap between intact regions of the spinal cord. ChABC also increased numbers of phagocytic cells which remove myelin debris as well as populations of astrocytes thereby aiding blood-spinal cord  reformation.

We aimed to differentiate between these functions and to identify differences between spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists with different subtype selectivity or the ability to cross the blood-brain  were used to demonstrate beta-adrenoceptor involvement in resting blood pressure and the response to tyramine-induced peripheral norepinephrine release. The centrally acting propranolol (beta(1+2[+3])), CGP20712A (beta(1)), ICI-118551 (beta(2)), and SR59230A (beta(3)), as well as peripherally restricted nadolol (beta(1+2)) and atenolol (beta(1)), were administered intravenously, separately, or in combinations. Blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, total peripheral vascular resistance, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were evaluated. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists had little effect on cardiovascular baselines in normotensive rats. In hypertensive rats, antagonist-induced hypotension paralleled reductions in resistance, except for atenolol, which reduced cardiac output. The resistance reduction involved primarily neuronal catecholamine, central beta(1)-adrenoceptors, and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Tyramine induced a transient, prazosin-sensitive vascular resistance increase. Inhibition of nerve-activated, peripheral beta(1/3)-adrenoceptors enhanced this alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-dependent vasoconstriction in normotensive but not hypertensive rats. In hypertensive rats, return to baseline was eliminated after inhibition of the central beta(1)-adrenoceptor, epinephrine release (acute adrenalectomy), and peripheral beta(2/3)-adrenoceptors. Adrenalectomy eliminated beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in hypertensive rats, and tyramine induced a prazosin-sensitive vasoconstriction, which was inhibited by combined blockade of central beta(1)- and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, nerve-activated beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation was not present in hypertensive rats, whereas epinephrine-activated beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation was upregulated. There was also a hypertensive, nerve-activated vasoconstrictory mechanism present in hypertensive rats, involving central beta(1)- and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors combined.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621206>Targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling in lung diseases.</a></h2><p>Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a simple, bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, plays a key role, both intracellularly and extracellularly, in various cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, migration, inflammation, angiogenesis, and endothelial  integrity. The cellular S1P level is low and is tightly regulated by its synthesis and degradation. Sphingosine Kinases (SphKs) 1 and 2, catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of sphingosine to S1P, while the degradation is mediated by the reversible dephosphorylation catalyzed by the S1P phosphatases and lipid phosphate phosphatases and the irreversible degradation to hexadecenal and  phosphate by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (S1PL). As a ligand for specific G-protein-coupled receptors, S1P, which are differentially expressed in different cell types, S1P generates downstream signals that play crucial role in developmental and disease related pathologies. In addition to acting extracellularly on receptors located on the plasma membrane, S1P can also act intracellularly, independently of S1P, affecting calcium homeostasis and cell proliferation. The SphKs /S1P /S1PL metabolic pathway is implicated in numerous human pathologies including respiratory disorders, thereby raising the possibility that manipulating intracellular S1P levels could offer therapeutic potential in ameliorating lung diseases. This review focuses on the prospects of targeting S1P signaling and S1P metabolizing enzymes using small molecule inhibitors, receptor agonists, and antagonists in the treatment of lung diseases.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Catecholamines may exert additional detrimental effects on mesenteric blood flow in these patients, and thereby contribute to this damage. Enterocyte damage itself results in impairment of gut   and consequent translocation of bacteria/toxins. This may contribute to multiple organ failure and death by sustaining or amplifying the systemic inflammatory response. The aim of the study was 2-fold: to investigate which factors contribute to enterocyte damage in septic patients, and to assess whether enterocyte damage is associated with a sustained or amplified systemic inflammatory response.In this prospective observational cohort study in 129 patients with septic shock admitted to the ICU, we serially measured plasma levels of Intestinal Fatty Acid-Binding Protein (I-FABP, a marker for enterocyte damage) and of cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, Interferon (IFN)-y, Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (RA), and IL-10. Clinical data were collected from electronic patient files.A total of 129 patients were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 67 years [56-74]. The median norepinephrine infusion rate was 0.2 μg/kg/min [0.1-0.5]. Overall, 28-day mortality was 31 (24%). Similar to previous work, I-FABP levels at admission were independently associated with mortality (odds ratio 3.101 [1.138-8.448]). Acute  and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and an increase in norepinephrine infusion rate between days 1 and 3 were independently associated with area under curve I-FABP levels, whereas mean arterial pressure and creatinine levels were not. No correlations were found between any of the measured cytokines and plasma I-FABP levels. Furthermore, high I-FABP levels were not related with the subsequent course of cytokine levels.In patients with septic shock, norepinephrine use is associated with more enterocyte damage. Although enterocyte damage is associated with increased 28-day mortality, it is not associated with a sustained or amplified systemic inflammatory response.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17502130>Combined effects of iontophoretic and chemical enhancement on drug delivery.

Transport across human and murine skin.</a></h2><p>This paper reports measurements of the release characteristics of the model drug salbutamol from a liquid crystalline vehicle across both human and hairless murine skin in vitro. The use of oleic acid and iontophoresis as penetration enhancement techniques, used separately and simultaneously, was also investigated. Over a period of 12h, salbutamol base did not diffuse from the vehicle across excised human skin while, in contrast, over a period of 2h, the drug passively transported across hairless murine skin. The diffusion co-efficient for the drug in this tissue was estimated to be 4.54+/-0.60x10(-9)cm(2)s(-1) with a permeability co-efficient of 7.03+/-0.83x10(-7)cms(-1). A current of density of 0.39mAcm(-2) facilitated a significant transport of salbutamol from the liquid crystalline vehicle across excised human skin but with a small (<0.1) transport number. The quantity of salbutamol transported across excised hairless murine skin under the same conditions was significantly greater with a transport number of 0.68. The alteration of the permeability of the tissue was less than that of the human skin and a full recovery of the pre-iontophoretic permeability of murine skin was consistently observed. The incorporation of either oleic or lauric acid into the monoglyceride component of the vehicle at a concentration of 0.1M had a marked effect on the transport of salbutamol across both human and murine skin. The initial passive permeation of the drug across the skin was not affected but the rate of drug delivery during iontophoresis was typically observed to increase by a factor greater than two. The post-iontophoretic transport of salbutamol across either tissue was also substantially enhanced in the presence of the fatty acid. The analogous use of stearic acid did not significantly influence the iontophoretic or the post-iontophoretic transport of salbutamol across excised human skin. The investigation also revealed a synergistic combination of the fatty acid and anodal iontophoresis to enhance the in vitro transport of other drug substances, including nicotine and diltiazem hydrochloride across murine skin. Oleic acid increased both the iontophoretic and post-iontophoretic transport of nicotine, so that the enhancement of drug delivery was greater than that caused by the current alone. The investigation also indicated that the  properties of the skin recover following the constant current iontophoresis in the presence of oleic or lauric acids.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326008>The non-neuronal cholinergic system of human skin.</a></h2><p>In human skin both resident and transiently residing cells are part of the extra- or non-neuronal cholinergic system, creating a highly complex and interconnected cosmos in which acetylcholine (ACh) and choline are the natural ligands of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors with regulatory  in both  and pathophysiology.

Intrathecal terazosin blocked the effect of intravenous phenylephrine. 3) α(1)-AR subtype mRNA levels was all increased after SCI.These results suggest that α(1)-AR facilitates the micturition reflex in the spinal cord, and α(1)-AR blockers applied in the lumbosacral spinal inhibits this effect. Upregulation of α(1)-AR in the lumbosacral spinal cord could be involved in the genesis of detrusor overactivity after SCI.

The compound 13, N-{[(6S,7R)-7-(4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1,4-oxazepan-6-yl]methyl}-2-[(2H(3))methyloxy]acetamide hydrochloride, which exhibited peripheral NET selective inhibition at tested doses in rats, increased urethral resistance in a dose-dependent manner.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Regulation of transient receptor potential classical (TRPC) 6-mediated currents in lung endothelial cells was assessed by patch clamp technique.PAF increased lung weight gain and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i). This response was abrogated by inhibitors of ASM or in ASM-deficient mice, and replicated by lung perfusion with exogenous ASM or C2-ceramide. PAF increased the caveolar abundance of TRPC6 channels, which was similarly blocked by ASM inhibition. PAF-induced increases in lung endothelial [Ca(2+)](i), vascular filtration coefficient, and edema formation were attenuated by the TRPC inhibitor SKF96365 and in TRPC6-deficient mice, whereas direct activation of TRPC6 replicated the [Ca(2+)](i) and edema response to PAF. The exogenous NO donor PapaNONOate or the cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate analog 8Br-cGMP blocked the endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) and permeability response to PAF, in that they directly blocked TRPC6 channels without interfering with their PAF-induced recruitment to caveolae.The present findings outline a new signaling cascade in the induction of PAF-induced lung edema, in that stimulation of ASM causes recruitment of TRPC6 channels to caveolae, thus allowing for Ca(2+) influx and subsequent increases in endothelial permeability that are amplified in the absence of endothelial NO synthesis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851906>Acute hyperglycemia exacerbates trauma-induced endothelial and glycocalyx injury: An in vitro model.</a></h2><p>Early hyperglycemia is associated with higher mortality in trauma and predicts multiple organ failure. Endothelial cell (EC) injury and glycocalyx (GC) degradation occur following traumatic shock and are key factors in the development of trauma-induced coagulopathy and result in impaired microvascular perfusion and accompanying organ failure. Acute hyperglycemia has been shown to result in the loss of the GC layer, EC inflammation, and activation of coagulation in vivo. We postulated that acute hyperglycemia would exacerbate trauma-induced EC injury and GC shedding and integrity. This was studied using a microfluidic device in a biomimetic in vitro model.Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers established in the microfluidic channels of a microfluidic device well plate were perfused at constant shear overnight. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers were then exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation and epinephrine followed by the addition of varying concentrations of glucose.Glycocalyx shedding and loss of dimension, as well as EC injury/activation, were noted after exposure to the biomimetic conditions of trauma/shock in our study. Similar but less dramatic findings were noted after acute hyperglycemia. Exposure to hyperglycemia exacerbated the adverse effects on the GC and EC following hypoxia/reoxygenation plus epinephrine exposure and may be related to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species.Microfluidic device study may allow the preclinical assessment and development of therapeutic strategies of the vascular  under stress conditions.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26934927>Effect of Physiological Changes in the Skin on Systemic Absorption of Tacrolimus Following Topical Application in Rats.</a></h2><p>Tacrolimus (TL) ointment is a topical treatment for atopic dermatitis, a disease that exhibits various skin conditions. The effect of skin pathologies on the systemic absorption of TL and related side effects remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate factors affecting the cutaneous absorption of TL. We prepared various skin models in hairless rats by tape stripping, injection of prophlogistic material solution (PMS), and continuous subcutaneous adrenaline (Adr) infusion. In vivo absorption studies were conducted, with measurements of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin blood flow as physiological parameters. Very little TL absorption was observed through intact skin. Greater TL absorption was noted in skins with high TEWL values and fully stripped skin with PMS injections. In contrast, Adr infusion, which reduced skin blood flow, resulted in decreased TL absorption through fully stripped skin. Combined use of TL and Adr on skin with PMS injections resulted in suppression of TL absorption. Our results revealed that TL absorption following topical application is affected by alterations in the skin , blood flow, and vascular permeability. We propose an administration plan for TL in a flowchart as a means of preventing systemic side effects.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p></html>
