Although it alters fatty  (FA) metabolism, data concerning the profile of FA in CF patients with liver cirrhosis is lacking. This study aimed to assess the FA composition of serum phospholipids in CF patients with and without liver cirrhosis.The study comprised 25 CF patients with liver cirrhosis and 25 without it. We assessed Z-scores for body height and weight, lung function, exocrine pancreatic sufficiency and  with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FAs' profile of serum glycerophospholipids was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.In CF patients with liver cirrhosis, the levels of C16:0 were higher and the amounts of C20:2n-6, C20:3n-6, C20:4n-6, and all the n-3 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) (C18:3n-3, C20:5n-3, C22:5n-3, C22:6n-3) were lower than those in CF subjects without liver cirrhosis. The n-6/n-3, C20:4n-6/C18:2n-6, total n-6/C18:2n-6, C20:5n-3/C18:3n-3 and total n-3/C18:3n-3 ratios did not differ between the 2 groups.Liver cirrhosis may associate with profound abnormalities in the composition of serum glycerophospholipids FAs in CF patients. None of the analyzed clinical factors could explain the greater prevalence of low levels of PUFAs in this CF subgroup.© 2017 S.

The mechanisms involved are multifactorial and (especially for microbiome) poorly defined. A strategic approach to investigate the complexity of the microbial influence on lipid metabolism would facilitate determination of relevant molecular mechanisms for microbiome-targeted therapeutics.  is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome and we used this association in conjunction with gnotobiotic models to investigate the impact of  on lipid metabolism. To address the complexities of the integration of the microbiome and lipid metabolism, we developed transcriptomics-driven lipidomics (TDL) to predict the impact of   on lipid metabolism and established mediators of inflammation and insulin resistance including  metabolism, alterations in bile acids and dietary lipid absorption. A microbiome-related therapeutic approach targeting these mechanisms may therefore provide a therapeutic avenue supporting maintenance of metabolic health.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29029700>Lipid components of bile increase the protective effect of conjugated bile salts against antifungal drugs.</a></h2><p>Fungi and bacteria can persist in the human gall bladder. Previous studies have shown that bile protects Candida albicans in this cryptic host niche from antifungals, providing a reservoir for intestinal re- after discontinuation of antifungal therapy. Bile and conjugated bile salts trap antifungals in micelles, thereby reducing their bioavailability and possibly promoting the development of drug resistance. Here we show that the protective effect of bile and conjugated bile salts is not limited to C. albicans, but also observed with other fungi. Interestingly, bile, but not conjugated bile salts conferred resistance of C. albicans against fluconazole and only bile mediated resistance of Aspergillus terreus against voriconazole. To investigate this higher potency of bile we aimed in a step-wise reconstitution of bile from conjugated bile salts. Neither addition of phospholipids nor saturated fatty acids protected from azoles. In contrast, supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids increased azole resistance and decreased the critical micelle concentration of conjugated bile salts to the level of bile. Therefore, polyunsaturated fatty acids are vital for mixed micelle formation with high potential to trap antifungals. As biliary infections are difficult to treat, drug efficacy in the biliary system should be tested by using reconstituted synthetic bile.Copyright © 2017 British Mycological Society.

We aimed to investigate the determinants of serum glycerophospholipids' FAs in CF with regard to the highest number of FAs and in the largest cohort to date. The study comprised 172 CF patients and 30 healthy subjects (HS). We assessed Fas' profile (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), CF transmembrane conductance regulator () genotype, spirometry, fecal elastase-1, body height and weight , liver disease, diabetes and  by . The amounts of saturated FAs (C14:0, C16:0) and monounsaturated FAs (C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9, C20:1n-9, C20:3n-9) were significantly higher in CF patients than in HS. C18:3n-6, C20:3n-6 and C22:4n-6 levels were also higher in CF, but C18:2n-6, C20:2n-6 and C20:4n-6, as well as C22:6n-3, were lower. In a multiple regression analysis, levels of seven FAs were predicted by various sets of factors that included age, genotype, forced expiratory volume in one second, pancreatic status and diabetes. FA composition abnormalities are highly prevalent in CF patients. They seem to be caused by both metabolic disturbances and independent clinical risk factors. Further research into the influence of  mutations on fat metabolism and desaturases' activity is warranted.</p><p>Keyword: colonization</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30687644> Cyclooxygenase-Like Protein Regulates Cysteine Protease Expression and Virulence.</a></h2><p>The intestinal protozoan parasite  () causes amebiasis associated with severe diarrhea and/or liver abscess.  pathogenesis is multifactorial requiring both parasite virulent molecules and host-induced innate immune responses. -induced host pro-inflammatory responses plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis by causing damage to tissues allowing parasites access to systemic sites.  cyclooxygenase (Cox) derived prostaglandin E stimulates the chemokine IL-8 from mucosal epithelial cells that recruits neutrophils to the site of infection to exacerbate disease.

We analyzed the metagenome of airway microbiome to understand the associated role of upper airway microbiome with the natural course of childhood asthma.Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from children with asthma, those in asthma remission, and control groups. High-throughput sequencing was used to examine the structure and functional dynamics of the airway microbiome with respect to asthma phenotypes.The composition of microbiota differed among healthy control, asthma, and remission groups. The relative abundance of Streptococcus was negatively associated with FEV predicted (P = .023) and that of Staphylococcus was negatively associated with methacholine PC (P = .013). Genes related to  metabolites, lysine residues, and glycosaminoglycans in the microbiome could be associated with airway inflammation. In particular, genes related to synthesis of anti-inflammatory prostaglandin E (PGE ) were not detected from the airway microbiome in the asthma group.These data suggest that alterations in the composition and function of the upper airway microbiome could be related with the natural course of asthma in children.© 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.
