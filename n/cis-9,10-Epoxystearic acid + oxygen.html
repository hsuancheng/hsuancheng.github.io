One pathway of HNE formation consisted of initial oxygenation of NON into (2E)-4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE) by a novel (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase activity, followed by conversion of HPNE into HNE by a previously recognized hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. The hydroperoxide intermediate was detected in coincubations of NON and oleic acid, in which experiments the HPNE generated from NON supported epoxygenase-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid into . Furthermore, by using an enzyme preparation in which the epoxygenase had been inactivated by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide it was possible to isolate and characterize racemic (4R,4S) HPNE following incubation of NON. Although the (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase resembled a lipoxygenase in its action, it was not inhibited by the lipoxygenase inhibitors, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. In a second pathway, HNE was produced by rearrangement of 3,4-epoxynonenal, which was in turn formed from NON by a reaction catalyzed by hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. Support for this pathway came from experiments in which 18O-labeled HNE was isolated following coincubation of NON and 13-18O-labeled linoleic acid 13-hydroperoxide. The existence of 3,4-epoxynonenal as a transient intermediate in HNE biosynthesis was further demonstrated by the isolation of 3,4-epoxynonenal (61% (4R)-configuration) as a trapping product in short time incubations interrupted by addition of sodium borohydride. The two  established for biosynthesis of HNE involved the hydroperoxide-reducing and the olefin-epoxidizing activities of hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. In the absence of extraneous olefins and hydroperoxides the two  would be tightly coupled and follow the stoichiometry: 2NON + 1O2-->2HNE. It was also shown that the V. faba particle fraction catalyzed oxygenation of (3Z)-hexenal into (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-hexenal.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5782360>Gas--liquid chromatography--mass spectrophotometry of hydroxylated octadecanols derived from hydroxylated stearic acids.</a></h2><p>A gas-liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric method of determining the position of oxygen atoms on polyfunctional fatty acids has been explored. The method consists of reduction of keto, hydroperoxy, epoxy, and carboxylic acid groups with LiAlH(4) to the corresponding alcohols; trimethylsilylation with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide; and analysis by means of the combined gas-liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The following compounds were analyzed: 9-mono-, 9,10-di-, 9,10,12-tri-, and 9,10,12,13-tetrahydroxystearic acids and the corresponding derivatives of octadecan-1-ol. The reduction products of  and a mixture of linoleic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides were also analyzed. The position of the oxygen function in the original molecule can be deduced rapidly and accurately.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11358528>CYP94A5, a new cytochrome P450 from Nicotiana tabacum is able to catalyze the oxidation of fatty acids to the omega-alcohol and to the corresponding diacid.</a></h2><p>A full length cDNA encoding a new cytochrome P450-dependent fatty acid hydroxylase (CYP94A5) was isolated from a tobacco cDNA library. CYP94A5 was expressed in S. cerevisiae strain WAT11 containing a P450 reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana necessary for catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. When incubated for 10 min in presence of NADPH with microsomes of recombinant yeast,  was converted into one major metabolite identified by GC/MS as 18-hydroxy-. The kinetic parameters of the reaction were Km,app = 0.9 +/- 0.2 microM and Vmax,app = 27 +/- 1 nmol x min(-1) x nmol(-1) P450. Increasing the incubation time to 1 h led to the formation of a compound identified by GC/MS as 9,10-epoxy-octadecan-1,18-dioic acid. The diacid was also produced in microsomal incubations of 18-hydroxy-. Metabolites were not produced in incubations with microsomes of yeast transformed with a control plasmid lacking CYP94A5 and their production was inhibited by antibodies raised against the P450 reductase, demonstrating the involvement of CYP94A5 in the reactions. The present study describes a cytochrome P450 able to catalyze the complete set of reactions oxidizing a terminal methyl group to the corresponding carboxyl. This new fatty acid hydroxylase is enantioselective: after incubation of a synthetic racemic mixture of , the chirality of the residual epoxide was 40/60 in favor of 9R,10S enantiomer. CYP94A5 also catalyzed the omega-hydroxylation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with aliphatic chain ranging from C12 to C18.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p></html>
