This study investigated the potential interaction with and effect of biofluid components, namely cholic ,  and ursodeoxycholic , on AgNP toxicity. Two cell lines corresponding to organs related to the biofluid components were employed. These were HepG-2 a hepatocellular carcinoma derived from liver tissue and Hep2 an epithelial cell line. Physiochemical and cytotoxic screening was performed and the ability of biofluid components to modify AgNP cytotoxicity was explored. No alteration to the physiochemical characteristics of AgNP by biofluid components was demonstrated. However, biofluid component addition resulted in alteration of AgNP toxicity. Greater reactive  species induction was noted in the presence of cholic  and . Ursodeoxycholic  demonstrated no modification of toxicity in HepG-2 cells; however, significant modification was noted in Hep2 cells. It is concluded that biofluid components can modify AgNP toxicity but this is dependent on the biofluid component itself and the location where it acts.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17308059>17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin enhances the lethality of  in primary rodent hepatocytes and established cell lines.</a></h2><p>Ansamycin antibiotics that target heat shock protein 90 function are being developed as anticancer agents but are also known to be dose limiting in patients due to hepatotoxicity. Herein, to better understand how the normal tissue toxicity of geldanamycins could be ameliorated to improve the therapeutic index of these agents, we examined the interactions of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) and the secondary bile   (DCA) in hepatocytes and fibroblasts. DCA and 17AAG interacted in a greater than additive fashion to cause hepatocyte cell death within 2 to 6 h of coadministration. As single agents DCA, but not 17AAG, enhanced the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, AKT, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Combined exposure of cells to DCA and 17AAG further enhanced JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK activity. Inhibition of JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK, but not activator protein-1, suppressed the lethality of 17AAG and of 17AAG and DCA. Constitutive activation of AKT, but not MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2, suppressed 17AAG- and DCA-induced cell killing and reduced activation of JNK1/2. DCA and 17AAG exposure promoted association of BAX with mitochondria, and functional inhibition of BAX or caspase-9, but not of BID and caspase-8, suppressed 17AAG and DCA lethality. DCA and 17AAG interacted in a greater than additive fashion to promote and prolong the generation of reactive  species (ROS). ROS-quenching agents, inhibition of mitochondrial function, expression of dominant-negative thioredoxin reductase, or expression of dominant-negative apoptosis signaling kinase 1 suppressed JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation and reduced cell killing after 17AAG and DCA exposure. The potentiation of DCA-induced ROS production by 17AAG was abolished by Ca(2+) chelation and ROS generation, and cell killing following 17AAG and DCA treatment was abolished in cells lacking expression of PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase. Thus, DCA and 17AAG interact to stimulate Ca(2+)-dependent and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase-dependent ROS production; high levels of ROS promote intense activation of the p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 pathways that signal to activate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825559>Anti-oxidants do not prevent bile -induced cell death in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, reactive  species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines are crucial regulators of cell death in acute and chronic liver diseases. The contribution of each factor to hepatocyte death, either apoptosis or necrosis, has not been clarified as yet. It has been suggested that the generation of oxidative stress by bile acids contributes to hepatocyte death during cholestasis and bile  toxicity, although the beneficial role of ROS prevention in bile -mediated cell death is not fully understood.Study the effects of anti-oxidants in bile -induced cell death in vitro.Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to the bile acids glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) or taurolithocholic -3 sulphate in the absence or presence of ROS scavengers or anti-oxidants. Haeme oxygenase (HO)-1 mRNA levels were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Apoptosis was quantified by acridine orange staining and caspase-3 activity assay. Necrosis was detected by Sytox green staining.Anti-oxidants do not attenuate bile -induced cell death. Furthermore, bile  exposure does not enhance the mRNA expression of the oxidative stress-responsive gene HO-1. The Src-kinase inhibitor, SU6656, does reduce GCDCA-induced apoptosis and necrosis.In hepatocytes, bile -induced toxicity is not prevented by scavengers of oxidative stress. The beneficial effects observed in patients might be because of the contribution of ROS and cytokines rather than bile -mediated oxidative stress. However, the use of specific Src kinase inhibitors might be a useful tool to prevent bile -induced injury in liver diseases.© 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18685914>Genotoxic effect of bile acids on human normal and tumour colon cells and protection by dietary antioxidants and butyrate.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is the second cause of death for tumour worldwide. Among the risk factors for this disease the dietary habits seem to have a pivotal role. An elevated intake of fats causes a high release in the gut lumen of bile acids that are positively correlated with colorectal cancer, since they act as detergents and proliferation promoters. Recently, it was evidenced that bile acids can also be able to induce DNA damage.In this study the genotoxicity of  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  CDCA) has been evaluated in human normal colonocytes derived from 60 colon biopsies and in tumour cells. The involvement of reactive  species (ROS) and the oxidative DNA damage was assessed. In addition, the protective effect exerted by both two well-known antioxidants commonly present in the diet, beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol, and butyrate which is known to be involved in the regulation of several cellular functions, has also been tested.The DNA damage was evaluated by the "comet assay" or single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) both in its conventional use and by the Endonuclease III modified method, which allow to detect the presence of oxidized pyrimidines.Bile acids (CDA and CDCA) resulted genotoxic on both normal and tumour human colon cells. The inclusion of the endonuclease III digestion step in the comet assay demonstrated that bile acids induced an oxidative DNA damage. In addition, treatment of colonocytes with bile acids in the presence of the antioxidants (beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol) and Na-butyrate caused a reduction of DNA damage.Our results suggest that bile acids may be involved in the tumour initiation by inducing a DNA oxidative damage, and so add further evidences to the preventive properties of antioxidants present in the Mediterranean diet.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16171810>Hydrophilic bile salt ursodeoxycholic  protects myocardium against reperfusion injury in a PI3K/Akt dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>The opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) during reperfusion injury of heart has been well demonstrated and thus controlling PTP would attenuate the myocardial damage and cell death. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a hydrophilic bile salt and has been shown to prevent apoptosis in hepatocytes by inhibiting the opening of PTP. Here we demonstrate the role of UDCA in preventing the reperfusion injury of heart through its ability to inhibit PTP. Wistar rats underwent 30 min left coronary artery occlusion (LCA) followed by 180 min reperfusion after treatment with 40 mg/kg per iv infusion of UDCA over 30 min before LCA occlusion. Other groups of rats were treated with PTP agonist atractyloside(5 mg/kg) or PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin (16 ug/kg) before UDCA treatment. UDCA treatment prior to LCA occlusion, activated phosphorylation of Akt and Bad. Phosphorylating Bad prevented its translocation in to mitochondria, there by preventing the down regulation of Bcl-2 expression and PTP opening. This was confirmed by reduced cytochrome C release from intramitochondrial space in to the cytosol and hence reduced cell death either by apoptosis (4.8 vs 11.8%, P<0.001, UDCA treated against control group) or necrosis (reduced MI area in UDCA treated group (22.1%) compared to control group(46.4%), P<0.001). In contrast, inhibition of Akt activation with PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or opening the PTP with atractyloside abolished, UDCA mediated cytoprotective effects. Studies on primary culture cardiomyocytes also confirmed our in vivo results of UDCA on cell survival. These results altogether demonstrate that UDCA protect the heart against reperfusion injury by inhibiting the PTP in a PI3K/Akt dependent pathway.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22561666>Sodium deoxycholate inhibits chick duodenal calcium absorption through oxidative stress and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>High concentrations of sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC) produce toxic effects. This study explores the effect of a single high concentration of NaDOC on the intestinal Ca(2+) absorption and the underlying mechanisms. Chicks were divided into two groups: 1) controls and 2) treated with different concentrations of NaDOC in the duodenal loop for variable times. Intestinal Ca(2+) absorption was measured as well as the gene and protein expressions of molecules involved in the Ca(2+) transcellular pathway. NaDOC inhibited the intestinal Ca(2+) absorption, which was concentration dependent. Ca(2+)-ATPase mRNA decreased by the bile salt and the same occurred with the protein expression of Ca(2+)-ATPase, calbindin D(28k) and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. NaDOC produced oxidative stress as judged by ROS generation, mitochondrial swelling and glutathione depletion. Furthermore, the antioxidant quercetin blocked the inhibitory effect of NaDOC on the intestinal Ca(2+) absorption. Apoptosis was also triggered by the bile salt, as indicated by the TUNEL staining and the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. As a compensatory mechanism, enzyme activities of the antioxidant system were all increased. In conclusion, a single high concentration of NaDOC inhibits intestinal Ca(2+) absorption through downregulation of proteins involved in the transcellular pathway, as a consequence of oxidative stress and mitochondria mediated apoptosis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The present results demonstrated that UDCA could effectively inhibit the proliferation of two human melanoma cell line (M14 and A375) with time‑ and concentration‑dependence. Following exposure to various concentrations of UDCA, M14 cells exhibited typical morphological changes and weaker ability of colony forming. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that UDCA could induce a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in M14 cells. The cell cycle was arrested in the G2/M phase, which was confirmed by the decrease of cyclin‑dependent kinase 1 and cyclinB1 at the protein level. However, when M14 cells were treated with UDCA and Z‑VAD‑FMK (caspase inhibitor) synchronously, the apoptosis rate of the cells was reduced significantly. In addition, it was demonstrated that UDCA induced apoptosis of human melanoma M14 cells through the ROS‑triggered mitochondrial‑associated pathway, which was indicated by the increased expression of cleaved‑caspase‑3, cleaved‑caspase‑9, apoptotic protease activating factor‑1, cleaved‑poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 and the elevation of B cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) associated X protein/Bcl‑2 ratio associated with apoptosis.

The method regarding bile  active absorption was validated, then, the portal venous content was examined for fibroblast growth factor 15(FGF15), a putative signaling protein produced by the ileal enterocytes following bile  absorption. After isolation and cannulation of the relevant vessels (abdominal aorta and portal vein), the abdominal aorta and the terminal ileum were infused with respectively Krebs-Ringer solution and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) and the absorption was assessed by its recovery in the portal vein. After immunoblot, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis were performed both on gel bands digestion products and on portal outflow samples in order to evaluate if negligible amounts of FGF15 were present in the portal circulation. TUDCA absorption was efficient, intestinal morphology and  consumption were normal. Despite accurate analysis, we could not find FGF15. Our method proved to be reliable for studying the active bile  absorption. It is also suitable to identify molecules produced by enterocytes and transferred to the portal circulation in response to absorption of different substances such as nutrients or drugs. Since FGF15 was not recovered we suggest the possibilities that this protein is produced in very little amounts, poorly transferred outside the cell, or that it is extremely unstable and rapidly degraded.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22552910>Inhibition of butyrate uptake by the primary bile salt chenodeoxycholic  in intestinal epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that bile acids may play a role in CRC etiology. Our aim was to characterize the effect of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) upon(14) C-BT uptake in tumoral (Caco-2) and non-tumoral (IEC-6) intestinal epithelial cell lines. A 2-day exposure to CDCA markedly and concentration-dependently inhibited (14) C-BT uptake by IEC-6 cells (IC(50) = 120 µM), and, less potently, by Caco-2 cells (IC(50) = 402 µM). The inhibitory effect of CDCA upon (14) C-BT uptake did not result from a decrease in cell proliferation or viability. In IEC-6 cells: (1) uptake of (14) C-BT involves both a high-affinity and a low-affinity transporter, and CDCA acted as a competitive inhibitor of the high-affinity transporter; (2) CDCA inhibited both Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate cotransporter 1 (SMCT1)- and H(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated uptake of (14) C-BT; (3) CDCA significantly increased the mRNA expression level of SMCT1; (4) inhibition of (14) C-BT uptake by CDCA was dependent on CaM, MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38 pathways), and PKC activation, and reduced by a reactive  species scavenger. Finally, BT (5 mM) decreased IEC-6 cell viability and increased IEC-6 cell differentiation, and CDCA (100 µM) reduced this effect. In conclusion, CDCA is an effective inhibitor of (14) C-BT uptake in tumoral and non-tumoral intestinal epithelial cells, through inhibition of both H(+) -coupled MCT1- and SMCT1-mediated transport. Given the role played by BT in the intestine, this mechanism may contribute to the procarcinogenic effect of CDCA at this level.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15382121>Bile acids induce mitochondrial ROS, which promote activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and signaling pathways in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated in hepatocytes that  (DCA) promotes inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) and activation of ERBB1 and the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway. The present studies have determined the biochemical mechanism(s) through which these events occur. DCA and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) (100 micromol/L) caused activation of ERBB1, insulin receptor, and the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways in primary rodent hepatocytes. DCA- and TDCA-induced receptor and signaling pathway activations were blocked by the reactive  species (ROS) scavengers N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and Trolox (TX), as well as by cyclosporin A (CsA) and bongkrekic  (BKA). DCA activated the ERK1/2 pathway in HuH7 human hepatoma cells that was blocked by the incubation of cells with an ERBB1 inhibitor, NAC, TX, CsA, or BKA. DCA did not activate the ERK1/2 pathway in mitochondria-defective HuH7 Rho 0 cells. In HuH7 cells and primary hepatocytes, DCA enhanced the production of ROS, an effect that was abolished in Rho 0 cells and by prior incubation of cells with CsA or BKA. In hepatocytes and HuH7 cells, DCA inhibited PTPase activity. Incubation of hepatocytes with either CsA or BKA prevented DCA-induced inhibition of PTPase activity. Loss of mitochondrial function in Rho 0 cells also abolished the inhibitory effects of DCA on PTPase activity. In conclusion, DCA and TDCA cause ROS generation in hepatocytes that is dependent on metabolically active mitochondria. The generation of ROS is essential for PTPase inactivation, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, and enhanced signaling down the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16540769>Therapy of NAFLD: antioxidants and cytoprotective agents.</a></h2><p>Lipid peroxidation and secondary cellular injury are the dominant mechanism in the transition from relatively stable hepatic steatosis to potentially progressive steatohepatitis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oxidation of excessive fatty acids generates free radicals (reactive  species) that damage organelles and stimulate signaling pathways leading to fibrosis and cellular injury. Both antioxidant agents (by breaking the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation) and cytoprotective agents (by stabilizing cellular and organelle phospholipid membranes) may be effective agents in treating an active steatohepatitis through amelioration of the driving force and attenuation of the secondary effects. Here we have reviewed the existing studies on such therapies, including vitamin E, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), betaine, and ursodeoxycholic . Small trials suggest possible improvement in liver enzymes with the use of these agents in NAFLD. However, controlled studies have not uniformly demonstrated benefit from these agents when compared with control groups treated with diet and weight loss alone, and measurement of reliable histologic endpoints is limited. These agents may show benefit in NAFLD through future larger controlled studies. Particular promise may exist in the use of these agents in combination therapy with ones that target other aspects in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, such as insulin-sensitizing agents.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843188>Critical Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia-Induced Deficits in Synaptic Plasticity and Long-Term Memory.</a></h2><p>This study examined the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mediating chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH)-induced neurocognitive deficits. We designed experiments to demonstrate that ER stress is initiated in the hippocampus under chronic IH and determined its role in apoptotic cell death, impaired synaptic structure and plasticity, and memory deficits.Two weeks of IH disrupted ER fine structure and upregulated ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein, in the hippocampus, which could be suppressed by ER stress inhibitors, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric . Meanwhile, ER stress induced apoptosis via decreased Bcl-2, promoted reactive oxygen species production, and increased malondialdehyde formation and protein carbonyl, as well as suppressed mitochondrial function. These effects were largely prevented by ER stress inhibitors. On the other hand, suppression of oxidative stress could reduce ER stress. In addition, the length of the synaptic active zone and number of mature spines were reduced by IH. Long-term recognition memory and spatial memory were also impaired, which was accompanied by reduced long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral pathway. These effects were prevented by coadministration of the TUDCA.These results show that ER stress plays a critical role in underlying memory deficits in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-associated IH.

Thus, further understanding long-term survival and differentiation of stem cells may uncover new targets for discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches. We have previously described the impact of mitochondrial apoptosis-related events in modulating neural stem cell (NSC) fate. In addition, the endogenous bile , tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) was shown to be neuroprotective in several animal models of neurodegenerative disorders by acting as an anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant molecule at the mitochondrial level. Here, we hypothesize that TUDCA might also play a role on NSC fate decision. We found that TUDCA prevents mitochondrial apoptotic events typical of early-stage mouse NSC differentiation, preserves mitochondrial integrity and function, while enhancing self-renewal potential and accelerating cell cycle exit of NSCs. Interestingly, TUDCA prevention of mitochondrial alterations interfered with NSC differentiation potential by favoring neuronal rather than astroglial conversion. Finally, inhibition of mitochondrial reactive  species (mtROS) scavenger and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase revealed that the effect of TUDCA is dependent on mtROS and ATP regulation levels. Collectively, these data underline the importance of mitochondrial stress control of NSC fate decision and support a new role for TUDCA in this process.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436193>Antibacterial and anti-atrophic effects of a highly soluble,  stable UDCA formula in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis.</a></h2><p>Helicobacter pylori is one of the main causes of atrophic gastritis and gastric carcinogenesis. Gastritis can also occur in the absence of H. pylori as a result of bile reflux suggesting the eradication of H. pylori by bile acids.

Surprisingly, H. pylori-induced expression of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic  cycle, at both the protein and mRNA levels. However, the UDCA formula repressed MDH expression and increased the membrane potential thereby increasing the ATP level and body weight in vivo. Moreover, UDCA scavenged the reactive  species (ROS), increased the membrane potential, and inhibited apoptosis in AGS cells exposed to H(2)O(2) in vitro through the mitochondria-mediated pathway.

Doxorubicin (DOX) and reactive  species have also been implicated in the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is encoded by the MDR1 gene and causes antitumor multidrug resistance. In the present study, we assessed the effects of UDCA on the expression of MDR1 mRNA, P-gp, and intracellular reactive  species levels in DOX-treated HepG2 cells and compared them to those of other bile acids. DOX-induced increases in reactive  species levels and the expression of MDR1 mRNA were inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, and the DOX-induced increase in reactive  species levels and DOX-induced overexpression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp were inhibited by UDCA. Cells treated with UDCA showed improved rhodamine 123 uptake, which was decreased in cells treated with DOX alone. Moreover, cells exposed to DOX for 24h combined with UDCA accumulated more DOX than that of cells treated with DOX alone. Thus, UDCA may have inhibited the overexpression of P-gp by suppressing DOX-induced reactive  species production. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) also exhibited these effects, whereas  and litocholic  were ineffective. In conclusion, UDCA and CDCA had an inhibitory effect on the induction of P-gp expression and reactive  species by DOX in HepG2 cells.

This is a life-threatening infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Primary cutaneous disease may occur following traumatic implantation of spores, or use of contaminated bandages, or as a complication of extensive burns, diabetic acidosis and other specific immunocompromised conditions. The clinical spectrum is highly non-specific and is often triggered by seemingly innocuous trauma. The superficial vesicles or patchy erythema rapidly degrade to haemorrhagic necrosis and rapidly progressive gangrenous lesion. The problem with diagnosing mucormycosis remains, therefore, that the condition has poor clinical indicators and requires reliance on microscopy and fungal culture. Management starts with a clinical suspicion, taking into account the risk factors and lack of response to first-line agents, as well as an aggressive clinical course. Treatment is multimodal, with medical correction of the risk factors and optimisation of limiting factors, such as diabetes, neutropenia and immunosuppressants.

How specific bile acids promote neoplasia is as yet unknown, as are the exact identities of the important bile  subtypes. The combination of bile subtype with appropriate pH is critical, as pH alters bile  activity enormously. Hence glycine-conjugated bile acids are involved in neoplastic development at acidic pH (pH ~4), and unconjugated bile acids are involved in neoplastic development at more neutral pH (~6). Bile acids (at the appropriate pH) are potent DNA-damaging agents, due to the induction of ROS (reactive  species), which are mainly induced by bile-induced damage to mitochondrial membranes, allowing leakage of ROS into the cytosol. These ROS also induce pro-survival signalling pathways [e.g. via PKC (protein kinase C)-dependent NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) activity]. Interestingly, NOS (nitric oxide synthase), through induction of NO may exacerbate this NF-kappaB activity and form a positive-feedback loop to amplify the activation of NF-kappaB by  in particular. This combination of induced DNA damage and cell survival by bile acids is of major importance in neoplasia.

The Ce6/DS-DOCA nanoagents could generate highly reactive singlet oxygen under laser irradiation. Also, in vitro studies showed that they were more specifically taken up by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activated macrophages (RAW 264.7) via a SR-A-mediated endocytosis, relative to by non-activated macrophages, and notably induced cell death of activated macrophages under laser irradiation.

We have previously shown that deoxycholate (DOC) activates NF-kappaB in hepatocytes and colon epithelial cells and that persistent exposure of HCT-116 cells to increasing concentrations of DOC results in the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB, which is associated with the development of apoptosis resistance.

AP was induced by intraductal infusion of two different concentrations of glycodeoxycholic  (GDOC 17 mmol and 34 mmol). An equal number of animals had only cannulation of the pancreatic duct without infusion and served as controls (GDOC-control). In another experimental model iv.-infusion of oleic  (OA) was used to create severe lung injury comparable to human ARDS. In this model control animals received iv.-infusion of saline solution only (SAL). At 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours the animals were sacrificed and blood was collected for determination of FFA, amylase and pO2. The pancreas and lungs were removed for histologic examination and the lungs were weighed. GDOC-34 animals developed severe pancreatitis with hemorrhage and necrosis. Histology of the lungs showed edema, inflammatory infiltrates, hemorrhage and thickening of the alveolar membrane in GDOC-34 rats as well as in OA-animals. In contrast, there was only pancreatic edema until 24 hours in the GDOC 17 group and less severe histological changes in the lungs. Amylase, FFA, pO2 and lung weight were directly influenced by the different kinds of treatment. Furthermore, FFA correlated positively with the levels of amylase and lung weight and negatively with pO2. Infusion of OA alone also caused an increase in levels of amylase with pancreatic edema and focal necroses in some animals. These results show that it was possible to create different degrees of severity of AP which was in concordance with different degrees of morphologic changes and dysfunction in the lungs. FFA values correlated significantly with the clinical course as well as with increasing amylase, lung weight and decreasing pO2.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252519>Ursodeoxycholate inhibits induction of NOS in human intestinal epithelial cells and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) has anti-inflammatory and chemoprotective effects in animal models of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. Because overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) by the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) is implicated in the pathogenesis of these conditions, we investigated the ability of UDCA to inhibit NO production in transformed human intestinal epithelial (DLD-1) cells. Nitrite/nitrate production was measured by the Griess reaction, enzymatic activity of iNOS was assessed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, and protein and mRNA were measured by Western and Northern blotting. Dose-dependent inhibition of interleukin-1 beta- and interferon-gamma-stimulated nitrite/nitrate production was observed when cells were preincubated for 6 h with UDCA (0-800 microM), and a substantial inhibition (81 +/- 3.2%) was seen at 500 microM. In cytokine-stimulated cells, UDCA reduced iNOS mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity without exerting cytotoxicity. UDCA had a minimal direct inhibitory effect on iNOS enzyme activity. UDCA pretreatment also reduced the expression of iNOS in the colonic epithelium of rats treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Thus UDCA inhibits the induction of epithelial iNOS in vitro and in vivo, and this effect may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and chemoprotective actions of UDCA.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9741584>The effect of idebenone, a coenzyme Q analogue, on hydrophobic bile  toxicity to isolated rat hepatocytes and hepatic mitochondria.</a></h2><p>Oxidant stress induced by hydrophobic bile acids has been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver injury in cholestatic liver disorders. We evaluated the effect of idebenone, a coenzyme Q analogue, on taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDC)-induced cell injury and oxidant stress in isolated rat hepatocytes and on glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDC)-induced generation of hydroperoxides in fresh hepatic mitochondria. Isolated rat hepatocytes in suspension under 9%  atmosphere were preincubated with 0, 50, and 100 micromol/l idebenone for 30 min and then exposed to 1000 micromol/l TCDC for 4 h. LDH release (cell injury) and thiobarbituric  reactive substances (measure of lipid peroxidation) increased after TCDC exposure but were markedly suppressed by idebenone pretreatment. In a second set of experiments, the addition of 100 micromol/l idebenone up to 3 h after hepatocytes were exposed to 1000 micromol/l TCDC resulted in abrogation of subsequent cell injury and markedly reduced oxidant damage to hepatocytes. Chenodeoxycholic  concentrations increased to 5.15 nmol/10(6) cells after 2 h and to 7.05 after 4 h of incubation of hepatocytes with 1000 micromol/l TCDC, and did not differ in the presence of idebenone. In freshly isolated rat hepatic mitochondria, when respiration was stimulated by succinate, 10 micromol/l idebenone abrogated the generation of hydroperoxides during a 90-minute exposure to 400 micromol/l GCDC. These data demonstrate that idebenone functions as a potent protective hepatocyte antioxidant during hydrophobic bile  toxicity, perhaps by reducing generation of  free radicals in mitochondria.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23150771>Obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress causes chronic inflammation in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue plays a central role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis under normal conditions. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction. In this study, we observed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the inflammatory response occurred in adipose tissue of mice fed a high-fat diet for a period of 16 weeks. After 16 weeks of feeding, ER stress markers increased and chronic inflammation occurred in adipose tissue. We found that ER stress is induced by free fatty  (FFA)-mediated reactive  species (ROS) generation and up-regulated gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Oral administration to obese mice of chemical chaperons, which alleviate ER stress, improved chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, followed by the suppression of increased body weight and improved insulin signaling.

Additional evaluations using gene ontology (GO) indicate that significant enrichment occurred in the  transportation, defensive reactions, and protein modifications of the decreased DEGs as well as in the cell morphological formation, neural development, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling of the increased DEGs on day 21.  transportation was also significantly enriched for downregulated DEGs on day 35.

Further, pretreatment of 50 mM glucose-treated VL-17A cells with NAC or UDCA decreased oxidative stress (levels of reactive oxygen species and protein carbonylation), apoptosis (caspase 3 activity and annexin V-propidium iodide positive cells) and glutathionylated protein formation, a measure of oxidative stress. GSH depletion with 0.4 mM buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or 1 mM diethyl maleate (DEM) potentiated the decrease in viability, glyoxalase I activity and increase in oxidative stress and apoptosis, with decreased GSH levels in 50 mM glucose-treated VL-17A cells.Thus, changes in GSH levels with exogenous agents such as NAC, UDCA, BSO or DEM modulate hyperglycemia-mediated injury in a cell model of VL-17A liver cells.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820500>Monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein (MCPIP) promotes inflammatory angiogenesis via sequential induction of oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.</a></h2><p>Major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, obesity and tumor growth are known to involve inflammation. Inflammatory molecules such as MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 are known to promote angiogenesis. MCP-induced protein (MCPIP), originally discovered as a novel zinc finger protein induced by MCP-1, is also induced by other inflammatory agents. MCPIP was shown to mediate MCP-1-induced angiogenesis. Whether angiogenesis induced by other inflammatory agents is mediated via MCPIP is unknown and the molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis induced by MCPIP have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to bridge this gap and delineate the sequential processes involved in angiogenesis mediated via MCPIP. siRNA knockdown of MCPIP was used to determine whether different inflammatory agents, MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8, mediate angiogenesis via MCPIP in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Chemical inhibitors and specific gene knockdown approach were used to inhibit each process postulated. Oxidative stress was inhibited by apocynin or cerium oxide nanoparticles or knockdown of NADPH oxidase subunit, phox47. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was blocked by tauroursodeoxycholate or knockdown of ER stress signaling protein IRE-1 and autophagy was inhibited by the use of 3'methyl adenine, or LY 294002 or by specific knockdown of beclin1. Matrigel assay was used as a tool to study angiogenic differentiation induced by inflammatory agents or MCPIP overexpression in HUVECs. Tube formation induced by inflammatory agents, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 and MCP-1 was inhibited by knockdown of MCPIP. Forced MCPIP-expression induced oxidative stress, ER stress, autophagy and angiogenic differentiation in HUVECs. Inhibition of each step caused inhibition of each subsequent step postulated. The results reveal that angiogenesis induced by inflammatory agents is mediated via induction of MCPIP that causes oxidative and nitrosative stress resulting in ER stress leading to autophagy required for angiogenesis. The sequence of events suggested to be involved in inflammatory angiogenesis by MCPIP could serve as possible targets for therapeutic intervention of angiogenesis-related disorders.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Pharmacologic inhibition of photoreceptor cell death may prevent this outcome. This study tests whether systemic administration of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) can protect photoreceptors from cell death after experimental retinal detachment in rodents.Retinal detachment was created in rats by subretinal injection of hyaluronic . The animals were treated daily with vehicle or TUDCA (500 mg/kg). TUNEL staining was used to evaluate cell death. Photoreceptor loss was evaluated by measuring the relative thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Macrophage recruitment, oxidative stress, cytokine levels, and caspase levels were also quantified. Three days after detachment, TUDCA decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared to vehicle (651±68/mm(2) vs. 1314±68/mm(2), P = 0.001) and prevented the reduction of ONL thickness ratio (0.84±0.03 vs. 0.65±0.03, P = 0.002). Similar results were obtained after 5 days of retinal detachment. Macrophage recruitment and expression levels of TNF-a and MCP-1 after retinal detachment were not affected by TUDCA treatment, whereas increases in activity of caspases 3 and 9 as well as carbonyl-protein adducts were almost completely inhibited by TUDCA treatment.Systemic administration of TUDCA preserved photoreceptors after retinal detachment, and was associated with decreased oxidative stress and caspase activity.

COX-2 is involved in both inflammation and carcinogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms by which bile acids promote COX-2 expression in the oesophagus are largely unknown. We analysed the molecular mechanisms that govern bile -mediated expression of COX-2 in Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA).The effects of bile acids on COX-2 expression were analysed in immortalised Barrett's oesophagus and OA cells using immunoblotting and transient transfections. Pharmacological inhibitors, phospho-specific antibodies, dominant-negative mutants and siRNA techniques were used to identify relevant signalling pathways. Flow cytometry and reactive  species (ROS) scavengers were used to examine ROS involvement. Immunohistochemistry was performed on oesophageal mucosa obtained from an established rat model of bile reflux.Unconjugated bile acids potently stimulated COX-2 expression and induced AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in concert with COX-2 induction. These findings were mimicked in the in vivo rat model. Dominant-negative (DN) AKT and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) or U0126 (MEK-1/2 inhibitor) blocked chenodeoxycholic  (CD) and  (DC) mediated COX-2 induction. CD and DC also induced CREB phosphorylation and AP-1 activity. CREB-specific siRNA and DN AP-1 blocked CD and DC-induced COX-2 induction.

However, whether T cells contribute to renal sodium retention and salt-sensitive hypertension is unknown. Here we demonstrate that T cells infiltrate into the kidney of salt-sensitive hypertensive animals. In particular, CD8 T cells directly contact the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in the kidneys of DOCA-salt mice and CD8 T cell-injected mice, leading to up-regulation of the Na-Cl co-transporter NCC, p-NCC and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Co-culture with CD8 T cells upregulates NCC in mouse DCT cells via ROS-induced activation of Src kinase, up-regulation of the K channel Kir4.1, and stimulation of the Cl channel ClC-K. The last event increases chloride efflux, leading to compensatory chloride influx via NCC activation at the cost of increasing sodium retention.

Because of our prior finding that the intravenous contrast medium (CM) accentuates the severity of ANP by promoting further necrosis and higher mortality, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which this injury is mediated.Mild acute pancreatitis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats with intravenous caerulein hyperstimulation; and severe ANP, with intravenous caerulein plus intraductal glycodeoxycholic . Control animals and rats with pancreatitis were randomized to be given intravenous CM or saline.Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to measure the index of hemoglobin content and  saturation in pancreatic tissues in vivo. saturation of hemoglobin was increased in animals with mild acute pancreatitis (AP) (mean [+/- SEM], 58.7% +/- 1.2% vs 55.2% +/- 1.5% in control animals; P < .05) and was decreased in animals with ANP (51.2% +/- 1.2% vs 55.2% +/- 1.5%; P < .05). Fifteen minutes after the infusion of CM,  saturation of hemoglobin significantly decreased further in animals with ANP (51.4% +/- 1.8% before infusion of CM vs 46.1% +/- 1.7% at 15 minutes; P < .05) and remained significantly below the comparable group receiving intravenous saline for the entire 60-minute test. This decrement was not observed in animals with ANP given saline or in animals with mild AP or in control animals after infusion of saline or CM. The index of hemoglobin content remained unchanged throughout the experiment in all groups.The prolonged reduction of  saturation of hemoglobin in the pancreas following the administration of intravenous CM in rats with severe ANP indicates that CM impairs the pancreatic microcirculation in necrotizing forms of AP. This may explain our previous finding that CM increases pancreatic injury and mortality in rodents with ANP, and it underlines our concern that the use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography early in human AP may promote the evolution of pancreatic necrosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10491327>Ursodeoxycholic  protects hepatocytes against oxidative injury via induction of antioxidants.</a></h2><p>The therapeutic efficacy of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has been widely demonstrated in various liver diseases, suggesting that UDCA might protect hepatocytes against common mechanisms of liver damage. A candidate for such protection is oxidative injury induced by reactive  species. This study was designed to assess the effects of UDCA on oxidative injury and antioxidative systems in cultured rat hepatocytes. The viability of the hepatocytes dose-dependently decreased after hydrogen peroxide or cadmium administration. Pretreatment with UDCA significantly prevented this decrease in viability. The amounts of glutathione (GSH) and protein thiol increased significantly, but the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase were unchanged in UDCA-treated hepatocytes. The mRNA levels of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and metallothionein (MT) were significantly higher in UDCA-treated hepatocytes than in controls. In conclusion, UDCA increased hepatocyte levels of GSH and thiol-containing proteins such as MT, thereby protecting hepatocytes against oxidative injury.

Here we investigated whether ethanol consumption during pregnancy (ECDP), even at doses unable to cause malformation, might increase the susceptibility of fetal rat liver to oxidative insults. Since cholestasis is a common condition in alcoholic liver disease and pregnancy, exposure to glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) has been used here as the oxidative insult. The mothers received drinking water without or with ethanol from 4 weeks before mating until term, when placenta, maternal liver, and fetal liver were used. Ethanol induced a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio in these organs, together with enhanced gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione reductase activities in both placenta and fetal liver. Lipid peroxidation in placenta and fetal liver was enhanced by ethanol, although it had no effect on caspase-3 activity. Although the basal production of reactive  species (ROS) was higher by fetal (FHs) than by maternal (AHs) hepatocytes in short-term cultures, the production of ROS in response to the presence of varying GCDCA concentrations was higher in AHs and was further increased by ECDP, which was associated to a more marked impairment in mitochondrial function. Moreover, GCDCA-induced apoptosis was increased by ECDP, as revealed by enhanced Bax-alpha/Bcl-2 ratio (both in AHs and FHs) and the activity of caspase-8 (only in AHs) and caspase-3. In sum, our results indicate that although AHs are more prone than FHs to producing ROS, at doses unable to cause maternal liver damage ethanol consumption causes oxidative stress and apoptosis in fetal liver.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29133896>The food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni responds to the bile salt deoxycholate with countermeasures to reactive oxygen species.</a></h2><p>Bile plays an important role in digestion, absorption of fats, and the excretion of waste products, while concurrently providing a critical barrier against colonization by harmful bacteria. Previous studies have demonstrated that gut pathogens react to bile by adapting their protein synthesis. The ability of pathogens to respond to bile is remarkably complex and still incompletely understood. Here we show that Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of human diarrheal illness worldwide, responds to deoxycholate, a component of bile, by altering global gene transcription in a manner consistent with a strategy to mitigate exposure to reactive oxygen stress. More specifically, continuous growth of C. jejuni in deoxycholate was found to: 1) induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); 2) decrease succinate dehydrogenase activity (complex II of the electron transport chain); 3) increase catalase activity that is involved in HO breakdown; and 4) result in DNA strand breaks. Congruently, the addition of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL), a superoxide dismutase mimic that reacts with superoxide, rescued the growth of C. jejuni cultured in the presence of deoxycholate.

As the worldwide demand for agricultural products increases, there is a need to pursue the development of new methods to protect crops from disease. One mechanism of plant protection is through the activation of the plant immune system. By exogenous application, 'plant activator molecules' with elicitor properties can be used to activate the plant immune system. These defence-inducing molecules represent a powerful and often environmentally friendly tool to fight pathogens. We show that the secondary bile   (DCA) induces defence in Arabidopsis and reduces the proliferation of two bacterial phytopathogens: Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We describe the global defence response triggered by this new plant activator in Arabidopsis at the transcriptional level. Several induced genes were selected for further analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We describe the kinetics of their induction and show that abiotic stress, such as moderate drought or nitrogen limitation, does not impede DCA induction of defence. Finally, we investigate the role in the activation of defence by this bile  of the salicylic  biosynthesis gene SID2, of the receptor-like kinase family genes WAK1-3 and of the NADPH oxidase-encoding RbohD gene. Altogether, we show that DCA constitutes a promising molecule for plant protection which can induce complementary lines of defence, such as callose deposition, reactive  species accumulation and the jasmonic  and salicylic  signalling pathways.© 2016 BSPP AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187671>Bavachin Induces Apoptosis through Mitochondrial Regulated ER Stress Pathway in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>As a traditional herbal medicine, the fruits of Psoralea corylifolia L.

Bavachin, one of flavonoids in FP, has been documented as a hepatotoxic substance, and the present study aimed to determine the toxicity caused by bavachin and the possible toxic mechanisms involved using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results showed that bavachin could significantly inhibited cell proliferation and trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent manner. Downregulating ER stress using tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) obvious attenuated bavachin-triggerd cell apoptosis. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of Mitofusion2 (Mfn2) resulted in a remarkable aggravation of ER stress through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Additionally, suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by ROS Scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cystein (NAC)) also reduced bavachin-induced ER stress. Taken together, our study demonstrated that bavachin-induced ER stress caused cell apoptosis by Mfn2-Akt pathway, and that ROS may participate upstream in this mechanism.

In addition, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and reactive  species (ROS) production in liver homogenate were also evaluated. On the other hand, the protective effects of pretreatment with UDCA (20 mg/kg, orally, 21 d) on these parameters were also evaluated. Our results show that pretreatment with UDCA reduced the liver parameters that were enhanced by single or combined administration of Amox and/or Clav such as serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin levels. Moreover, pretreatment with UDCA normalized the GSH level and inhibited the elevation in hepatic MDA concentration. The enhanced MPO activity and ROS production in liver homogenate of rats treated with Clav or Co-amoxyclav were also normalized by UDCA pretreatment.

Bile acids (10(-3) M) and 10(-4) M H(2)O(2) reduced membrane fluidity. H(2)O(2) caused a concentration-dependent increase in the extent of lipid peroxidation, whereas the bile acids and A(2)C had no effect. Bile acids (10(-4) M) reduced beta-adrenoceptor density in the absence of variations in membrane fluidity and in the extent of membrane lipid peroxidation. This result suggests that bile acids, at concentrations equivalent to the plasma/serum total or estimated free bile  concentration, may have a possible role in the etiology of cardiomyopathy of cholestatic liver disease. At 10(-3) M bile  concentration, beta-adrenoceptor number and affinity were adversely affected, accompanied by a decrease in membrane fluidity but without any significant increase in the extent of membrane lipid peroxidation. Although cardiac beta-adrenoceptor density and affinity and membrane fluidity were adversely affected by bile acids, the relevance of these findings to our understanding of the etiological basis of hepatic cardiomyopathy is questionable, since such concentrations exceeded the highest concentrations seen in the plasma and/or tissues of patients with cholestatic liver disease.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9737577>Bile acids influence hepatic chemiluminescence in normal and oxidative-stressed rats.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to clarify whether bile acids influence chemiluminescence (CL) in the liver in vivo. Hepatic CL was determined on the surface of the liver of anaesthetized rats by using a photon counter. In normal rats, hepatic CL was significantly decreased 30 min after enteral administration of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) or  (DCA), but returned to its initial level 3 h later, after part of the CDCA administered was metabolized. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and cholic  had no effect on CL. In contrast, hepatic CL was markedly increased 30 min after CDCA or DCA administration in rats given either buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, or diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), an inhibitor of both superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Chenodeoxycholic  further increased the CL of BSO- or DDC-treated rats during inhalation of  via a tracheal cannula. Coadministration of UDCA eliminated the effects of CDCA on the hepatic CL of normal and BSO- or DDC-treated rats with or without  inhalation. We conclude that cytotoxic bile acids, such as CDCA, increase CL in the antioxidants-depleted or oxidative-stressed liver in vivo, but that UDCA prevents CDCA from developing CL.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25519031>Ultrastructural analysis of an enterolith composed of .</a></h2><p>A 67-year-old Japanese man underwent enterotomy because of enterolith ileus.

Here, we demonstrated that the early development of in vitro-produced (IVP) bovine embryos was governed by the cooperative action between ROS and ER stress. Compared with the tension produced by 5% O2, 20% O2 significantly decreased the blastocyst formation rate and cell survival, which was accompanied by increases in ROS and in levels of sXBP-1 transcript, which is an ER stress indicator. In addition, treatment with glutathione (GSH), a ROS scavenger, decreased ROS levels, which resulted in increased blastocyst formation and cell survival rates. Importantly, levels of sXBP-1 and ER stress-associated transcripts were reduced by GSH treatment in developing bovine embryos. Consistent with this observation, tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, improved blastocyst developmental rate, trophectoderm proportion, and cell survival. Moreover, ROS and sXBP-1 transcript levels were markedly decreased by supplementation with TUDCA, suggesting a possible mechanism governing the mutual regulation between ROS and ER stress. Interestingly, knockdown of XBP-1 transcripts resulted in both elevation of ROS and decrease of antioxidant transcripts, which ultimately reduced in vitro developmental competence of bovine embryos. Based on these results, in vitro developmental competence of IVP bovine embryos was highly dependent on the coupled response between oxidative and ER stresses. These results increase our understanding of the mechanism(s) governing early embryonic development and may improve strategies for the generation of IVP embryos with high developmental competence.© 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10048711>The role of ursodeoxycholic  in bile -mediated kidney fragment toxicity.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of bile acids are thought to play an important role in the renal failure of patients with obstructive jaundice undergoing surgery. In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  (UDA) is widely used to improve cholestasis and has been proposed as protective bile acids and antioxidant. The present study employs kidney fragments to determine the role of reactive  species (ROS) in the mechanism of toxicity of hydrophobic bile acids and to determine the nephroprotectant properties of UDA against the hydrophobic bile acids. The hydrophobic bile acids chenodeoxycholic (200 microM) and  (200 microM) significantly (P<0.05) increased lactate dehydrogenase leakage (LDH) from glomerular fragments from 2.7+/-0.4 to 5.03+/-0.23 and 4.66+/-0.37 (micromol NADH consumed/min/mg protein) for chenodeoxycholic and  respectively. Preincubating the fragments with UDA (500 microM) did not prevent the leakage of LDH caused by the bile acids. The level of lipid peroxidation was not increased in fragments exposed to either ursodeoxycholic (0-500 microM), lithocholic (0-100 microM), chenodeoxycholic (0-500 microM) or  (0-500 microM). Furthermore UDA (500 microM) did not prevent the increase in lipid peroxidation caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (0-1000 microM) in the fragments. These results suggest that hydrophobic bile acids do not cause lipid peroxidation in kidney fragments and that UDA is neither capable of preventing the loss of membrane integrity induced by hydrophobic bile acids or acting as an antioxidant in kidney fragments.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809409>Effects of hydroxyethyl starch and cell-free hemoglobin on microcirculation, tissue oxygenation, and survival in severe acute porcine pancreatitis: results of a randomized experimental trial.</a></h2><p>Severe acute pancreatitis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality; so far, no causal treatment is known.

Severe acute pancreatitis was induced by intraductal injection of glycodeoxycholic  in combination with intravenous administration of cerulein. All animals were kept in isovolemic conditions by application of Ringer solution, 10% HES, or cell-free hemoglobin. The pancreatic microcirculation was evaluated over 8 hours. Thereafter, the animals were observed for 6 days followed by killing of the animals and histopathologic examination.The administration of HES and cell-free hemoglobin led to improved microcirculation and tissue oxygenation compared with the Ringer's group. Consequently, the histopathologic damage was reduced (5.5 [3-8.5] vs 9.5 [7.5-11]; P < 0.001). In addition, the mean survival was significantly longer at 121 hours (95% confidence interval, 102-139) versus the Ringer group's 57 hours (95% confidence interval, 32-82; P < 0.001).The administration of HES and cell-free hemoglobin can improve microcirculation in severe acute porcine pancreatitis, with consequent reduction in histopathologic damage and mortality.

However, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by ischemia in the area of application limits the integration and survival of MSCs in patients. In our study, we generated ER stress-induced conditions in MSCs using -cresol. As -cresol is a toxic compound accumulated in the body of CKD patients and induces apoptosis and inflammation through reactive  species (ROS), we observed ER stress-induced MSC apoptosis activated by oxidative stress, which in turn resulted from ROS generation. To overcome stress-induced apoptosis, we investigated the protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a bile , on ER stress in MSCs. In ER stress, TUDCA treatment of MSCs reduced ER stress-associated protein activation, including GRP78, PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, IRE1α, and CHOP. Next, to explore the protective mechanism adopted by TUDCA, TUDCA-mediated cellular prion protein (PrP) activation was assessed. We confirmed that PrP expression significantly increased ROS, which was eliminated by superoxide dismutase and catalase in MSCs. These findings suggest that TUDCA protects from inflammation and apoptosis in ER stress via PrP expression. Our study demonstrates that TUDCA protects MSCs against inflammation and apoptosis in ER stress by PrP expression in response to -cresol exposure.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18203149>Tauroursodeoxycholic : relieving the pathogenesis of HFE C282Y hereditary hemochromatosis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16274877>Glycochenodeoxycholate plays a carcinogenic role in immortalized mouse cholangiocytes via oxidative DNA damage.</a></h2><p>Bile acids have been suggested to be involved in biliary carcinogenesis, although the underlying mechanisms are yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the carcinogenic effect of bile acids in the biliary tract in relation to oxidative stress. Immortalized mouse cholangiocytes were incubated with various bile acids, followed by measurement of reactive  species (ROS) and the glutathione (GSH) level. As a marker of oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expression in cholangiocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. Then the expression of oxidative DNA repair enzymes in cholangiocytes was examined by real-time PCR. In addition, the long-term effect of bile -induced oxidative DNA damage on cholangiocytes was investigated using a mouse oligo DNA microarray. It was found that glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) induced the generation of ROS and the depletion of GSH. In contrast, no marked changes were induced by the other bile acids. The percentage of 8-OHdG-positive cells was also increased by GCDC, but the expression of oxidative DNA repair enzymes was not up-regulated. DNA microarray analysis showed marked changes of various genes associated with carcinogenesis (genes related to cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis). In conclusion, the long-term effect of oxidative DNA damage due to GCDC may promote carcinogenesis in the biliary tract. Furthermore, accumulation of 8-OHdG due to GCDC might contribute to the dysfunction of oxidative DNA repair enzymes.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2365980>Tauroursodeoxycholate prevents taurolithocholate-induced cholestasis and toxicity in rat liver.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholate has been advocated for the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases. The coinfusion of tauroursodeoxycholate with taurolithocholate in the perfused rat liver completely prevented the decrease of bile flow and the increase of  uptake found with taurolithocholate only. Bile flow and bile salt secretion were increased with the coinfusion of both bile acids as compared with the infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate only (+4.30 microliters/g liver per 30 min) with 16 and 32 mumol/l tauroursodeoxycholate (+1.55 microliters/g liver per 30 min with 80 and 160 mumol/l). Morphological examination revealed a 50% decrease of the number of necrotic cells in the periportal area.

The present study assessed the effects and mechanisms of action of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which play an important role in the development of diabetes complications, on testosterone secretion by rat Leydig cells. Primary rat Leydig cells were cultured and treated with AGEs (25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/ml). Testosterone production induced by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was determined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression levels of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), which are involved in testosterone biosynthesis, were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyssi, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Leydig cells was measured using the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe. The expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins [C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)] in the Leydig cells were measured by western blot analysis. We found that the AGEs markedly suppressed testosterone production by rat Leydig cells which was induced by hCG in a concentration-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of StAR, 3β-HSD and P450scc were downregulated by the AGEs in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control (P<0.01). The antioxidant agent, N-acetyl‑L‑cysteine (NAC), and the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), reversed the inhibitory effects of AGEs. In addition, the content of ROS in Leydig cells treated with AGEs increased significantly. The expression levels of CHOP and GRP78 were markedly upregulated by the AGEs in the Leydig cells.

We hypothesize that butyrate and DCA each modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis via common and distinct cellular signaling targets. In this study, we demonstrated that both butyrate and DCA inhibited cell proliferation by up to 89% and 92% and increased cell apoptosis rate by up to 3.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. Cell cycle analyses revealed that butyrate led to an increase in G1 and G2 fractions with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction, but DCA induced an increase in only G1 fraction with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction when compared with the untreated cells. The examination of early cellular signaling revealed that DCA but not butyrate increased intracellular reactive oxygen species, genomic DNA breakage, the activation of ERK1/2, caspase-3 and PARP. In contrast, DCA decreased activated Rb protein level, and butyrate but not DCA increased p21 expression.

Lithocholic  inhibited protein synthesis from 5mum, chenodeoxycholic and  from 50mum (P<0.05). The concentration of hydrophobic bile acids that inhibited protein synthesis by 50% (IC(50)) was 10mum, 75mum and 80mum for lithocholic, chenodeoxycholic and  acids, respectively. The glycine and taurine conjugates of these bile acids had no significant effect on de novo protein synthesis up to 200mum. Lithocholic  (50mum), chenodeoxycholic (200mum) and  acids (200mum) caused a significant increase (P<0.05) in LDH leakage. Lithocholic  also directly inhibited LDH activity above 50mum (P<0.05), whereas chenodeoxycholic  and  had no effect on LDH below 500mum, at which concentration they caused a slight increase in activity. The cytotoxic bile acids had no effect on the level of reactive  species in kidney fragments. Hydrophobic bile acids inhibit protein synthesis and increase membrane permeability.

We examined apoptotic signaling pathways affected by FDGP and by its active components, including epicatechin, cyanidin, quercetin, and resveratrol, in human Huh7 hepatoma cells by assaying cell viability assays, the activities of caspase 3 and caspase 7, and the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated proteins. FDGP dramatically decreased taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA)-induced production of reactive  species (ROS). Assessment of individual active components revealed that at concentrations corresponding to 300 μg/mL FDGP, only quercetin demonstrated cytoprotective effects against mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, increased concentrations of other individual polyphenolic compounds were required to produce measurable cytoprotective effect. Only combinations of all four polyphenolic compounds (epicatechin, cyanidin, quercetin, and resveratrol) restored a degree of the anti-apoptotic effects seen with FDGP. The pretreatment of FDGP at 30 μg/mL concentration could reverse the thapsigargin-induced effects on the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated proteins. In conclusion, FDGP reduced oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. The mechanisms involved in the anti-apoptotic effects of FDGP included reduced generation of ROS, and reduced processing of certain caspases. We demonstrated that quercetin, epicatechin, and cyanidin are active compounds within FDGP that attenuate apoptosis.

We have studied the effect of  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) treatments in BCS-TC2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Both bile acids promote cell death, being this effect higher for CDCA. Apoptosis is detected after 30 min-2 h of treatment, as observed by cell detachment, loss of membrane asymmetry, internucleosomal DNA degradation, appearance of mitochondrial transition permeability (MPT), and caspase and Bax activation. At longer treatment times, apoptosis is followed in vitro by secondary necrosis due to impaired mitochondrial activity and ATP depletion. Bile -induced apoptosis is a result of oxidative stress with increased ROS generation mainly by activation of plasma membrane enzymes, such as NAD(P)H oxidases and, to a lower extent, PLA2. These effects lead to a loss of mitochondrial potential and release of pro-apoptotic factors to the cytosol, which is confirmed by activation of caspase-9 and -3, but not caspase-8.

On the sixth day, serum samples were collected and analyzed for ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and homogenated liver tissues were examined for reactive  metabolites (ROM); luminol, lucigenin, lipid peroxygenation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels.In the MTX group, serum ALT, ALP, GGT and tissue ROM levels were higher and GSH level was lower. On the histopathological examination, hepatocellular necrosis was clearly more evident in the MTX group than the MTX + UDCA group.UDCA treatment protects against MTX-induced liver toxicity. Histopathologically hepatocyte necrosis can be prevented by UDCA treatment, indicating clearly the hepatoprotective effect of this agent on MTX-induced liver injury.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9470179>Structure-retention correlation of isomeric bile acids in inclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with methyl beta-cyclodextrin.</a></h2><p>The structure-retention correlation of various C24 bile  isomers was studied by the addition of methyl beta-cyclodextrin (Me-beta-CD) to mobile phases in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The compounds examined include a series of monosubstituted bile acids related to cholanoic acids differing from one another in the position and configuration of an -containing function (hydroxyl or oxo group) at the position C-3, C-6, C-7, or C-12 and the stereochemistry of the A/B-ring fusion (trans 5 alpha-H and cis 5 beta-H) in the steroid nucleus. The inclusion HPLC with Me-beta-CD was also applied to biologically important 4 beta- and 6-hydroxylated bile acids substituted by three to four hydroxyl groups in the 5 beta-steroid nucleus. These bile  samples were converted into their fluorescence prelabeled 24-pyrenacyl ester derivatives and chromatographed on a Capcell Pak C18 column eluted with methanol-water mixtures in the presence or absence of 5 mM Me-beta-CD. The effects of Me-beta-CD on the retentions of each compound were correlated quantitatively to the decreasing rate of capacity factors and the relative strength of host-guest interactions. On the basis of the retention data, specific and nonspecific hydrogen-bonding interactions between the bile acids and the Me-beta-CD were discussed.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534273>Tauroursodeoxycholic  Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis, Neural Stem Cell Pool, and Early Neurogenesis in Adult Rats.</a></h2><p>Although neurogenesis occurs in restricted regions of the adult mammalian brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) produce very few neurons during ageing or after injury. We have recently discovered that the endogenous bile  tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis and a neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, also enhances NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neuronal conversion by improving mitochondrial integrity and function of NSCs. In the present study, we explore the effect of TUDCA on regulation of NSC fate in neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using rat postnatal neurospheres and adult rats exposed to the bile . TUDCA significantly induced NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neural differentiation in the SVZ, without affecting DG-derived NSCs. More importantly, expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial antioxidant responses were significantly increased by TUDCA in SVZ-derived NSCs. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of TUDCA in adult rats markedly enhanced both NSC proliferation and early differentiation in SVZ regions, corroborating in vitro data. Collectively, our results highlight a potential novel role for TUDCA in neurologic disorders associated with SVZ niche deterioration and impaired neurogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12936912>Role of PGE2 on gallbladder muscle cytoprotection of guinea pigs.</a></h2><p>H2O2 and taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDC) impair the contraction induced by CCK-8, ACh, and KCl without affecting the actions of PGE2 and damage functions of membrane proteins except for PGE2 receptors. The aim of this study was to examine whether the preserved PGE2 actions contribute to cytoprotective mechanisms against reactive  species. Muscle cells from guinea pig gallbladder were obtained by enzymatic digestion. Levels of lipid peroxidation and activities of SOD and catalase were determined by spectrophotometry. Pretreatment with PGE2 prevented the inhibition of H2O2 or TCDC on agonist (CCK-8, ACh, and KCl)-induced contraction and reduced the expected increase in lipid peroxidation and activities of catalase and SOD caused by H2O2 and TCDC. Incubation with CCK-8 for 60 min desensitized CCK-1 receptors up to 30 min, whereas no receptor desensitization was observed after PGE2 pretreatment. Cholesterol-rich liposome treatment enhanced the inhibition of H2O2 and TCDC on agonists-induced contraction, including that of PGE2. Pretreatment with PGE2 before H2O2 and TCDC did not completely block their inhibition on agonist-induced contraction. Cholesterol-rich liposome treatment impaired the expected increase in catalase activities in response to PGE2. We conclude that pretreatment with PGE2 prevents the muscle cell damage caused by H2O2 and TCDC due to the resistance of PGE2 receptors to agonist-induced desensitization. The preservation of PGE2 receptors may be designed to conserve these cytoprotective functions that are, however, impaired by the presence of excess cholesterol in the plasma membrane.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22385135>The effect of ursodeoxycholic  on oxidative stress level and DNase activity in rat liver after bile duct ligation.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids (BAs) during cholestasis plays an important role in apoptosis initiation as well as oxidative stress increase in liver cells. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) acts as a protector in BA-induced cell injury.The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of UDCA on oxidative stress level and DNase I and II activity caused by liver injury in bile duct ligation (BDL) rats.Wistar rats were divided in four groups: group 1, control (sham-operated); group 2, sham-operated and injected with UDCA (30 mg/kg); group 3,animals with BDL; and group 4,UDCA-treatedcholestatic rats. Animals were sacrificed after 9 days. Malondialdehyde (MDA; lipid peroxidation end-product) level and protein-molecule oxidative modification (carbonyl group content) significantly increased in BDL rat liver. Catalase (CAT) activity in liver tissue was found to be decreased in BDL rats. In addition, xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, which is thought to be one of the key enzymes producing reactive  species, was found to be increased in the cholestatic group. The apoptotic effect in cholestasis was probably triggered by the increased activation of DNase I and II. The protective effect of UDCA on liver tissue damage in BDL rats, in comparison to cholestatic liver, were 1) decrease of MDA levels, 2) increased CAT activity, 3) reduced XO activity, and 4) effect on terminal apoptotic reaction, shown as a decrease in DNase I and II activity.Therefore, UDCA may be useful in the preservation of liver function in cholestasis treatment.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22569305>Glycochenodeoxycholate induces rat alveolar epithelial type II cell death and inhibits surfactant secretion in vitro.</a></h2><p>Bile -induced lung injury has become an important topic for neonatologists after the discovery of a high incidence of infant respiratory distress syndrome complicated from maternal intrahepatic cholestasis. To explore the molecular pathway of bile -induced lung injury, we investigated the cytotoxicity of the glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) to alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), as the main component of bile . The results demonstrated that glycochenodeoxycholate induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and increased caspase activity in the primary cultured AECII. Moreover, ROS scavengers and caspase inhibitors could rescue cell death induced by GCDC in rat AECII. Our results also indicated that GCDC inhibited AECII surfactant secretion.

The enzyme showed highest activity at pH 5.5 when alpha-linolenic  dispersed with Tween 20 was used as a substrate but showed little activity at above pH 8.0. On the contrary, it showed the highest activity at pH 9.0 with trilinolenin emulsified with gum arabic. When the assay was performed with linolenic  dispersed with different concentrations of Tween 20, little activity which could be seen up to the reaction solution became turbid as the linolenic /Tween 20 ratio increased, while the activity rapidly emerged afterward. The enzyme could also act on phosphatidylcholine, although the activity was strongly modified by freeze-thaw and sonication treatment on the lipid vesicles. Addition of  to the phospholipid vesicles drastically enhanced the activity. Addition of free fatty  was also revealed to be effective to enhance the activity. In the latter case, myristic  exerted highest activity. Oleic  enhanced the activity more highly than palmitic  did. These lines of evidence suggested that the lipoxygenase strictly recognized a specific physical state of the phospholipid substrate in the reaction mixture.

The underlying signaling events were investigated by Western blotting and inhibitor studies.GCDC (20 µmol/l) induced within 60 min a retrieval of Ntcp from the basolateral membrane into the cytosol, which was accompanied by an activating phosphorylation of the Src kinases Fyn and Yes. Both, Fyn activation and the GCDC-induced Ntcp retrieval from the plasma membrane were sensitive to the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and the Src family kinase inhibitors SU6656 and PP-2, whereas PP-2 did not inhibit GCDC-induced Yes activation. Internalization of Ntcp by GCDC was also prevented by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö6850. TUDC (20 µmol/l) reversed the GCDC-induced retrieval of Ntcp from the plasma membrane and prevented the activation of Fyn and Yes in GCDC-perfused rat livers. Reinsertion of Ntcp into the basolateral membrane in GCDC-perfused livers by TUDC was sensitive to the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 and the integrin-inhibitory peptide GRGDSP, whereas the control peptide GRADSP was ineffective. Ex posure of cultured rat hepatocytes to GCDC (50 µmol/l, 15min) increased the fluorescence intensity of the reactive  fluorescent indicator DCF to about 1.6-fold of untreated controls in a TUDC (50 µmol/l)-sensitive way. GCDC caused a TUDC-sensitive canalicular dilatation without evidence for Bsep retrieval from the canalicular membrane.The present study suggests that GCDC triggers the retrieval of Ntcp from the basolateral membrane into the cytosol through an oxidative stress-dependent activation of Fyn.

Glycochenodeoxycholate  (GCDC) triggers a rapid oxidative stress response as an event of glutathione (GSH) depletion and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. We therefore investigated whether the bioactivity of the antioxidant capillarisin (Cap) prevents GCDC-induced hepatocyte damage. Isolated rat hepatocytes were co-incubated with 100 muM GCDC and 0.5 mg/ml Cap for 4 h. GSH depletion and thiobarbituric -reactive substances (TBARS, measure of lipid peroxidation) increased after GCDC exposure, but were markedly suppressed by Cap treatment. Cap protected hepatocytes from a GCDC-induced increase in reactive  species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential induction, as measured by flow cytometry analysis. In addition, Cap was shown to inhibit GCDC-mediated NF-kappaB activation by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). In contrast to GCDC, Cap not only significantly decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 enzyme activity, but also suppressed heme oxygenase-1 protein and mRNA expression in hepatocytes. These results demonstrate that Cap function as an antioxidant reduced hepatocyte injury caused by hydrophobic bile acids, perhaps by preventing generation of ROS and release of cytochrome c, thereby minimizing hepatocytes apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11728521>7alpha-OH epimerisation of bile acids via oxido-reduction with Xanthomonas maltophilia.</a></h2><p>The microbial 7alpha-OH epimerisation of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, and 12-ketochenodeoxycholic acids (7alpha-OH bile acids) with Xanthomonas maltophilia CBS 827.97 to corresponding 7beta-OH derivatives with scarcity of  is described.

(DCA)-induced inflammation and apoptotic resistance play an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression from BE to EAC. Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is a garlic-derived natural organosulfur compound. This study investigated whether DADS has chemopreventive effects against BE and the potentially related signaling pathway. BAR-T cells were treated with DCA in the presence or absence of DADS. An MTT assay was used to detect the viability of the cells. The apoptosis rate of the cells was measured by light microscopy and flow cytometry. ROS levels were determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to detect mRNA and protein levels, respectively. The levels of target proteins were also determined by western blot analysis. DADS did not inhibit cell viability in a certain concentration range. DADS, similar to the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC, inhibited the DCA-induced ROS production, inflammatory factors, IκBα phosphorylation, and expression of p50 in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. DADS also increased the cell apoptosis rate through down-regulating the level of Bcl-2. DADS has low cytotoxicity in BAR-T cells. It has an anti-inflammatory effect in BAR-T cells through inhibiting ROS and the NF-κB signaling pathway. Further, it abolishes the apoptotic resistance induced by DCA in an NF-κB/Bcl-2 dependent manner.

In a murine CKD model, reactive  species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are increased in the hippocampus. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the candidates for cell-based therapy for CKD; however severe pathophysiological conditions can decrease their therapeutic potential. To address these issues, we established tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA)-treated MSCs using MSCs isolated from patients with CKD (CKD-hMSCs) and assessed the survival and ROS generation of neural cell line SH-SY5Y cells by co-culturing with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs. In the presence of the uremic toxin -cresol, the death of SH-SY5Y cells was induced by ROS-mediated ER stress. Co-culture with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs increased anti-oxidant enzyme activities in SH-SY5Y cells through the upregulation of the cellular prion protein (PrP) expression. Upregulated PrP expression in SH-SY5Y cells protected against CKD-mediated ER stress and apoptosis. In an adenine-induced murine CKD model, injection with TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs suppressed ROS generation and ER stress in the hippocampus. These results indicate that TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs prevent the CKD-mediated cell death of SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting ER stress. Our study suggests that treatment with TUDCA could be a powerful strategy for developing autologous MSC-based therapeutics for patients with CKD, and that PrP might be a pivotal target for protecting neural cells from CKD-mediated ER stress.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27511066>Bile  receptor TGR5, NADPH Oxidase NOX5-S and CREB Mediate Bile -Induced DNA Damage In Barrett's Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms whereby bile  reflux may accelerate the progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) are not fully understood. In this study we found that bile  taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) significantly increased the tail moment (TM) and histone H2AX phosphorylation in FLO-1 EA cells, an increase which was significantly decreased by knockdown of TGR5. Overexpression of TGR5 significantly increased TDCA-induced TM increase and H2AX phosphorylation. In addition, NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium significantly inhibited the TDCA-induced increase in TM and H2AX phosphorylation. TDCA-induced increase in TM and H2AX phosphorylation was significantly decreased by knockdown of NOX5-S and overexpression of NOX5-S significantly increased TDCA-induced increase in the tail moment and H2AX phosphorylation. Furthermore, TDCA significantly increased cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in FLO-1 cells. Knockdown of CREB significantly decreased TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S mRNA and the tail moment. Conversely, overexpression of CREB significantly increased TDCA-induced TM increase. We conclude that TDCA-induced DNA damage may depend on the activation of TGR5, CREB and NOX5-S. It is possible that in Barrett's patients bile acids may activate NOX5-S and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via activation of TGR5 and CREB.

In chronic injury, NO appears detrimental by combining with reactive  to form potent-free radicals. In contrast, inhibition of NO synthesis after acute injury exacerbates damage and inflammation. Recent studies have disclosed constitutive expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) by normal intestinal epithelia, yet little attention has been given to the role of iNOS in acute epithelial repair. We studied the local effects of iNOS on early epithelial repair of porcine ileal mucosa injured by deoxycholate within Ussing chambers. iNOS was constitutively expressed by the villous epithelium, and after deoxycholate injury, iNOS was expressed by injured and detaching enterocytes. Selective inhibition of iNOS abolished increases in NO synthesis and villous reepithelialization after injury. Exogenous L-arginine rescued baseline reepithelialization from NOS inhibitors but was only capable of stimulating additional repair in the presence of serum. These results demonstrate that iNOS-derived NO is a key mediator of early villous reepithelialization following acute mucosal injury.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26655953>Farnesoid X Receptor Protects against Kidney Injury in Uninephrectomized Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has indicated a therapeutic potential for this nuclear bile  receptor in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy and obesity-induced renal damage. Here, we investigated the protective role of FXR against kidney damage induced by obesity in mice that had undergone uninephrectomy, a model resembling the clinical situation of kidney donation by obese individuals. Mice fed a high-fat diet developed the core features of metabolic syndrome, with subsequent renal lipid accumulation and renal injury, including glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and albuminuria. The effects were accentuated by uninephrectomy. In human renal biopsies, staining of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), and C/EBP-homologous protein, markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, was more prominent in the proximal tubules of 15 obese patients compared with 16 non-obese patients. In mice treated with the FXR agonist obeticholic , renal injury, renal lipid accumulation, apoptosis, and changes in lipid peroxidation were attenuated. Moreover, disturbed mitochondrial function was ameliorated and the mitochondrial respiratory chain recovered following obeticholic  treatment. Culturing renal proximal tubular cells with free fatty  and FXR agonists showed that FXR activation protected cells from free fatty -induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as denoted by a reduction in the level of reactive  species staining and Grp78 immunostaining, respectively. Several genes involved in glutathione metabolism were induced by FXR activation in the remnant kidney, which was consistent with a decreased glutathione disulfide/glutathione ratio.

DCA induced significant hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes determined by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling assay and nuclear staining, respectively (P < 0.001). Apoptosis in isolated rat hepatocytes increased 12-fold after incubation with 0.5% ethanol (P < 0.001).

Finally, incubation with okadaic  induced significant apoptosis in HuH-7, Saos-2, Cos-7, and HeLa cells. Coadministration of UDCA with each of the apoptosis-inducing agents was associated with a 50-100% inhibition of apoptotic changes (P < 0.001) in all the cell types. Also, UDCA reduced the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) in isolated mitochondria associated with both DCA and phenylarsine oxide by > 40 and 50%, respectively (P < 0.001). FACS(R) analysis revealed that the apoptosis-inducing agents decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and increased reactive  species production (P < 0.05). Coadministration of UDCA was associated with significant prevention of mitochondrial membrane alterations in all cell types.

As the skin is contaminated by micro-organisms, antibiotics need to be added to primary skin cell culture media. This study analysed the impact of the most widely used agents, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B deoxycholate (amB), on UVA-irradiated human skin fibroblasts. The results show that the presence of amB in cell culture media increases the susceptibility of fibroblasts to UVA and the intracellular level of reactive  species, even when cells are irradiated in amB-free saline. This photosensitising effect of amB can be prevented if the antifungal agent is removed from the culture medium at least 24 hours before irradiation. Moreover, the use of streptomycin during cell culture partly protects cells against the UVA-induced mortality linked to amB. Acellular tests on lipid micelles suggest that this protective effect could result from an inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the antibacterial agent. In conclusion, antibiotics should be used with care in cell culture media if the cells are to be used in physiological studies of fine mechanisms in UVA-susceptibility of skin cells.

An intestinal I/R injury model was established by the occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for ischemia for 1 h, followed by reperfusion for 4 h in C57BL/6 (wild type [WT]) and FXR mice. The small intestine injury was assessed by histological analysis. Diamine oxidase and TNF-α levels in the serum were measured. Expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) were determined by immunohostochemical staining. -glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to make injury in cultured Caco-2 cells pretreated with FXR agonist (INT-747) or DL-propargylglycine (PAG) for 24 h. Cell viability and the expressions of NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-6 were assessed. Compared with WT I/R mice, FXR knockout mice exacerbated intestinal I/R injury, intestinal epithelial apoptosis, and inflammatory response. The I/R injury in WT mice was alleviated with INT-747 pretreatment. CSE expression increased after intestinal I/R injury in WT but not in FXR mice. INT-747 enhanced Caco-2 cell viability and inhibited inflammatory response by blocking the NF-κB pathway after OGD/R injury, which was diminished by a CSE-specific inhibitor (PAG). Thus, we demonstrated that FXR activation enhances intestinal epithelial cell tolerance to I/R by suppressing the inflammatory response and NF-κB pathway via CSE mediation.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606578>Antagonism of the actions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha by bile acids.</a></h2><p>The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty  beta-oxidation. Because a number of substrates and intermediates of this metabolic pathway serve as ligand activators of this receptor, homeostatic control of fatty  metabolism is achieved. Evidence also exists for PPARalpha-dependent regulation of genes encoding critical enzymes of bile  biosynthesis. To determine whether the primary products of bile  biosynthesis, cholic  and chenodeoxycholic , were capable of modulating PPARalpha function, a variety of in vivo and in vitro approaches were utilized. Feeding a bile -enriched diet significantly reduced the degree of hepatomegaly and induction of target genes encoding enzymes of fatty  beta-oxidation caused by treatment with the potent PPARalpha ligand Wyeth-14,643. Convergent data from mechanistic studies indicate that bile acids interfere with transactivation by PPARalpha at least in part by impairing the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. The results of this study provide the first evidence in favor of the existence of compounds, normally found within the body, that are capable of antagonizing the physiological actions of PPARalpha. The impact of PPARalpha antagonism by endogenous bile acids is likely to be limited under normal conditions and to have only minimal effects on bile  homeostasis. However, during certain pathophysiological states where intracellular bile  concentrations are elevated, meaningful effects on PPARalpha-dependent target gene regulation are possible.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30106087>Synergistic effect of ursodeoxycholic  on the antitumor activity of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via modulation of STAT3 and ERK.</a></h2><p>Sorafenib has been approved for the treatment of advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma but has limited efficacy. Ursodeoxycholic  exerts cytoprotective activities in hepatocytes and is believed to suppress tumorigenesis through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. The present study examined whether co‑treatment with ursodeoxycholic  has a synergistic effect on the antitumor activity of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Notably, co‑treatment with both agents more effectively inhibited cell proliferation than sorafenib or ursodeoxycholic  alone. Furthermore, co‑treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and activated extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK), a mitogen‑activated protein kinase, accompanied by excessive intracellular reactive  species generation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Thus, chemotherapy with sorafenib and ursodeoxycholic combination may be efficacious in hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis through reactive  species‑dependent activation of ERK and dephosphorylation of STAT3. The present findings may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807573>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) Exerts Anti-Atherogenic Effects by Inhibiting RAGE Signaling in Diabetic Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>A naturally occurring bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), is known to alleviate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress at the cellular level. However, the detailed action mechanisms of UDCA in atherosclerosis are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated whether UDCA exerts anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting ER stress and "receptor for advanced glycation endproduct" (RAGE) signaling. UDCA markedly reduced ER stress, RAGE expression, and pro-inflammatory responses [including NF-κB activation and reactive  species (ROS) production] induced in endothelial cells (ECs) by high glucose (HG). In particular, UDCA inhibited HG-induced ROS production by increasing the Nrf2 level. In macrophages, UDCA also blocked HG-induced RAGE and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibited foam cell formation via upregulation of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. In the diabetic mouse model, UDCA inhibited atheromatous plaque formation by decreasing ER stress, and the levels of RAGE and adhesion molecules. In conclusion, UDCA exerts an anti-atherogenic activity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting both ER stress and RAGE signaling. Our work implicates UDCA as a potential therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of diabetic atherosclerosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14764912>Beta-carotene prevents bile -induced cytotoxicity in the rat hepatocyte: Evidence for an antioxidant and anti-apoptotic role of beta-carotene in vitro.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobic bile acids are implicated in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disorders through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Antioxidants ameliorate bile -induced cytotoxicity in rat hepatocyte suspensions. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the potential protective role of beta-carotene (betaC), a putative fat-soluble antioxidant that is reduced in patients with cholestasis, against bile -induced hepatotoxicity. In freshly isolated rat hepatocyte suspensions that were exposed to the toxic hydrophobic bile  glycochenodeoxycholic  (100 or 500 microM), betaC (100 microM) decreased generation of reactive  species by >50%, similar to the inhibition afforded by alpha-tocopherol. Commensurate with this antioxidant effect, 100 microM betaC also protected hepatocytes against both glycochenodeoxycholic -induced cellular necrosis and apoptosis, which was associated with reduction in caspase 3 activation, inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release in rat hepatocytes, and prevention of the mitochondrial permeability transition in both liver mitochondria and rat hepatocytes. A lower concentration of betaC (50 microM) produced similar antioxidant and anti-apoptotic protection but with less inhibition against cell necrosis, suggesting that the higher concentration of betaC may have conferred additional cytoprotection not directly related to its antioxidant function. These results demonstrate that the antioxidant effects of betaC may provide hepatoprotection against cholestatic liver injury by preventing bile -induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial perturbations.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24012838>Tauroursodeoxycholic  protects retinal neural cells from cell death induced by prolonged exposure to elevated glucose.</a></h2><p>Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most frequent causes of blindness in adults in the Western countries. Although diabetic retinopathy is considered a vascular disease, several reports demonstrate that retinal neurons are also affected, leading to vision loss. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an endogenous bile , has proven to be neuroprotective in several models of neurodegenerative diseases, including models of retinal degeneration. Since hyperglycemia is considered to play a central role in retinal cell dysfunction and degeneration, underlying the progression of diabetic retinopathy, the purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TUDCA in rat retinal neurons exposed to elevated glucose concentration. We found that TUDCA markedly decreased cell death in cultured retinal neural cells induced by exposure to elevated glucose concentration. In addition, TUDCA partially prevented the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria, as well as the subsequent accumulation of AIF in the nucleus. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as protein carbonyl groups and reactive  species production, were markedly decreased after TUDCA treatment as compared to cells exposed to elevated glucose concentration alone. In conclusion, TUDCA protected retinal neural cell cultures from cell death induced by elevated glucose concentration, decreasing mito-nuclear translocation of AIF. The antioxidant properties of TUDCA might explain its cytoprotection. These findings may have relevance in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy patients.Copyright © 2013 IBRO.

Although excess colonic bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative, lithocholic  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human colonic T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

Forty-five anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. A severe acute pancreatitis model was established by combining an intravenous infusion of cerulein (15 microg/kg/h) and an intraductal injection of 0.1 ml of glycodeoxycholic  (5 mM). Pathology, serum amylase level, pancreatic malondiadehyde levels and water content of the lungs and the pancreas were used to evaluate the severity of disease. Moreover, an in vivo microscopic technique was used to investigate microcirculatory derangement in the pancreas, i.e., flow velocity and leukocytes sticking in postcapillary venules. HBO was delivered in three regimens, i.e., 100%  at 2.5 absolute atmospheric pressure (AAP), 40%  at 2.5 AAP, and 100%  at 1 AAP, 6 h after the initiation of induction of acute pancreatitis. All animals survived until the end of the experiments. HBO significantly improved the pathologic conditions and pancreatic malondiadehyde levels. Concomitantly, it also significantly lessened the severity of lung edema and improved the microcirculatory environment in the pancreas.

The hypothesis that accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in hepatocytes during cholestasis leads to generation of  free radicals and oxidative injury was tested. The aim of this study was to determine if hydrophobic bile  toxicity is associated with increased hydroperoxide generation in isolated rat hepatocytes and mitochondria.Hepatocytes were exposed to taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDC; 0-2000 mumol/L) or taurocholic  (TC; 1000 mumol/L), and cellular injury, intracellular hydroperoxide generation, and thiobarbituric -reacting substances (TBARS) were measured. Isolated mitochondria were incubated with 400 mumol/L chenodeoxycholic  or 400 mumol/L cholic , and hydroperoxide generation was measured fluorometrically.Hepatocyte injury, hydroperoxide generation, and TBARS increased over 4 hours on exposure to TCDC but not TC. Hydroperoxide generation preceded hepatocyte injury and accumulation of TBARS. Preincubation of hepatocytes with the antioxidant, d-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, completely abrogated cellular injury, hydroperoxide, and TBARS generation.

Interestingly, hepatocyte cell death from bile -induced toxicity occurs more frequently from apoptosis than from necrosis. However, both processes appear to involve the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT). In this study, we determined the inhibitory effect of UDCA on  (DCA)-induced MPT in isolated mitochondria by measuring changes in transmembrane potential (delta psi m) and production of reactive  species (ROS). In addition, we examined the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins in mitochondria isolated from livers of bile -fed animals.Adult male rats were maintained on standard diet supplemented with DCA and/or UDCA for 10 days. Mitochondria were isolated from livers by sucrose/percoll gradient centrifugation and MPT was measured using spectrophotometric and fluorimetric assays. delta psi m and ROS generation were determined by FACScan analysis. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein abundance were determined by Western blot analysis.DCA increased mitochondrial swelling 25-fold over controls (p < 0.001); UDCA reduced the swelling by > 40% (p < 0.001). Similarly, UDCA inhibited DCA-mediated release of calcein-loaded mitochondria by 50% (p < 0.001). delta psi m was significantly decreased in mitochondria incubated with DCA but not with UDCA. delta psi m disruption was followed closely by increased superoxide anion and peroxides production (p < 0.01). Coincubation of mitochondria with UDCA significantly inhibited the changes associated with DCA (p < 0.05). In vivo, DCA feeding was associated with a 4.5-fold increase in mitochondria-associated Bax protein levels (p < 0.001); combination feeding with UDCA almost totally inhibited this increase (p < 0.001).UDCA significantly reduces DCA-induced disruption of delta psi m, ROS production, and Bax protein abundance in mitochondria, suggesting both short- and long-term mechanisms in preventing MPT. The results suggest a possible role for UDCA as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of both hepatic and nonhepatic diseases associated with high levels of apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713361>The FXR agonist 6ECDCA reduces hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress induced by ethanol and low-protein diet in mice.</a></h2><p>Excessive ethanol consumption can lead to development of hepatic steatosis. Since the FXR receptor regulates adipose cell function and liver lipid metabolism, the aim of this work was to examine the effects of the FXR agonist 6ECDCA on alcoholic liver steatosis development and on oxidative stress induced by ethanol consumption.Swiss mice (n=24) received a low-protein diet (6%) and a liquid diet containing 10% ethanol or water for 6weeks. In the last 15days mice received oral treatment with 6ECDCA (3mgkg(-1)) or 1% tween (vehicle). The experimental groups (n=6) were: water+tween, water+6ECDCA, ethanol+tween and ethanol+6ECDCA. Moreover, as a diet control, we used a basal group (n=6), fed by a normal-proteic diet (23%) and water. After the treatment period, the animals were anesthetized for sample collection to perform plasma biochemistry assays, hepatic oxidative stress assays, hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides measurements, liver histology and hepatic gene expression.Ethanol associated with low-protein diet induced hepatic oxidative stress, increased plasma transaminases and induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Many of these parameters were reversed by the administration of 6ECDCA, including amelioration of lipid accumulation and lipoperoxidation, and reduction of reactive oxygen species. These effects were possibly mediated by regulation of Srebpf1 and FAS gene expression, both reduced by the FXR agonist.Our data demonstrated that 6ECDCA reverses the accumulation of lipids in the liver and decreases the oxidative stress induced by ethanol and low-protein diet.

In transplantation process, warm ischemia (WI) in the donor, cold ischemia and reperfusion injury in the recipient altogether inducing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is strongly associated with ITBL. This is a cascading injury process, involving in a complex series of inter-connecting events causing variety of cells activation and damage associated with the massive release of inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These damaged cells such as sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs), Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs), coupled with immunological injury and bile salt toxicity altogether contribute to ITBL in NHBD LT. Developed therapeutic strategies to attenuate IRI are essential to improve outcome after LT. Among them, single pharmaceutical interventions blocking a specific pathway of IRI in rodent models play an absolutely dominant role, and show a beneficial effect in some given controlled experiments. But this will likely prove ineffective in complex clinical setting in which more risk parameters are involved. Therefore, we intend to design a multidrug cocktail approach to block different pathways on more than one stage (WI, cold ischemia and reperfusion) of the process of IRI-induced ITBL simultaneously. This multidrug cocktail will include six drugs containing streptokinase, epoprostenol, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), hemin and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDC). These drugs show protective effects by targeting the different key events of IRI, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis and reduced bile salt toxicity. Ideally, the compounds, dosage, and method of application of drugs included in cocktail should not be definitive. We can consider removing or adding some drugs to the proposed cocktail based on further research. But given the multitude of different combinations, it is extremely difficult to determent which combination is the optimization design. Nevertheless, regardless of the difficulty, our multidrug cocktail approach designed to block different mechanisms on more than one stage of IRI simultaneously may represent a future preventive and therapeutic avenue for ITBL.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to investigate the action of curcumin in the hippocampus subjected to glutamate neurotoxicity. Glutamate stimulation induced reactive  species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to damage in the hippocampus. Curcumin treatment in the hippocampus or SH-SY5Y cells inhibited IRE1α and PERK phosphorylation with suppression of intracellular ROS production. Curcumin increased AMPK activity and knockdown of AMPKα with specific siRNA abrogated its inhibitory effects on IRE1α and PERK phosphorylation, indicating that AMPK activity was essential for the suppression of ER stress. As a result, curcumin reduced TXNIP expression and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by downregulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thus reduced IL-1β secretion. Specific fluorescent probe and flow cytometry analysis showed that curcumin prevented mitochondrial malfunction and protected cell survival from glutamate neurotoxicity.

The Prx I and Prx II, newly defined antioxidant enzymes reducing H(2)O(2) levels were decreased at the 200 and 400 micromol/l. These observations point to ROS generation in the GCDC-treated hepatocyte as the proximate event that triggers NF-kappaB activation, IkappaB-alpha proteolysis, Prx depletion, and finally cell death.

We aimed to determine the effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic  (5-ASA) on bile  induced apoptosis in hepatocytes.Apoptosis was determined by caspase assays and immunoblotting, NFkappaB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reporter gene assays, generation of reactive  species (ROS) fluorometrically, bile secretion gravimetrically, and bile  uptake radiochemically and by gas chromatography in HepG2-Ntcp cells and isolated perfused rat livers.Glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA 75 micromol/l) induced apoptosis was reduced by sulfasalazine dose dependently (1-1000 micromol/l) in HepG2-Ntcp cells whereas its metabolites 5-ASA and sulfapyridine had no effect. Sulfasalazine significantly reduced GCDCA induced activation of caspases 9 and 3. In addition, sulfasalazine activated NFkappaB and decreased GCDCA induced generation of ROS.

However, when 50% of GCDCA (12.5 micromol/l) was administered alone, marked hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury were again observed, questioning the impact of reduced GCDCA uptake for the antiapoptotic effect of sulfasalazine.Sulfasalazine is a potent inhibitor of GCDCA induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and in the intact liver.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11575458>Ursodeoxycholic  and in vitro vasoactivity of hydrophobic bile acids.</a></h2><p>Lipophilic bile acids, such as  (DCA), are nonspecific endothelium-independent vasorelaxants whose underlying basis is complex, involving membrane calcium channels blockade and receptor antagonism. The vasorelaxant action of these acids has also been linked to the generation of reactive  species and an increased extent of lipid peroxidation. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a naturally occurring tertiary dihydroxy hydrophilic  whose mechanism of action has been attributed to minimizing the effects of lipophilic bile acids. Hence, we considered UDCA might be a useful pharmacological tool to delineate the role of enhanced lipid peroxidation in lipophilic bile -induced vasorelaxation. UDCA abrogates in vitro DCA-induced vasorelaxation in rat aortic rings and can suppress DCA-initiated lipid peroxidation in vascular smooth muscle microsomal membrane fractions prepared from the rat aortae. Three different studies were performed. In study 1, the ability of UDCA to restore the DCA-blunted contractile response to the alpha1-adrenoceptor, phenylephrine in rat aortic rings, was evaluated. In study 2, the ability of UDCA to restore DCA-induced vasorelaxation in precontracted rat aortic rings was assessed. In study 3, the ability of UDCA to suppress the increased extent of lipid peroxidation effected by DCA in vascular smooth muscle microsomal membrane fractions prepared from rat aortae was measured using the thiobarbituric  reactive substance (TBARS) assay. UDCA, at a concentration equivalent to that seen in the plasma of patients with cholestatic liver disease treated with the bile , partially restored DCA-induced impaired contractility, prevented DCA-induced vasorelaxation, and abolished DCA-induced increases in the extent of lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, these data suggest that DCA-induced vasorelaxation is mediated by increasing the extent of lipid peroxidation in vascular tissue.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17512017>Protective effect of ursodeoxycholic  on liver mitochondrial function in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes: link with oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>We investigated the effects of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on mitochondrial functions and oxidative stress and evaluated their relationships in the livers of rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by a single alloxan injection (150 mg kg(-1) b.w., i.p.). UDCA (40 mg kg(-1) b.w., i.g., 30 days) was administered from the 5th day after the alloxan treatment. Mitochondrial functions were evaluated by  consumption with Clark  electrode using succinate, pyruvate+malate or palmitoyl carnitine as substrates and by determination of succinate dehydrogenase and NADH dehydrogenase activities. Liver mitochondria were used to measure chemiluminiscence enhanced by luminol and lucigenin, reduced liver glutathione and the end-products of lipid peroxidation. The activities of both NADH dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase as well as the respiratory control (RC) value with all the substrates and the ADP/O ratio with pyruvate+malate and succinate as substrates were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. UDCA developed the beneficial effect on the mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation parameters in alloxan-treated rats, whereas the activities of mitochondrial enzymes were increased insignificantly after the administration of UDCA. The contents of polar carbonyls and MDA as well as the chemiluminescence with luminol were elevated in liver mitochondria of diabetic rats. The treatment with UDCA normalized all the above parameters measured except the MDA content. UDCA administration prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in rats treated with alloxan and this process is closely connected with inhibition of oxidative stress by this compound.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17310103>Hydrophobic bile salts induce hepatocyte shrinkage via NADPH oxidase activation.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobic bile salts activate NADPH oxidase through a ceramide and protein kinase Czeta-dependent pathway as an important upstream event of bile salt-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. As shown in the present study, hydrophobic bile salts such as glycochenodeoxycholate, taurochenodeoxycholate or taurolithocholylsulfate (TLCS) also induce within 30 min hepatocyte shrinkage in perfused rat liver. TLCS-induced hepatocyte shrinkage was strongly blunted in presence of desipramine, apocynin, bafilomycin and DIDS, i.e. maneuvres previously shown to inhibit TLCS-induced NADPH oxidase activation and the subsequent oxidative stress response. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited TLCS-induced hepatocyte shrinkage. N-acetylcysteine by itself increased hepatocyte hydration, suggesting that a basal production of reactive  intermediates is involved in the regulation of liver cell hydration. TLCS failed to induce shrinkage of hepatocytes from p47(phox) knock-out, but not control mice. Likewise, hepatocytes from p47(phox) knock-out mice were resistant towards TLCS-induced apoptosis and failed to activate the CD95 system. No cell shrinkage was observed in response to taurocholate and tauroursodesoxycholate, i.e. bile salts which do not induce an oxidative stress signal and apoptosis. NADPH oxidase activation also counteracts volume recovery in response to hyperosmotic hepatocyte shrinkage. The findings indicate that hydrophobic, proapoptotic bile salts induce hepatocyte shrinkage largely through NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress. Because cell shrinkage in turn activates NADPH oxidase, which blunts cell volume recovery, a vicious cycle ensues between oxidative stress and cell shrinkage, which propagates CD95 activation and may finally lead to apoptosis. In addition, cell shrinkage induced by proapoptotic bile salts may augment apoptosis by increasing protein breakdown and induction of cholestasis.Copyright 2007 S.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of honokiol on glycochenodeoxycholic -induced apoptosis in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. Glycochenodeoxycholic  is a hydrophobic bile salt that accumulates intrahepatically during cholestasis and induces hepatocyte apoptosis at pathophysiological concentrations. Primary rat hepatocytes were pretreated with honokiol at concentrations of 40, 20 and 10 microM 5 min before glycochenodeoxycholic  treatment. Incubation of hepatocytes with glycochenodeoxycholic  at a concentration of 100 microM for 4 h induced apoptosis as shown by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Pretreatment with honokiol at concentrations of 40, 20 and 10 microM significantly inhibited the generation of intracellular reactive  species and reduced activation of caspases-8, -9, and -3 and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Glycochenodeoxycholic  treatment up-regulated phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH2-terminal kinase which was inhibited by honokiol treatment.

Apoptosis was quantified by measuring caspase 3/7 activity and transcription of interleukin (IL) 8 and IL-22 by quantitative real-time PCR. Oleic  (500 microM) alone did not induce apoptosis, while palmitic  (500 microM) increased apoptosis 5-fold. GCDCA did not induce significant apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations (5-30 microM) in non-steatotic cells. However, at the same concentrations, GCDCA increased apoptosis 3-fold in oleic -pretreated HepG2-Ntcp cells and 3.5-fold in primary rat hepatocytes. Pretreatment with oleic  increased GCDCA-induced gene transcription of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-22 5-fold and 19-fold, respectively.

In response to certain stimulations, oxidative stress is activated and regulates apoptosis and inflammation. Excessive apoptosis promotes aortic inflammation and degeneration, leading to AAD formation. This study aimed to clarify role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AAD and whether the antioxidant ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) attenuates AAD formation.Angiotensin II (Ang II) was infused in 8-months male ApoE-/- mice for one week to establish a model of AAD. UDCA (10 mg/kg/day) was administered via intragastric gavage for 3 consecutive days before AngII infusion and also during the AngII infusion for another consecutive 7 days.Ang II-infusion resulted in the incidence of AAD at a rate of 35% (13/37) and UDCA markedly reduced the incidence of AAD to 16% (6/37), accompanied with reduced maximal aortic diameter measured at the suprarenal region of the abdominal aorta. Additionally, UDCA pretreatment prevented Ang II induced generations of reactive  species (ROS) and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) both in vivo and in. vitro Mechanistically, we found UDCA markedly increased Nrf2 expression in VSMCs and prevented Ang II induced expression of NADPH subunits (p47, p67 and gp91) in Nrf2-dependent manner and rescued the activity of redox enzymes (Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and CAT), thereby inhibiting apoptosis of VSMCs.These results demonstrate that UDCA prevented AAD formation by reducing apoptosis of VSMCs caused by oxidative stress in Nrf2 dependent manner and suggest that UDCA might have clinical potential to suppress AAD formation.© 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

Some of these products are cytotoxic and attack nucleic acids, thiol proteins, or membrane lipids causing lipid peroxidation. Hydrophobic bile acids, such as  (DCA), can damage hepatocytes by solubilising membranes and impairing mitochondrial function, as well as increasing the generation of reactive  species.The hypothesis that hydrophobic bile acids could stimulate Kupffer cells to increase their capacity to generate reactive  species by measuring cellular lipid peroxidation was tested. Because the hydrophilic bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) can block hydrophobic bile  induced cellular phenomena, it was also hypothesised that UDCA could antagonise macrophage activation by hydrophobic bile acids to blunt their capacity to generate reactive  species.J-774A.1 murine macrophages were incubated for 24 hours with either 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M (final concentration) DCA alone, or 10(-4) M UDCA alone, or a mixture of 10(-4) M 1:1 molar ratio of DCA and UDCA. At the end of the incubation period, the culture medium was collected for determination of cellular lipid peroxidation by measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the medium with the thiobarbituric  reactive substances assay.10(-5) M and 10(-4) M DCA increased MDA generation by cultured macrophages. 10(-4) M UDCA alone did not increase MDA generation but blocked the peroxidative actions of DCA.Hydrophobic bile acids, after their hepatic retention, can oxidatively activate Kupffer cells to generate reactive  species. Because UDCA can block this action, the beneficial effect of UDCA is, in part, related to its ability to act as an antioxidant.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11230742>Bile -induced rat hepatocyte apoptosis is inhibited by antioxidants and blockers of the mitochondrial permeability transition.</a></h2><p>The accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids plays a role in the induction of apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes during cholestasis. The aim of this study was to determine in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes the roles of oxidant stress and the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in bile -induced apoptosis. Hepatocytes isolated from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated for 4 hours in buffer containing the hydrophobic bile , glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDC, 0-500 micromol/L) or the hydrophilic bile , glycocholic  (GCA), and either the antioxidants, alpha tocopherol, ebselen, or idebenone (a coenzyme Q analogue); or the MPT blockers, cyclosporin A, or bongkrekic , or a caspase-8 inhibitor. Apoptosis was assessed hourly by nuclear morphologic changes of fixed cells by DAPI fluorescence microscopy and reactive  species (ROS) generation by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence of hepatocytes. The percent of cells undergoing apoptosis increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in cells exposed to GCDC, and to a much lesser extent to GCA. ROS generation preceded the onset of apoptosis. MPT blockers, caspase-8 inhibition, and antioxidants prevented apoptosis and reduced ROS generation by hepatocytes. Flow cytometry analysis showed that MPT occurred within 1 hour of exposure of cells to 100 micromol/L GCDC, prior to onset of significant apoptosis. In conclusion, ROS generation, MPT induction, and cytochrome c release are critical steps in the induction of apoptosis by bile acids. Antioxidants may reduce liver injury caused by low levels of bile acids by preventing the generation of oxidant stress and subsequent stimulation of the MPT and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222033>Multiple perspectives of qingkailing injection-fraction-single compound in revealing the hepatotoxicity of baicalin and hyodeoxycholic .</a></h2><p>The complexity of ingredients in traditional Chinese medical formulas and the limited consideration of toxicological responses are fundamental issues that hamper prognostic information of drug quality control.A multidisciplinary approach for quality control of Qingkailing injection (QKL) regarding drug induced liver toxicity was described for the first time. High content image analysis (HCA) was combined with reverse-phase chromatographic separation and high-resolution MS detection technologies to provide the dynamic responses of drug induced HepG2 cell injury. Firstly, a simple and rapid method for simultaneous qualification and quantification of 21 major constituents in QKL was established and validated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap), which were operated in full MS/dd-MS mode and thus simultaneously acquired quantitative high resolution (HR) full scan data and confirmatory HR MS data. Secondly, repeated semi-preparation HPLC was applied to obtain four fractions (F1-F4) for HCS analysis. Finally, potential hepatotoxicity was determined by five hepatotoxicity biomarkers, including cell loss, DNA condense, glutathione (GSH) depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and  membrane potential (MMP) depolarization.The detection in polarity switching mode empowered the coverage of comprehensive constituents with different chemical properties. Satisfactory linearity precisions, repeatability, stability, and recovery were achieved. QKL injection significantly induced HepG2 cell injury above the concentration of 1.25% (v/v). Meanwhile, flavone glycosides (F3) and stinasterols (F4) fractions exhibited hepatotoxicity above 75μg/mL and 50μg/mL, respectively. Still further, baicalin originated from F3 significantly caused cell loss and glutathione (GSH) depletion. In parallel, hyodeoxycholic  from F4 induced cell loss, nucleus condense, and GSH reduction as well.Our work provides multiple perspectives based on injection-fractions-single compound format to improve QKL pharmacovigilance through revealing the potential hepatotoxic material basis.

Bile functions as a defensive barrier against intestinal colonization by pathogenic microbes. Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial cause of foodborne illness, possess strategies to mitigate the toxic components of bile. We recently found that growth of C. jejuni in medium with deoxycholate, a component of bile, caused DNA damage consistent with the exposure to reactive  species. We hypothesized that C. jejuni must repair DNA damage caused by reactive  species to restore chromosomal integrity. Our efforts focused on determining the importance of the putative AddAB DNA repair proteins. A C. jejuni addAB mutant demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to deoxycholate and was impaired in DNA double strand break repair. Complementation of the addAB mutant restored resistance to deoxycholate, as well as function of the DNA double strand break repair system. The importance of these findings translated to the natural host, where the AddAB system was found to be required for efficient C. jejuni colonization of the chicken intestine.

Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays an important role in dopaminergic neuronal death in substantia nigra pars compacta. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) acts as a mitochondrial stabilizer and anti-apoptotic agent in several models of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated the role of TUDCA in preventing 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurodegeneration in a mouse model of PD. We evaluated whether TUDCA modulates MPTP-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal axis, and if that can be explained by regulation of JNK phosphorylation, reactive  species (ROS) production, glutathione S-transferase (GST) catalytic activation, and Akt signaling, using C57BL/6 glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP) null mice. TUDCA efficiently protected against MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration. We have previously demonstrated that exacerbated JNK activation in GSTP null mice resulted in increased susceptibility to MPTP neurotoxicity. Interestingly, pre-treatment with TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced JNK phosphorylation in mouse midbrain and striatum. Moreover, the anti-oxidative role of TUDCA was demonstrated in vivo by impairment of ROS production in the presence of MPTP. Finally, results herein suggest that the survival pathway activated by TUDCA involves Akt signaling, including downstream Bad phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. We conclude that TUDCA is neuroprotective in an in vivo model of PD, acting mainly by modulation of JNK activity and cellular redox thresholds, together with activation of the Akt pro-survival pathway.

We show here that the secondary bile ,  (DCA), is the only one of the commonly refluxed bile acids tested here, to show genotoxicity, in terms of chromosome damage and mutation induction in the human p53 gene. This genotoxicity was apparent at both neutral and acidic pH, whilst there was a considerable increase in bile-induced toxicity at acidic pH. The higher levels of cell death and low cell survival rates at acidic pH may imply that  bile exposure is toxic rather than carcinogenic, as dead cells do not seed cancer development. We also show that DCA (at neutral and  pH) induced the release of reactive  species (ROS) within the cytoplasm of exposed cells. We further demonstrate that the genotoxicity of DCA is ROS mediated, as micronucleus induction was significantly reduced when cells were treated with DCA + the anti-oxidant vitamin C. In conclusion, we show that DCA, is an effective genotoxin at both neutral and acidic pH. As bile acids like DCA can induce DNA damage at neutral pH, suppressing the acidity of the refluxate will not completely remove its carcinogenic potential.

Exposure of Huh7 cells or PHH to CDCA (50 μM) enhanced the effect of hypoxia on OSTα mRNA levels. In luciferase assays and EMSA, the inducing effect of low oxygen could be assigned to HIF-1α, which binds to hypoxia responsive elements (HRE) in the OSTα and OSTβ gene promoters. Site-directed mutagenesis of either the predicted HRE or the bile  responsive FXR binding site abolished inducibility of the OSTα promoter, indicating that both elements need to be intact for induction by hypoxia and CDCA. In a rat model of chronic renal failure, the known increase in hepatic OSTα expression was associated with an increase in HIF-1α protein levels.OSTα-OSTβ expression is induced by hypoxia.

During endoscopy in patients, we took biopsy specimens of Barrett's mucosa before and after esophageal perfusion with DCA or UDCA and assessed DNA damage and NF-κB activation. Exposure to DCA, but not UDCA, resulted in ROS/RNS production, DNA damage, and NF-κB activation but did not increase the rate of apoptosis in BAR-T cells. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (a ROS scavenger) prevented DNA damage after DCA exposure, and DCA did induce apoptosis in cells treated with NF-κB inhibitors (BAY 11-7085 or AdIκB superrepressor). DNA damage and NF-κB activation were detected in biopsy specimens of Barrett's mucosa taken after esophageal perfusion with DCA, but not UDCA. These data show that, in Barrett's epithelial cells, DCA induces ROS/RNS production, which causes genotoxic injury, and simultaneously induces activation of the NF-κB pathway, which enables cells with DNA damage to resist apoptosis.

UDCA increased expression of death receptor 5 [(DR5), also known as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 2], and this DR appeared to be responsible for UDCA-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by DR5 knockdown. UDCA triggered formation of lipid rafts that played crucial roles in UDCA-induced apoptotic actions. Lipid rafts were required not only for provision of a proper site for DR5 action but also for mediation of DR5 expression. In addition, reactive  species (ROS) and protein kinase C (PKC) δ appeared to be implicated in UDCA-induced raft-dependent DR5 expression. Our results indicate that UDCA-induced apoptosis is mediated by DR5 expression, which is regulated by the raft formation/ROS production/PKCδ activation pathway and DR5 localization into lipid rafts in gastric cancer cells. Tumor-suppressive activity of UDCA was confirmed in an in vivo system: UDCA (120 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased tumor growth in gastric cancer xenograft mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that UDCA can be used as a potent chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of gastric cancer.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253449>UDCA exerts beneficial effect on mitochondrial dysfunction in LRRK2(G2019S) carriers and in vivo.</a></h2><p>To further characterize mitochondrial dysfunction in LRRK2(G2019S) mutant Parkinson disease (PD) patient tissue (M-LRRK2(G2019S)), determine whether ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) also exerts a beneficial effect on mitochondrial dysfunction in nonmanifesting LRRK2(G2019S) mutation carriers (NM-LRRK2(G2019S)), and assess UDCA for its beneficial effect on neuronal dysfunction in vivo.Intracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels, oxygen consumption, and activity of the individual complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as mitochondrial morphology were measured in M-LRRK2(G2019S), NM-LRRK2(G2019S), and controls. UDCA was assessed for its rescue effect on intracellular ATP levels in NM-LRRK2(G2019S) and in a LRRK2 transgenic fly model with dopaminergic expression of LRRK2(G2019S).Crucial parameters of mitochondrial function were similarly reduced in both M-LRRK2(G2019S) and NM-LRRK2(G2019S) with a specific decrease in respiratory chain complex IV activity. Mitochondrial dysfunction precedes changes in mitochondrial morphology but is normalized after siRNA-mediated knockdown of LRRK2. UDCA improved mitochondrial function in NM-LRRK2(G2019) and rescued the loss of visual function in LRRK2(G2019S) flies.There is clear preclinical impairment of mitochondrial function in NM-LRRK2(G2019S) that is distinct from the mitochondrial impairment observed in parkin-related PD. The beneficial effect of UDCA on mitochondrial function in both NM-LRRK2(G2019S) and M-LRRK2(G2019S) as well as on the function of dopaminergic neurons expressing LRRK2(G2019S) suggests that UDCA is a promising drug for future neuroprotective trials.© 2015 American Academy of Neurology.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23756642>Effect of quercetin 7-rhamnoside on glycochenodeoxycholic -induced L-02 human normal liver cell apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R) is one of the main flavonoid components of Hypericum japonicum. However, whether Q7R is one of the active ingredients responsible for the hepatopreventive effects of Hypericum japonicum has not yet been ascertained. Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate whether Q7R attenuates apoptosis induced by glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDC) in vitro, and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. L-02 human normal liver cells were pre-incubated with 0, 50, 100 and 200 µM Q7R for 30 min and then exposed to 100 µM GCDC for the indicated periods of time. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was performed to examine cell viability. Apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. Intracellular reactive  species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe, DCFH-DA. The assay for glutathione (GSH) was performed using a GSH detection kit. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was evaluated using a confocal laser scanning microscope with Fluo-3 as the Ca2+ probe and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured by rhodamine 123 (Rh123) fluorescence. Q7R attenuated the GCDC-induced reduction in cell viability and the high apoptotic rate. Moreover, Q7R protected the L-02 cells from ROS overproduction, GSH depletion, intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and Δψm decrease induced by GCDC. These results suggest that Q7R attenuates L-02 cell injury induced by GCDC, possibly by inhibiting the overproduction of ROS, GSH depletion, intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and Δψm decrease, thereby minimizing L-02 cell apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12184532>Glutathione depletion with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine demonstrates deleterious effects in acute pancreatitis of the rat.</a></h2><p>A common pathway in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is the generation of free  radicals. The most important defense mechanisms are free radical scavengers, especially glutathione. This study evaluates the influence of the inhibition of glutathione synthesis with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) on the course of experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in rats and the effects on isolated pancreatic acini and their secretion pattern. Thus acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced with intraductal infusion of low-dose glycodeoxycholic  and subsequent hyperstimulation with cerulein with and without pretreatment with BSO. In vitro pancreatic acini were isolated and stimulated with different concentrations of cerulein with and without BSO. The BSO-treated group showed a significantly reduced survival, more necrosis, and a decreased secretion of amylase in vivo. No effect on secretion pattern in either groups was seen in vitro and BSO did not exert toxic effects. Based on the data presented, this study demonstrates deleterious effects of scavenger depletion on the course of experimental pancreatitis. This is due to the systemic effects of free  radicals rather than to local effects.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121477>Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Induce Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Autophagic Cell Death via Mitochondria-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Disruption in Normal Lung Cells.</a></h2><p>Nanomaterials are used in diverse fields including food, cosmetic, and medical industries. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) are widely used, but their effects on biological systems and mechanism of toxicity have not been elucidated fully. Here, we report the toxicological mechanism of TiO2-NP in cell organelles. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were exposed to 50 and 100 μg/mL TiO2-NP for 24 and 48 h. Our results showed that TiO2-NP induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the cells and disrupted the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) and calcium ion balance, thereby increasing autophagy. In contrast, an inhibitor of ER stress, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), mitigated the cellular toxic response, suggesting that TiO2-NP promoted toxicity via ER stress. This novel mechanism of TiO2-NP toxicity in human bronchial epithelial cells suggests that further exhaustive research on the harmful effects of these nanoparticles in relevant organisms is needed for their safe application.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9726039>Effect of S-adenosylmethionine versus tauroursodeoxycholic  on bile -induced apoptosis and cytolysis in rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) increases survival in alcoholic liver cirrhosis and may have a beneficial effect in cholestatic liver disease.

In the present study the possible hepatoprotective effect of SAMe was evaluated and compared with that of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA).Primary rat hepatocytes treated with glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) were used as a model for cholestasis-induced hepatocellular damage, which served to study the effects of SAMe and TUDCA on bile -induced apoptosis and cytolysis.SAMe reduced bile -induced apoptosis but did not prevent bile -induced cytolysis. Compared with SAMe, TUDCA was more efficient in reducing apoptosis due to toxic bile acids. The combination of SAMe and TUDCA had additive effects in reducing apoptosis.The reduction in bile -induced apoptosis by SAMe may represent one of the factors responsible for its beneficial effects in the treatment of liver diseases.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21938477>Inhibition of deoxycholate-induced apoptosis in iron-depleted HCT-116 cells.</a></h2><p>The bile , deoxycholate (DOC), can induce apoptosis in cells containing adequate amounts of all key nutrients, but it is unknown whether DOC-induced apoptosis can occur in cells lacking a single key nutrient. The aim of this study was to determine if DOC is able to induce apoptosis in HCT-116 colon epithelial cells depleted of iron. The cells were made iron-deficient by pre-treating them with the iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), before subsequent exposure to DOC. Mitochondrial dysfunction was detected in control cells exposed to DOC, but not in iron-depleted cells exposed to DOC. Moreover, characteristic features of apoptosis, namely, membrane blebbing, formation of apoptotic bodies, cytochrome c release into cytosol, generation of the activated form of caspase-3, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and also plasma membrane phospholipid translocation, were all induced by DOC in control cells but not in iron-depleted cells. Treating DFO-pretreated cells with ferrous sulfate to replenish cellular iron restored the ability of DOC to induce apoptosis. In relating these findings to oxidative stress, it was found that DOC also induced the formation of reactive  species and caused DNA damage in control cells, but not in iron-depleted cells. Collectively, the results suggest that in order for HCT-116 cells to undergo apoptosis when exposed to DOC, adequate amounts of intracellular iron must be present.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26646271>The Effects of Pancreatic Microcirculatory Disturbances on Histopathologic Tissue Damage and the Outcome in Severe Acute Pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Severe acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas with a high morbidity and mortality.

Pancreatic microcirculation, pancreatic tissue oxygenation, histopathologic tissue damage, and survival were measured and analyzed.Our study demonstrates a strong correlation between pancreatic microcirculatory disturbances and histopathologic tissue damage (r = 0.728; P < 0.001). Furthermore, we showed a strong correlation between tissue oxygenation and the severity of the pancreatitis according to an established porcine pancreatitis score (r = 0.694; P < 0.001). In addition, disturbances of the pancreatic microcirculation were shown to be associated with an increased mortality rate in severe acute pancreatitis.We found that pancreatic microcirculatory disturbances have significant effects on histopathologic tissue damage and the outcome of severe acute pancreatitis.

Animals were pair-fed liquid diets containing 36% of calories as ethanol or isocaloric carbohydrates. They were randomly assigned into 4 groups of 7 rats each and received a specific treatment for 5 weeks: control diet, ethanol diet, control diet + UDC, and ethanol diet + UDC. Respiratory rates of isolated liver mitochondria were measured using a Clark  electrode with sodium succinate as substrate. Mitochondria from rats chronically fed ethanol demonstrated an impaired ability to produce energy. At the fatty liver stage, the ADP-stimulated respiration (V3) was depressed by 33%, the respiratory control ratio (RC) by 25% and the P/O ratio by 15%. In ethanol-fed rats supplemented with UDC, both the rate and efficiency of ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation were improved: V3 was increased by 35%, P/O by 8%. All the respiratory parameters were similar in control group and control + UDC group. On the other hand, the number and size of mitochondria were assessed by electron microscopy and computer-assisted quantitative analysis. The number of mitochondria from ethanol-treated rats was decreased by 29%, and they were enlarged by 74%. Both parameters were normalized to control values by UDC treatment. These studies demonstrate that UDC has a protective effect against ethanol-induced mitochondrial injury by improving ATP synthesis and preserving liver mitochondrial morphology. These UDC positive effects may contribute to the observed decrease in fat accumulation and may delay the progression of alcoholic injury to more advanced stages.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9214446>Cytotoxicity of bile salts against biliary epithelium: a study in isolated bile ductule fragments and isolated perfused rat liver.</a></h2><p>We evaluated cytotoxic effects of different unconjugated and glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile salts (BS) against bile duct epithelial cells in isolated bile ductule fragments and isolated perfused rat liver. Ultrastructural morphometric studies were performed in polarized rat bile ductule fragments exposed in vitro to increasing concentrations (10-100 micromol/L) of lithocholate (LCA), deoxycholate (DCA), chenodeoxycholate (CDCA), cholate (CA), ursodeoxycholate (UDCA), their taurine-conjugates, and glycoconjugates of cholic (GCA) or chenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) for 20, 30, or 75 minutes. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of unconjugated hydrophobic bile salts against biliary epithelium (BDE) in the whole liver, livers were isolated from rats with impaired taurine-conjugation capacity (beta-alanine treatment) and perfused for 70 minutes with 2 micromol/min LCA (n = 6), CDCA (n = 6), CA (n = 6), or 0.5 micromol/min tauro-LCA (n = 4). In isolated bile ductule fragments, hydrophobic unconjugated bile salts (LCA, CDCA, DCA) induced a marked damage of intracellular organelles, mainly mitochondria. The damage started at a concentration of 10 micromol/L and became prominent at concentrations higher than 50 micromol/L. No damage of the apical and basolateral membrane was seen and tight junctions appeared intact. UDCA, taurine and glycoconjugated bile salts failed to induce any evident ultrastructural alteration. In taurine-depleted isolated livers, perfused with LCA, CDCA, or CA, bile duct epithelial cells showed no evidence of intracellular damage, despite the increased biliary excretion of unconjugated BS. Marked alterations of the apical cell membrane were seen only in livers perfused with LCA and in isolated segments of the biliary epithelium. In contrast with biliary epithelium, hepatocytes showed prominent subcellular damage with CA and CDCA, and profound alterations of the canalicular membrane with LCA and tauro-LCA. We have shown that, in vitro, BDE cells are not damaged by taurine- or glycine-conjugated BS, but they are very sensitive to cytotoxicity of hydrophobic unconjugated BS. Such sensitivity is not present in the whole liver, probably because of the specificity of BS transport processes, the microvascular architecture of the bile ductal system, and the presence in bile of a physiological surfactant, such as phospholipids.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569011>Paradoxical effect of diphenyleneiodonium in inducing DNA damage and apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) is often used as a molecular tool in unravelling redox-sensitive cellular events involving NADPH oxidase.

DPI induced single-strand breaks in DNA of HCT-116 cells, although this only slightly increased GADD153 expression. Nevertheless, after sustaining DNA damage, the DPI-treated cells subsequently had features characteristic of apoptosis, such as translocated membrane phospholipid and nuclei containing condensed chromatin. Paradoxically, DPI attenuated the DNA damage and overall ROS production caused by sodium deoxycholate (DOC), although DPI did not inhibit DOC-induced generation of mitochondrial [image omitted] . Furthermore, DPI prevented the occurrence of apoptosis caused by DOC. However, other known chemical inhibitors of NADPH oxidase did not produce the same results as DPI in negating the effects of DOC.

This study was undertaken (a) to characterize further the mechanism by which 3-NP induces apoptosis in rat neuronal RN33B cells and (b) to determine if and how the taurine-conjugated UDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), inhibits apoptosis induced by 3-NP. Our results indicate that coincubation of cells with TUDCA and 3-NP was associated with an approximately 80% reduction in apoptosis (p < 0.001), whereas neither taurine nor cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), inhibited cell death. Moreover, TUDCA, as well as UDCA and its glycine-conjugated form, glycoursodeoxycholic , prevented mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (p < 0.001), which probably accounts for the observed inhibition of DEVD-specific caspase activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. 3-NP decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (p < 0.001) and increased mitochondrial-associated Bax protein levels (p < 0.001). Coincubation with TUDCA was associated with significant inhibition of these mitochondrial membrane alterations (p < 0.01). The results suggest that TUDCA inhibits 3-NP-induced apoptosis via direct inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization and outer membrane disruption, together with modulation of Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria.

Short-term feedback regulation of Ntcp by primary bile salts has not yet been investigated in vivo. Subcellular localization of Ntcp was analyzed in Ntcp-transfected HepG2-cells by flow cytometry and in immunofluorescence images from tissue sections by a new automated image analysis method. Net bile salt uptake was investigated in perfused rat liver by a pulse chase technique. In Flag-Ntcp-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) expressing HepG2-cells, taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), but not taurocholate (TC), induced endocytosis of Ntcp. TCDC, but not TC, caused significant internalization of Ntcp in perfused rat livers, as shown by an increase in intracellular Ntcp immunoreactivity, whereas Bsep distribution remained unchanged. These results correlate with functional studies. Rat livers were continuously perfused with 100 μmol/L of TC. 25 μmol/L of TCDC, taurodeoxycholate (TDC), tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC), or TC were added for 30 minutes, washed out, followed by a pulse of (3) [H]-TC. TCDC, but not TDC, TUDC, or TC significantly increased the amount of (3) [H]-TC in the effluent, indicating a reduced sinusoidal net TC uptake. This effect was sensitive to chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) and cypermethrin (protein phosphatase 2B inhibitor). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors had an additive effect, whereas Erk1/2 (extracellular signal activated kinase 1/2), p38MAPK, protein phosphatase 1/2A (PP1/2A), and reactive  species (ROS) were not involved.TCDC regulates bile salt transport at the sinusoidal membrane by protein kinase C- and protein phosphatase 2B-mediated retrieval of Ntcp from the plasma membrane. During increased portal bile salt load this mechanism may adjust bile salt uptake along the acinus and protect periportal hepatocytes from harmful bile salt concentrations.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130098>Ursodeoxycholic  suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell formation by reducing the levels of peroxiredoxin II and reactive oxygen species in pancreatic cancer cells.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in cancer development and progression. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) may possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and chemoprophylatic effects. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of UDCA treatment on pancreatic cancer cells. The pancreatic cancer cell lines HPAC and Capan-1 were treated with 0.2 mM UDCA. To examine alterations in the levels of intracellular ROS, the DCF-DA stain was used and both stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes were quantified using qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. The pancreatic cancer sphere culture was performed following seven days of treatment with 0.2 mM UDCA, as an indicator of stemness. Following treatment with UDCA, the level of intracellular ROS was decreased in the pancreatic cancer cells. UDCA decreased both the phosphorylation of STAT3 and the expression of peroxiredoxin II (Prx2). Furthermore, the treatment resulted in the upregulation of E-cadherin and in the downregulation of N-cadherin. In addition, UDCA decreased the expression of sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2) and it diminished the number of pancreatic cancer spheres formed. In conclusion UDCA suppressed the levels of intracellular ROS and Prx2 and it decreased EMT and stem cell formation in pancreatic cancer cells.

Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to evaluate predictors of composite neonatal outcome (neonatal intensive care unit admission, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, mechanical ventilation use, oxygen by nasal cannula, pneumonia, and stillbirth). Predictors including TBA level, hepatic transaminase level, gestational age at diagnosis, underlying liver disease, and use of ursodeoxycholic  were evaluated.Of 233 women with ICP, 152 women had TBA levels 10-39.9 μmol/L, 55 had TBA 40-99.9 μmol/L, and 26 had TBA ≥100 μmol/L. There was no difference in maternal age, ethnicity, or prepregnancy body mass index according to TBA level. Increasing TBA level was associated with higher hepatic transaminase and total bilirubin level (P < .05). TBA levels ≥100 μmol/L were associated with increased risk of stillbirth (P < .01). Increasing TBA level was also associated with earlier gestational age at diagnosis (P < .01) and ursodeoxycholic  use (P = .02).

However, the potential cardiac function of FXR remains unclear. We investigated the cardiac expression and biological function of FXR.Farnesoid-X-receptor was detected in both isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Natural and synthetic FXR agonists upregulated cardiac FXR expression, stimulated myocyte apoptosis, and reduced myocyte viability dose- and time-dependently. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that FXR agonists disrupted mitochondria, characterized by mitochondrial permeability transition pores activation, mitochondrial potential dissipation, cytochrome c release, and both caspase-9 and -3 activation. Such mitochondrial apoptotic responses were abolished by siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous FXR or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial death signalling. Furthermore, low levels of FXR were detected in the adult mouse heart, with significant (∼2.0-fold) upregulation after myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R).

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DNA damage, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by bile acids and gastric  can be attenuated by the cytoprotective, hydrophilic bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA). Non-dysplastic BE cells were exposed for 10 min to pH 4 and/or bile  cocktail or to pH 4 and a modified cocktail consisting of a mixture of bile acids and GUDCA. DNA damage was evaluated by the comet assay; cell viability and proliferation were measured by trypan blue staining and the MTS assay; reactive  species (ROS) were measured using hydroethidium staining; oxidative DNA/RNA damage was detected by immunostaining with antibody against 8-OH-dG; thiol levels were measured by 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) staining; and the expression of antioxidant proteins was evaluated by western blotting. DNA damage and oxidative stress were significantly increased, while thiol levels were decreased in BE cells treated with pH 4 and bile  cocktail compared with cells treated with pH 4 alone or untreated cells. Bile acids and low pH also significantly decreased cell proliferation. Expression of the antioxidant enzymes, MnSOD and CuZnSOD, was elevated in the cells treated with bile acids and low pH. When GUDCA was included in the medium, all these effects of pH 4 and bile acids were markedly reduced. In conclusion, treatment of BE cells with acidified medium and a bile  cocktail at physiologically relevant concentrations induces DNA damage, cytotoxicity, and ROS.

The aim of this study was to determine if deoxycholate-induced apoptosis is influenced by zinc. HCT-116 colon epithelial cells were pre-treated with zinc and then exposed to deoxycholate. Membrane blebbing, formation of apoptotic bodies, and greater overall production of reactive  species (ROS) occurred in cells exposed to deoxycholate, but zinc inhibited the occurrence of these three events caused by deoxycholate. Upon finer analysis, stimulation of mitochondrial superoxide production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytochrome c release were detected in cells exposed to deoxycholate, but zinc did not inhibit any of these three effects caused by deoxycholate. Additionally, caspase-3 activation, plasma membrane phospholipid translocation, and also chromatin condensation and fragmentation were observed in cells exposed to deoxycholate, but all of these effects of deoxycholate, including the greater overall ROS production, were all inhibited by zinc. Because zinc did not prevent the three mitochondrial effects caused by deoxycholate, the last set of findings suggested that zinc hampered activation of an initiator caspase upstream of effector caspase-3, in inhibiting deoxycholate-induced HCT-116 cell death. In examining this possibility, it was found that caspase-8 activation caused by deoxycholate was blocked by zinc. Collectively, the results suggest that zinc can inhibit deoxycholate-induced apoptotic cell death mediated by caspases.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19073151>Ursodeoxycholic  induces glutathione synthesis through activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is widely recognized as an effective compound in the treatment of chronic hepatitis and is known to modulate the redox state of the liver accompanied by an increase of GSH. In the present study, to access the antioxidative effect of UDCA and to clarify the molecular basis of the action on GSH level, we evaluated its effects in HepG2 cells exposed to excessive iron. UDCA inhibited both a decrease in the GSH level and an increase in the reactive  species caused by excessive iron in the cells. UDCA increased the gene expression of the catalytic- and modifier-units of glutamine-cysteine ligase (GCL), which is a key enzyme in GSH synthesis. We further investigated the effect of UDCA on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and obtained results showing that UDCA-induced increase in the GSH level was prevented by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor. In addition, Western blot analysis of Akt showed that, while the total Akt level remained unchanged, the phosphorylated Akt level was increased by UDCA, and this increase was also prevented by LY294002. Moreover, UDCA promoted the translocation of a transcription factor, nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), into the nucleus, and this action was inhibited by LY294002.

Synthesis of UDCA-conjugated chitosan (ChitoUDCA) was confirmed using (1)H NMR spectra.

Morphology of Ce6-incorporated ChitoUDCA nanoparticles was observed using TEM and their shapes were spherical with sizes around 200-400 nm. The PDT potential of Ce6-incorporated ChitoUDCA nanoparticles were studied with HuCC-T1 human cholangiocarcinoma cells. The results showed that ChitoUDCA nanoparticles enhances of Ce6 uptake into tumor cells, phototoxicity, and ROS generation compared to Ce6 itself. Furthermore, Ce6-incorporated ChitoUDCA nanoparticles showed quenching in aqueous solution and sensing at tumor cells. We suggest that Ce6-incorporated ChitoUDCA nanoparticles are promising candidates for PDT of cholangiocarcinoma cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The fatty  hydrophobic tail had a high affinity for the hydrophobic region of phosphatidylcholine micelles. The fatty acids inserted into phosphatidylcholine micelles were better substrates for soybean lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1) with two distinct pH optima at 7.0 and 10.0. With Tween 20-solubilized linoleic , the enzyme had a pH optimum at 9.0, exclusively forming 13-hydroperoxides. However, with linoleic and arachidonic acids inserted into PDM-micelles, LOX1 synthesized exclusively 9- and 5-hydroperoxides, respectively. The enzyme brought about the transformation of the substrate either at pH 7.4 or at 10.0, less efficiently at pH 10.0. However, the regioselectivity of the enzyme was not altered by increasing the pH from 7.4 to 10.0. Thus, LOX1 could utilize fatty acids bound to membranes as physiological substrates. The enzyme utilized the carboxylic group of linoleic and arachidonic acids inserted into the PDM-micelles as a recognition site to convert the compounds into 9- and 5-hydroperoxides, respectively. This was confirmed by activity measurements using methyl linoleate as the substrate. Circular dichroism measurement of LOX1 with PDM-micelles suggested that while there was a small change in the tertiary structure of LOX1, the secondary structure was unaffected. Soybean LOX1, which is arachidonate 15-LOX, acted as "5-LOX", thus making it possible to change the regiospecificity of the LOX1-catalyzed reaction by altering the physical state of the substrate.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8638707>cGMP stimulates bile -independent bile formation and biliary bicarbonate excretion.</a></h2><p>The effect of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) on hepatic bile formation was studied in isolated perfused rat livers and rat hepatocytes. Studies in isolated perfused rat livers showed that infusion of 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcGMP, 3 micromol/min or 100 microM) 1) increased bile flow without affecting biliary excretion of simultaneously infused taurocholate, 2) increased biliary concentration and excretion of HCO3(-) but did not affect biliary excretion of glutathione, and 3) increased net perfusate H+ efflux without affecting hepatic O2 uptake. Studies in isolated rat hepatocytes showed that 1) 8-BrcGMP increased intracellular pH in the presence (but not in the absence) of extracellular HCO-3, and effect inhibited by 4,4' -diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic  and Na+ replacement, 2) 8-BrcGMP did not affect taurocholate uptake and intracellular [Ca2+], and 3) bile acids, like ursodeoxycholate and cholate, did not increase cellular cGMP. Taken together, these results indicate that cGMP stimulates bile -independent bile formation, in part by stimulating biliary HCO3- excretion. cGMP may increase HCO3- excretion by stimulating sinusoidal Na+ - HCO3- cotransport, but not Na+/H+ exchange. cGMP, unlike adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, may not regulate hepatic taurocholate transport, and bile -induced HCO3- rich choleresis may not be mediated via cGMP.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20086178>Bile  reflux contributes to development of esophageal adenocarcinoma via activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cgamma2 and NADPH oxidase NOX5-S.</a></h2><p>Gastroesophageal reflux disease complicated by Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). However, the mechanisms of the progression from BE to EA are not fully understood. Besides  reflux, bile  reflux may also play an important role in the progression from BE to EA. In this study, we examined the role of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and a novel NADPH oxidase NOX5-S in bile -induced increase in cell proliferation. We found that taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) significantly increased NOX5-S expression, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production, and cell proliferation in EA cells. The TDCA-induced increase in cell proliferation was significantly reduced by U73122, an inhibitor of PI-PLC. PI-PLCbeta1, PI-PLCbeta3, PI-PLCbeta4, PI-PLCgamma1, and PI-PLCgamma2, but not PI-PLCbeta2 and PI-PLCdelta1, were detectable in FLO cells by Western blot analysis. Knockdown of PI-PLCgamma2 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) significantly decreased TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production, and cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of PI-PLCbeta1, PI-PLCbeta3, PI-PLCbeta4, PI-PLCgamma1, or ERK1 MAP kinase had no significant effect. TDCA significantly increased ERK2 phosphorylation, an increase that was reduced by U73122 or PI-PLCgamma2 siRNA. We conclude that TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression and cell proliferation may depend on sequential activation of PI-PLCgamma2 and ERK2 MAP kinase in EA cells. It is possible that bile  reflux present in patients with BE may increase reactive  species production and cell proliferation via activation of PI-PLCgamma2, ERK2 MAP kinase, and NADPH oxidase NOX5-S, thereby contributing to the development of EA.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28681695>Mcl-1 suppresses abasic site repair following bile -induced hepatic cellular DNA damage.</a></h2><p>In cholestasis, increases in bile  levels result in the generation of reactive  species and the induction of DNA damage and mutation. It is believed that bile  accumulation is associated with liver tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism that underpins this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Mcl-1, which is overexpressed in hepatic cells, is a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family. In this study, we observed that Mcl-1 potently suppresses the repair of bile -induced abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) sites in DNA lesions. Upon exposure of hepatic cells to glycochenodeoxycholate, one of the major conjugated human bile acids, we observed an increase in AP site accumulation along with induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and XRCC1 ( X-Ray Repair Cross Complementing 1). In addition, accumulation of Mcl-1 was observed in the nuclei of QGY-7703 cells in response to glycochenodeoxycholate stimulation. Knockdown of endogenous Mcl-1 by RNA interference significantly accelerated the repair of DNA lesions in glycochenodeoxycholate-treated cells. However, unlike XRCC1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was induced following Mcl-1 knockdown. Conversely, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suppression was observed following glycochenodeoxycholate treatment of cells overexpressing Mcl-1. Moreover, AP-site counting analyses revealed that DNA repair activity was enhanced in cells overexpressing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase under glycochenodeoxycholate stress conditions. It is well known that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase plays a crucial role in the base excision repair pathway. Thus, our findings suggest that Mcl-1 suppresses base excision repair by inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase induction following glycochenodeoxycholate-induced DNA damage. These results potentially explain how bile  accumulation results in genetic instability and carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924062>Chenodeoxycholic  activates NLRP3 inflammasome and contributes to cholestatic liver fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver contributes to cholestatic liver injury. Inflammation induced by excessive bile acids is believed to play a crucial role, however, the mechanisms of bile acids triggered inflammatory response remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating liver inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we for the first time showed that chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), the major hydrophobic primary bile  involved in cholestatic liver injury, could dose-dependently induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-1β in macrophages by promoting ROS production and K+ efflux. Mechanistically, CDCA triggered ROS formation in part through TGR5/EGFR downstream signaling, including protein kinase B, extracellular regulated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Meanwhile, CDCA also induced ATP release from macrophages which subsequently causes K+ efflux via P2X7 receptor. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically decreased mature IL-1β level of liver tissue and ameliorated liver fibrosis in bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model. In conclusion, excessive CDCA may represent an endogenous danger signal to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate liver inflammation during cholestasis.

To examine this possibility in vitro, the purpose of this study was to determine if expression of certain growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible genes (GADD) is upregulated in human colonic epithelial cells exposed to deoxycholate (DOC). DNA macroarray screening of a small cluster of stress/apoptosis-related genes in DOC-treated HCT-116 colonocytes revealed clearly higher expression of only GADD45, which was confirmed by gene-specific relative RT-PCR analysis. Subsequently, it was found that DOC also increased GADD34 mRNA expression. However, mRNA expression of GADD153 was increased most markedly in DOC-treated HCT-116 colonocytes, which express wild-type p53. However, the upregulation of GADD34, GADD45, and GADD153 mRNA expression apparently did not require p53, based on the finding that DOC increased expression of all three GADD genes in HCT-15 colonocytes, which express mutant p53. In further studying GADD153 in particular, the effect of DOC on GADD153 mRNA was prevented by actinomycin-D (Act-D), but not by antioxidants or MAPK inhibitors. DOC also caused GADD153 protein to be expressed in close parallel with increased GADD153 mRNA expression. Induction of GADD153 protein by DOC was prevented by either anisomycin or cycloheximide. These findings suggest that DOC-induced upregulation of GADD153 mRNA expression occurred at the level of transcription without involving reactive  species and MAPK signaling, and that the expression of GADD153 protein was due also to translation of pre-existing, and not just newly synthesized, mRNA.2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552716>Nrf2 activation by tauroursodeoxycholic  in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the cause of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction and severe oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the cell death that characterizes the disease. Under oxidative stress, the master regulator of cellular redox status, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is responsible for activating the transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Nrf2 is a promising target to limit reactive  species (ROS)-mediated damage in PD. Here, we show that tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) prevents both 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)- and α-synuclein-induced oxidative stress, through Nrf2 activation, in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, we used C57BL/6 male mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to elucidate the effect of TUDCA in this in vivo model of PD. In vivo, TUDCA treatment increases the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1, and Nrf2 downstream target antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and GPx. Moreover, we found that TUDCA enhances GPx activity in the brain. Altogether, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising agent to limit ROS-mediated damage, in different models of PD acting, at least in part, through modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, TUDCA should be considered a promising therapeutic agent to be implemented in PD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, however, several oxaliplatin-based combinatorial treatments have shown a promising anti-tumor activity in patients with HCC. Presently, we demonstrate that oxaliplatin triggers necrosis more than apoptosis in HepG2, SK-Hep1, SNU-423 and Hep3B HCC cells, while mainly inducing apoptosis in HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells. Interestingly, ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a less hydrophobic bile  that can suppress carcinogenesis, shifted oxaliplatin-induced necrosis to apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The same effect was produced by hydrophilic bile acids (tauroursodeoxycholic  and taurohyodeoxycholic ), but not by highly hydrophobic bile acids ( and chenodeoxycholic ). UDCA also triggered the necrosis-to-apoptosis switch when cotreated with other platinum-based chemotherapeutic drugs including cisplatin and carboplatin, suggesting that the cell death mode switching effect of UDCA is a general phenomenon when combined with platinum drugs. Oxaliplatin produced high level of reactive  species (ROS) in HepG2 cells and UDCA significantly reduced oxaliplatin-induced ROS generation. In addition, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the superoxide scavengers butylated hydroxyanisole and dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic  attenuated necrosis, indicating a critical role(s) of ROS in occurrence of necrotic death. Apoptosis induced by combined treatment appeared to be mediated by p53-caspase 8-caspase 3 pathway. In conclusion, UDCA switches oxaliplatin-induced necrosis to apoptosis via inhibition of ROS production and activation of the p53-caspase 8 pathway in HepG2 cells. As necrosis and subsequent inflammation are implicated in tumor progression and malignancy, our results imply a potential improved efficacy of UDCA-combined chemotherapy in HCC by reducing inflammatory responses that may be triggered by oxaliplatin.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22974827>A novel chenodeoxycholic -verticinone ester induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>In this study, the in vitro antitumor activity of chenodeoxycholic -verticinone ester (CDCA-Ver), a novel compound and its underlying mechanisms were evaluated.

After hydrolyzation, lyophilization and derivatization hydroxylated DNA bases were characterised and quantitated with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS) and SIM analysis. Two concentration ranges of bile salts were used, micromolar concentrations being present in plasma, millimolar in the gut lumen.In the absence of ROM Chelex-treated DNA preparations contain only small amounts of hydroxylated base products. Bile salts at 4.0 mM significantly increased the amounts of 5-OH uracil and cis-thymine glycol. In the presence of ROM bile salts at 4.0 microM increased the production of 8-OH adenine and 8-OH guanine whereas bile salts at 4.0 mM inhibited ROM-induced base hydroxylation.In the absence of ROM millimolar concentrations of a bile salt mixture with deoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate increase basal (spontaneous) DNA hydroxylation, whereas, they are without effects at micromolar concentrations. In the presence of ROM micromolar concentrations enhance oxidative DNA damage and millimolar concentrations were inhibitory. These results support the view that bile acids may cause oxidative DNA damage depending on their concentrations and the surrounding conditions both directly (enhancement of basal hydroxylation) and indirectly (enhancement of ROM-induced hydroxylation).</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19054763>Characterization of enantiomeric bile -induced apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are steroid detergents that are toxic to mammalian cells at high concentrations; increased exposure to these steroids is pertinent in the pathogenesis of cholestatic disease and colon cancer.

In this report we investigate the ability of synthetic enantiomers of lithocholic  (ent-LCA), chenodeoxycholic  (ent-CDCA), and  (ent-DCA) to induce toxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Natural bile acids were found to induce more apoptotic nuclear morphology, cause increased cellular detachment, and lead to greater capase-3 and -9 cleavage compared with enantiomeric bile acids in both cell lines. In contrast, natural and enantiomeric bile acids showed similar effects on cellular proliferation. These data show that bile -induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells is enantiospecific, hence correlated with the absolute configuration of the bile steroid rather than its detergent properties. The mechanism of LCA- and ent-LCA-induced apoptosis was also investigated in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. These bile acids differentially activate initiator caspases-2 and -8 and induce cleavage of full-length Bid. LCA and ent-LCA mediated apoptosis was inhibited by both pan-caspase and selective caspase-8 inhibitors, whereas a selective caspase-2 inhibitor provided no protection. LCA also induced increased CD95 localization to the plasma membrane and generated increased reactive  species compared with ent-LCA.

H(2)O(2) was measured by a fluorescent assay. Cell proliferation was determined by measurement of thymidine incorporation.NOX5-S was present in FLO cells. TDCA significantly increased NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO and BAR-T cells. This increase in thymidine incorporation was significantly reduced by knockdown of NOX5-S. TGR5 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in OA tissues than in normal oesophageal mucosa or Barrett's mucosa. Knockdown of TGR5 markedly inhibited TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression, H(2)O(2) production and thymidine incorporation in FLO and BAR-T cells.

TUDCA increased CD34(+) /Sca1(+) progenitors in mice peripheral blood (PB), and CD34(+) , CD31(+) , and c-kit(+) progenitors in human PB. In addition, TUDCA increased differentiation of CD34(+) HSCs into EPC lineage cells via Akt activation. EPC invasion was increased by TUDCA, which was mediated by fibroblast activating protein via Akt activation. Interestingly, TUDCA induced integration of EPCs into human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by increasing adhesion molecule expression. In the mouse hind limb ischemia model, TUDCA promoted blood perfusion by enhancing angiogenesis through recruitment of Flk-1(+) /CD34(+) and Sca-1(+) /c-kit(+) progenitors into damaged tissue. In GFP(+) bone marrow-transplanted hind limb ischemia, TUDCA induced recruitment of GFP(+) /c-kit(+) progenitors to the ischemic area, resulting in an increased blood perfusion ratio.

In addition, bile acids also actively participate in regulation of gene expression through their ability to act as ligands for the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor or by activating kinase signaling pathways. Under cholestatic conditions, elevated levels of bile acids in the liver induce hepatic inflammation, and because bile  levels are also elevated in the circulation, they might also induce vascular inflammation. To test this hypothesis, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic endothelial cells were treated with bile acids, and the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were monitored. The three major bile acids found in the circulation, chenodeoxycholic , , and lithocholic , all strongly induced both the mRNA and protein expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.

The bile -induced cell surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was sufficient to result in the increased adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to the HUVEC, suggesting that elevated levels of bile acids in the circulation may cause endothelium dysfunction and contribute to the initiation of early events associated with vascular lesion formation.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11479033> free radical generating mechanisms in the colon: do the semiquinones of vitamin K play a role in the aetiology of colon cancer?</a></h2><p>It is proposed that bile acids (), the K vitamins, iron(II) complexes and  interact to induce an oncogenic effect in the colon by the generation of free radicals. In the relatively low oxidising/reducing conditions of the colonic lumen the K vitamins exist in the reduced form; however, if absorbed into the mucosa they have the capacity to be chemically oxidised and to enter into a redox cycle yielding  radicals. The semiquinone radical of K(1) (phylloquinone) has been stabilised in bile  mixed micelles and investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The estimated half-life of the radical was about 30 min which confirms a remarkably high stability in aqueous micellar solution.

The molecular mechanisms of this bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) are not yet clarified and no neuroprotective strategy is currently worldwide accepted. Here, we show that UCB, at conditions mimicking those of hyperbilirubinemic newborns (50 microM UCB in the presence of 100 muM human serum albumin), rapidly (within 1 h) inhibited cytochrome c oxidase activity and ascorbate-driven  consumption in 3 days in vitro rat cortical neurons. This was accompanied by a bioenergetic and oxidative crisis, and apoptotic cell death, as judged by the collapse of the inner-mitochondrial membrane potential, increased glycolytic activity, superoxide anion radical production, and ATP release, as well as disruption of glutathione redox status. Furthermore, the antioxidant compound glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) fully abrogated UCB-induced cytochrome c oxidase inhibition and significantly prevented oxidative stress, metabolic alterations, and cell demise. These results suggest that the neurotoxicity associated with neonatal bilirubin-induced encephalopathy occur through a dysregulation of energy metabolism, and supports the notion that GUDCA may be useful in the treatment of BIND.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24073649>Computational prediction and in vitro analysis of potential physiological ligands of the bile  binding site in cytochrome c oxidase.</a></h2><p>A conserved bile  site has been crystallographically defined in the membrane domain of mammalian and Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase (RsCcO). Diverse amphipathic ligands were shown previously to bind to this site and affect the electron transfer equilibrium between heme a and a3 cofactors by blocking the K proton uptake path. Current studies identify physiologically relevant ligands for the bile  site using a novel three-pronged computational approach: ROCS comparison of ligand shape and electrostatics, SimSite3D comparison of ligand binding site features, and SLIDE screening of potential ligands by docking. Identified candidate ligands include steroids, nicotinamides, flavins, nucleotides, retinoic , and thyroid hormones, which are predicted to make key protein contacts with the residues involved in bile  binding. In vitro  consumption and ligand competition assays on RsCcO wildtype and its Glu101Ala mutant support regulatory activity and specificity of some of these ligands. An ATP analog and GDP inhibit RsCcO under low substrate conditions, while fusidic , cholesteryl hemisuccinate, retinoic , and T3 thyroid hormone are more potent inhibitors under both high and low substrate conditions. The sigmoidal kinetics of RsCcO inhibition in the presence of certain nucleotides is reminiscent of previously reported ATP inhibition of mammalian CcO, suggesting regulation involving the conserved core subunits of both mammalian and bacterial oxidases. Ligand binding to the bile  site is noncompetitive with respect to cytochrome c and appears to arrest CcO in a semioxidized state with some resemblance to the "resting" state of the enzyme.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11825660>Role of mitochondrial complexes I and II, reactive  species and arachidonic  metabolism in deoxycholate-induced apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are promoters of colon cancer; however, the mechanism(s) of action of this tumor promoter are largely unknown. Bile acids induce apoptosis in colon epithelial cells and it is probable that the modulation of apoptosis contributes, in part, to colon carcinogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that damage to mitochondria is an upstream event in sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC)-induced apoptosis and that a pro-oxidant state of the cell favors survival. NaDOC-induced damage to mitochondria was assessed by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential using flow cytometry and an increase in megamitochondria formation using transmission electron microscopy. We found that inhibition of mitochondrial complexes I and II with rotenone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone, respectively, dramatically protected HT-29 cells against NaDOC-induced apoptosis. Antioxidants (e.g. lazaroids U-74389G and U-8389G), however, sensitized cells to NaDOC-induced apoptosis, in spite of a reduction in reactive /nitrogen species. Lazaroid pre-treatment caused a marked decrease in NaDOC-induced activation of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor, NF-kappaB, which may provide the basis for the sensitization to apoptosis caused by these antioxidants. Inhibitors of arachidonic  metabolism (e.g. esculetin, sulindac sulfide, NS-398) also sensitized HT-29 cells to NaDOC-induced apoptosis.

We have previously shown that ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has antioxidative activity through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling-mediated glutathione production. In this study, we investigated the effects of UDCA on insulin response by analyzing intracellular ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HepG2 cells treated with palmitate. The level of ROS was quantified using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (HDCFDA), and the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting assay using appropriate antibodies. The intracellular ROS levels were increased by palmitate but were reduced by treatment with UDCA and insulin. Furthermore, insulin significantly stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt. When the cells were pre-treated with palmitate, insulin-induced Akt-phosphorylation was markedly inhibited. However, when the cells were treated with palmitate and UDCA, the effects of insulin were partially restored.

Biosynthesis and mineralization by aerobic bacteria have been intensively studied. This review describes our knowledge on the anaerobic metabolism of isoprenoids, mainly by denitrifying and fermentative bacteria. Nitrate-reducing beta-Proteobacteria were isolated on monoterpenes as sole carbon source and electron donor. Thauera spp. were obtained on the -containing monoterpenes linalool, menthol, and eucalyptol. Several strains of Alcaligenes defragrans were isolated on unsaturated monoterpenes as growth substrates. A novel denitrifying beta-Proteobacterium, strain 72Chol, mineralizes cholesterol completely to carbon dioxide. Physiological studies showed the presence of several oxidative pathways in these microorganisms. Investigations by organic geochemists indicate possible contributions of anaerobes to early diagenetic processes. One example, the formation of p-cymene from monoterpenes, could indeed be detected in methanogenic enrichment cultures. In man, cholic  (CA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. During their enterohepatic circulation, bile acids are biotransformed by the intestinal microflora into a variety of metabolites. Known bacterial biotranformations of conjugated bile acids include: deconjugation, oxidation of hydroxy groups at C-3, C-7 and C-12 with formation of oxo bile acids and reduction of these oxo groups to either alpha- or beta-configuration. Quantitatively, the most important bacterial biotransformation is the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of CA and CDCA yielding  and lithocholic , respectively. The 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of CA occurs via a novel six-step biochemical pathway. The genes encoding several enzymes that either transport bile acids or catalyze various reactions in the 7 alpha-dehydroxylation pathway of Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 have been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21175587>Mitochondrial genome depletion dysregulates bile - and paracetamol-induced expression of the transporters Mdr1, Mrp1 and Mrp4 in liver cells.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria are involved in the toxicity of several compounds, retro-control of gene expression and apoptosis activation.

Following glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) or paracetamol, Rho cells generated less ROS and were more resistant to cell death. Apoptosis induced by GCDCA and Fas was also reduced. The basal expression of Mdr1 was significantly enhanced, but this was not further stimulated by GCDCA or paracetamol, as observed in wild-type (WT) cells. Basal expression of Mrp1 and Mrp4 was similar in WT and Rho cells, whereas they were up-regulated only in WT cells after GCDCA or paracetamol, along with the transcription factors Shp and Nrf2, but not Fxr or Pxr. Increased expression of Nrf2 was accompanied by its enhanced nuclear translocation. Glycoursodeoxycholic  failed to cause any of the effects observed for GCDCA or paracetamol.The Nrf2-mediated pathway is partly independent of ROS production. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 is insufficient to up-regulate Mdr1, Mrp1 and Mrp4, which requires the participation of other regulatory element(s) whose activation in response to GCDCA and paracetamol is impaired in Rho cells and hence probably sensitive to ROS.© 2011 The Authors.

AT-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are thus important candidates in the treatment of liver fibrosis. However, multiple case reports suggest that AT-1R blockers may induce hepatocyte injury. Therefore, we investigated the effect of AT-II and its receptor blockers on cytokine-, oxidative stress- and bile salt-induced cell death in hepatocytes. Primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to TNF-α/Actinomycin D, the ROS-generating agent menadione or the bile salts: glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) and tauro-lithocholic -3 sulfate (TLCS), to induce apoptosis. AT-II (100 nmol/L) was added 10 minutes prior to the cell death-inducing agent. AT-1R antagonists (Sartans) and the AT-2R antagonist PD123319 were used at 1 µmol/L. Apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, acridine orange staining) and necrosis (Sytox green staining) were quantified. Expression of CHOP (marker for ER stress) and AT-II receptor mRNAs were quantified by Q-PCR. AT-II dose-dependently reduced GCDCA-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p<0.05) without inducing necrosis. In addition, AT-II reduced TLCS-induced apoptosis of hepatocytes (-50%, p<0.05). However, AT-II did not suppress TNF/Act-D and menadione-induced apoptosis. Only the AT-1R antagonists abolished the protective effect of AT-II against GCDCA-induced apoptosis. AT-II increased phosphorylation of ERK and a significant reversal of the protective effect of AT-II was observed when signaling kinases, including ERK, were inhibited. Moreover, AT-II prevented the GCDCA-induced expression of CHOP (the marker of the ER-mediated apoptosis).Angiotensin II protects hepatocytes from bile salt-induced apoptosis through a combined activation of PI3-kinase, MAPKs, PKC pathways and inhibition of bile salt-induced ER stress.

We demonstrate the direct mitochondrio-toxicity of bile salts which deplete the mitochondrial membrane potential and induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The bile salt mediated mechanistic mode of destruction significantly differs from that of calcium, the prototype MPT inducer. Cell-toxic bile salts initially bind to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Subsequently, the structure of the inner boundary membrane disintegrates. And it is only thereafter that the MPT is induced. This progressive destruction occurs in a dose- and time-dependent way. We demonstrate that GCDCA and TCDCA, but not TUDCA, preferentially permeabilize liposomes containing the mitochondrial membrane protein ANT, a process resembling the MPT induction in whole mitochondria. This suggests that ANT is one decisive target for toxic bile salts. To our knowledge this is the first report unraveling the consecutive steps leading to mitochondrial destruction by cell-toxic bile salts.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here we elucidate the intermediate processes through which MCPIP induces adipogenesis. Forced expression of MCPIP in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes caused increased reactive /nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production and inducible-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER), as indicated by expression of ER chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, and autophagy as indicated by expression of beclin-1 and cleavage of LC3.

Both UDCA (50-200 μM) and YS (100-200 μM) dose-dependently prevented SNP (1mM)-induced cell death. Results showed that both UDCA and YS effectively attenuated the production of total reactive  species (ROS), peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) and nitric oxide (NO), and markedly inhibited the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss and intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion. SNP-induced programmed cell death events, such as nuclear fragmentation, caspase-3/7 and -9 activation, Bcl-2/Bax ratio decrease, and cytochrome c release, were significantly attenuated by both UDCA and YS.

In contrast, ADP/O ratios of these substrates and oxidative metabolism of ascorbate were not significantly affected. Ursodeoxycholate did not impair mitochondrial oxidative metabolism up to concentrations of 100 mumol/L; at 300 mumol/L, however, it decreased state 3 oxidation rates and respiratory control ratios of L-glutamate, succinate and duroquinol. Tauroursodeoxycholate had no significant inhibitory effect on state 3 oxidation rates of L-glutamate and succinate at concentrations up to 300 mumol/L. When ursodeoxycholate (final concentration, 30 mumol/L or 100 mumol/L) was added to mitochondrial incubations containing chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, the toxic effects of lipophilic bile acids on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism were partially reversed. However, 300 mumol/L ursodeoxycholate, in combination with chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, exhibited greater toxicity compared with incubations containing only the individual bile acids. In contrast to ursodeoxycholate, tauroursodeoxycholate did not reduce the toxic effects of chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate on mitochondrial metabolism. Ursodeoxycholate (100 mumol/L) significantly decreased the incorporation of chenodeoxycholate into mitochondrial membranes, whereas the decrease in lithocholate incorporation was not statistically significant.

Vasorelaxant activity correlated with the relative lipid solubility of bile acids with lipophilic bile acids exhibiting the greatest vasorelaxant activity with modest to no vasorelaxant activity exhibited by hydrophilic bile acids. We also investigated whether bile -induced vasorelaxation is mediated by antagonism of a prototypal contractile receptor, the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor, by stimulation of a bile  surface membrane receptor, by the release of endothelium-derived relaxant factors, by promoting the generation of reactive  species and increasing the extent of lipid peroxidation, or by modifying membrane fluidity. Lipophilic bile acids induce vasorelaxation possibly by antagonizing alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, a phenomenon that manifests itself as a lowering of the affinity of vascular alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Bile -induced vasorelaxation was not dependent upon stimulation of a bile  surface membrane receptor or the release of endothelium-derived relaxant factors. Lipophilic bile acids can also increase the extent of lipid peroxidation with a subtle reduction in the fluidity of rat vascular smooth muscle membranes not associated with loss of membrane cholesterol or phospholipid. We have concluded that lipophilic bile acids are non-selective vasorelaxants whose mechanism of action is a multifaceted process involving antagonism of contractile surface membrane receptors possibly effected by an increased extent of lipid peroxidation and/or membrane fluidity but occurs independent of the release of endothelial-derived relaxant factors or stimulation of a surface membrane bile  binding site.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17768385>Cellular osmolytes reduce lens epithelial cell death and alleviate cataract formation in galactosemic rats.</a></h2><p>Many cataractogenic stresses also induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in lens epithelial cells (LECs), which appears to be one of the universal inducers of cell death.

We administered these osmolytes either orally or by injection into galactosemic Sprague-Dawley rats. These rats had significantly reduced LEC death and partially delayed hypermature cataract formation. Since the UPR was not activated in cultured LECs treated with selenite, we used the selenite nuclear cataract as a UPR-independent death pathway control. In selenite-induced nuclear cataract in rats, cellular osmolytes did not prevent LEC death and did not alleviate cataract formation.These results further establish that ER stress and LEC death play a vital role in certain types of cataract formation.

Surprisingly, the most abundant cholesterol metabolites were found to be C(27) and C(24) intermediates of the bile  biosynthetic pathways with structures corresponding to 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic  (7.170 +/- 2.826 ng/ml, mean +/- S.D., six subjects), 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic  (0.416 +/- 0.193 ng/ml), 7alpha,x-dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic  (1.330 +/- 0.543 ng/ml), and 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-en-24-oic  (0.172 +/- 0.085 ng/ml), and the C(26) sterol 7alpha-hydroxy-26-norcholest-4-ene-3,x-dione (0.204 +/- 0.083 ng/ml), where x is an  atom either on the CD rings or more likely on the C-17 side chain. The ability of intermediates of the bile  biosynthetic pathways to activate the liver X receptors (LXRs) and the farnesoid X receptor was also evaluated. The acidic cholesterol metabolites 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic  and 3beta,7alpha-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic  were found to activate LXR in a luciferase assay, but the major metabolite identified in this study, i.e. 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic , was not an LXR ligand. 7Alpha-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic  is formed from 3beta,7alpha-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic  in a reaction catalyzed by 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C(27)-steroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7), which may thus represent a deactivation pathway of LXR ligands in brain. Significantly, LXR activation has been found to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer disease (Fan, J., Donkin, J., and Wellington C. (2009) Biofactors 35, 239-248); thus, cholesterol metabolites may play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27699602>Tauroursodeoxycholic  Protects Against Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Cell Death via Mitophagy in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been deeply implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, to keep a healthy mitochondrial population, a balanced mitochondrial turnover must be achieved. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative disease models; however, the mechanisms involved are still incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective role of TUDCA against mitochondrial damage triggered by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophelyhydrazone (CCCP). Herein, we show that TUDCA significantly prevents CCCP-induced cell death, ROS generation, and mitochondrial damage. Our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of TUDCA in this cell model is mediated by parkin and depends on mitophagy. The demonstration that pharmacological up-regulation of mitophagy by TUDCA prevents neurodegeneration provides new insights for the use of TUDCA as a modulator of mitochondrial activity and turnover, with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17661404>Is vitamin E beneficial in chronic liver disease?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909664>Design, synthesis, and mechanistic investigations of bile -tamoxifen conjugates for breast cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>We have synthesized two series of bile  tamoxifen conjugates using three bile acids lithocholic  (LCA),  (DCA), and cholic  (CA). These bile -tamoxifen conjugates possess 1, 2, and 3 tamoxifen molecules attached to hydroxyl groups of bile acids having free  and amine functionalities at the tail region of bile acids. The in vitro anticancer activities of these bile -tamoxifen conjugates show that the free amine headgroup based cholic -tamoxifen conjugate (CA-Tam3-Am) is the most potent anticancer conjugate as compared to the parent drug tamoxifen and other  and amine headgroup based bile -tamoxifen conjugates. The cholic -tamoxifen conjugate (CA-Tam3-Am) bearing three tamoxifen molecules shows enhanced anticancer activities in both estrogen receptor +ve and estrogen receptor -ve breast cancer cell lines. The enhanced anticancer activity of CA-Tam3-Am is due to more favorable irreversible electrostatic interactions followed by intercalation of these conjugates in hydrophobic core of membrane lipids causing increase in membrane fluidity. Annexin-FITC based FACS analysis showed that cells undergo apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis showed the arrest of cells in sub G0 phase. ROS assays showed a high amount of generation of ROS independent of ER status of the cell line indicating changes in mitochondrial membrane fluidity upon the uptake of the conjugate that further leads to the release of cytochrome c, a direct and indirect regulator of ROS. The mechanistic studies for apoptosis using PCR and western analysis showed apoptotsis by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in ER +ve MCF-7 cells and by only an intrinsic pathway in ER -ve cells. In vivo studies in the 4T1 tumor model showed that CA-Tam3-Am is more potent than tamoxifen. These studies showed that bile acids provide a new scaffold for high drug loading and that their anticancer activities strongly depend on charge and hydrophobicity of lipid-drug conjugates.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185272>Bile acids induce activation of alveolar epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts through farnesoid X receptor-dependent and independent pathways.</a></h2><p>The roles of bile  microaspiration and bile -activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unclear. We hypothesized that bile acids activate alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and lung fibroblasts, which may be regulated by FXR activation.Human AECs and normal or IPF-derived lung fibroblast cells were incubated with the three major bile acids: lithocholic  (LCA),  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). The AECs injury indices, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung fibroblast activation were evaluated. FXR expression in IPF lungs and the roles of FXR and FXR-independent pathways in bile -induced profibrotic effects were also investigated.LCA, DCA and CDCA reduced cell viability and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in A549 cells. They all induced EMT, as shown by enhanced α-SMA and vimentin and decreased E-cadherin levels. LCA directly induced differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. All three bile acids promoted cellular migration but not proliferation of lung fibroblasts. FXR expression was upregulated in IPF lungs, and inhibition of FXR restrained the bile -induced EMT and lung fibroblast activation. Differentiation and proliferation were enhanced in lung fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium from bile -stimulated A549 cells, which contained increased levels of profibrotic factors. TGF-β/Smad3 signaling was also involved in the bile -induced EMT and lung fibroblast differentiation.Bile  microaspiration may promote the development of pulmonary fibrosis by inducing activation of AECs and lung fibroblasts via FXR-dependent and independent pathways.© 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30023697>Role of Surface Hydrophobicity of Dicationic Amphiphile-Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles on A549 Lung Cancer Cells.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the surface functionality of dicationic cysteamine conjugated cholic  (DCaC), dicationic cysteamine conjugated  (DCaDC), and dicationic cysteamine conjugated lithocholic  (DCaLC) templated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on mammalian cells.

Adaptation processes of Campylobacter jejuni to this hostile environment are analyzed in this study by a proteomic approach.Proteome profiling by label-free mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) has been used to characterize the adaptation of C. jejuni to sublethal concentrations of seven bile acids.The bile acids with the lowest inhibitory concentration (IC ),  and chenodeoxycholic , induce the most significant proteome changes. Overall a downregulation of all basic biosynthetic pathways and a general decrease in the transcription machinery are found. Concurrently, an induction of factors involved in detoxification of reactive  species, protein folding, and bile  exporting efflux pumps is detected. Exposure to  and chenodeoxycholic  results in an increased expression of components of the more energy-efficient aerobic respiration pathway, while the anaerobic branches of the electron transport chain are down-expressed.The results show that C. jejuni has a differentiated system of adaptation to bile  stresses. The findings enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of campylobacteriosis, especially for survival of C. jejuni in the human intestine, and may provide clues to future medical treatment.© 2018 The Authors.

This study examined the influence of cardiac-specific overexpression of catalase, an antioxidant detoxifying H(2)O(2), on paraquat-induced myocardial geometric and functional alterations, with a focus on ER stress. FVB and catalase transgenic mice were administered paraquat for 48h. Myocardial geometry, contractile function, apoptosis, and ER stress were evaluated using echocardiography, edge detection, caspase-3 activity, and immunoblotting. Our results revealed that paraquat treatment significantly enlarged left ventricular (LV) end diastolic and systolic diameters; increased LV mass and resting myocyte length; reduced fractional shortening, cardiomyocyte peak shortening, and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening; and prolonged relengthening duration in the FVB group. Whereas the catalase transgene itself did not alter myocardial geometry and function, it mitigated or significantly attenuated paraquat-elicited myocardial geometric and functional changes. Paraquat promoted overt apoptosis and ER stress as evidenced by increased caspase-3 activity, apoptosis, and ER stress markers including Bax, Bcl-2, GADD153, calregulin, and phosphorylated JNK, IRE1α, and eIF2α; all were ablated by the catalase transgene. Paraquat-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction was mitigated by the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic . Moreover, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversed paraquat-induced ER stress as evidenced by enhanced GADD153 and IRE1α phosphorylation. Taken together, these data revealed that catalase may rescue paraquat-induced myocardial geometric and functional alteration possibly by alleviating JNK-mediated ER stress.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Antioxidant defense is accepted to include biotransformation of biliverdin (BV) into bilirubin (BR) through BV reductase α (BVRα). The mutation (c.214C>A) in BLVRA results in a non-functional enzyme (mutBVRα). Consequently, homozygous carriers suffering from cholestasis develop green jaundice. Whether BVRα deficiency reduces BV-dependent protection against bile acids is a relevant question because a screening of the mut-BLVRA allele (a) in 311 individuals in Greenland revealed that this SNP was relatively frequent in the Inuit population studied (1% a/a and 4.5% A/a). In three human liver cell lines an inverse correlation between BVRα expression (HepG2>Alexander>HuH-7) and basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was found, however the ability of BV to reduce oxidative stress and cell death induced by  (DCA) or potassium dichromate (PDC) was similar in these cells. The transduction of BVRα or mutBVRα in human placenta JAr cells with negligible BVRα expression or the silencing of endogenous BVRα expression in liver cells had no effect on DCA-induced oxidative stress and cell death or BV-mediated cytoprotection. DCA stimulated both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production, whereas BV only inhibited the latter. DCA and other dihydroxy-bile acids, but not PDC, induced up-regulation of both BVRα and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in liver cells through a FXR independent and BV insensitive mechanism. In conclusion, BV exerts direct and BVRα-independent antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, whereas bile  accumulation in cholestasis stimulates the expression of enzymes favoring the heme biotransformation into BV and BR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Importantly, angiotensin II (AngII), independently of its vasoconstrictor action, causes β-cell inflammation and dysfunction, which may be an early step in the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine how AngII causes β-cell dysfunction. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from C57BL/6J mice that had been infused with AngII in the presence or absence of taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and effects on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and β-cell function determined. The mechanism of action of AngII was further investigated using isolated murine islets and clonal β cells. We show that AngII triggers ER stress, an increase in the messenger RNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and promotes β-cell dysfunction in murine islets of Langerhans both in vivo and ex vivo. These effects were significantly attenuated by TUDCA, an inhibitor of ER stress. We also show that AngII-induced ER stress is required for the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and is caused by reactive  species and IP3 receptor activation. These data reveal that the induction of ER stress is critical for AngII-induced β-cell dysfunction and indicates how therapies that promote ER homeostasis may be beneficial in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16699860>Hepatitis C virus core protein inhibits -mediated apoptosis despite generating mitochondrial reactive  species.</a></h2><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is known to cause oxidative stress and alter apoptosis pathways. However, the apoptosis results are inconsistent, and the real significance of oxidative stress is not well known. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we wanted to confirm whether core-induced oxidative stress was really significant enough to cause DNA damage, and whether it induced cellular antioxidant responses. Second, we wanted to evaluate whether this core-induced oxidative stress and the antioxidant response to it was responsible for apoptosis changes.HCV core protein was expressed under control of the Tet-Off promoter in Huh-7 cells and HeLa cells. We chose to use  (DCA) as a model because it is known to produce both reactive  species (ROS) and apoptosis.Core expression uniformly increased ROS and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) under basal and DCA-stimulated conditions. Core protein expression also increased manganese superoxide dismutase levels. Core protein inhibited DCA-mediated mitochondrial membrane depolarization and DCA-mediated activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, despite the increase in ROS by DCA. Core protein inhibited DCA-mediated apoptosis by increasing Bcl-x(L) protein and decreasing Bax protein, without affecting the proportion of Bax between mitochondria and cytosol, resulting in suppression of cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytoplasm.HCV core protein induces oxidative DNA damage, whereas it inhibits apoptosis that is accompanied by enhancement of ROS production. Thus, oxidative stress and apoptosis modulation by core protein are independent of each other.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19673394>[Epicatechin abolished TDCA-induced apoptosis in Huh7 cell by inhibiting Bax, p38 MAPK and ROS production].</a></h2><p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in anti-apoptotic effects of epicathechin in liver cells.Human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) was treated with 400 miromol x L(-1) taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) for 48 hours to induce apoptosis. Intracellular generation of reactive  species (ROS) was detected with DCFH-DA assay. Caspase-3/7 activity was analyzed with EnzoLyte Homogeneous AMC kit. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The expression of Bax, Phospho-p38 MAPK and the levels of cytochrome C were assessed by Western-blot analysis.TDCA-dependent intracellular ROS production was 8-fold higher as compared to untreated cells, consequently resulting in 45% reduction of cell viability. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with epicatechin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of TDCA-induced ROS generation and reduced cell apoptosis by threefold as compared to TDCA treatment alone. In addition epicatechin reduced Bax expression with consequential inhibition of cytochrome C release from mitochondria, inhibition of caspase 3/7 activation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.Epicatechin protects Huh7 cells from oxidative stress and mitochondria-induced apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms of anti-apoptotic effects of epicatechin were associated with inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and Bax expression, and reduction of ROS production.

However, the mechanism that triggers the up-regulation of CYP3A4 is still not clear. In this study, using recombinant CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes, we demonstrate that CYP3A4 can metabolise lithocholic  into 3-dehydrolithocholic , a potent activator of the nuclear receptors, pregnane X receptor and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 receptor, which are known to regulate the expression of CYP3A4. This process thus provides a feed-forward metabolism of toxic bile  that may be of importance in maintaining bile  homeostasis. We also provide evidence for a novel CYP3A4-mediated metabolic pathway of the secondary bile  . Patients treated with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, had markedly elevated urinary excretion of 1beta-hydroxydeoxycholic  compared to healthy controls. The importance of CYP3A4 in this process was verified by incubations with recombinant CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes, both of which efficiently converted  into 1beta-hydroxydeoxycholic .

In this study, we examined the protective effect of protease inhibitor aprotinin and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi) on pulmonary inflammation in rats with severe pancreatitis-associated ALI.A rat model of acute pancreatitis (AP) was established by injecting sodium glycodeoxycholate (GDOC) into the pancreatic duct. Pharmacological interventions included pretreatment with a protease inhibitor aprotinin (10mg/kg) and a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPi, 100g/kg). The extent of pancreatic and lung injury and systemic inflammation was assessed by examinations of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung tissue. Pancreatic or lung tissue edema was evaluated by tissue water content. Pulmonary arterial pressure and alveolar-capillary membrane permeability were evaluated post-injury via a catheter inserted into the pulmonary artery in an isolated, perfused lung model.Pre-treatment with aprotinin or MMPi significantly decreased amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the wet/dry weight ratio of the lung and pancreas in AP rats. Compared to the GDOC alone group, administration of aprotinin or MMPi prevented pancreatitis-induced IL-6 increases in the lung. Similarly, treatment with aprotinin or MMPi significantly decreased the accumulation of white blood cells,  radicals, nitrite/nitrates in both blood and BAL, and markedly reduced lung permeability.Pretreatment with either aprotinin or MMPi attenuated the systemic inflammation and reduced the severity of lung and pancreas injuries. In short, our study demonstrated that inhibition of protease may be therapeutic to pulmonary inflammation in this GDOC-induced AP model.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

In intact mitochondria, lipophilic bile acids used at a concentration of 100 mumol/L (0.1 mumol/mg protein) inhibited state 3 and state 3u (dinitrophenol-uncoupled) oxidation rates for L-glutamate, succinate, duroquinol or ascorbate/N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as substrates. In contrast, state 4 oxidation rates and ADP/ ratios were not significantly affected. At a bile  concentration of 10 mumol/L (0.01 mumol/mg protein), the state 3 oxidation rate for L-glutamate was decreased in the presence of deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate or lithocholate, whereas only lithocholate inhibited state 3 oxidation for succinate or duroquinol. In broken mitochondria, inhibition of oxidative metabolism was found for NADH or duroquinol as substrate in the presence of 100 mumol/L lithocholate (0.2 mumol/mg protein) and for duroquinol in the presence of 100 mumol/L chenodeoxycholate. Direct assessment of the activities of the enzyme complexes of the electron transport chain revealed decreased activities of complex I and complex III in the presence of 100 mumol/L deoxycholate or chenodeoxycholate or 10 mumol/L lithocholate. Inhibition of complex IV required higher bile  concentrations (300 mumol/L for chenodeoxycholate or 30 mumol/L for lithocholate), and complex II was not affected.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that reactive  intermediates (ROIs) serve as messengers for most if not all of these stimuli. To identify the relevant ROI species and to gain more direct evidence for an involvement of ROIs as messengers, we investigated whether changes in the levels of enzymes that control intracellular ROI levels affect the activation of NF-kappa B.Cell lines stably overexpressing the H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase were deficient in activating NF-kappa B in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) or okadaic . The catalase inhibitor aminotriazol restored NF-kappa B induction. In contrast, stable overexpression of cytoplasmic Cu/Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD), which enhances the production of H2O2 from superoxide, potentiated NF-kappa B activation. The level of cytoplasmic NF-kappa B-I kappa B complex was unchanged, indicating that synthesis of NF-kappa B was not affected.Our data show that one ROI species, H2O2 acts as a messenger in the TNF- and okadaic -induced post-translational activation of NF-kappa B. Superoxide is only indirectly involved, as a source for H2O2. These data explain the inhibitory effects of many antioxidative compounds on the activation of NF-kappa B and its target genes. H2O2 is overproduced in response to various stimuli, and normal levels of catalase appear insufficient to remove it completely.

We have now compared the patterns of vulnerability and rescue of Caenorhabditis elegans with genetic modifications of three different genetic factors implicated in Parkinson disease (PD). We observed that expressing alpha-synuclein, deleting parkin (K08E3.7), or knocking down DJ-1 (B0432.2) or parkin produces similar patterns of pharmacological vulnerability and rescue. C. elegans lines with these genetic changes were more vulnerable than nontransgenic nematodes to mitochondrial complex I inhibitors, including rotenone, fenperoximate, pyridaben, or stigmatellin.

Mesenteric vascular beds isolated from young (8-week-old) to adult (16-week-old) rats were perfused, and changes in perfusion pressure induced by continuous perfusion of methoxamine or high KCl (60 mM) were measured over 180 min. In young preparations with intact endothelium, methoxamine-induced vasoconstriction time-dependently decreased to 20% of the initial levels, while time-dependent reduction was not observed in adult preparations. High KCl-induced vasoconstriction in young and adult preparations did not show time-dependent reduction. Endothelium removal abolished time-dependent reduction of methoxamine-induced vasoconstriction in young preparations and significantly attenuated vasoconstriction in adult preparations. Indomethacin, seratrodast, or tempol but not catalase significantly reduced methoxamine-induced vasoconstriction in adult preparations with endothelium. A23187 (Ca(2+)-ionophore)-, but not acetylcholine-, induced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the presence of N(G)-L-nitro arginine methyl ether in adult preparations was significantly smaller than that in young preparations.

Hence, there is interest in identifying compounds capable of protecting cells against DOC. In HCT-116 colon epithelial cells, DOC increased generation of reactive  species and caused DNA damage and apoptosis. These effects of DOC were inhibited by rottlerin, which is a phenolic compound of plant origin. In elucidating its mechansim, rottlerin prevented the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol, and also prevented the cleavage of caspase-3. Yet, rottlerin by itself markedly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial superoxide production, but this did not result in cytochrome c release or in caspase-3 cleavage. At a higher test concentration, two other phenolic phytochemicals, namely, quercetin and resveratrol, were each able to largely prevent the occurrence of apoptosis in cells exposed to DOC.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is also evoked in Aldo-induced renal injury. In the present study, we investigated the role of ER stress in inflammation-mediated renal injury in Aldo-infused mice. C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive treatment for 4 weeks as follows: vehicle infusion, Aldo infusion, vehicle infusion plus tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), and Aldo infusion plus TUDCA. The effect of TUDCA on the Aldo-infused inflammatory response and renal injury was investigated using periodic -Schiff staining, real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. We demonstrate that Aldo leads to impaired renal function and inhibition of ER stress via TUDCA attenuates renal fibrosis. This was indicated by decreased collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, and TGF- expression, as well as the downregulation of the expression of Nlrp3 inflammasome markers, Nlrp3, ASC, IL-1, and IL-18. This paper presents an important role for ER stress on the renal inflammatory response to Aldo. Additionally, the inhibition of ER stress by TUDCA negatively regulates the levels of these inflammatory molecules in the context of Aldo.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26235421>The Bile  Chenodeoxycholic  Increases Human Brown Adipose Tissue Activity.</a></h2><p>The interest in brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a target to combat metabolic disease has recently been renewed with the discovery of functional BAT in humans. In rodents, BAT can be activated by bile acids, which activate type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) in BAT via the G-coupled protein receptor TGR5, resulting in increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. Here we examined the effects of oral supplementation of the bile  chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) on human BAT activity. Treatment of 12 healthy female subjects with CDCA for 2 days resulted in increased BAT activity. Whole-body energy expenditure was also increased upon CDCA treatment. In vitro treatment of primary human brown adipocytes derived with CDCA or specific TGR5 agonists increased mitochondrial uncoupling and D2 expression, an effect that was absent in human primary white adipocytes. These findings identify bile acids as a target to activate BAT in humans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, cholestasis is difficult to diagnose by conventional markers at an early stage of disease. The aim of this study was to identify promising biomarkers for distinguishing the symptom-based types of liver injury (e.g. hepatocellular injury, cholestasis), which was derived from a rigorously statistical perspective. The associations between diagnostic biomarkers (e.g. bile  components, oxidative stress markers and liver fibrosis markers) and the liver injury types were assessed by a multiple logistic regression analysis using 304 blood samples from patients with liver disease. As a result, reductions in the lithocholic  (LCA) and  (DCA) levels, and elevation of the serum sulfated bile  (SSBA), liver fibrosis marker IV collagen (type IV collagen), hyaluronic  (HA) and reactive  species (ROS) levels were all significantly associated with cholestasis. On the other hand, elevations in the LCA and type IV collagen levels, and a reduction in the ursodeoxy cholic  (UDCA) level, were significantly associated with hepatocellular injury. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) was found for ROS, followed by DCA, HA, LCA, SSBA and type IV collagen in the cholestatic-type cases. These results indicated that ROS, the secondary bile  levels such as DCA and LCA, and SSBA are promising biomarkers for cholestasis and for classifying the type of liver injuries. This comprehensive approach will allow for an accurate diagnosis, which will facilitate the selection of an appropriate therapy at the onset of disease.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In oesophageal adenocarcinoma, DCA is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis during reflux where stomach contents enter the lower oesophagus. It is imperative that we understand the mechanisms whereby oesophageal carcinogens function in order that therapeutic options may be developed. We have previously shown that DCA can damage chromosomes and does so through its generation of reactive  species (ROS). We show here, after detailed experiments, that DCA appears to have a non-linear dose response for DNA damage. DCA induces DNA damage (as measured by the micronucleus assay) at doses of 100 microM and higher in oesophageal OE33 cells, but fails to induce such DNA damage below this cut-off dose. We also show that in terms of NF-kappaB activation (as measured by up-regulation of two NF-kappaB target genes) by DCA, a similar dose response is observed. This dose-response data may be important clinically as DCA exposure to the oesophagus may be used as a way to identify the 10% of Barrett's oesophagus patients currently progressing to cancer from the 90% of patients who do not progress. Only quantitative studies measuring DCA concentrations in refluxates correlated with histological progression will answer this question. We further show here that ROS are behind DCAs ability to activate NF-kappaB as antioxidants (epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol and vitamin C) abrogate DCAs ability to up-regulate NF-kappaB-controlled genes. In conclusion, low doses of DCA appear to be less biologically significant in vitro. If this were to be confirmed in vivo, it might suggest that reflux patients with low DCA concentrations may be at a lower risk of cancer progression compared to patients with high levels of DCA in their refluxate. Either way, antioxidant supplementation may possibly help prevent the deleterious effects of DCA in the whole GI tract.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567583>Role of the vascular endothelium in O2 extraction during progressive ischemia in canine skeletal muscle.</a></h2><p>O2 extraction during progressive ischemia in canine skeletal muscle, J. Appl. Physiol. 79(4): 1351-1360, 1995.--O2 uptake (VO2) is defended during decreased O2 delivery (QO2) by an increase in the O2 extraction ratio (O2ER, VO2/QO2), presumably by recruitment of capillaries. This study tested the hypothesis that activity of the microvascular endothelium plays a necessary role in achievement of maximal O2ER. We pump perfused the vascularly isolated hindlimbs of 24 anesthetized and paralyzed dogs at progressively lower flows over a 90-min period. In eight dogs, hindlimb vascular endothelium was removed by injection of deoxycholate (DOC) into the perfusing artery before the ischemic challenge. DOC treatment resulted in loss of normal in vivo and in vitro endothelium-dependent dilatory responses to acetylcholine, but endothelium-independent vascular smooth muscle responses were intact. Eight other dogs were pretreated with nitro-L-arginine methyl ester plus indomethacin (L+I group) to block the synthesis of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin. L+I and DOC treatment were associated with increases in hindlimb vascular resistance of 168 +/- 17 and 63 +/- 12%, respectively. O2ER at critical QO2 (QO2 at which VO2 begins to decrease) was 81 +/- 2% in eight control dogs, 66 +/- 6% in L+I, and 42 +/- 4% in DOC, indicating a significant O2 extraction defect in the two treatment groups. These data suggest that products of the vascular endothelium play an important role in the matching of O2 supply to demand during supply limitation in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10728856>13C nuclear magnetic resonance data of bile  derivatives.</a></h2><p>The 13C-NMR spectra of well over 100 bile  derivatives have been analyzed and summarized.

This has been associated with the accumulation of biliary compounds able to induce oxidative stress. However, other cholephilic compounds such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and bilirubin have direct anti-oxidant properties. In the present study we investigated whether these compounds exert a protective effect on cholestasis-induced oxidative stress in placenta as compared to maternal and fetal livers, and whether this is due in part to the activation of anti-oxidant mechanisms involving vitamin C uptake and biliverdin/bilirubin recycling. In human placenta (JAr) and liver (HepG2) cells,  (DCA) similar rates of free radical generation. In JAr (not HepG2), the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability were impaired by low DCA concentrations; this was partly prevented by bilirubin and UDCA. In HepG2, taurocholic  (TCA) and UDCA up-regulated biliverdin-IX alpha reductase (BVR alpha) and the vitamin C transporter SVCT2 (not SVCT1), whereas bilirubin up-regulated both SVCT1 and SVCT2. In JAr, TCA and UDCA up-regulated BVR alpha, SVCT1 and SVCT2, whereas bilirubin up-regulated only SVCT2. A differential response to these compounds of nuclear receptor expression (SXR, CAR, FXR and SHP) was found in both cell types. When cholestasis was induced in pregnant rats, BVR alpha, SVCT1 and SVCT2 expression in maternal and fetal livers was stimulated, and this was further enhanced by UDCA treatment. In placenta, only BVR alpha was up-regulated. In conclusion, bilirubin accumulation and UDCA administration may directly and indirectly protect the placental-fetal unit from maternal cholestasis-induced oxidative stress.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p></html>
