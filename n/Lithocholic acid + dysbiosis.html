Secondary bile acids produced by intestinal bacteria are ligands for specific nuclear receptors, which regulate glucose, lipid, and drug metabolism in the liver. The present study aimed to clarify the effect of changes in secondary bile acids caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on the host physiology, especially glucose, lipid, and drug metabolism. After oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics for 5 days, decreased amounts of secondary bile -producing bacteria in faeces and a reduction in secondary bile  [ (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA)] levels in the liver were observed. Serum glucose and triglyceride levels were also decreased, and these decreases were reversed by LCA and DCA supplementation. Quantitative proteomics demonstrated that the expression levels of proteins involved in glycogen metabolism, cholesterol, bile  biosynthesis, and drug metabolism (Cyp2b10, Cyp3a25, and Cyp51a1) were altered in the liver in dysbiosis, and these changes were reversed by LCA and DCA supplementation. These results suggested that secondary bile -producing bacteria contribute to the homeostasis of glucose and triglyceride levels and drug metabolism in the host, and have potential as therapeutic targets for treating metabolic disease.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316997>Microbiota-Related Changes in Unconjugated Fecal Bile Acids Are Associated With Naturally Occurring, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in Dogs.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) in humans has recently been associated with altered intestinal microbiota. The consequences of intestinal dysbiosis, such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal dysbiosis and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of dysbiosis and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM. The dog represents a novel large animal model for advancing translational medicine research efforts (e.g., investigating pathogenesis and therapeutics) in DM affecting humans.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472697>Diet-induced remission in chronic enteropathy is associated with altered microbial community structure and synthesis of secondary bile acids.</a></h2><p>The microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved  structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957301>Longitudinal assessment of microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile  concentrations, and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive chronic inflammatory enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Mounting evidence from human studies suggests that bile  dysmetabolism might play a role in various human chronic gastrointestinal diseases. It is unknown whether fecal bile  dysmetabolism occurs in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CE).To assess microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile acids (fUBA), and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.Twenty-four healthy control dogs and 23 dogs with steroid-responsive CE.In this retrospective study, fUBA were measured and analyzed. Fecal microbiota were assessed using a dysbiosis index. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index was used to evaluate remission of clinical signs. This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P = .002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P = .049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3 months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P = 0.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE. Additionally, resolution of clinical activity index in dogs with therapeutically managed CE and bile  dysmetabolism are likely correlated. However, subclinical disease (i.e., microbial dysbiosis) can persist in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.© 2019 The Authors.

The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids and depleted of .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and  activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism. Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27203081>Bile Acids and Dysbiosis in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by dysbiosis. The bidirectional effects between intestinal microbiota (IM) and bile acids (BA) suggest that dysbiosis may be accompanied by an altered bile  (BA) homeostasis, which in turn can contribute to the metabolic dysregulation seen in NAFLD. This study sought to examine BA homeostasis in patients with NAFLD and to relate that with IM data.This was a prospective, cross-sectional study of adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver: NAFL or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: NASH) and healthy controls (HC). Clinical and laboratory data, stool samples and 7-day food records were collected. Fecal BA profiles, serum markers of BA synthesis 7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and intestinal BA signalling, as well as IM composition were assessed.53 subjects were included: 25 HC, 12 NAFL and 16 NASH. Levels of total fecal BA, cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and BA synthesis were higher in patients with NASH compared to HC (p<0.05 for all comparisons). The primary to secondary BA ratio was higher in NASH compared to HC (p = 0.004), but ratio of conjugated to unconjugated BAs was not different between the groups. Bacteroidetes and Clostridium leptum counts were decreased in in a subset of 16 patients with NASH compared to 25 HC, after adjusting for body mass index and weight-adjusted calorie intake (p = 0.028 and p = 0.030, respectively). C. leptum was positively correlated with fecal unconjugated  (LCA) (r = 0.526, p = 0.003) and inversely with unconjugated CA (r = -0.669, p<0.0001) and unconjugated CDCA (r = - 0.630, p<0.0001). FGF19 levels were not different between the groups (p = 0.114).In adults with NAFLD, dysbiosis is associated with altered BA homeostasis, which renders them at increased risk of hepatic injury.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30482679>Bile  7α-Dehydroxylating Gut Bacteria Secrete Antibiotics that Inhibit Clostridium difficile: Role of Secondary Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Clostridium scindens biotransforms primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, and is correlated with inhibition of Clostridium difficile growth in vivo. The aim of the current study was to determine how C. scindens regulates C. difficile growth in vitro and if these interactions might relate to the regulation of gut microbiome structure in vivo. The bile  7α-dehydroxylating gut bacteria, C. scindens and C. sordellii, were found to secrete the tryptophan-derived antibiotics, 1-acetyl-β-carboline and turbomycin A, respectively. Both antibiotics inhibited growth of C. difficile and other gut bacteria. The secondary bile acids, deoxycholic  and , but not cholic , enhanced the inhibitory activity of these antibiotics. These antibiotics appear to inhibit cell division of C. difficile. The results help explain how endogenously synthesized antibiotics and secondary bile acids may regulate C. difficile growth and the structure of the gut microbiome in health and disease.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934972>-Microbial Metabolome-Cancer Cell Interactions in Breast Cancer-Familiar, but Unexplored.</a></h2><p>Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide. Dysbiosis, an aberrant composition of the , characterizes breast cancer. In this review we discuss the changes to the metabolism of breast cancer cells, as well as the composition of the breast and gut  in breast cancer. The role of the breast  in breast cancer is unresolved, nevertheless it seems that the gut  does have a role in the pathology of the disease. The gut  secretes bioactive metabolites (reactivated estrogens, short chain fatty acids, amino  metabolites, or secondary bile acids) that modulate breast cancer. We highlight the bacterial species or taxonomical units that generate these metabolites, we show their mode of action, and discuss how the metabolites affect mitochondrial metabolism and other molecular events in breast cancer. These metabolites resemble human hormones, as they are produced in a "gland" (in this case, the ) and they are subsequently transferred to distant sites of action through the circulation. These metabolites appear to be important constituents of the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we discuss how bacterial dysbiosis interferes with breast cancer treatment through interfering with chemotherapeutic drug metabolism and availability.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p></html>
