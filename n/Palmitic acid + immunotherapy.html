Here, we report the identification, characterization, recombinant expression, tissue localization and protective potential of a Taenia solium FABP (TsFABP1). The TsFABP1 primary structure showed all the conserved residues characteristic of the subfamily iv of the intracellular Lipid-Binding Proteins (iLBPs), including those involved in the binding stabilization of the fatty  molecule. Through a competitive binding assay we found that TsFABP1 is able to bind at least six different fatty acids with preference toward  and stearic , suggesting that TsFABP1 is a member of the iLBP subfamily iv. Immunolocalization assays carried out on larval and adult tissues of four species of taeniids using anti-TsFABP1 hyperimmune sera produced in mice and rabbit, showed intense labeling in the tegument of the spiral canal and in subtegumental cytons of the larvae. These findings suggest that the spiral canal might be a major place for FA uptake in the developing scolex. In contrast, only subtegumental cytons in the adult worms stained positive. We propose that TsFABP1 is involved in the mechanism to mobilize fatty acids between compartments in the extensive syncytial tissue of taeniids. Protection assays carried out in a murine model of cysticercosis showed that subcutaneous immunization with TsFABP1 resulted in about 45% reduction of parasite load against an intraperitoneal challenge with Taenia crassiceps cysts. This reduction in parasite load correlated with the level of cellular and humoral immune responses against TsFABP1, as determined in spleen lymphocyte proliferation and ELISA testing.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The immunogenicity of the peptide(s) and mixture of peptides were studied in mice with different genetic background. Peptide(s) entrapped in ISCOMs using a low-dose immunization strategy generated high-titer as well as high-affinity antibodies. Interestingly, no genetic restriction of the immune response was observed in any of the strains studied. The IgG subclass pattern with the peptide(s) showed predominately IgG2a/2b isotypes, while with the mixed peptide formulation, (un)2-specific IgG isotype pattern showed induction of both IgG1 and IgG2a/2b isotypes. These cytophilic antibodies inhibited the ring as well as schizont stage and total parasite growth during in vitro merozoite reinvasion inhibition study. In the mixed peptide preparation, the same pattern of immune response was achieved as that of individual peptide(s) using ISCOMs delivery. Therefore, the entrapment of otherwise poorly immunogenic synthetic peptides in ISCOMs resulted in increased immunogenicity followed by strong secondary response and can be adopted for developing subunit immunogen formulation against malarial parasite.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17692437>A palmitoyl-tailed sequential oligopeptide carrier for engineering immunogenic conjugates.</a></h2><p>The main guideline in designing effective immunogens as vaccine candidates capable of eliciting potent and specific immune responses is to combine B/T cell epitopes and adjuvants as immunostimulators on the same carrier that links the major histocompatibility complex with T cell receptors. Aiming at contributing to the development of carriers for human usage a helicoid type sequential oligopeptide carrier, SOC(n)-II, formed by the repeating tetrapeptide unit (Aib-Lys-Aib-Gly)(n), n=2-7, elongated from the amino-terminus by the palmitoyl group, known for its adjuvanticity, is now presented. The main B cell epitope, PPGMRPP, of the Sm autoantigen against which the majority of antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is directed, was coupled to the Lys-N(epsilon)H(2) groups of the carrier in four copies and the resulting conjugate Palm-SOC(4)-II-Sm(4) was subjected to animal immunizations without utilizing any adjuvant. The induced immune response was comparable with that produced when Ac-SOC(4)-II-Sm(4) was administered in animals following the conventional immunization protocol of complete/incomplete Freund's adjuvant. High titers of anti-Palm-SOC(4)-II-Sm(4) antibodies were generated, which recognize the priming immunogenic conjugate, as well as reconstituted Sm mimics but not the carrier alone. It is concluded that Palm-SOC(n)-II carrier is a valuable tool for engineering immunogens eliciting enhanced and specific humoral immune responses.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483652>Depletion of tumor-associated macrophages enhances the anti-tumor immunity induced by a Toll-like receptor agonist-conjugated peptide.</a></h2><p>It has been reported that lipopeptides can be used to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against viral diseases and cancer. In our previous study, we determined that mono-palmitoylated peptides can enhance anti-tumor responses in the absence of adjuvant activity. To investigate whether di-palmitoylated peptides with TLR2 agonist activity are able to induce anti-tumor immunity, we synthesized a di--conjugated long peptide that contains a murine CTL epitope of HPV E749-57 (Pam2IDG). Pam2IDG stimulated the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) through TLR2/6. After immunization, Pam2IDG induced higher levels of T cell responses than those obtained with its non-lipidated counterpart (IDG). In the prophylactic model, Pam2IDG immunization completely inhibited tumor growth, whereas IDG immunization was unable to inhibit tumor growth. However, Pam2IDG immunization could not effectively inhibit the growth of established tumors. Therefore, we further investigated whether the depletion of immunosuppressive factors could improve the therapeutic effects of Pam2IDG. Our data indicate that treatment with Pam2IDG combined with clodronate/liposome delays tumor growth and increases the survival rate. We also observed that the therapeutic effects of Pam2IDG are improved by diminishing the function of tumor-associate macrophages (TAMs) and through the use of an IL10 receptor blocking antibody or a Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) inhibitor. In conclusion, the depletion of TAMs may enhance the anti-tumor immunity of a TLR2 agonist-conjugated peptide.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15368273>Lipopeptide epitopes extended by an Nepsilon-palmitoyl-lysine moiety increase uptake and maturation of dendritic cells through a Toll-like receptor-2 pathway and trigger a Th1-dependent protective immunity.</a></h2><p>Lipopeptides, a form of peptide immunogens, are currently under intense investigation as human vaccines for many infectious pathogens and cancers. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lipopeptide immunogenicity are only partially understood. We have investigated the influence of the lipid content on the immunogenicity of lipopeptides using the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gD(1-23) peptide as a model antigen. Totally synthetic lipopeptides were constructed by covalent attachment to the peptide backbone of either Nepsilon-palmitoyl-lysine (palmitoyl-lipidated peptide, palmitoyl-LP) or cholesterol-lysine (cholesterol-lipidated peptide, cholesterol-LP). Immunization of mice with the palmitoyl-LP, but not with its cholesterol-LP analog, induced a strong T cell-dependent protective immunity against lethal HSV-1 infection. Analysis of cytokine profiles and IgG2a/IgG1 ratios revealed that a dominant Th1-type immune response was stimulated by the palmitoyl-LP, as opposed to a Th2 response generated by its cholesterol-LP analog. The palmitoyl-LP was efficiently taken up in vitro by immature dendritic cells (DC) in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and induced phenotypic maturation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DC. Finally, DC stimulated with the palmitoyl-LP induced antigen-specific T cell responses through the Toll-like receptor-2 pathway. These findings have important implications for the development of effective lipopeptide immunization strategies against infectious pathogens.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7515822>Desensitization, phosphorylation and palmitoylation of the human dopamine D1 receptor.</a></h2><p>The regulation and post-translational modifications of the human dopamine D1 receptor were studied in the baculovirus-eukaryotic cell expression system. Baculovirus constructs containing either the DNA encoding the dopamine D1 receptor or a DNA encoding a c-myc epitope tagged dopamine D1 receptor (c-myc-dopamine D1 receptor) were used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Expressed dopamine D1 and c-myc-dopamine D1 receptors bound agonists and antagonists with affinities and a rank order of potency characteristic of a classical dopamine D1 receptor pharmacological profile. In membrane preparations from cells expressing c-myc-dopamine D1 receptor, the photoaffinity label [125I](3-methyl-2-[4'-azidophenyl]-2,3,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepine) ([125I]MAB) bound specifically upon photolysis. A major broad band of approximately 48 kDa was detected. This species was identified in immunoblots by the monoclonal antibody raised against the c-myc epitope of c-myc-dopamine D1 receptor was isolated by immunoprecipitation from whole cells and was shown to be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and palmitoylation. Exposure of cells expressing c-myc-dopamine D1 receptor to dopamine for 15 min resulted in a reduction in the maximal dopamine stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, which was accompanied by an increased phosphorylation of the receptor and a rapid redistribution of surface c-myc-dopamine D1 receptor as detected by in situ immunofluorescence. Dopamine exposure also resulted in an increased level of incorporation of [3H] into the receptor. Thus, we provide the first evidence that the human dopamine D1 receptor undergoes agonist-dependent desensitization, phosphorylation and palmitoylation.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7814635>Development of a lipopeptide-based therapeutic vaccine to treat chronic HBV infection. I. Induction of a primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in humans.</a></h2><p>Our goal is to use peptide epitopes that are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) as immunogens for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection being our first therapeutic target. Because most CTL peptide epitopes are poor immunogens, we specifically modified them by covalently attaching two additional components: a T helper peptide epitope and two lipid molecules. Using the murine influenza virus CTL epitope NP 147-155 as a model system, we found this construct to be highly immunogenic, and a single injection resulted in memory CTL induction that persisted for > 1 yr. Based on the animal studies, a vaccine was designed and tested for both safety and its ability to induce a primary CTL response in normal subjects. The three vaccine components included HBV core antigen peptide 18-27 as the CTL epitope, tetanus toxoid peptide 830-843 as the T helper peptide, and two  molecules as the lipids. A dose escalation trial (5, 50, and 500 micrograms) carried out in 26 normal subjects showed that the vaccine was safe and able to induce a primary HBV-specific CTL response. A dose-response curve was observed and five out of five subjects responded to the 500-micrograms dose.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11401782>Designer cancer vaccines made easy: protein transfer of immunostimulatory molecules for use in therapeutic tumor vaccines.</a></h2><p>Advances in the understanding of the immune response to tumors has led to the development of new strategies to design therapeutic vaccines. One of these strategies is the development of protein transfer of immunostimulatory molecules onto the surface of tumor cells, thereby directing the immune response to the tumor antigens carried by the modified tumor cells. This strategy has been developed as an alternative to gene transfer, the more classical technique of introducing immunostimulatory molecules onto tumors.

To this end, HLA (human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen)-A2-restricted epitopes from several specific viral proteins were tested in an HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model system, which mimics human CTL responses to these viral proteins. Multiple CTL responses were elicited by immunization with either peptides emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), or lipidated peptides administered in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In the case of lipidated peptides, induction of CTL responses was crucially dependent on the presence of helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, and most efficient in the case of lipidated covalently linked HTL-CTL epitope constructs. CTL could also be induced by immunization with lipidated HTL epitopes simply mixed with CTL epitopes and formulated in PBS. However, this approach was highly dependent on the particular lipidated HTL/CTL combination utilized, and was marginally effective for simultaneous priming of multiple CTL responses. By contrast, all HTL/CTL combinations were potent immunogens when delivered as lipidated, covalently linked molecules. This was the most effective of the approaches analysed in terms of multi-epitope priming, as demonstrated by the induction of simultaneous CTL responses to a pool of five different epitopes.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17898288>Protective immunity against ocular herpes infection and disease induced by highly immunogenic self-adjuvanting glycoprotein D lipopeptide vaccines.</a></h2><p>An important phase in the development of an ocular herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) subunit vaccine is the identification of an efficient, safe, and adjuvant-free antigen delivery system capable of inducing and sustaining long-term memory T-cell protective immunity. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that immunization with self-adjuvanting lipopeptide bearing HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) T-cell epitopes would elicit long-term HSV-specific T cells and decrease infection, disease, or both in a ocular herpes mouse model.Five immunodominant CD4(+) T-cell peptide epitopes (gD(1-29), gD(49-82), gD(146-179), gD(228-257), and gD(332-358)), recently identified from HSV-1 gD, were covalently linked to a  moiety (lipopeptides) and delivered subcutaneously in adjuvant-free saline. The primary and memory T cells induced by these molecularly defined lipopeptides and their protective efficacy were assessed, in terms of virus replication in the eye, ocular disease, and survival.Three gD lipopeptides, that drive dendritic cell maturation in vitro, induced long-term, virus-specific, IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) Th(1) responses, associated with a reduction in ocular herpes infection and disease. Immunization with a cocktail of these three highly immunogenic Th(1) lipopeptides increased survival, lowered the peak of ocular virus titer, and cleared the ocular disease.Vaccination with a mixture self-adjuvanting lipopeptides containing novel HSV-1 immunodominant gD T-cell epitopes protected mice from ocular herpes infection and disease. The strength of protective immunity induced by these lipopeptides together with their safety provide a molecularly defined vaccine formulation that could combat ocular herpes infection and disease in humans.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27693020>Novel lipopeptides of ESAT-6 induce strong protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Routes of immunization and TLR agonists critically impact vaccine's efficacy.</a></h2><p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterial cause of tuberculosis, is a leading infectious agent worldwide. The development of a new vaccine against Mtb is essential to control global spread of tuberculosis, since the current vaccine BCG is not very effective and antibiotic resistance is a serious, burgeoning problem. ESAT-6 is a secreted protein of Mtb, which is absent in BCG but has been implicated in inducing protective immunity against Mtb. Peptide based subunit vaccines are attractive due to their safety and high specificity in eliciting immune responses, but small synthetic peptides are usually not very immunogenic. We have designed a novel subunit vaccine for Mtb by using simple lipid () modified derivatives of peptides from ESAT-6 protein corresponding to dominant human T cell epitopes and examined their ability to stimulate protective immunity against Mtb by intranasal and subcutaneous immunization in mice. We also investigated how individual TLR agonists as adjuvants (PolyI:C, MPL and GDQ) contribute to enhancing the induced immune responses and resulting protective efficacy of our vaccine. We observed that single C-terminal palmitoyl-lysine modified lipopeptides derived from ESAT-6 induce significant cellular immune responses on their own upon mucosal and subcutaneous immunizations. Intriguingly, a combination of immunogenic lipopeptides of ESAT-6 antigen exhibited local (pulmonary) and systemic immune responses along with efficient protective efficacy when administered intranasally or subcutaneously. Surprisingly, combination of ESAT-6 derived lipopeptides with a TLR-4 agonist (MPL) enhanced protection, whereas TLR-3 (Poly I:C) and TLR-7/8 agonists (gardiquimod, GDQ) led to reduced protection associated with specific local and systemic immune modulation. Our studies demonstrate the potential of ESAT-6 derived lipopeptides as a promising vaccine candidate against Mtb, and emphasize that selection of adjuvant is critical for the success of vaccines. These findings demonstrate the promise of synthetic lipopeptides as the basis of a subunit vaccine for TB.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specific antibody titres were evaluated by ELISA technique. From 9 peptides 4 were excluded from following investigations showing cross reactivity or low immunogenic effects, sufficient anti-peptide titres were achieved by 5 peptides. Labelling control is possible after 7 days at the earliest and can be used for the whole fattening period after single immunization using an effective carrier-adjuvant-combination. Mixing of peptides in one labelling dose had no negative influence on titres against single peptides. Different combinations of 4 carriers (keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), -3-cystein- (Pam3Cys),  (Pam) and dextran) and 4 adjuvants (Montanide IMS 1313, Montanide ISA 25, Quil A and Diluvac forte) were tested. Optimal labelling could be seen by combination of 50 nmol peptide, KLH as carrier and Montanide IMS 1313 as adjuvant. Generally after booster injection titres were higher, however, a booster dose was not necessary using most effective adjuvants. A less immunogenic, but cost effective alternative for short time labelling (7 weeks) was a peptide-Pam3Cys-conjugate (75 nmol) combined with Quil A as an adjuvant (2 mg/ml).

TLR2 is known to mature myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) to drive mDC contact-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation. Here we tested if MALP-2 activates NK cells through stimulation of TLR2 on mDC. Although synthetic MALP-2 with 6 or 14 amino acids (a.a.) stretch (designated as s and f) matured mDC to induce IL-6, IL-12p40 and TNF-α to a similar extent, they far less activated NK cells than Pam2CSK4, a positive control of 6 a.a.-containing diacyl lipopeptide. MALP-2s and f were TLR2/6 agonists and activate the MyD88 pathway similar to Pam2CSK4, but MALP-2s having the CGNNDE sequence acted on mDC TLR2 to barely induce external NK activation. Even the s form, with slightly high induction of IL-6 compared to the f form, barely induced in vivo growth retardation of NK-sensitive implant tumor. Pam2CSK4 and MALP-2 have the common lipid moiety but different peptides, which are crucial for NK cell activation.

Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) regulates the cellular redox state and metabolism and has been linked to many diseases, including diabetes. Therefore, we examined the role of TXNIP in hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo.Lipogenic and inflammatory proteins produced by hepatocytes treated with  (PA) or transfected with TXNIP or Txnip siRNA were measured by Western blotting. Lipid accumulation was assessed using Oil Red O staining. Protein interactions were assessed by immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Hepatic protein levels were measured by Western blotting from wild type or Txnip(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or chow diet. Livers from NAFLD patients were compared with normal liver by immunohistochemistry.PA increased TXNIP, and inflammatory and lipogenic proteins in both AML12 and H4IIE cells. It also increased the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1α (PGC-1α), which mediated the expression of lipogenic markers and lipid accumulation. In addition, PA increased protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) and PRMT1 siRNA abolished the increase in lipogenic markers with PGC-1α. Furthermore, TXNIP interacted with PRMT1 in PA-treated hepatocytes. In vivo, levels of lipogenic proteins, inflammatory molecules, PGC-1α, and PRMT1 were increased in the livers of HFD mice compared with those fed a chow diet, and were ameliorated in HFD Txnip(-/-) mice.

This article examines the murine T cell response to peptide 315-329 derived from HIV gp160. Surprisingly, immunization with peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant induced class I-restricted T cells as well as class II-restricted T cells. These data suggest that this peptide may have the unusual ability to enter the class I antigen processing pathway. Strategies that employ V3 loop peptides to induce protective immunity must generate T cells that can recognize epitopes derived from whole molecules in vivo. Therefore, peptide-induced T cells were tested for their ability to respond to naturally processed forms of gp120 and gp160 whole-molecule preparations. Peptide induced class I-restricted cells were capable of recognizing transfectants expressing gp160. However, only one of two class II-restricted T cell lines was capable of recognizing soluble whole molecules. This indicates that peptide immunization induces T cells that recognize a class II-restricted determinant that is not generated during normal processing of whole molecules. We have also examined the response of peptide primed T cells to lipidated peptide antigens. Lipidated peptides are generally considered to have increased antigenicity and immunogenicity as compared to normal peptides. However, lipidation of peptide 315-329 damaged both the class I- and II-restricted determinants, indicating that lipidation is not always desirable.

There is no human vaccine against LD currently available. Our approach to a vaccine is based on its surface-exposed glycolipids. One group of these glycolipids termed BBGL-2 consists of 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-(α-d-galactopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol congeners having , oleic, stearic, linoleic, and myristic acids. In order to delineate the immunodominant region(s) of the BBGL-2 components, we embarked on a synthetic project to provide available structurally defined, homogeneous analogs of BBGL-2 that might help identify the best vaccine candidate. The antigenicity of the synthetic glycolipids was examined by dot-blot analysis using mice sera obtained by immunization with killed B. burgdorferi cells, with native BBGL-2 in complete Freund's adjuvant, as well as sera obtained from patients with Lyme disease. We found that the presence of two acyl groups in the glycerol moiety was essential for antigenicity. At least one of these groups must be an oleoyl moiety. Neither the anomeric configuration of the galactose nor the configuration of the glycerol at C-2 was a decisive factor. Based on these findings we designed an 'unnatural' BBGL-2 analog having the structure 3-O-(β-d-galactopyranosyl)-1,2-di-O-oleoyl-dl-glycerol which is easier and less expensive to synthesize than the other BBGL-2 congeners prepared in this study.

However, its clinical use has been limited by severe toxicity, associated primarily with systemic administration with excess protein distributing freely throughout the body. We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate forms permitting more restricted localization may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity. Here, we have tested the utility of palmitate-derivatized rhIL-2. rhIL-2 was reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide palmitate ester. The resultant lipidated rhIL-2 (pIL-2), when mixed with cells, could spontaneously transfer from solution to cell surfaces. Next, anticancer efficacy of pIL-2 was assessed in two modalities. For adoptive T cell therapy, antitumor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were protein transferred ("painted") with pIL-2 and injected into mice bearing lymphoma. For in situ therapy, pIL-2 was injected intratumorally into mice bearing melanoma. Tumor growth and IL-2-associated toxicity were determined.In the lymphoma model, painting of the antitumor CTLs with pIL-2 markedly increased their viability and titer. In the melanoma model, intratumoral injection of pIL-2, but not rhIL-2, increased the number of activated CD8(+) T cells (IFN-γ(+)) in the spleen, reduced lung metastasis and prolonged the survival of treated mice. Moreover, while repeated intratumoral injection of rhIL-2 at an excessively high dose (10 injections of 10,000 IU/mouse) caused marked vascular leakage syndrome, the same regimen using pIL-2 caused no detectable toxicity.Transferring spontaneously from solution to cell surfaces, pIL-2 may bypass the current limitations of rhIL-2 and, thus, serve as a more effective and tolerable anticancer drug.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7542878>Immune response against the murine mdri protein induced by vaccination with synthetic lipopeptides in liposomes.</a></h2><p>Intrinsically, or after exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, many cancer cells overexpress a class of high molecular weight membrane glycoproteins associated with the multidrug resistance (mdr) of these cells.

In the presence of these antibodies the resistance of L1210 mdr cells was reduced from an LD50 of 4 x 10(-5) M to 5 x 10(-7) M doxorubicin.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25443969>Immune-spaying as an alternative to surgical spaying in Iberian×Duroc females: effect on carcass traits and meat quality characteristics.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of immune-spaying on production traits and meat quality characteristics of fresh loin (longissimus dorsi) by comparing 3 groups of Iberian×Duroc females (N=12 per batch): surgically spayed, immune-spayed and entire females. Carcass traits and physicochemical parameters, including fatty  profile, were investigated. The only carcass trait significantly affected by castration was the ham fat thickness, where both immune-spayed and surgically spayed females showed higher values against entire females (57±9.5mm, 62±2.5mm and 51±10.1mm, respectively; p<0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the quality parameters of fresh meat. These results are important regarding animal welfare, since in Europe, there is a plan to voluntarily end the surgical castration of pigs by 2018. Therefore, with an adequate vaccination protocol, immune-spaying might represent a good alternative to surgical spaying. The reliability of immune-spaying over long periods should be evaluated.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, an elevated level of specific antibody is considered a reliable clinical indicator that a state of immunity exists in the host. However, in the case of herpes simplex virus (HSV), the presence of circulating VNA does not necessarily correlate with protection. Thus, it has been found that secondary infections occur in individuals even with high neutralizing titers to HSV, suggesting that antibody to the virus may be useless or even deleterious. In consideration of these facts, we were interested in inducing a T cell response to HSV. We had already shown that synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH3-terminal region of the glycoprotein D (gD) molecule of HSV could induce a strong T cell response when injected into mice, but did not, by themselves, confer protection. In this report, we examined the ability of peptides, covalently coupled to  and incorporated into liposomes, to induce virus-specific T cell responses that confer protection against a lethal challenge of HSV-2. We have demonstrated that long-term protective immunity is achieved with a single immunization in the absence of neutralizing antibody when antigen is presented in this form. Furthermore, T cells but not serum from such immune mice can adoptively transfer this protection.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25916503>Long-term persistence of immunity induced by OVA-coupled gas-filled microbubble vaccination partially protects mice against infection by OVA-expressing Listeria.</a></h2><p>Vaccination aims at generating memory immune responses able to protect individuals against pathogenic challenges over long periods of time. Subunit vaccine formulations based on safe, but poorly immunogenic, antigenic entities must be combined with adjuvant molecules to make them efficient against infections. We have previously shown that gas-filled microbubbles (MB) are potent antigen-delivery systems. This study compares the ability of various ovalbumin-associated MB (OVA-MB) formulations to induce antigen-specific memory immune responses and evaluates long-term protection toward bacterial infections. When initially testing dendritic cells reactivity to MB constituents,  exhibited the highest degree of activation. Subcutaneous immunization of naïve wild-type mice with the OVA-MB formulation comprising the highest  content and devoid of PEG2000 was found to trigger the more pronounced Th1-type response, as reflected by robust IFN-γ and IL-2 production. Both T cell and antibody responses persisted for at least 6 months after immunization. At that time, systemic infection with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytgenes was performed. Partial protection of vaccinated mice was demonstrated by reduction of the bacterial load in both the spleen and liver. We conclude that antigen-bound MB exhibit promising properties as a vaccine candidate ensuring prolonged maintenance of protective immunity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TLR pathway regulation provides a new insight to controlling the inflammatory response induced by fatty . Taken together, our study was aimed to understand the mechanism of fatty -mediated inflammation and look for an effective target which can prevent the inflammatory response induced by obesity. In this study, we used the saturated fatty   (PA) to activate TLR4 signal pathway in human monocyte cells THP-1 that established an intracellular inflammatory model. Followed with activated TLR4, downstream molecular TRAF6 was upregulated and ultimately induced proinflammatory cytokine production. Based on this model, we also found that PA downregulated miR-194 expression with TLR4 activation. Moreover, our results showed that key signal molecular TRAF6 is a target of miR-194, overexpression of miR-194 directly decreased TRAF6 expression and attenuated the release of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in PA-activated monocyte THP-1. We conclude that miR-194 negatively regulates the TLR4 signal pathway which is activated by PA through directly negative TRAF6 expression.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26850222>Efficacy of a therapeutic treatment using gas-filled microbubble-associated phospholipase A2 in a mouse model of honeybee venom allergy.</a></h2><p>Venom  is efficient to desensitize people suffering from insect sting allergies. However, the numerous injections required over several years and important risks of severe side reactions complicate the widespread use of . In the search for novel approaches to blunt the overwhelming pro-allergic Th2 response, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a treatment based on a denatured form of the major allergen, phospholipase A2, associated with microbubbles (PLA2denat -MB) in a mouse model of honeybee venom allergy.Antibodies measured by ELISA, T-cell responses assessed by CFSE-based proliferation assays and ELISA, and basophil degranulation were examined after PLA2denat -MB-based therapeutic treatment of sensitized mice. Mice were challenged with a lethal dose of PLA2 to evaluate protection against anaphylaxis.Therapeutic subcutaneous administration of two different PLA2denat -MB formulations, in contrast to PLA2denat alone, reduced allergic symptoms and protected all mice from anaphylaxis-mediated death after allergen challenge. At the functional level, the use of PLA2denat decreased IgE-mediated basophil degranulation as compared to the native form of the allergen. In comparison with PLA2denat alone, both PLA2denat -MB formulations decreased allergen-specific Th2 CD4 T-cell reactivity. At the mechanistic level, PLA2denat -MB containing 20%  and PEG induced PLA2-specific IgA and increased Foxp3(+) Treg frequencies and TGF-β production, whereas the formulation bearing 80%  triggered the production of IFN-γ, IgG2a, and IgG3.In contrast to conventional PLA2 subcutaneous , the therapeutic administration of PLA2-MB treatment to mice that already had established allergy to PLA2 protects all subsequently challenged animals.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

To determine whether the lipid modification of this protein is required for immunogenicity or the elicitation of biologically active antibodies, a genetic fusion was constructed that contains the sequence of mature Hi-PAL fused to the polylinker region of pUC19. The protein expressed by this clone does not contain detectable lipid and was purified to homogeneity. This recombinant fusion protein, rPAL, elicited a strong immune response when injected into rabbits, and the antiserum reacted well with native Hi-PAL. The antiserum was bactericidal against a number of clinical nontypeable strains, duplicating the activity of anti-Hi-PAL. The anti-rPAL antiserum was also protective against type b bacteremia in the infant rat model. These results demonstrate that purified rPAL elicits antibodies with biological activities that are similar to those of anti-Hi-PAL antibodies. Thus, the lipid component of Hi-PAL is not required for either immunogenicity or elicitation of biologically active antibodies.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18432764>Preparation of immune stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) as adjuvants.</a></h2><p>Purified proteins are often poorly immunogenic and in such cases the induction of primary immune responses requires use of an adjuvant.

The non-obese diabetic mouse is a model of the human autoimmune disease Type I diabetes [1-3]. We have previously shown that ingested type 1 interferon inhibits chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and the adoptive transfer of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelites by T cells, and decreases both antigen-specific and mitogen-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in this disorder. We therefore tried to determine whether ingested murine interferon alpha inhibits insulinitis and suppresses Type I diabetes mellitus in non-obese diabetic mice. Murine interferon alpha, given daily, decreased islet inflammation and suppressed diabetes. It increased the concanavalin A and ionomycin plus myristic   ester-induced production of interleukin 4 and 10 and interferon gamma-secretion in spleen cells from treated mice. Adoptive transfer of unstimulated splenocytes secreting interleukin 4 and interleukin 10 from fed interferon alpha donors suppressed spontaneous diabetes mellitus in recipients. The protective effect of adoptively transferred unstimulated splenocytes shows the presence of ingested interferon alpha-activated regulatory splenic cell populations that may work via increased interleukin 4 or interleukin 10 production.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of glyco-lipopeptides (GLPs) immunogenicity and the position of the lipid moiety on immunogenicity and protective efficacy of GLPs remain to be determined.We have constructed two structural analogues of HER-2 glyco-lipopeptide (HER-GLP) by synthesizing a chimeric peptide made of one universal CD4(+) epitope (PADRE) and one HER-2 CD8(+) T-cell epitope (HER(420-429)). The C-terminal end of the resulting CD4-CD8 chimeric peptide was coupled to a tumor carbohydrate B-cell epitope, based on a regioselectively addressable functionalized templates (RAFT), made of four alpha-GalNAc molecules. The resulting HER glyco-peptide (HER-GP) was then linked to a  moiety, attached either at the N-terminal end (linear HER-GLP-1) or in the middle between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes (branched HER-GLP-2). We have investigated the uptake, processing and cross-presentation pathways of the two HER-GLP vaccine constructs, and assessed whether the position of linkage of the lipid moiety would affect the B- and T-cell immunogenicity and protective efficacy. Immunization of mice revealed that the linear HER-GLP-1 induced a stronger and longer lasting HER(420-429)-specific IFN-gamma producing CD8(+) T cell response, while the branched HER-GLP-2 induced a stronger tumor-specific IgG response. The linear HER-GLP-1 was taken up easily by dendritic cells (DCs), induced stronger DCs maturation and produced a potent TLR- 2-dependent T-cell activation. The linear and branched HER-GLP molecules appeared to follow two different cross-presentation pathways. While regression of established tumors was induced by both linear HER-GLP-1 and branched HER-GLP-2, the inhibition of tumor growth was significantly higher in HER-GLP-1 immunized mice (p<0.005).These findings have important implications for the development of effective GLP based immunotherapeutic strategies against cancers.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421664>A pilot study of the CY-1899 T-cell vaccine in subjects chronically infected with hepatitis B virus.

Vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity directed at HLA class I-bound viral epitopes are detected during acute hepatitis B, but not in chronic hepatitis B carriers. A CTL epitope derived from the hepatitis B core protein amino acids 18-27 has been incorporated into a vaccine also comprised of a T-helper cell epitope and 2  residues (CY-1899). The aim of this study was to determine whether repeated doses of CY-1899 given to patients with chronic hepatitis B could initiate in vivo CTL activity and viral clearance. Patients with chronic hepatitis B received up to 4 doses (ranging from 0.05 mg to 15 mg) 6 weeks apart. Following vaccination, patients were monitored for hepatitis B surface antigen and "e" status, HBV-DNA levels, liver biochemistry, CTL activity, and any adverse events. Ninety patients with chronic hepatitis B infection received CY-1899. Mean CTL responses were all low but were maximal following vaccination with 5 mg CY-1899. Peak CTL responses never exceeded 10 lytic units (LU) regardless of vaccine dose, this value being well below that seen following resolution of acute hepatitis B. No significant changes in liver biochemistry or viral serology were observed during follow-up. No serious adverse events were noted. Administration of the single-epitope vaccine, CY-1899, initiated CTL activity, but of a magnitude lower than that observed during spontaneous HBV clearance.

The 2.1-kb pypag-2 cDNA contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 409-amino- protein with a predicted molecular mass of 46.8 kDa. Unlike many characterized plasmodial antigens, blocks of tandemly repeated amino acids are lacking in the pypAg-2 protein sequence. Recombinant pypAg-2, comprising the full-length protein minus the predicted N-terminal signal and C-terminal anchor sequences, was produced and used to raise a high-titer polyclonal rabbit antiserum. This antiserum was used to identify and characterize the native protein through immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Consistent with the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, pypAg-2 fractionated with the detergent phase of Triton X-114-solubilized proteins and could be metabolically labeled with [(3)H]. By immunofluorescence, pypAg-2 expression was localized to both the trophozoite and merozoite membranes. Similar to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1, pypAg-2 contains two C-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Most importantly, immunization with recombinant pypAg-2 protected mice against lethal P. yoelii malaria.

However, peptides less than about 20 to 30 amino acids long are poor immunogens. In general, to increase its immunogenicity, the presentation of the peptide should be improved, and molecular weight needs to be increased. Many attempts have been made to couple peptide immunogens to different carrier proteins [e.g. keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) or ovalbumin]. This leads to very complex structures, however. We used a controlled conjugation of a peptide to a single long-chain fatty  like  by a thioester or an amide bond. It was found that these S-palmitoylated peptides were much more immunogenic than N-palmitoylated peptides and at least similar to KLH-conjugated peptides with respect to appearance and magnitude of induced antibodies (canine parvovirus) or immunocastration effect (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). For chemical synthesis of thioesters, we established conditions for solution and solid-phase synthesis. In both phases, Cys(SBut) could only be deprotected efficiently using phosphines, and S-acylation was accomplished using standard coupling at pH 5. We speculate that, in vivo, the presence of an appropriate fatty  chain, chemically linked through a labile thioester bond, greatly enhances immunogenicity, because it represents a favourable substrate for cleavage by cellular thioesterases in cells of the immune system.</p><p>Keyword: immunotherapy</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14645418>Fully synthetic carbohydrate-based vaccines in biochemically relapsed prostate cancer: clinical trial results with alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine-O-serine/threonine conjugate vaccine.</a></h2><p>We report the synthesis of a mucin-related O-linked glycopeptide, alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine-O-serine/threonine (Tn), which is highly simplistic in its structure and can induce a relevant humoral response when given in a trimer or clustered (c) formation.
