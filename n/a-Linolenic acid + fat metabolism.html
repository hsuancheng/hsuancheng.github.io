Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) can be found in brown and golden varieties; however, questions have arisen as to whether the variety may influence the health effects.The objective of this study was to compare the effects of brown and golden flaxseeds on lipid profile, glycemia, blood pressure, inflammatory status,body weight, and body composition in overweight adolescents.Seventy-five overweight adolescents (33 boys, 42 girls; age 13.7 ! 2.1 y), from Alegre-ES, Brazil, were randomized to one of the three groups (n ¼ 25) on a parallel, single-blind clinical trial. They received 28 g/d of brown flaxseed (BF), golden flaxseed (GF), or the equivalent amount of wheat bran (Control, CG) in different preparations at school from Monday to Friday for 11 wk. Blood pressure, anthropometric evaluation, and the analyses of blood total cholesterol, lipoproteins, glucose, and inflammatory markers were performed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. The data were analyzed by ANCOVA at 5% significance.The groups who consumed brown and golden flaxseed showed significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Brown and golden flaxseed did not differentially affect plasma lipid responses, plasma glucose and inflammatory profile, although all groups (BF, GF, and CG) showed increased levels of TNF-a.The adolescents consumed about half the daily amount provided, which may not have been sufficient to exert the health benefits of flaxseed reported in the literature, concerning the lipid profile, inflammation biomarkers and body composition.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

During the last decade, some fatty  (FA) have received attention because of their functional and beneficial effects on human health. The milk FA profile is affected by both diet and genetics. Differences in milk fat composition are based on biochemical pathways, and candidate genes have been proposed to explain FA profile variation. Here, the association between DGAT1 K232A, SCD1 A293V, and LEPR T945M markers with milk fat composition in southern Chile was evaluated. We selected five herds of Holstein-Friesian, Jersey, Frisón Negro, Montbeliarde, and Overo Colorado cows (pasture-grazed) that received strategic supplementation with concentrates and conserved forages. We genotyped the SNPs and calculated allele frequencies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Milk fat composition was determined for individual milk samples over a year, and associations between genotypes and milk composition were studied. The most frequent variants for DGAT1, SCD1, and LEPR polymorphisms were GC/GC, C, and C, respectively. The DGAT1 GC/GC allele was associated with lower milk fat and protein content, lower saturated fatty  levels, and higher polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3 and n-6 FA, and   to cholesterolemic FA ratios, which implied a healthier FA profile. The SCD1 CC genotype was associated with a low cholesterolemic FA content, a high ratio of linolenic  to cholesterolemic FA, and lower conjugated-linolenic  and PUFA content. These results suggest the possible modulation of milk fat profiles, using specific genotypes, to improve the nutritional quality of dairy products.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597785>Palmitic  (16:0) competes with omega-6 linoleic and omega-3 ɑ-linolenic  for FADS2 mediated Δ6-desaturation.</a></h2><p>Sapienic , 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty  on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty  levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty , and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to  and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
