Here, we report that although catecholamines, mediators of systemic sympathetic activity, display only weak immunosuppressive impact on their own, their combination with inflammatory signals leads to the induction of COX-2 and multiple COX-2-dependent suppressive factors in human myeloid cells and  tissues. Human macrophages exposed to epinephrine and TNFα, or macrophages generated in 6day cultures in the presence of epinephrine, expressed high levels of COX-2, IDO and IL-10, and strongly suppressed both the proliferation and IFNγ production of CD8 T cells. These suppressive effects of epinephrine were counteracted by celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2 activity, which inhibited the induction of immunosuppressive factors (including the elevated expression of COX-2 itself) and the ability of epinephrine-exposed macrophages to suppress CD8 T cell responses. The activation of the COX-2/PGE system and COX-2-dependent suppressive events were also observed in ex vivo human breast and  explant cultures and were similarly counteracted by celecoxib. Our preliminary data also indicate elevated COX-2 expression in mammary tumors of chronic stress-exposed mice. The current demonstration of the interplay between inflammation and the induction of immunosuppressive factors by catecholamines suggest a contextual impact of stress, helping to explain variable results of epidemiologic studies of the link between sympathetic activity and  progression, and implicating COX-2 blockade as a potential means to mitigate stress-related immune suppression.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A gold disk modified with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) was functionalised via covalent immobilization of monoclonal anti-ET-1 antibodies using EDC-NHS (1-(3-(dimethylamine)-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, N-hydroxy succinimide) chemistry. This immunosensing platform (/anti-ET-1/11-MUA/Au) was characterized via atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (CA) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic techniques. The fabricated SPR electrode was further used to detect ET-1 in the broad concentration range 2-100 pg mL, with a detection limit of 0.30 pg mL and remarkable sensitivity of 2.18 m pgmL. The adsorption mechanism was studied using monophasic model and the values of association (k) and dissociation (k) constants for anti-ET-1 and ET-1 binding were calculated to be 4.4 ± 0.4 × 10 M s and 2.04 ± 0.0003 × 10 s, respectively. The results obtained via analysis of serum samples of colorectal  patients were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Further, electrochemical studies were performed to prove the efficacy of the fabricated platform as a point of care device for the detection of ET-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of TMAO and its biomarker precursors (choline, carnitine, and betaine) and incident colorectal  risk in a nested case-control study of male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene  Prevention (ATBC) Study. We measured biomarker concentrations in baseline fasting serum samples from 644 incident colorectal  cases and 644 controls using LC/MS-MS. Logistic regression models estimated the ORs and 95% confidence interval (CI) for colorectal  by quartile (Q) of serum TMAO, choline, carnitine, and betaine concentrations. Men with higher serum choline at ATBC baseline had approximately 3-fold greater risk of developing colorectal  over the ensuing (median ± IQR) 14 ± 10 years (in fully adjusted models, Q4 vs. Q1, OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.24-4.61;  < 0.0001). The prognostic value of serum choline for prediction of incident colorectal  was similarly robust for proximal, distal, and rectal  cancers (all  < 0.0001). The association between serum TMAO, carnitine, or betaine and colorectal  risk was not statistically significant ( = 0.25, 0.71, and 0.61, respectively). Higher serum choline concentration (but not TMAO, carnitine, or betaine) was associated with increased risk of colorectal . Serum choline levels showed strong prognostic value for prediction of incident colorectal  risk across all anatomical subsites, suggesting a role of altered choline metabolism in colorectal  pathogenesis. .©2017 American Association for  Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532461>Choline transporter-like proteins CTLs/SLC44 family as a novel molecular target for  therapy.</a></h2><p>Choline is essential for the synthesis of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC), the methyl donor betaine and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Elevated levels of choline and up-regulated choline kinase activity have been detected in various cancers. Thus, the intracellular accumulation of choline through choline transporters is the rate-limiting step in phospholipid metabolism and a prerequisite for  cell proliferation. Previous studies have demonstrated abnormalities in choline uptake and choline phospholipid metabolism in  cells using the imaging of  with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The aberrant choline metabolism in  cells is strongly correlated with their malignant progression. Using quantitative real-time PCR, the mRNA expression of choline transporters was measured, and it was found that choline transporter-like proteins CTLs/SLC44 family are highly expressed in various  cell lines. Choline uptake through CTLs is associated with cell viability, and the functional inhibition of CTLs could promote apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, non-neuronal cholinergic systems that include CTLs-mediated choline transport are associated with cell proliferation and their inhibition promotes apoptotic cell death in , small cell lung  and human leukemic T-cells. The identification of this new CTLs-mediated choline transport system provides a potential new target for  therapy.Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26058426>The stress hormone norepinephrine increases migration of prostate  cells in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>The metastatic process is the most serious cause of  death. Norepinephrine, secreted in chronic stress conditions, stimulates the motility of breast and  cells through β-adrenergic receptor. On these bases, we examined its possible role in metastasis formation and development in vitro and in vivo. Treatments with norepinephrine (β2-adrenoreceptor agonist) in mice xenografted with human DU145 prostate  cells increased the metastatic potential of these cells. Specifically, we showed that treatment of mice with norepinephrine induced a significant increase of the migratory activity of  cells in a concentration-dependent manner and that this process was blocked by propanolol (β-adrenergic antagonist). Mice treated with norepinephrine, displayed an increased number of metastatic foci of DU145 cells in inguinal lymph nodes and also showed an increased expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in tumor samples compared to controls. Moreover, we demonstrated that propanolol induced in norepinephrine treated DU145 cells a E-cadherin finger-like membrane protrusions driven by vimentin remodeling. Altogether these data suggest that β2-AR plays an important role in prostate  metastasis formation and that the treatment with antagonist propanolol, could represents an interesting tool to control this process in cells overexpressing β2AR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26113740>Percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization using foam  oleate and carbon dioxide (CO₂): a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization (PTPE) can induce atrophy of the embolized- and hypertrophy of the residual area. These effects are advantageous in patients scheduled for extended hepatectomy.To evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of foam sclerotherapy with foam  oleate (EO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) for PTPE before hepatectomy.We performed sclerotherapy for PTPE in 15 patients with: hepatocellular carcinoma (HHC; n = 9), bile duct carcinoma (n = 5), or metastatic liver tumor from  (n = 1). The foam contained 5% EO iopamidol (EOI) and CO2 at a 1:2 ratio. We compared the percentage of the pre- and post-PTPE future liver remnant (FLR) volumes and calculated the percent FLR volume (%FLR) increase after PTPE.The amount of EOI used (range, 14-20 mL; median, 16.8 mL) was based on the volume of the target portal vein. Technical success was achieved in 14 of 15 patients (93%); the other patient presented with computed tomography evidence of recanalization 1 week after PTPE. The FLR volume before and after portal vein embolization was 599 ± 342 and 691 ± 318 cm(3), respectively (P < 0.01); the mean %FLR volume increase was 29.5%. There was no significant difference in the mean platelet count, total bilirubin, total aspartate aminotransferase, and total creatinine before and after PTPE. One patient suffered intra-abdominal bleeding that required transcatheter arterial embolization. No other patients developed major complications higher than grade 3.Sclerotherapy using foam EOI and CO2 is clinically safe and effective for PTPE before hepatectomy.© The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2015.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481234>Clinical and biochemical relevance of monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism targeting strategy for  stem cell elimination in .</a></h2><p>Lipid metabolism is associated with  prognosis and incidence. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which converts fully saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), has been suggested as a vulnerable target for selective elimination of  stem cells (CSCs). However, the clinical significance and physiological role of SCD1 in CSCs has not been well demonstrated. Here, we showed the clinical and biochemical relevance of blocking SCD1 to target CSCs by analyzing human  data from TCGA and through lipidomic profiling of CSCs with or without SCD1 inhibition using mass spectrometry. Positive associations between SCD1 expression and colorectal  patient clinical status and the expression of CSC-related genes (WNT and NOTCH signaling) were found based on TCGA data analysis. Lipidomic profiling of CSCs and bulk  cells (BCCs) using mass spectrometry revealed that  CSCs contained a distinctive lipid profile, with higher free MUFA and lower free SFA levels than in BCCs, suggesting that enhanced SCD1 activity generates MUFAs that may support WNT signaling in CSCs. In addition, all identified phosphatidyl--containing MUFAs were found at higher levels in CSCs. Interestingly, we observed lower phosphatidyl-serine (18:1/18:0), phosphatidyl-choline (PC; p-18:0/18:1)), and sphingomyelin (SM; d18:1/20:0 or d16:1/22:0) levels in CSCs than in BCCs. Of those, SCD1 inhibition, which efficiently diminished free MUFA levels, increased those specific PC and SM and MUFAs in CSCs promptly. These results suggest that these specific lipid composition is critical for CSC stem cell maintenance. In addition, not only free MUFAs, which are known to be required for WNT signaling, but also other phospholipids, such as SM, which are important for lipid raft formation, may mediate other cell signaling pathways that support CSC maintenance. Comparison of the lipidomic profiles of  cells with those of previously reported for glioma cells further demonstrated the tissue specific characteristics of lipid metabolism in CSCs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been reported that Apc mice maintained on a diet deficient in the methyl donors folic acid, methionine, choline, and vitamin B12, and supplemented with homocysteine, show a greater than 95% reduction in intestinal tumor development. The present study extends these findings and shows that tumor protection afforded by dietary methyl donor deficiency (MDD) is long-lasting. After 11 weeks of MDD, tumor protection persisted for at least an additional 7 weeks of methyl donor repletion (22.2 ± 3.5 vs. 70.2 ± 4.6 tumors per mouse; P < 0.01). Sustained tumor protection was associated with a reduction in intestinal crypt length (26%, P < 0.01), crypt cell division and crypt fission, and an increase in apoptosis of both normal crypts and tumors (4.9- and 3.2-fold, respectively, P < 0.01). MDD also caused a significant reduction in the number of Dclk1-positive cells in the intestine (62%, P < 0.01), a long-lived crypt cell with  stem cell potential. Several undesirable effects associated with methyl donor restriction (e.g., reduced body weight gain) were shown to be transient and readily reversible following methyl donor repletion. Taken together, these results indicate that even temporary dietary methyl donor restriction in adenoma-prone mice can induce persistent changes to the intestinal epithelium and provide long-lasting tumor protection. These data also suggest that transient reductions in dietary methyl donor consumption should be considered when studying the impact of folate on  risk in humans.

A high expression level of PCho, due to elevated CK activity, has previously been associated with malignant transformation. In the present study, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the mRNA expression profiles of ck and ek mRNA variants in MCF7 breast, HCT116  and HepG2 liver  cells. The ck and ek mRNA expression profiles showed that total ckα was expressed most abundantly in the HepG2 cells. The HCT116 cells exhibited the highest ckβ and ek1 mRNA expression levels, whereas the highest ek2α mRNA expression levels were detected in the MCF7 cells. The ckβ variant had higher mRNA expression levels, as compared with total ckα, in both the MCF7 and HCT116 cells. Relatively low ek1 mRNA expression levels were detected, as compared with ek2α in the MCF7 cells; however, this was not observed in the HCT116 and HepG2 cells. Notably, the mRNA expression levels of ckα2 were markedly low, as compared with ckα1, in all three  cell lines. The effects of epigenetic modification on ck and ek mRNA expression, by treatment of the cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), were also investigated. The results of the present study showed that the mRNA expression levels of ckα, ckβ and ek2α were affected by TSA. An increase >8-fold was observed in ek2α mRNA expression upon treatment with TSA, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the levels of ck and ek transcript variants in the three  cell lines were varied. The effects of TSA treatment on the mRNA expression levels of ck and ek imply that ck and ek mRNA expression may be regulated by epigenetic modification.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836914>Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity of Mefloquine-Based Analogs Against Sensitive and Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strains.</a></h2><p>Background and Introduction: Mefloquine, a drug used to prevent and treat malaria is described possessing activity against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as well as against multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR) and other types of bacteria. Despite their importance, few compounds based on the Mefloquine nucleus have been synthesized and evaluated against TB.For the synthesis of all the compounds based on the Mefloquine nucleus we used a synthetic route which utilized the key derivative 4-methoxy-2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl)quinoline 2 as starting material. The compounds 3 (a-c), 4 (a-b) were synthesized after one step by reaction of 2 with appropriate amines substituted. The chloro derivatives 5 and 6 were obtained from compounds 4b and 4a by treatment with SOCl2 in CH2Cl2 at reflux in 75 and 80% yield, respectively. The analogue 6 was converted to 7 after treatment with  under heating at 90oC in 64% yield and to the azido derivative 8 in 56% after reaction with sodium azide in MeOH at reflux for 2 h. The analogue 9 was obtained after reaction of 5 with  at 90oC for 1 h in 90% yield. All the new compounds were identified by detailed spectral data, including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectra. All the compound were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 27294, using the microplate Alamar Blue assay (MABA). The more active compounds 3c, 7, and 9 were also evaluated against resistant strain SR 2571/0215 (resistant to Rifampicin and Isoniazid) by above method. All compounds were tested against three  cell lines: SF-295 (glioblastoma), HCT-116 () and PC-3 (prostate) using the MTT assay.All the planned ten compounds were synthetically obtained in good global yield, displaying activity against sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro, with exception of one, with MIC values between 37.2 and 154.8 µM. The compounds 3c (37.2 µM), 7 (68.1 µM) and 9 (65.6 µM) showed the highest activity in this series with MIC values similar when compare to the standard Mefloquine (30 - 60 µM), being 3c the most potent. The more active compounds 3c, 7, and 9 were also evaluated against resistant strain, displaying MIC of 37.2, 136.2 and 65.6 µM, respectively. All compounds were tested against three  cell lines and showed low cytotoxicity.All synthesized compounds, with the exception of 5, exhibited activity against the Mtb. Compound 3c was the most potent against resistant and sensitive Mtb in this series, with MIC value of 37.2 µM. All compounds showed low cytotoxicity.

Along the  crypt axis, and concomitant to the differentiation process, certain lipid species tightly linked to signaling (phosphatidylinositols and arachidonic acid (AA)-containing diacylglycerophospholipids), change following a rather simple mathematical expression. We extend here our observations to  plasmalogens (PlsEtn), a unique type of glycerophospholipid presenting a vinyl ether linkage at sn-1 position. PlsEtn distribution was studied in healthy, adenomatous, and carcinomatous  mucosa sections by IMS. In epithelium, 75% of PlsEtn changed in a highly regular manner along the crypt axis, in clear contrast with diacyl species (67% of which remained constant). Consistently, AA-containing PlsEtn species were more abundant at the base, where stem cells reside, and decreased while ascending the crypt. In turn, mono-/diunsaturated species experienced the opposite change. These gradients were accompanied by a gradual expression of ether lipid synthesis enzymes. In lamina propria, 90% of stromal PlsEtn remained unchanged despite the high content of AA and the gradient in AA-containing diacylglycerophospholipids. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were severely affected in polyps and carcinoma. These results link PlsEtn species regulation to cell differentiation for the first time and confirm that diacyl and ether species are differently regulated. Furthermore, they reaffirm the observations on cell lipid fingerprint image sensitivity to predict cell pathophysiological status, reinforcing the translational impact both lipidome and IMS might have in clinical research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Milne-Redh. & Schweick in particular has been used by Zulu, Sotho and Tswana people to treat tumors as a form of chemotherapy, while in Madagascar, Crinum powellii Baker Handb. was used in the treatment of abscesses and tumors. Many of the alkaloids spawned by genus Crinum will surely take part in the production of anticancer drugs but their further clinical development is restricted by their limited commercial availability. An emerging area of research is the establishment of green extraction techniques of different targeted compounds.Our comparative study has investigated the possibility of getting improved biological responses by changing extraction solvent to a better and greener one. This study aimed to assess the cytotoxic activity of Crinum powellii and Crinum bulbispermum bulbs, when extracted by different green solvents.The green solvents Genapol X-80 (a surfactant-aided extraction), DES-3 (Choline chloride: fructose 5:2) mixture (a natural deep eutectic solvent) and purified distilled water were used for extraction of the bulbs. Extracts were tested against two cell lines HEPG-2 and HCT 116, with doxorubicin as a positive reference. Molecular docking studies were carried out to illustrate binding orientations of the alkaloids in the active site of several molecular targets for treatment of hepatic and colorectal .DES aided extraction showed highest cytotoxicity against the two cell lines, followed by surfactant aided extracts and finally aqueous extracts. There is an obvious relationship between alkaloidal content and antiproliferative potency of extracts. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed to aid the prediction of the alkaloids responsible for the activity. The alkaloid crinine showed high correlation coefficient value against HCT  cell line in the orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS) model, suggesting that it could operate with a selective mode of action on this cell line. In addition, the alkaloid lycorine had almost no correlation to anti-proliferative activity against HCT  cells. Molecular docking studies confirmed the same conclusions.Herein, it was demonstrated that natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) components and surfactant solutions could be chosen to enhance biological activity of extracts prepared.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The development of a neuropathic syndrome impairs quality of life and potentially results in chemotherapy dose reductions and/or early discontinuation. In the complex pattern of molecular and morphological alterations induced by oxaliplatin in the nervous system, an important activation of glia has been preclinically evidenced. N-Palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) modulates glial cells and exerts antinociceptive effects in several animal models. In order to improve the therapeutic chances for chemotherapy-dependent neuropathy management, the role of PEA was investigated in a rat model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy (2.4 mg kg-1 daily, intraperitoneally). On day 21, a single administration of PEA (30 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to reduce oxaliplatin-dependent pain induced by mechanical and thermal stimuli. The repeated treatment with PEA (30 mg kg-1 daily i.p. for 21 days, from the first oxaliplatin injection) prevented lowering of pain threshold as well as increased pain on suprathreshold stimulation. Ex vivo histological and molecular analysis of dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerves and spinal cord highlighted neuroprotective effects and glia-activation prevention induced by PEA repeated administration. The protective effect of PEA resulted in the normalization of the electrophysiological activity of the spinal nociceptive neurons. Finally, PEA did not alter the oxaliplatin-induced mortality of the human  cell line HT-29. The efficacy of PEA in neuropathic pain control and in preventing nervous tissue alteration candidates this endogenous compound as disease modifying agent.

We aimed at evaluating its antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects in human  adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cell line. Caco-2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PEA (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 μM) in the presence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a (PPAR-α) or PPAR-γ antagonists. Cell proliferation was evaluated by performing a MTT assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release was estimated by ELISA, while the expression of VEGF receptor and the activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were evaluated by western blot analysis. PEA caused a significant and concentration-dependent decrease of Caco-2 cell proliferation at 48 h. PEA administration significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner VEGF secretion and VEGF receptor expression. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and a downstream decrease of phospho-mTOR and of p-p70S6K were observed as compared with untreated cells. PPAR-α, but not PPAR-γ antagonist, reverted all effects of PEA. PEA is able to decrease cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The antiangiogenic effect of PEA depends on the specific inhibition of the AkT/mTOR axis, through the activation of PPAR-α pathway.

TMAO is formed from trimethylamine (TMA)-precursors such as choline via the combined action of the gut microbiota and liver. We conducted a Mediterranean diet intervention that increased intakes of fiber and changed intakes of many other foods containing fat to increase the relative amount of mono-unsaturated fats in the diet. The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases and might counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of increased TMAO formation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the Mediterranean diet would reduce TMAO concentrations. Fasting TMAO concentrations were measured before and after six-months of dietary intervention in 115 healthy people at increased risk for . No significant changes in plasma TMAO or in the ratios of TMAO to precursor compounds were found in either the Mediterranean group or the comparison group that followed a Healthy Eating diet. TMAO concentrations exhibited positive correlations with age and markers of metabolic health. TMAO concentrations were not associated with circulating cytokines, but the relative abundance of Akkermansia mucinophilia in  biopsies was modestly and inversely correlated with baseline TMAO, choline, and betaine serum concentrations. These results suggest that broad dietary pattern intervention over six months may not be sufficient for reducing TMAO concentrations in an otherwise healthy population. Disruption of the conversion of dietary TMA to TMAO should be the focus of future studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28772225>An LC/MS/MS method for quantitation of chemopreventive sphingadienes in food products and biological samples.</a></h2><p>Colorectal  (CRC) is a leading cause of  mortality. Diet has a significant influence on  risk. Identifying chemopreventive agents, dietary constituents, practices and/or diet supplements that promote gut health and reduce the incidence of intestinal neoplasias and CRC could significantly impact public health. Sphingadienes (SDs) are dietary sphingolipids found in plant-based food products. SDs are cytotoxic to  cells and exhibit chemopreventive properties. The aim of the present study was to develop a sensitive and robust ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for quantifying SDs in food products and biological samples. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 80nM to 50μM and was sensitive to a detection limit of 3.3nM. Post-extraction stability was 100% at 24h. SD content in soy oils was approximately 10nM. SDs were detected transiently in the plasma of adult mice 10min after gavage delivery of a 25mg/kg bolus and declined to baseline by 1h. SD uptake in the gut was maximal in the duodenum and peaked 1h after gavage delivery. Disappearance of SDs in the lower gastrointestinal tract suggests either rapid metabolism to yet unidentified products or potentially luminal export.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to compare the complete resection rate of hot snare polypectomy (HSP) with that of EMR for small, sessile, or flat polyps.Patients with 5- to 9-mm non-pedunculated colorectal polyps were prospectively randomized to the HSP or EMR group. The presence of residual polyps was assessed by performing histologic assessment of 4-quadrant forceps biopsy specimens taken from the edges of the polypectomy site. The primary outcome was the complete resection rate after HSP or EMR; the secondary outcomes were the proportion of procedure-related adverse events and specimen-loss rate. Sample size was estimated using a superiority trial design. We assumed that the complete resection rate of the EMR group would be at least 8% higher than that of the HSP group.A total of 382 polyps in 269 patients were assessed and randomly assigned to each method using 4 × 4 block randomization. Of these, 353 polyps were finally analyzed based on the pathology results. The mean polyp size was 6.3 ± 1.3 mm. The complete resection rate did not differ between the HSP and EMR groups (88.4% [152/172] vs 92.8% [168/181], respectively; P = .2). The intraprocedural bleeding rate, immediately after polypectomy, was significantly higher in the HSP group than in the EMR group (5.2% vs 0.6%, respectively; P = .009). However, clinically significant bleeding and tissue retrieval failure rates did not differ between the groups. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, sessile serrated adenoma/polyps or hyperplastic polyps were almost 3 times (odds ratio, 2.824; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-7.75; P = .044) more likely to be incompletely resected compared with other conventional adenomatous polyps. Except for pathology, we found no significant independent predictors for incomplete resection.EMR for small non-pedunculated colorectal polyps is not superior to HSP in terms of complete resection or safety. Both methods can be performed according to the endoscopist's preference.

Aerobic glycolysis reduces pyruvate flux into mitochondria, preventing a complete oxidation of glucose and shunting glucose to anabolic pathways essential for cell proliferation. Here we tested a new strategy, mitochondrial uncoupling, for its potential of antagonizing the anabolic effect of aerobic glycolysis and for its potential anticancer activities. Mitochondrial uncoupling is a process that facilitates proton influx across the mitochondrial inner membrane without generating ATP, stimulating a futile cycle of acetyl- CoA oxidation. We tested two safe mitochondrial uncouplers, NEN (niclosamide ) and oxyclozanide, on their metabolic effects and anti- activities. We used metabolomic NMR to examine the effect of mitochondrial uncoupling on glucose metabolism in  MC38 cells. We further tested the anti- effect of NEN and oxyclozanide in cultured cell models, APC mouse model, and a metastatic  mouse model. Using a metabolomic NMR approach, we demonstrated that mitochondrial uncoupling promotes pyruvate influx to mitochondria and reduces various anabolic pathway activities. Moreover, mitochondrial uncoupling inhibits cell proliferation and reduces clonogenicity of cultured  cells. Furthermore, oral treatment with mitochondrial uncouplers reduces intestinal polyp formation in APC mice, and diminishes hepatic metastasis of  cells transplanted intrasplenically. Our data highlight a unique approach for targeting  cell metabolism for  prevention and treatment, identified two prototype compounds, and shed light on the anti- mechanism of niclosamide.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28954820>Cannabidiol and palmitoylethanolamide are anti-inflammatory in the acutely inflamed human .</a></h2><p>We sought to quantify the anti-inflammatory effects of two cannabinoid drugs, cannabidiol (CBD) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), in cultured cell lines and compared this effect with experimentally inflamed explant human  tissue. These effects were explored in acutely and chronically inflamed , using inflammatory bowel disease and appendicitis explants.Caco-2 cells and human  explants collected from elective bowel , inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or acute appendicitis resections, and were treated with the following drug treatments: vehicle, an inflammatory protocol of interferon γ (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα; 10 ng/ml), inflammation and PEA (10 µM), inflammation and CBD (10 µM), and PEA or CBD alone, CBD or vehicle were added simultaneously with IFNγ. Nine intracellular signalling phosphoproteins were determined by multiplex. Inflammatory cytokine secretion was determined using ELISA. Receptor mechanisms were investigated using antagonists for CB, CB, PPARα, PPARγ, TRPV1 and GPR55.IFNγ and TNFα treatment increased phosphoprotein and cytokine levels in Caco-2 cultures and  explants. Phosphoprotein levels were significantly reduced by PEA or CBD in Caco-2 cultures and  explants. CBD and PEA prevented increases in cytokine production in explant , but not in Caco-2 cells. CBD effects were blocked by the CB antagonist AM630 and TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. PEA effects were blocked by the PPARα antagonist GW6471. PEA and CBD were anti-inflammatory in IBD and appendicitis explants.PEA and CBD are anti-inflammatory in the human . This effect is not seen in cultured epithelial cells. Appropriately sized clinical trials should assess their efficacy.© 2017 The Author(s).

Stress response has been associated with the incidence and development of . The catecholamines (CA), adrenaline (AD) and noradrenaline (NA), are crucial mediators of stress response, exerting their effects through interaction with α- and β-adrenergic receptors (AR).  cells express β-AR, and their activation has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Interest concerning the efficacy of β-AR blockers as possible additions to  treatment has increased. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of several AR agonists and β-blockers following cell proliferation of HT-29 cells, a human  adenocarcinoma cell line. For this purpose, HT-29 cells were incubated in the absence (control) or in the presence of the AR-agonists, AD, NA and isoprenaline (ISO) (0.1-100 µM) for 12 or 24 h. The tested AR agonists revealed proliferative effects on HT-29 cells. In order to study the effect of several β-blockers following proliferation induced by AR activation, the cells were treated with propranolol (PRO; 50 µM), carvedilol (CAR; 5 µM), atenolol (ATE; 50 µM), or ICI 118,551 (ICI; 5 µM) for 45 min prior, and simultaneously, to incubation with each of the AR agonists, AD and ISO, both at 1 and 10 µM. The results suggested that adrenergic activation plays an important role in  cell proliferation, most probably through β-AR. The β-blockers under study were able to reverse the proliferation induced by AD and ISO, and some of these blockers significantly decreased the proliferation of HT-29 cells. The elucidation of the intracellular pathways involved in CA-induced proliferation of  cells, and in the reversion of this effect by β-blockers, may contribute to identifying promising strategies in  treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807725>Sp1 and Sp3 Are the Transcription Activators of Human ek1 Promoter in TSA-Treated Human  Carcinoma Cells.</a></h2><p> kinase (EK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of , the first step in the CDP- pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Human EK exists as EK1, EK2α and EK2β isoforms, encoded by two separate genes, named ek1 and ek2. EK activity is stimulated by carcinogens and oncogenes, suggesting the involvement of EK in carcinogenesis. Currently, little is known about EK transcriptional regulation by endogenous or exogenous signals, and the ek gene promoter has never been studied.In this report, we mapped the important regulatory regions in the human ek1 promoter. 5' deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis identified a Sp site at position (-40/-31) that was essential for the basal transcription of this gene. Treatment of HCT116 cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, significantly upregulated the ek1 promoter activity through the Sp(-40/-31) site and increased the endogenous expression of ek1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that TSA increased the binding of Sp1, Sp3 and RNA polymerase II to the ek1 promoter in HCT116 cells. The effect of TSA on ek1 promoter activity was cell-line specific as TSA treatment did not affect ek1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells.In conclusion, we showed that Sp1 and Sp3 are not only essential for the basal transcription of the ek1 gene, their accessibility to the target site on the ek1 promoter is regulated by histone protein modification in a cell line dependent manner.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25785727>Choline and betaine intake and colorectal  risk in Chinese population: a case-control study.</a></h2><p>Few studies have examined the association of choline and betaine intake with colorectal  risk, although they might play an important role in colorectal  development because of their role as methyl donors. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between consumption of choline and betaine and colorectal  risk in a Chinese population.A case-control study was conducted between July 2010 and December 2013 in Guangzhou, China. Eight hundred and ninety consecutively recruited colorectal  cases were frequency matched to 890 controls by age (5-year interval) and sex. Dietary information was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire by face-to-face interviews. The logistic regression model was used to estimate multivariate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Total choline intake was inversely associated with colorectal  risk after adjustment for various lifestyle and dietary factors. The multivariate-adjusted OR was 0.54 (95%CI = 0.37-0.80, Ptrend <0.01) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile. No significant associations were observed for betaine or total choline+betaine intakes. For choline-containing compounds, lower colorectal  risk was associated with higher intakes of choline from phosphatidylcholine, glycerophosphocholine and sphingomyelin but not for free choline and phosphocholine. The inverse association of total choline intake with colorectal  risk was observed in both men and women,  and rectal . These inverse associations were not modified by folate intake.These results indicate that high intake of total choline is associated with a lower risk of colorectal .</p></html>
