The cell viability was measured with MTT. HepG2 cells apoptosis was detected by Hoechest staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The protein expressions of BCL-2, CHOP and TLR4 were measured with western blotting and flow cytometry analysis. The mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, BCL-2, CHOP and GAPDH were measured with RT-PCR. The results suggested that compared with the control group, the number of HepG2 cells of the model group were reduced significantly (<0.01), while the number of apoptotic HepG2 cells were increased. Compared with the model group, the number of HepG2 cells of the high-dose group and the middle-dose group were increased significantly (<0.01), whereas the number of apoptotic HepG2 cells were reduced. Compared with the control group, TNF-α, IL-1β and CHOP mRNA expressions and CHOP and TLR4 protein expressions in the model group were significantly up-regulated (<0.01), while BCL-2 protein and mRNA expressions in the model group were significantly decreased (<0.01). Compared with the model group, TNF-α, IL-1β and CHOP mRNA expressions and CHOP and TLR4 protein expressions in the high-dose group were significantly decreased (<0.01), while BCL-2 protein and mRNA expressions in the high-dose group were significantly up-regulated (<0.01).In conclusion, TSPJ can reduce inflammation and apoptosis induced by , with a certain protective effect on liver cells.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26610473>Inhibitory Effect of Gardenoside on Free Fatty -Induced Steatosis in HepG2 Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Gardenoside is one of the most important effective extractions of a herb for its hepatoprotective properties. The aim of this study was to address the mechanism of Gardenoside on HepG2 cellular steatosis induced by free fatty acids (FFAs). The model of HepG2 steatosis was duplicated by oleic and  at the proportion of 2:1 (FFAs mixture) for 24 h, then lipid toxicity was induced. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were used to detect cell viability and Oil Red O staining method was used to judge the lipid accumulation respectively. Inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and intracellular NFκB were measured after 24 h. The steatosis was significantly decreased after Gardenoside treatment without cytotoxicity. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 were modulated to HepG2 cells by treatment of Gardenoside. In the meantime, the activation of NFκB was inhibited by Gardenoside. Gardenoside has a protective effect on FFA-induced cellular steatosis in HepG2 cells which indicates that Gardenoside might be a potential therapeutic herb against  by suppressed supernatant inflammatory cytokine production and intracellular NFkB activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907226>Dual roles of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) in cytoprotection against lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Saturated fatty  (SFA)-induced lipotoxicity is caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is associated with damaged mitochondria. Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse liver has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of .

All VSPs are type I membrane proteins that have a conserved hydrophobic sequence terminated by the invariant hydrophilic amino acids, CRGKA. Using transfected Giardia constitutively expressing HA-tagged VSPH7 and incubated with radioactive [3H]palmitate, we demonstrate that the palmitate is attached to the Cys in the conserved CRGKA tail. Surface location of mutant VSPs lacking either the CRGKA tail or its Cys is identical to that of wild-type VSPH7 but non-palmitoylated mutants fail to undergo complement-independent antibody specific cytotoxicity. In addition, membrane localization of non-palmitoylated mutant VSPH7 changes from a pattern similar to rafts to non-rafts. Palmitoyl transferases (PAT), responsible for protein palmitoylation in other organisms, often possess a cysteine-rich domain containing a conserved DHHC motif (DHHC-CRD). An open reading frame corresponding to a putative 50 kDa Giardia PAT (gPAT) containing a DHHC-CRD motif was found in the Giardia genome database. Expression of epitope-tagged gPAT using a tetracycline inducible vector localized gPAT to the plasma membrane, a pattern similar to that of VSPs. Transfection with gPAT antisense producing vectors inhibits gPAT expression and palmitoylation of VSPs in vitro confirming the function of gPAT. These results show that VSPs are palmitoylated at the cysteine within the conserved tail by gPAT and indicate an essential function of palmitoylation in control of VSP-mediated signalling and processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28623272>Exosomes derived from -treated hepatocytes induce fibrotic activation of hepatic stellate cells.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a dominant cause of chronic liver disease, but the exact mechanism of progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of exosomes in NAFLD progression. Exosomes were isolated from a human hepatoma cell line treated with  (PA) and their miRNA profiles examined by microarray. The human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line (LX-2) was then treated with exosome isolated from hepatocytes. Compared with controls, PA-treated hepatocytes displayed significantly increased CD36 and exosome production. The microarray analysis showed there to be distinctive miRNA expression patterns between exosomes from vehicle- and PA-treated hepatocytes. When LX-2 cells were cultured with exosomes from PA-treated hepatocytes, the expression of genes related to the development of fibrosis were significantly amplified compared to those treated with exosomes from vehicle-treated hepatocytes. In conclusion, PA treatment enhanced the production of exosomes in these hepatocytes and changed their exosomal miRNA profile. Moreover, exosomes derived from PA-treated hepatocytes caused an increase in the expression levels of fibrotic genes in HSCs. Therefore, exosomes may have important roles in the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs in the progression from simple steatosis to .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27756518>Intracellular and extracellular miRNome deregulation in cellular models of NAFLD or : Clinical implications.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common chronic liver disease in industrialized countries. NAFLD has the potential to progress through the inflammatory phase of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Identifying patients at risk for this transition is a relevant clinical challenge. The complexity of these phenotypes in vivo made necessary the development of in vitro models in order to dissect the molecular signalling affected in NAFLD and , but also to identify potential circulating biomarkers.We profiled the expression of 754 cellular and medium-secreted human miRNAs in HepG2 cells after lipotoxic (Palmitate, model of ) or not-lipotoxic stimuli (Oleate-Palmitate, model of NAFLD). Results were validated through Single TaqMan assays. We performed computational analysis of miRNA targets and pathways. Oleate-palmitate treatment induced a variation of 2.8% and 10% of total miRNAs in cells and medium, respectively; palmitate treatment caused 10% and 19% intracellular and extracellular miRNA deregulation, respectively. We validated miR-126, miR-150, miR-223, miR-483-3p, miR-1226*, and miR-1290 deregulation. Through computational analysis, we observed that targets of both intracellular and extracellular DE miRNAs were involved in processes associated with the onset and progression of NAFLD and , such as fatty  metabolism, apoptosis and inflammation.These data would be useful to elucidate the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis and progression of the NAFLD spectrum, but they also allow the identification of novel potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis to be tested in vivo.Copyright Â© 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

The novel PKC isoforms δ and ε are activated by lipid metabolites and have been implicated in lipid-induced hepatic disease. Using a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) dietary model of , we addressed the question of whether hepatic PKCδ and PKCε are activated. With progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis, there was activation and increased PKCδ protein content coincident with hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress parameters. To examine whether similar changes could be induced in vitro, McA-RH 7777 (McA) hepatoma cells were used. We observed that McA cells stored triglyceride and released alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when treated with MCD medium in the presence of fatty acids. Further, MCD medium with , but not oleic or linoleic acids, maximally activated PKCδ and stimulated ER stress. In PKCδ knockdown McA cells, MCD/fatty  medium-induced ALT release and ER stress induction were completely blocked, but triglyceride storage was not. In addition, a reduction in the uptake of propidium iodide and the number of apoptotic nuclei and a significant increase in cell viability and DNA content were observed in PKCδ knockdown McA cells incubated in MCD medium with . Our studies show that PKCδ activation and protein levels are elevated in an animal model of steatohepatitis, which was recapitulated in a cell model, supporting the conclusion that PKCδ plays a role in ALT release, the ER stress signal, and cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26113297>Hepatic TLR4 signaling in obese NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occurs frequently in the setting of metabolic syndrome, but the factors leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () are not fully understood. This study investigated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in human liver with the goal of delineating whether activation of this pathway segregates those with nonalcoholic fatty liver from those with . Experiments were performed using liver biopsy tissue obtained from class III obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery, and extended to an immortalized human hepatocyte HepaRG cell line and primary human hepatocytes. The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and total free fatty  levels were significantly increased in plasma of  patients. TLR4 mRNA levels were significantly increased in subjects with  compared with NAFL as was interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 in the myeloid differentiation factor 88-independent signaling pathway. In HepaRG cells, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation and functional activity increased following treatment with the fatty , palmitate, and following exposure to LPS compared with hepatocytes stimulated with a lipogenic treatment that induced de novo lipogenesis. Palmitate and LPS induction of NF-κB activity was partially attenuated by chemical- or small-interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of TLR4. Expression of TLR4 and its downstream mediators was upregulated with palmitate and LPS. Similar results were observed using primary human hepatocytes from a lean donor. Interestingly, NF-κB activity assays showed obese donor hepatocytes were resistant to chemical TLR4 inhibition. In conclusion, TLR4 expression is upregulated in a large cohort of  patients, compared with those with NAFL, and this occurs within the setting of increased LPS and fatty acids.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274380>The NOX1 isoform of NADPH oxidase is involved in dysfunction of liver sinusoids in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been postulated to play a key role in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the source of ROS and mechanisms underlying the development of NAFLD have yet to be established. We observed a significant up-regulation of a minor isoform of NADPH oxidase, NOX1, in the liver of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () patients as well as of mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet for 8 weeks. In mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1KO), increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 demonstrated in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly attenuated. Concomitantly, increased protein nitrotyrosine adducts, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury detected in hepatic sinusoids of WT, were significantly suppressed in Nox1KO. The expression of NOX1 mRNA was much higher in the fractions of enriched liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) than in those of hepatocytes. In primary cultured LSECs,  (PA) up-regulated the mRNA level of NOX1, but not of NOX2 or NOX4. The production of nitric oxide by LSECs was significantly attenuated by PA-treatment in WT but not in Nox1KO. When the in vitro relaxation of TWNT1, a cell line that originated from hepatic stellate cells, was assessed by the gel contraction assay, the relaxation of stellate cells induced by LSECs was attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, the relaxation effect of LSECs was preserved in cells isolated from Nox1KO. Taken together, the up-regulation of NOX1 in LSECs may elicit peroxynitrite-mediated cellular injury and impaired hepatic microcirculation through the reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide. ROS derived from NOX1 may therefore constitute a critical component in the progression of NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Regulatory T cells (T(regs)) play a critical role in regulating inflammatory processes in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and because T helper type 17 (Th17) functionally oppose T(reg)-mediated responses, this study focused on characterizing the role of Th17 cells using a NAFLD mouse model. C57BL/6 mice were fed either a normal diet (ND) or high fat (HF) diet for 8 weeks. Mice in the HF group had a significantly higher frequency of liver Th17 cells compared to ND-fed mice. Neutralization of interleukin (IL)-17 in HF mice ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury reflected by decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and reduced inflammatory cell infiltrates in the liver. In vitro, HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of free fatty acids (FFA; oleic  and ) for 24 h and IL-17 developed steatosis via insulin-signalling pathway interference. IL-17 and FFAs synergized to induce IL-6 production by HepG2 cells and murine primary hepatocytes which, in combination with transforming growth factor (TGF-β), expanded Th17 cells. It is likely that a similar process occurs in  patients, as there were significant levels of IL-17(+) cell infiltrates in  patient livers. The hepatic expression of Th17 cell-related genes [retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR)γt, IL-17, IL-21 and IL-23] was also increased significantly in  patients compared to healthy controls. Th17 cells and IL-17 were associated with hepatic steatosis and proinflammatory response in NAFLD and facilitated the transition from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis. Strategies designed to alter the balance between Th17 cells and T(regs) should be explored as a means of preventing progression to  and advanced liver diseases in NAFLD patients.© 2011 The Authors.

Currently, therapeutic options are poor and the long-term burden to society is constantly increasing. Previously, macrophage stimulating protein (MSP)-a serum protein mainly secreted by liver-was shown to inhibit oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)/lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation in mouse macrophages. Additionally, MSP could reduce  (PA)-induced lipid accumulation and lipogenesis in the HepG2 cell line. Altogether, these data suggest MSP as a suppressor for metabolic inflammation. However, so far the potential of MSP to be used as a treatment for  was not investigated. We hypothesized that MSP reduces lipid accumulation and hepatic inflammation. To investigate the effects of MSP in the early stage of , low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr-/-) mice were fed either a regular chow or a high fat, high cholesterol (HFC) diet for 7 days. Recombinant MSP or saline (control) was administrated to the mice by utilizing subcutaneously-implanted osmotic mini-pumps for the last 4 days. As expected, mice fed an HFC diet showed increased plasma and hepatic lipid accumulation, as well as enhanced hepatic inflammation, compared with chow-fed controls. Upon MSP administration, the rise in cholesterol and triglyceride levels after an HFC diet remained unaltered. Surprisingly, while hepatic macrophage and neutrophil infiltration was similar between the groups, MSP-treated mice showed increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic mediators in the liver, compared with saline-treated controls. Contrary to our expectations, MSP did not ameliorate . Observed changes in inflammatory gene expression suggest that further research is needed to clarify the long-term effects of MSP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24946279>ASMase regulates autophagy and lysosomal membrane permeabilization and its inhibition prevents early stage non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p> sphingomyelinase (ASMase) is activated in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). However, the contribution of ASMase to  is poorly understood and limited to hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism. Here we examined the role of ASMase in high fat diet (HFD)-induced .Autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) were determined in ASMase(-/-) mice fed a HFD. The impact of pharmacological ASMase inhibition on  was analyzed in wild type mice fed a HFD.ASMase deficiency determined resistance to hepatic steatosis mediated by a HFD or methionine-choline deficient diet. ASMase(-/-) mice were resistant to HFD-induced hepatic ER stress, but sensitive to tunicamycin-mediated ER stress, indicating selectivity in the resistance of ASMase(-/-) mice to ER stress and steatosis. Autophagic flux, determined in the presence of rapamycin and/or chloroquine, was lower in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) from ASMase(-/-) mice and accompanied by increased p62 levels, suggesting autophagic impairment. Moreover, autophagy suppression by chloroquine and brefeldin A caused ER stress in PMH from ASMase(+/+) mice but not in ASMase(-/-) mice. ASMase(-/-) PMH exhibited increased lysosomal cholesterol loading, decreased LMP and apoptosis resistance induced by O-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride or , effects that were reversed by decreasing cholesterol levels by oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol. In vivo pharmacological ASMase inhibition by amitriptyline, a widely used tricyclic antidepressant, protected wild type mice against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and liver damage, effects indicative of early-stage .These findings underscore a critical role for ASMase in diet-induced  and suggest the potential of amitriptyline as a treatment for patients with .Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

It has been well established that the chronic sterile inflammation caused by the NLRP3 inflammasome is closely related to NAFLD development. Kupffer cells (KCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. We used methionine choline-deficient diets to establish a mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () model. The expression and formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the KCs from the mouse and cell models were determined by Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release was determined by live cell labeling and imaging. KCs and the NLRP3 inflammasome exerted proinflammatory effects on the development and progression of  through secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. NLRP3, ASC and Caspase-1 protein expression levels in KCs from  mouse livers were significantly higher than those in KCs from NLRP3 mice, and the number of NLRP3 inflammasome protein complexes was significantly higher in KCs from  mouse livers, whereas these protein complexes could not be formed in NLRP3 mice. In in vitro experiments,  (PA) decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induced mtDNA release from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. NLRP3 inflammasome expression was substantially increased, and mtDNA-NLRP3 inflammasome complexes formed upon PA stimulation. Our data suggest that mtDNA released from mitochondria during PA stimulation causes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing a missing link between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and  development, via binding of cytosolic mtDNA to the NLRP3 inflammasome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in human and mouse hepatocytes during NAFLD. ER stress and autophagy markers were analyzed in livers from patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatosis (NAS) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () compared with livers from subjects with histologically normal liver, in livers from mice fed with chow diet (CHD) compared with mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet and in primary and Huh7 human hepatocytes loaded with  (PA). In  patients, significant increases in hepatic messenger RNA levels of markers of ER stress (activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)) and autophagy (BCN1) were found compared with NAS patients. Likewise, protein levels of GRP78, CHOP and p62/SQSTM1 (p62) autophagic substrate were significantly elevated in  compared with NAS patients. In livers from mice fed with HFD or MCD, ER stress-mediated signaling was parallel to the blockade of the autophagic flux assessed by increases in p62, microtubule-associated protein 2 light chain 3 (LC3-II)/LC3-I ratio and accumulation of autophagosomes compared with CHD fed mice. In Huh7 hepatic cells, treatment with PA for 8 h triggered activation of both unfolding protein response and the autophagic flux. Conversely, prolonged treatment with PA (24 h) induced ER stress and cell death together with a blockade of the autophagic flux. Under these conditions, cotreatment with rapamycin or CHOP silencing ameliorated these effects and decreased apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that the autophagic flux is impaired in the liver from both NAFLD patients and murine models of NAFLD, as well as in lipid-overloaded human hepatocytes, and it could be due to elevated ER stress leading to apoptosis. Consequently, therapies aimed to restore the autophagic flux might attenuate or prevent the progression of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158819>Pro-Inflammatory CXCR3 Impairs Mitochondrial Function in Experimental Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). However, the regulator of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of  is still largely unclear. CXCR3 is an essential pro-inflammatory factor in chronic liver diseases. We explored the significance of CXCR3 in regulating mitochondrial function during  development in animal models and cultured hepatocytes.The effects of CXCR3 on mitochondrial function were evaluated by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mouse models and . The ultrastructural changes of mitochondria were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Hepatic levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, membrane potential and ATP were examined.CXCR3 ablation by genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition in mice protected against  development by influencing mitochondrial function. Similarly, depletion of CXCR3 reduced steatohepatitis injury in cultured hepatocytes. TEM analysis revealed that liver mitochondrial integrity was much improved in CXCR3 knockout (CXCR3) compared to wildtype (WT) mice. In agreement with this, impaired mitochondrial function was pronounced in WT mice compared to CXCR3 mice, evidenced by increased protein expression of dynamic-related protein-1 (DRP1) and fission-1 (FIS1) and decreased protein expression of mitofusin-1 (MFN1). Mitochondrial dysfunction was induced in AML-12 hepatocytes by methionine and choline deficient medium and in HepG2 cells by . The impaired mitochondrial function in both cell lines was evidenced by reduced membrane potential and ATP content, and by increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation and DNA damage. However, CXCR3 knockdown by siCXCR3 significantly diminished the mitochondrial dysfunction in both AML-12 and HepG2 hepatocytes. In addition, inhibition of CXCR3 by CXCR3 specific antagonists SCH546738 and AMG487 restored mitochondrial function and inhibited mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in the liver of WT mice fed with methionine and choline deficient diet.CXCR3 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis.

Pharmacological agents that can restore hepatic autophagic flux could therefore have therapeutic potentials for this increasingly prevalent disease. Herein, we investigated the effects of polydatin, a natural precursor of resveratrol, in a murine nutritional model of  and a cell line model of steatosis. Results showed that oral administration of polydatin protected against hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviated inflammation and hepatocyte damage in db/db mice fed methionine-choline deficient diet. Polydatin also alleviated -induced lipid accumulation in cultured hepatocytes. In both models, polydatin restored lysosomal function and autophagic flux that were impaired by  or steatosis. Mechanistically, polydatin inhibited mTOR signalling and up-regulated the expression and activity of TFEB, a known master regulator of lysosomal function. In conclusion, polydatin ameliorated  through restoring autophagic flux. The polydatin-regulated autophagy was associated with inhibition of mTOR pathway and restoration of lysosomal function by TFEB.

The present study was designed to develop an experimental cell culture model of  using four kinds of fatty acids -  (PA), stearic  (SA), linoleic  (LA), and oleic  (OA) - and TNF-α, according to the "two-hit" hypothesis. The saturated fatty acids PA and SA are more cytotoxic than the unsaturated fatty acids OA and LA. Cellular lipid accumulation without cytotoxicity was more easily induced with the unsaturated fatty acids than with the saturated fatty acids. PA augmented TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity, while the unsaturated fatty acids attenuated TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity. In a mechanistic study, PA enhanced TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in the absence of oxidative stress, as determined by measuring the cellular glutathione and malondialdehyde levels. Moreover, PA inhibited the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of AKT, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase, indicating that inhibition of survival signaling pathways activated by TNF-α may explain the effects of PA on TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity.

We determined whether inhibition of a hypoxia-induced signaling pathway could attenuate hypoxia-exacerbated lipoapoptosis in human hepatocytes. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was used in this study.  (PA)-treated groups were used for two environmental conditions: Hypoxia (1% O2) and normoxia (20% O2). Following the treatment, the cell viability was determined by the 3,4-(5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) assay, and the mechanism of lipoapoptosis was evaluated by Western blotting. Hypoxia exacerbated the suppression of hepatocyte growth induced by  via activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways as a result of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stresses. Ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, attenuated the hypoxia-exacerbated lipoapoptosis in hepatocytes, whereas glycerol, which reduces ER stress, did not. This may have been because inhibition of oxidative stress decreases the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as caspase 9 and cytochrome c. These results suggested that modulation of apoptotic signaling pathways activated by oxidative stress can aid in identifying novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () with OSA.

Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) is a hepatokine that potentially has a beneficial role in hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the current study, we investigated the regulatory role of MSP in the development of inflammation and lipid metabolism in various  models, both in vitro and ex vivo. We observed that MSP treatment activated the AMPK signaling pathway and inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and  (PA)-induced gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary mouse hepatocytes. In addition, MSP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in PA-induced lipid accumulation and inhibited the gene expression of key lipogenic enzymes in HepG2 cells. Upon short hairpin RNA-induced knockdown of RON (the membrane-bound receptor for MSP), the anti-inflammatory and anti-lipogenic effects of MSP were markedly ablated. Finally, to mimic  ex vivo, we challenged bone marrow-derived macrophages with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in combination with LPS. OxLDL+LPS exposure led to a marked inhibition of AMPK activity and a robust increase in inflammation. MSP treatment significantly reversed these effects by restoring AMPK activity and by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression and secretion under this condition. Taken together, these data suggest that MSP is an effective inhibitor of inflammation and lipid accumulation in the stressed liver, thereby indicating that MSP has a key regulatory role in .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27853646>Hepatocellular carcinoma is accelerated by  involving M2 macrophage polarization mediated by hif-1induced IL-10.</a></h2><p>Obesity-related inflammation promotes cancer development.

These effects were blocked by saroglitazar, pioglitazone and fenofibrate (all tested at 10μM concentration). Furthermore, these agents reversed PA-mediated changes in mitochondrial dysfunction, ATP production, NFkB phosphorylation and stellate cell activation in HepG2 and HepG2-LX2 Coculture studies. In mice with choline-deficient high-fat diet-induced , saroglitazar reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and prevented development of fibrosis. It also reduced serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and expression of inflammatory and fibrosis biomarkers. In this model, the reduction in the overall NAFLD activity score by saroglitazar (3 mg/kg) was significantly more prominent than pioglitazone (25 mg/kg) and fenofibrate (100 mg/kg). Pioglitazone and fenofibrate did not show any improvement in steatosis, but partially improved inflammation and liver function.

Zinc finger protein 267 (ZNF267) belongs to the family of Kruppel-like transcription factors, which regulate diverse biological processes that include development, proliferation, and differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that ZNF267 expression is up-regulated in liver cirrhosis and is further increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we analyzed the expression of ZNF267 in tissue specimens of NAFLD patients and found a significant up-regulation compared to normal liver tissue.

We tested whether this pathway underlies  (PA)-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes.Primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) from adeno-shlacZ or adeno-shSab treated mice and HuH7 cells were used.In PMH, PA dose-dependently up to 1mM stimulated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) due to mitochondrial β-oxidation. At ⩾1.5mM, PA gradually reduced OCR, followed by cell death. Inhibition of JNK, caspases or treatment with antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) protected PMH against cell death. Sab knockdown or a membrane permeable Sab blocking peptide prevented PA-induced mitochondrial impairment, but inhibited only the late phase of both JNK activation (beyond 4h) and cell death. In PMH, PA increased p-PERK and its downstream target CHOP, but failed to activate the IRE-1α arm of the UPR. However, Sab silencing did not affect PA-induced PERK activation. Conversely, specific inhibition of PERK prevented JNK activation and cell death, indicating a major role upstream of JNK activation.The effect of p-JNK on mitochondria plays a key role in PA-mediated lipotoxicity.

SCD1 (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1) converts SFAs to mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) that are incorporated into triglycerides and stored in lipid droplets. SCD1 thus helps protect hepatocytes from lipotoxicity and its reduced expression is associated with increased lipotoxic injury in cultured hepatic cells and mouse models. To further understand the role of SCD1 in lipotoxicity, we examined the regulation of Scd1 in hepatic cells treated with palmitate, and found that NR1H/LXR (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H) ligand, GW3965, induced Scd1 expression and lipid droplet formation to improve cell survival. Surprisingly, ULK1/ATG1 (unc-51 like kinase) played a critical role in protecting hepatic cells from SFA-induced lipotoxicity via a novel mechanism that did not involve macroautophagy/autophagy. Specific loss of Ulk1 blocked the induction of Scd1 gene transcription by GW3965, decreased lipid droplet formation, and increased apoptosis in hepatic cells exposed to palmitate. Knockdown of ULK1 increased RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1) signaling that, in turn, induced NCOR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor 1) nuclear uptake, interaction with NR1H/LXR, and recruitment to the Scd1 promoter. These events abrogated the stimulation of Scd1 gene expression by GW3965, and increased lipotoxicity in hepatic cells.

Serum and tissue samples were analyzed for evidence of inflammation, fibrosis, lipogenesis, and apoptosis.TC and EV treatments significantly reduced the hepatic lipid accumulation, improved liver-body weight ratio, blood biochemistry, and insulin resistance in mice fed with FF diet. However, inflammation, enlarged portal tracts, and fibrosis were pronounced in EV treated group. The lipogenic parameters, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1(SREBP-1), mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) and fatty  translocase (CD36) were significantly down-regulated in livers of TC and EV treated groups as compared to FF group. TC improved Bcl2/Bax ratio, decreased apoptosis, CYP2E1 protein expression and liver fibrosis levels, however, EV offered no such protection. Further, in an  model of lipotoxicity using the mouse hepatocyte (AML-12) cell line, treatment with TC and EV significantly reduced lipid accumulation and lipogenic and apoptotic markers induced with .In FF diet induced model of , both TC and EV inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation and improved metabolic parameters such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.

Despite well-known cholesterol-lowering action of statins, their mechanisms against -mediated fibrogenesis remain unclear. This study aimed at investigating the in vitro and in vivo anti-fibrotic properties of fluvastatin (Flu).Palmitate (PA)-induced changes in intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels in primary rat hepatocytes (PRHs) and human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) were quantified by dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) dye assay, whereas changes in expressions of NADPH oxidase gp91 (phox) subunit, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and NFκB p65 nuclear translocation were quantified with Western blotting. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to investigate mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory genes (ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α). Conditioned medium (CM) from PA-treated PRHs was applied to cultured rat hepatic stellate cell line, HSC-T6, with or without Flu-pretreatment for 2 h. Pro-fibrogenic gene expressions (COL1, TIMP-1, TGF-β1, α-SMA) and protein expression of α-SMA were analyzed. In vivo study using choline-deficient L-amino  defined (CDAA) diet-induced rat  model was performed by randomly assigning Wistar rats (n = 28) to normal controls (n = 4), CDAA diet with vehicles, and CDAA diet with Flu (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) (n = 8 each) through gavage for 4 or 8 weeks. Livers were harvested for histological, Western blot (α-SMA), and q-PCR analyses for expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, iNOS, ICAM-1) and pro-fibrogenic (Col1, α-SMA, TIMP-1) genes.In vitro, Flu (1-20 μM) inhibited PA-induced free-radical production, gp91 (phox) expression, and NFκB p65 translocation in HepG2 and PRHs, while CM-induced α-SMA protein expression and pro-fibrogenic gene expressions in HSC-T6 were suppressed in Flu-pretreated cells compared to those without pretreatment. Moreover, α-SMA protein expression was significantly decreased in HSC-T6 cultured with CM from PA-Flu-treated PRHs compared to those cultured with CM from PA-treated PRHs. Flu also reduced steatosis and fibrosis scores, α-SMA protein expression, mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic genes in livers of CDAA rats.We demonstrated PA-induced HSC activation through paracrine effect of hepatocyte in vitro that was significantly suppressed by pre-treating HSC with Flu.

The expression of the gp130-STAT3 axis and gp130 cytokine receptors were studied in subjects with varying phenotypes of NAFLD including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and compared with lean and weight-matched controls without NAFLD. Gp130 and its downstream signaling element (Tyk2 and STAT3) expression were inhibited in obese controls whereas they were increased in NAFLD. IL-6 levels were increased in  and correlated with gp130 expression (P < 0.01). Palmitate inhibited gp130-STAT3 expression and signaling. IL-6 and palmitate inhibited hepatic insulin signaling via STAT3-dependent and independent mechanisms, respectively. STAT3 overexpression reversed palmitate-induced lipotoxicity by increasing autophagy (ATG7) and decreasing endoplasmic reticulum stress. These data demonstrate that the STAT3 pathway is activated in NAFLD and can worsen insulin resistance while protecting against other lipotoxic mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625377>Thioacetamide potentiates high cholesterol and high fat diet induced steato-hepatitic changes in livers of C57BL/6J mice: A novel eight weeks model of fibrosing .</a></h2><p>There is an inadequacy of relevant animal models to study non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () and fibrosis.

The present study was designed to test whether this NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the "two-hit" injury during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and whether it can be a therapeutic target for the action of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), a widely used herbal remedy for hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome in China. We first demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation as well as lipid deposition occurred in the liver of mice on the high-fat diet (HFD), as shown by increased NLRP3 aggregation, enhanced production of IL-1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and remarkable lipid deposition in liver cells. FTZ extracts not only significantly reduced the NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation but also attenuated the liver steatosis and fibrogenic phenotype changed. In  studies,  (PA) was found to increase colocalization of NLRP3 components and enhanced caspase-1 activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicating enhanced formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by PA. PA also increased lipid deposition. Nlrp3 siRNA can reverse this effect by silencing the NLRP3 inflammasome and both with FTZ. In FTZ-treated cells, not only inflammasome formation and activation was substantially attenuated but also lipid deposition in HSCs was blocked. This inhibition of FTZ on lipid deposition was similar to the effects of glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, stimulated membrane raft redox signaling platform formation and increased O production by PA to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in HSCs was blocked by FTZ treatment.

Several intracellular events leading to NAFLD and progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () have been identified, including lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Emerging evidence links both hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and cholesterol (FC) accumulation in NAFLD development; in particular oxysterols, the oxidative products of cholesterol, may contribute to liver injury. We performed a targeted lipidomic analysis of oxysterols in the liver of male Wistar rats fed a high-fat (HF), high-cholesterol (HC) or high-fat/high-cholesterol (HF/HC) diet. Both HF and HC diets caused liver steatosis, but the HF/HC diet resulted in steatohepatitis with associated mitochondrial dysfunction. Above all, the oxysterol cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol (triol) was particularly increased in the liver of rats fed diets rich in cholesterol. To verify the molecular mechanism involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatocellular toxicity, Huh7 and primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to  (PA) and/or oleic  (OA), with or without triol. This compound induced apoptosis in cells co-exposed to both PA and OA, and this was associated with impaired mitochondrial respiration as well as down-regulation of PGC1-alpha, mTFA and NRF1.In conclusion, our data show that hepatic free fatty  or oxysterols accumulation per se induce low hepatocellular toxicity. On the contrary, hepatic accumulation of both fatty acids and toxic oxysterols such as triol are determinant in the impairment of mitochondrial function and biogenesis, contributing to liver pathology in NAFLD.Copyright © 2014.

Simple hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), which can be a precursor to more serious liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying progression of steatosis to  remain unclear; however, inflammation, proinflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been postulated to play key roles. We previously reported that patients with  have elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), which are likely to contribute to hepatic injury. This study specifically examines the effect of hepatic steatosis on IL-8 production. We induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (HepG2, rat primary hepatocytes, and human primary hepatocytes) by exposing them to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of  to simulate the excessive influx of fatty acids into hepatocytes. Significant fat accumulation was documented morphologically by Oil Red O staining in cells exposed to , and it was accompanied by an increase in intracellular triglyceride levels. Importantly,  was found to induce significantly elevated levels of biologically active neutrophil chemoattractant, IL-8, from steatotic hepatocytes.

Although free fatty -mediated apoptosis is a prominent feature of , the impact of HCV infection on hepatocyte lipotoxicity has remained largely unexplored. The study aimed at identifying whether infection by HCV affected the apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes during fatty  assault. MATERIAL AND METHODS OR6 cells, which are derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cells and harbor a full-length HCV RNA genome replication system, were treated with palmitate. Apoptosis was examined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Activation and expression of JNK, Bim, cIAP-1, and Mcl-1 were examined by immunoblotting. mRNA expression of CHOP, a major player in endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, was assessed by real-time PCR. RESULTS Palmitate-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells, in which the HCV genome had been eradicated by treatment with interferon-α. Although basal expression of CHOP mRNA was enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells, it was similarly upregulated in both cell lines following palmitate treatment. Notably, palmitate-induced JNK phosphorylation was accentuated in OR6 cells compared to cured cells. Inhibition of JNK with SP600125 attenuated palmitate-induced apoptosis. Palmitate-mediated upregulation of BH3-only protein Bim, which acts downstream of JNK, was also enhanced in OR6 cells compared to cured cells. In contrast, Mcl-1 and cIAP-1 were equally reduced in OR6 cells and cured cells following palmitate treatment.

We demonstrate the impact of ferroptosis on the progression of  induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) feeding for 10 days. RSL-3 (a ferroptosis inducer) treatment showed decreased hepatic expression of GPX4, and conversely increased 12/15-lipoxygenase, and apoptosis inducing factor, indicating that ferroptosis plays a key role in -related lipid peroxidation and its-associated cell death. Consistently, levels of serum biochemical, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in MCD-fed mice were exacerbated with RSL-3 treatment. However, MCD-fed mice treated with sodium selenite (a GPX4 activator) showed increase of hepatic GPX4, accompanied by reduced  severity. To chelate iron, deferoxamine mesylate salt was used. Administration of deferoxamine mesylate salt significantly reduced  severity and abolished the harmful effects of RSL-3 in MCD-fed mice. Finally, treatment with Liproxstatin-1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) repressed hepatic lipid peroxidation, and its associated cell death, resulting in decreased  severity. Consistent with the in vivo findings, modulation of ferroptosis /GPX4 affected hepatocellular death in -induced in vitro  milieu.

Calcium (Ca) homeostasis is considered to play a key role in ER stress. Matrine (Mat) has been applied for the treatment of hepatitis B, but its effect on NAFLD is still unknown, and there is no unified view of Mat on the regulation of ER stress in the previous literature.The pharmacological effects were studied in high-fat-diet or methionine-choline-deficient diet induced C57BL/6J mice models and in  (PA) induced L02 human liver cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments, computational virtual docking analysis and biochemical assays were used in identifying the locus of Mat.The results showed that Mat-treated mice were more resistant to steatosis in the liver than vehicle-treated mice and that Mat significantly reduced hepatic inflammation, lipid peroxides. The beneficial effect of Mat was associated with suppressing ER stress and restoring mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, Mat decreased the PA-induced lipid accumulation, ER stress and cytosolic calcium level ([Ca]) in hepatocyte cell lines in low and middle dose. However, the high dose Mat did not show satisfactory results in cell model. Calcium fluorescence experiments showed that Mat was able to regulate [Ca].

However, it is poorly understood that how various molecules interact within HSCs during the progression of  to fibrosis. The aim of the present study is to delineate how inflammasome molecules, hedgehog signaling and autophagy provoke HSC activation using  (PA) as a major insult.Inflammasome activation, hedgehog signaling activity and autophagy in PA-exposed HSCs were determined to investigate their role in activation of human and rodent HSC lines or primary HSCs.PA treatment elicited HSC activation reflected by increased mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-β1, connective tissue growth factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and procollagen type I (α1). In addition, expression levels of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and hedgehog signaling transcription factor Gli-1 were increased in PA-exposed HSCs. It's evident that PA treatment resulted in increased production of light chain 3-II and autophagosomes, as well as enhanced autophagy flux reflected by transduction of an adeno-associated viral vector. Whereas, reduced autophagy, which is often seen in the late stage of , provoked inflammasome activation. Moreover, suppressing the Hh signaling pathway by LDE225 blocked production of light chain 3-II and autophagy flux.Saturated fatty acids, such as PA, stimulate HSC activation through inflammasomes and hedgehog signaling.

The effect of the A2aR agonist CGS21680 on immunoinflammatory signals, CD4Th cell infiltration and immunolipotoxicity was analyzed in steatotic C57BL/6 mice fed with a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet and in mouse hepatocytes exposed to  (PA). CGS21680 inhibited  development in steatotic mice and decreased cytokines and chemokines involved in Th cell recruitment or polarization (namely CXCL10, CCL2, tumor necrosis factor alfa [TNFα], tumor growth factor [TGFβ], and IL-12). CGS21680 also reduced the expansion of Th17, Th22, and Th1 cells and increased the immunosuppressive activity of T regulatory cells. In PA-treated mice hepatocytes, CGS21680 inhibited the production of CXCL10, TNFα, TGFβ, IL-12, and CCL2; CGS21680 also prevented JNK-dependent lipotoxicity and its intensification by IL-17 or IL-17 plus IL-22 through Akt/PI3-kinase stimulation and inhibition of the negative regulator of PI3-kinase, (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), which is upregulated by IL-17.

Redirecting the toxic saturated fatty acids into triglyceride storage and reduction of cholesterol accumulation might be the possible explanation of OA driven protection in this scenario.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The inflammasome, which cleaves pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) into secreted IL-1β, is induced by endogenous and exogenous danger signals. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a toll-like receptor 4 ligand, plays a role in  and also activates the inflammasome. In this study, we hypothesized that the inflammasome is activated in  by multiple hits involving endogenous and exogenous danger signals. Using mouse models of methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced  and high-fat diet-induced , we found up-regulation of the inflammasome [including NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3; cryopyrin), apoptosis-associated speck-like CARD-domain containing protein, pannexin-1, and pro-caspase-1] at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level increased caspase-1 activity, and mature IL-1β protein levels in mice with steatohepatitis in comparison with control livers. There was no inflammasome activation in mice with only steatosis. The MCD diet sensitized mice to LPS-induced increases in NALP3, pannexin-1, IL-1β mRNA, and mature IL-1β protein levels in the liver. We demonstrate for the first time that inflammasome activation occurs in isolated hepatocytes in steatohepatitis. Our novel data show that the saturated fatty  (FA)  (PA) activates the inflammasome and induces sensitization to LPS-induced IL-1β release in hepatocytes. Furthermore, PA triggers the release of danger signals from hepatocytes in a caspase-dependent manner. These hepatocyte-derived danger signals, in turn, activate inflammasome, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α release in liver mononuclear cells.Our novel findings indicate that saturated FAs represent an endogenous danger in the form of a first hit, up-regulate the inflammasome in , and induce sensitization to a second hit with LPS for IL-β release in hepatocytes. Furthermore, hepatocytes exposed to saturated FAs release danger signals that trigger inflammasome activation in immune cells.

This study aims to delineate how mitophagy affects NLRP3 inflammasome activation in hepatic lipotoxicity. Mice were fed a high fat/calorie diet (HFCD) for 24 weeks. Primary rat hepatocytes were treated with  (PA) for various periods of time. Mitophagy was measured by protein levels of LC3II and P62. NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β at mRNA and protein levels were used as indicators of inflammasome activation. Along with steatotic progression in HFCD-fed mice, ratio of LC3II/β-actin was decreased concurrently with increased levels of liver P62, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and serum IL-1β levels in late-stage . PA treatment resulted in mitochondrial oxidative stress and initiated mitophagy in primary hepatocytes. The addition of cyclosporine A did not change LC3II/Τοmm20 ratios; but P62 levels were increased after an extended duration of PA exposure, indicating a defect in autophagic activity. Along with impaired mitophagy, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-18 and IL-1β were upregulated by PA treatment. Pretreatment with MCC950, N-acetyl cysteine or acetyl-L-carnitine reversed inflammasome activation and a pyroptotic cascade. Additionally, mitophagic flux was partially recovered as indicated by increases in LC3II/Tomm20 ratio, parkin, and PINK1 expression, and decreased P62 expression. The findings suggest that impaired mitophagy triggers hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a murine  model and primary hepatocytes. The new insights into inflammasome activation through mitophagy advance our understanding of how fatty acids elicit lipotoxicity through oxidant stress and autophagy in mitochondria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28189916>Chronic administration of saturated fats and fructose differently affect SREBP activity resulting in different modulation of Nrf2 and Nlrp3 inflammasome pathways in mice liver.</a></h2><p>The overconsumption of both saturated fats and fructose in the modern society has been related to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the specific contribution of individual dietary components on the progression of NAFLD to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () has been poorly investigated. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the dissimilar effects of these two dietary components on selected proinflammatory and antioxidant pathways in the liver of C57BL/6 mice fed a standard (SD), a 45% saturated fat (HFAT) or a 60% fructose (HFRT) diet for 12 weeks. HFAT diet evoked systemic metabolic alterations and overweight, not observed in HFRT mice. However, HFRT mice had a greater hepatic triglyceride deposition with increased ratio of triacylglycerols containing the  compared to HFAT, as assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. This effect is due to the higher activation of the SCAP/SREBP1c lipogenic pathway by HFRT feeding. In addition, we found inhibition of Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant signaling and more robust stimulation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome pathway in the livers of HFRT-fed mice when compared with HFAT-fed mice, which is consistent with the recent finding that palmitate and SREBP1c are implicated in hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. These effects were associated with increased hepatic inflammation, as confirmed by high expression of markers of leukocyte infiltration in the HFRT group. Thus, we hypothesize an amplifying loop among lipogenesis, palmitate, Nrf2 and Nlrp3 that leads to a higher risk of NAFLD progression to  in a high-fructose diet compared to a high-saturated fat intake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It has been also shown that  (PA) activates NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion in Kupffer cells (KCs). However, the specific mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation is unclear. We studies the molecular mechanisms by investigating the roles of Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and NLRP3 on NAFLD development in patients, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFL and methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced  in wild type (WT), TXNIP-/- (thioredoxin-interacting protein) and NLRP3-/- mice, and isolated KCs. We found that the expressions of NLRP3 and TXNIP in human liver tissues were higher in  group than in NAFL group. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analyses show that activation of the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex occurred in KCs of  WT mice rather than NAFL WT mice, thus suggesting that the formation and activation of this protein complex is mainly involved in the development of . NLRP3-/- mice exhibited less severe  than WT mice in MCD diet model, whereas TXNIP deficiency enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and exacerbated liver injury. PA triggered the activation and co-localization of the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex in KCs isolated from WT and TXNIP-/- but not NLRP3-/- mice, and most of the complex co-localized with mitochondria of KCs following PA stimulation.

To clarify the source of ROS, we examined the expression of superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase isoforms in the liver of high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFC) diet-fed mice. The mRNA expression of NOX1 was significantly elevated in mice on HFC diet for 8 weeks. Increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic cleaved caspase-3 in HFC diet-fed wild-type mice (WT) were significantly ameliorated in mice deficient in Nox1 (Nox1-KO). Increased nitrotyrosine adduct formation, a marker of peroxynitrite-induced injury, was observed in hepatic sinusoids of WT, which was significantly suppressed in NOX1-KO. NOX1 mRNA was mainly expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and it was significantly up-regulated in primary cultured LSECs treated with  (PA). The production of nitric oxide by LSECs and LSECs-dependent relaxation of hepatic stellate cells were significantly attenuated by PA treatment. In contrast, these effects of PA were not observed in cells isolated from Nox1-KO. Taken together, the up-regulation of NOX1 in LSECs may elicit peroxynitrite-mediated cellular injury and impair hepatic microcirculation through reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide.

H4IIE cells were treated with  (PA), and cell autophagy and apoptosis were examined. UCP2 expression, in association with LC3-II and caspase-3, which are indicators of cell autophagy and apoptosis, respectively,was measured. Results demonstrated that UCP2 was associated with autophagy during PA-induced hepatic carcinoma cells injury. Tests on reactive oxygen species (ROS) showed that UCP2 overexpression strongly decreases PA-induced ROS production and apoptosis. Conversely, UCP2 inhibition by genipin or UCP2 mRNA silencing enhances PA-induced ROS production and apoptosis. Autophagy partially participates in this progress. Moreover, UCP2 was associated with ATP synthesis during PA-induced autophagy. In conclusion, increasing UCP2 expression in hepatoma cells may contribute to cell autophagy and antiapoptotic as result of fatty  injury.

Reduced hepatic expression of the UPR regulator X-box binding protein 1 spliced (XBP1s) is associated with human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), and feeding mice a high-fat diet with fructose/sucrose causes progressive, fibrosing steatohepatitis. This study examines the role of XBP1 in nonalcoholic fatty liver injury and fatty -induced cell injury. Hepatocyte-specific Xbp1-deficient (Xbp1(-/-)) mice were fed a high-fat/sugar (HFS) diet for up to 16 wk. HFS-fed Xbp1(-/-) mice exhibited higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels compared with Xbp1(fl/fl) controls. RNA sequencing and Gene Ontogeny pathway analysis of hepatic mRNA revealed that apoptotic process, inflammatory response, and extracellular matrix structural constituent pathways had enhanced activation in HFS-fed Xbp1(-/-) mice. Liver histology demonstrated enhanced injury and fibrosis but less steatosis in the HFS-fed Xbp1(-/-) mice. Hepatic Col1a1 and Tgfβ1 gene expression, as well as Chop and phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), were increased in Xbp1(-/-) compared with Xbp1(fl/fl) mice after HFS feeding. In vitro, stable XBP1-knockdown Huh7 cells (Huh7-KD) and scramble control cells (Huh7-SCR) were generated and treated with  (PA) for 24 h. PA-treated Huh7-KD cells had increased cytotoxicity measured by lactate dehydrogenase release, apoptotic nuclei, and caspase3/7 activity assays compared with Huh7-SCR cells. CHOP and p-JNK expression was also increased in Huh7-KD cells following PA treatment. In conclusion, loss of XBP1 enhances injury in both in vivo and in vitro models of fatty liver injury.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) have recently been identified as important regulators of immunity and inflammation. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), HIF-1α is upregulated in hepatocytes, where it induces steatosis; however, the role of HIF-1α in macrophages under metabolic stress has not been explored. In this study, we found increased HIF-1α levels in hepatic macrophages in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice and in macrophages of patients with  compared with controls. The HIF-1α increase was concomitant with elevated levels of autophagy markers BNIP3, Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 in both mouse and human macrophages. LysM HIF fl/fl mice, which have HIF-1α levels stabilized in macrophages, showed higher steatosis and liver inflammation compared with HIF fl/fl mice on MCD diet. In vitro and ex vivo experiments reveal that saturated fatty ,  (PA), both induces HIF-1α and impairs autophagic flux in macrophages. Using small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down and overexpression of HIF-1α in macrophages, we demonstrated that PA impairs autophagy via HIF-1α.

Conclusion:  impairs autophagy via HIF-1α activation in macrophages. HIF-1α and impaired autophagy are present in  in vivo in mouse macrophages and in human blood monocytes. We identified that HIF-1α activation and decreased autophagic flux stimulate inflammation in macrophages through upregulation of NF-κB activation.

Although lumican is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis in extra-hepatic tissues, little is known about the role of lumican in hepatic disease. We therefore determined lumican expression in etiologies other than clinical . Our results indicated that lumican is upregulated in clinical samples of hepatitis C virus infection, in experimental rodent models of chronic and acute liver injury and could additionally be induced in vitro in response to the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and to lipotoxic . Together, these results suggested a role for lumican in hepatic fibrosis. To investigate the functional role of lumican in hepatic fibrosis, lumican null (Null) and wild-type (WT) littermates were administered carbon tetrachloride intra-peritoneally. Serum and liver tissue were analyzed for indices of liver injury, fibrosis, matrix turnover, and proliferation. Hepatic fibrosis was greatly reduced in null animals (P<0.05). Paradoxically, gene expression of fibrosis-related genes such as TGFβ1 and collagen 1 was numerically higher in null animals though statistically insignificant from WT animals. On the other hand, α smooth muscle actin expression (α-SMA), a marker for activated fibroblasts, the main contributors of collagen production was significantly higher (P<0.05) in null animals as compared with WT littermates. Among the matrix metalloproteases (MMP), MMP13 was significantly increased (P<0.05) in null animals. Ultra-structural imaging indicated differences in the organization and spatial distribution of hepatic collagen fibrils of null and WT mice. Cell proliferation was significantly increased (P<0.05) in null animals. We conclude that lumican is a prerequisite for hepatic fibrosis. The protective effect of lumican deficiency in hepatic fibrosis appears to be downstream of collagen production and mediated through the combined effects of impaired collagen fibrillogenesis, increased matrix turnover, and an enhanced proliferative response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21814826>Increased hepatic apoptosis in high-fat diet-induced  in rats may be associated with downregulation of hepatic stimulator substance.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms of progression from fatty liver to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis are not well elucidated.

Results showed that a high-fat diet altered liver function and histology in a manner resembling . Hepatic protein and mRNA HSS expression was decreased as  progressed. Meanwhile, cell apoptosis increased as result of caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release, indicating that HSS might be involved in  pathogenesis. Furthermore, in -induced hepatic cell damage, over-expression of HSS decreased cells apoptosis. In contrast, repression of HSS expression by siRNA increased cell apoptosis.

PA-induced lipoapoptosis was inhibited by acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor but not by ceramide synthesis inhibitors, suggesting that conversion products other than ceramide are involved. Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitors blocked PA-induced hepatocyte death, suggesting an important role for PLA(2) and its product lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC).

Increased hepatocellular damage was observed in PA-treated hepatocytes with TPM or CSE treatment, but increased triglyceride level was only observed in PA plus LPS-treated hepatocytes with a high concentration of TPM. Also, expression levels of steatohepatitis-related genes such as TNF-α, NOS 2, and SREBP-1c were significantly increased after treatment of TPM. To further demonstrate the role of Kupffer cells (KCs) after CS extracts treatment, trans-well co-culture system of hepatocytes and KCs was utilized. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and the ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 (apoptosis-related genes) were markedly increased in co-cultured hepatocytes after TPM or CSE treatment. Interestingly, KCs activation was augmented in KCs upon treatment with CSE or TPM. Overall, our findings indicate that in vitro treatment with CSE or TPM differentially contributes to the severity of steatohepatitis by modulating steatohepatitis-related lipotoxicity and inflammation, which might be caused by KCs activation with subsequent induction of hepatocytes apoptosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant (SN) of KCs were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that KCs and NLRP3 play pro-inflammatory roles in the progression of , probably through secretions of IL-1β and IL-18 by KCs induced by PA. PA could act as a kind of damage-associated molecular patterns to elevate the messenger RNA and protein expression levels of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 in KCs from WT mice.

Serum IL-1β and IL-18 levels were also determined.  was used to stimulate Kupffer cells (KCs), and protein expressions of CTSB, NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD), and caspase-1 in KCs were detected. The levels of IL-1β and IL-18 in the supernatant of KCs were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our results showed that CTSB inhibition improved the liver function and reduced hepatic inflammation and ballooning, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 were decreased. The expressions of CTSB and caspase-1 in liver tissues were increased in the  group. In in vitro experiments, PA stimulation could increase the expressions of CTSB and NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, and CTSB inhibition downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in KCs, when challenged by PA. Moreover, CTSB inhibition effectively suppressed the expression and activity of caspase-1 and subsequently secretions of IL-1β and IL-18. Collectively, these results suggest that CTSB inhibition limits NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent  formation through regulating the expression and activity of caspase-1, thus providing a novel anti-inflammatory signal pathway for the therapy of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393851>Degradation of splicing factor SRSF3 contributes to progressive liver disease.</a></h2><p>Serine rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) plays a critical role in liver function and its loss promotes chronic liver damage and regeneration. As a consequence, genetic deletion of SRSF3 in hepatocytes caused progressive liver disease and ultimately led to hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that SRSF3 is decreased in human liver samples with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), or cirrhosis that was associated with alterations in RNA splicing of known SRSF3 target genes. Hepatic SRSF3 expression was similarly decreased and RNA splicing dysregulated in mouse models of NAFLD and . We showed that -induced oxidative stress caused conjugation of the ubiquitin like NEDD8 protein to SRSF3 and proteasome mediated degradation. SRSF3 was selectively neddylated at lysine11 and mutation of this residue (SRSF3-K11R) was sufficient to prevent both SRSF3 degradation and alterations in RNA splicing. Finally prevention of SRSF3 degradation in vivo partially protected mice from hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. These results highlight a neddylation-dependent mechanism regulating gene expression in the liver that is disrupted in early metabolic liver disease and may contribute to the progression to , cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21620948>Cellular glutathione in fatty liver in vitro models.</a></h2><p>The range of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes simple hepatic steatosis, the inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), fibrosis and cirrhosis. The accumulation of specific lipids in hepatocytes has been associated with oxidative stress and progression of the disease. Elevated serum free fatty acids and hepatocyte lipotoxicity can be studied in an in vitro cellular model. For this purpose, we cultured the human liver cell line, HepG2/C3A, in medium supplemented with increasing amounts of oleic  (C18:1) and evaluated oxidative stress by measuring the content of the cellular antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). We observed a dose-dependent steatosis, as determined by Nile Red staining, with concurrent increases of GSH; similar findings were also observed in cultured human hepatocytes. Cells cultured with  (C16:0) or the combination oleic/ acids (2:1 ratio) also exhibited a dose-dependent increase of GSH; however -supplemented cultures did not sustain the GSH increase after 24h. We also detected an increase in the formation of lipid peroxides (LPO) indicating that the increase of GSH was a cellular mechanism that may be related to the high exposure of fatty acids. The results of this in vitro study suggest an antioxidant response against fat overloading and indicate potential differences in response to specific fatty -induced hepatic steatosis and associated lipotoxicity.Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29187142>Gut microbiota-mediated generation of saturated fatty acids elicits inflammation in the liver in murine high-fat diet-induced steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota plays crucial roles in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ().

The pathogenic basis of NAFLD progressing to  is currently unknown, but growing evidence suggests MD2 (myeloid differentiation factor 2), an accessory protein of TLR4, is an important signalling component contributing to this disease. We evaluated the effectiveness of the specific MD2 inhibitor, L6H21, in reducing inflammatory liver injury in a relevant high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of  and in the  (PA)-stimulated human liver cell line (HepG2). For study, genetic knockout (MD2 ) mice were fed a HFD or control diet for 24 weeks, or wild-type mice placed on a similar diet regimen and treated with L6H21 for the last 8 or 16 weeks. Results indicated that MD2 inhibition with L6H21 was as effective as MD2 knockout in preventing the HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, pro-fibrotic changes and expression of pro-inflammatory molecules. Direct challenge of HepG2 with PA (200 μM) increased MD2-TLR4 complex formation and expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes and L6H21 pre-treatment prevented these PA-induced responses. Interestingly, MD2 knockout or L6H21 increased expression of the anti-inflammatory molecule, PPARγ, in liver tissue and the liver cell line.

Whereas both a methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD) and a choline-deficient diet (CDD) lead to hepatic triglyceride accumulation, MCDD alone is associated with hepatic insulin resistance and inflammation (steatohepatitis). We used metabolic tracer techniques, including stable isotope ([¹³C₄]palmitate) dilution and mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) of [¹³C₂]acetate, to define differences in intrahepatic fatty  metabolism that could explain the contrasting effect of MCDD and CDD on  in C57Bl6 mice. Compared with control-supplemented (CS) diet, liver triglyceride pool sizes were similarly elevated in CDD and MCDD groups (24.37 ± 2.4, 45.94 ± 3.9, and 43.30 ± 3.5 μmol/liver for CS, CDD, and MCDD, respectively), but intrahepatic neutrophil infiltration and plasma alanine aminotransferase (31 ± 3, 48 ± 4, 231 ± 79 U/l, P < 0.05) were elevated only in MCDD mice. However, despite loss of peripheral fat in MCDD mice, neither the rate of appearance of palmitate (27.2 ± 3.5, 26.3 ± 2.3, and 28.3 ± 3.5 μmol·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) nor the contribution of circulating fatty acids to the liver triglyceride pool differed between groups.

Herein, early and persistently elevated, proinflammatory cytokine HMGB1 expression was detected in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD model in C57BL/6 mice. The expression and extracellular release of HMGB1 was rapidly and dramatically induced by saturated  in vitro. HFD-induced inflammatory response and liver function impairment were both mitigated after the inhibition of endogenous HMGB1 by neutralizing antibody in vivo. The up-regulation of HMGB1 was thought to be modified by dual channels: in the transcriptional level, it was regulated by JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 axis; post-transcriptionally, it was regulated by the microRNA (miR)-200 family, especially miR-429. miR-429 liver conditional knockout mice (miR-429), fed either a normal diet or an HFD, showed severe liver inflammation and dysfunction, accompanied by greater expression of HMGB1. Intriguingly, the up-regulation and release of HMGB1 could in turn self-activate TLR4-JNK1/JNK2-ATF2 signaling, thus forming a positive feedback.

We attempted to identify the pattern of altered gene expression at different time points in a high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. The early up-regulated genes are mainly involved in the innate immune responses, while the late up-regulated genes represent the inflammation processes. Although recent studies have shown that microRNAs play important roles in hepatic metabolic functions, the pivotal role of microRNAs in the progression of NAFLD is not fully understood. We investigated the functions of miR-451, which was identified as a target gene in the inflammatory process in NAFLD. miR-451 expression was significantly decreased in the palmitate (PA)-exposed HepG2 cells and in liver tissues of HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () mice. Its decreased expressions were also observed in liver specimens of  patients. In vitro analysis of the effect of miR-451 on proinflammatory cytokine provided evidence for negative regulation of PA-induced interleukin (IL)-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production. Furthermore, miR-451 over-expression inhibited translocation of the PA-induced NF-κB p65 subunit into the nucleus. Our result showed that Cab39 is a direct target of miRNA-451 in steatotic cells. Further study showed that AMPK activated through Cab39 inhibits NF-κB transactivation induced in steatotic HepG2 cells. miR-451 over-expression in steatotic cells significantly suppressed PA-induced inflammatory cytokine. These results provide new insights into the negative regulation of miR-451 in fatty -induced inflammation via the AMPK/AKT pathway and demonstrate potential therapeutic applications for miR-451 in preventing the progression from simple steatosis to severely advanced liver disease.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

We previously reported that hepatocytes, under lipotoxic stress, express the potent macrophage chemotactic ligand C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), and release CXCL10-enriched extracellular vesicles (EV) by a mixed lineage kinase (MLK) 3-dependent mechanism. In the current study, we sought to examine the signaling pathway responsible for CXCL10 induction during hepatocyte lipotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate a role for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 in regulating CXCL10 expression. Huh7 and HepG2 cells were treated with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), the toxic metabolite of the SFA palmitate. In LPC-treated hepatocytes, CXCL10 induction is mediated by a mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade consisting of a relay kinase module of MLK3, MKK3/6, and p38. P38 in turn induces STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation and CXCL10 upregulation in hepatocytes, which is reduced by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of this MAPK signaling cascade. The binding and activity of STAT1 at the CXCL10 gene promoter were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase gene expression assays. Promoter activation was attenuated by MLK3/STAT1 inhibition or by deletion of the consensus STAT1 binding sites within the CXCL10 promoter. In lipotoxic hepatocytes, MLK3 activates a MAPK signaling cascade, resulting in the activating phosphorylation of STAT1, and CXCL10 transcriptional upregulation. Hence, this kinase relay module and/or STAT1 inhibition may serve as a therapeutic target to reduce CXCL10 release, thereby attenuating  pathogenesis. J. Cell.

We first analyse the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on liver cells. In particular, the role of free fatty acids such as , cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged. These lipotoxic agents affect the cell behaviour via multiple mechanisms, including activation of signalling cascades and death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. In the second part of this review, the cellular and molecular players involved in the cross-talk between the gut and the liver are considered. These include modifications to the microbiota, which provide signals through the intestine and bacterial products, as well as hormones produced in the bowel that affect metabolism at different levels including the liver.

Human and pre-clinical models implicate cellular cholesterol dysregulation playing important role in its development. Mouse model studies suggest synergism between dietary cholesterol and fat in contributing to  but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our laboratory previously reported the primary importance of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol (ER-Chol) in regulating hepatic ER stress by comparing the responses of wild type, Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ and Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice, to a 2% high cholesterol diet (HCD). Here we further investigated the roles of ER-Chol and ER stress in HFHS diet-induced  using the same strains. With HFHS diet feeding, both WT and Ldlr-/-xLcat+/+ accumulate ER-Chol in association with ER stress and inflammasome activation but the Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice are protected. By contrast, all three strains accumulate cholesterol crystal, in correlation with ER-Chol, albeit less so in Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice. By comparison, HCD feeding per se (i) is sufficient to promote steatosis and activate inflammasomes, and (ii) results in dramatic accumulation of cholesterol crystal which is linked to inflammasome activation in Ldlr-/-xLcat-/- mice, independent of ER-Chol.

Here, we studied migration of human monocytes in response to supernatants obtained from liver cells after inducing lipoapoptosis with saturated free fatty acids (FFA). Lipoapoptotic supernatants stimulated monocyte migration with the magnitude similar to a monocyte chemoattractant protein, CCL2 (MCP-1). Inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in liver cells with SP600125 blocked migration of monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that JNK stimulates release of chemoattractants in lipoapoptosis. Notably, treatment of supernatants with Apyrase to remove ATP potently inhibited migration of THP-1 monocytes and partially blocked migration of primary human monocytes. Inhibition of the CCL2 receptor (CCR2) on THP-1 monocytes with RS102895, a specific CCR2 inhibitor, did not block migration induced by lipoapoptotic supernatants. Consistent with these findings, lipoapoptosis stimulated pathophysiological extracellular ATP (eATP) release that increased supernatant eATP concentration from 5 to ~60 nM. Importantly, inhibition of Panx1 expression in liver cells with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased supernatant eATP concentration and inhibited monocyte migration, indicating that monocyte migration is mediated in part by Panx1-dependent eATP release. Moreover, JNK inhibition decreased supernatant eATP concentration and inhibited Pannexin1 activation, as determined by YoPro-1 uptake in liver cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that JNK regulates activation of Panx1 channels, and provide evidence that Pannexin1-dependent pathophysiological eATP release in lipoapoptosis is capable of stimulating migration of human monocytes, and may participate in the recruitment of monocytes in chronic liver injury induced by saturated FFA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877220>Attenuated lipotoxicity and apoptosis is linked to exogenous and endogenous augmenter of liver regeneration by different pathways.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and cirrhosis. Free fatty acids (FFA) induce steatosis and lipo-toxicity and correlate with severity of NAFLD. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) for FFA induced ER (endoplasmatic reticulum) -stress and lipoapoptosis. Primary human hepatocytes or hepatoma cells either treated with recombinant human ALR (rhALR, 15kDa) or expressing short form ALR (sfALR, 15kDa) were incubated with  (PA) and analyzed for lipo-toxicity, -apoptosis, activation of ER-stress response pathways, triacylglycerides (TAG), mRNA and protein expression of lipid metabolizing genes. Both, exogenous rhALR and cytosolic sfALR reduced PA induced caspase 3 activity and Bax protein expression and therefore lipotoxicity. Endogenous sfALR but not rhALR treatment lowered TAG levels, diminished activation of ER-stress mediators C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and reduced death receptor 5 protein expression. Cellular ALR exerts its lipid lowering and anti-apoptotic actions by enhancing FABP1, which binds toxic FFA, increasing mitochondrial β-oxidation by elevating the mitochondrial FFA transporter CPT1α, and decreasing ELOVL6, which delivers toxic FFA metabolites. We found reduced hepatic mRNA levels of ALR in a high fat diet mouse model, and of ALR and FOXA2, a transcription factor inducing ALR expression, in human steatotic as well as  liver samples, which may explain increased lipid deposition and reduced β-oxidation in  patients. Present study shows that exogenous and endogenous ALR reduce PA induced lipoapoptosis.

We aimed to investigate the role of necroptosis in human and experimental NAFLD and its association with tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and oxidative stress. Serum markers of necrosis, liver receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) were evaluated in control individuals and patients with NAFLD. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or RIP3-deficient (RIP3(-/-)) mice were fed a high-fat choline-deficient (HFCD) or methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, with subsequent histological and biochemical analysis of hepatic damage. In primary murine hepatocytes, necroptosis and oxidative stress were also assessed after necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) treatment or RIP3 silencing. We show that circulating markers of necrosis and TNF-α, as well as liver RIP3 and MLKL phosphorylation were increased in NAFLD. Likewise, RIP3 and MLKL protein levels and TNF-α expression were increased in the liver of HFCD and MCD diet-fed mice. Moreover, RIP3 and MLKL sequestration in the insoluble protein fraction of  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) mice liver lysates represented an early event during stetatohepatitis progression. Functional studies in primary murine hepatocytes established the association between TNF-α-induced RIP3 expression, activation of necroptosis and oxidative stress. Strikingly, RIP3 deficiency attenuated MCD diet-induced liver injury, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress. In conclusion, necroptosis is increased in the liver of NAFLD patients and in experimental models of . Further, TNF-α triggers RIP3-dependent oxidative stress during hepatocyte necroptosis. As such, targeting necroptosis appears to arrest or at least impair NAFLD progression.© 2015 Authors; published by Portland Press Limited.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25766252>Lipidomic-based investigation into the regulatory effect of Schisandrin B on  level in non-alcoholic steatotic livers.</a></h2><p>Schisandrin B (SchB) is one of the most abundant bioactive dibenzocyclooctadiene derivatives found in the fruit of Schisandra chinensis.

Furthermore, the treatment also reduced hepatic fibrosis, activated nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor-2 which is known to attenuate the progression of -related fibrosis. Interestingly, in fasting mice, a single high-dose SchB induced transient lipolysis and increased the expressions of adipose triglyceride lipase and phospho-hormone sensitive lipase. The treatment also increased plasma cholesterol levels and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity, reduced the hepatic low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression in these mice.

LC3-II expression was also analyzed in human SMMC-7721 and HepG2 hepatoma cells exposed to  (PA), a saturated fatty . PA-induced apoptosis was detected by Annexin V staining and specific cleavage of PARP in the presence and absence of different agents.LC3-II expression was markedly increased in human  and in liver tissues of HFD-fed mice. Treatment of SMMC-7721 cells with PA increased LC3-II expression in time- and dose-dependent manners, whereas the unsaturated fatty  oleic  had no effect. Inhibition of autophagy with 3MA sensitized SMMC-7721 cells to PA-induced apoptosis, whereas activation of autophagy by rapamycin attenuated PA-induced PARP cleavage. The autophagy-associated proteins Beclin1 and Atg5 were essential for PA-induced autophagy in SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, pretreatment with SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, effectively abrogated PA-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. Specific knockdown of JNK2, but not JNK1, in SMMC-7721 cells significantly suppressed PA-induced autophagy and enhanced its pro-apoptotic activity; whereas specific knockdown of JNK1 had the converse effect. Similar results were obtained when HepG2 cells were tested.JNK1 promotes PA-induced lipoapoptosis, whereas JNK2 activates pro-survival autophagy and inhibits PA lipotoxicity.

Hepatocellular lipid accumulation is a hallmark of both nonalcoholic steatosis and steatohepatitis (). The latter develops upon pro-inflammatory cell infiltration and is widely considered as the first relevant pathophysiological step in NAFLD-progression. The chemokine CCL5/RANTES plays an important role in the progression of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. We here aimed to investigate its expression in NAFLD. Incubation of primary human hepatocytes with  induced a dose-dependent lipid accumulation, and corresponding dose-dependent RANTES induction in vitro. Furthermore, we observed significantly elevated hepatic RANTES expression in a dietary model of NAFLD, in which mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. This diet induced significant hepatic steatosis but only minimal inflammation. In contrast to the liver, RANTES expression was not induced in visceral adipose tissue of the group fed with high-fat diet. Finally, RANTES serum levels were elevated in patients with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD. In conclusion, our data indicate hepatocytes as cellular source of elevated hepatic as well as circulating RANTES levels in response to hepatic steatosis. Noteworthy, upregulation of RANTES in response to lipid accumulation occurs in the absence of relevant inflammation, which further indicates that hepatic steatosis per se has pathophysiological relevance and should not be considered as benign.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19937697>The plasma lipidomic signature of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Specific alterations in hepatic lipid composition characterize the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which extends from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (). However, the plasma lipidome of NAFLD and whether  has a distinct plasma lipidomic signature are unknown. A comprehensive analysis of plasma lipids and eicosanoid metabolites quantified by mass spectrometry was performed in NAFL (n = 25) and  (n = 50) subjects and compared with lean normal controls (n = 50). The key findings include significantly increased total plasma monounsaturated fatty acids driven by palmitoleic (16:1 n7) and oleic (18:1 n9) acids content (P < 0.01 for both acids in both NAFL and ). The levels of palmitoleic , oleic , and palmitoleic  to  (16:0) ratio were significantly increased in NAFLD across multiple lipid classes.

The docosahexanoic  (22:6 n3) to docosapentenoic  (22:5n3) ratio was significantly decreased within phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) pools, which was most marked in  subjects (P < 0.01 for PC and P < 0.001 for PE).

Myristic  (MA), a free fatty  highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and . Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and tauroursodeoxycholic  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause  associated with lipodystrophy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28628909>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease impairs the cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolism of α-tocopherol (vitamin E).</a></h2><p>This study aims to investigate in in vivo and in vitro models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) the enzymatic metabolism of α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and its relationship to vitamin E-responsive genes with key role in the lipid metabolism and detoxification of the liver. The experimental models included mice fed a high-fat diet combined or not with fructose (HFD+F) and HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma cells treated with the lipogenic agents palmitate, oleate or fructose. CYP4F2 protein, a cytochrome P-450 isoform with proposed α-tocopherol ω-hydroxylase activity, decreased in HFD and even more in HFD+F mice liver; this finding was associated with increased hepatic levels of α-tocopherol and decreased formation of the corresponding long-chain metabolites α-13-hydroxy and α-13-carboxy chromanols. A decreased expression was also observed for PPAR-γ and SREBP-1 proteins, two vitamin E-responsive genes with key role in lipid metabolism and CYP4F2 gene regulation. A transient activation of CYP4F2 gene followed by a repression response was observed in HepG2 cells during the exposure to increasing levels of the lipogenic and cytotoxic agent ; such gene repression effect was further exacerbated by the co-treatment with oleic  and α-tocopherol and was also observed for PPAR-γ and the SREBP isoforms 1 and 2. Such gene response was associated with increased uptake and ω-hydroxylation of α-tocopherol, which suggests a minor role of CYP4F2 in the enzymatic metabolism of vitamin E in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the liver metabolism and gene response of α-tocopherol are impaired in experimental NAFLD.Copyright © 2017.

However, the significance of FGF21 induction in the occurrence of MCD-induced  remains undetermined. C57BL/6J Fgf21-null and wild-type mice were treated with MCD for 1 week. Hepatic Fgf21 mRNA was increased early after commencing MCD treatment independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α and farnesoid X receptor. While no significant differences in white adipose lipolysis were seen in both genotypes, hepatic triglyceride (TG) contents were increased in Fgf21-null mice, likely due to the up-regulation of genes encoding CD36 and phosphatidic  phosphatase 2a/2c, involved in fatty  (FA) uptake and diacylglycerol synthesis, respectively, and suppression of increased mRNAs encoding carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1α, PPARγ coactivator 1α, and adipose TG lipase, which are associated with lipid clearance in the liver.

We aimed to investigate the functional role of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in modulating local mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of human and experimental non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Muscle biopsies were obtained from morbid obese NAFLD patients undergoing bariatric surgery. C57BL/6N mice were fed different NAFLD-inducing diets and C2C12 muscle cells incubated with  (PA) in the presence or absence of an AMPK activator, or upon miR-34a functional modulation. Several muscle miRNAs, including miR-34a, were found increased with human NAFLD progression. Activation of the miR-34a/SIRT1:AMPK pathway, concomitant with impairment in insulin signalling mediators and deregulation of mitochondrial-shaping proteins, was evident in C2C12 cells incubated with PA, as well as in the skeletal muscle of all three diet-induced NAFLD mice models. Functional studies established the association between miR-34a- and PA-induced muscle cell deregulation. Of note, activation of AMPK almost completely prevented miR-34a- and PA-induced cellular stress.

We therefore investigated the susceptibility of steatotic, hepatocyte-derived cells to TNFalpha and the pro-oxidant, t-butylhydroperoxide (TBH). HepG2 spheroids rendered steatotic by fat-loading with 0.15 mM oleic or  for 48 h and treated with TNFalpha or TBH for 18 h exhibited surprisingly lower levels of cytotoxicity, and increased anti-oxidant activity (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) compared with non fat-loaded controls. The protective effect of steatosis was significantly reversed by the inhibition of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) since spheroids transfected with a kinase-dead AMPKalpha2 subunit, exhibited a significant increase in TBH-induced cytotoxicity when fat-loaded. In conclusion, our findings suggest that fat-loaded hepatocyte-derived cells are surprisingly less susceptible to cytokine and pro-oxidant induced damage via an adaptive mechanism dependent, in part, on AMPK activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024755>Niacin inhibits fat accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in cultured hepatocytes: Impact on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammation and potentially resulting in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. Recently, we have shown that niacin significantly prevented hepatic steatosis and regressed pre-existing steatosis in high-fat fed rat model of NAFLD. To gain further insight into the cellular mechanisms, this study investigated the effect of niacin on human hepatocyte fat accumulation, ROS production, and inflammatory mediator IL-8 secretion.Human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 or human primary hepatocytes were first stimulated with  followed by treatment with niacin or control for 24 h.The data indicated that niacin (at 0.25 and 0.5 mmol/L doses) significantly inhibited -induced fat accumulation in human hepatocytes by 45-62%. This effect was associated with inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) mRNA expression without affecting the mRNA expression of fatty  synthase (FAS) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1). Niacin attenuated hepatocyte ROS production and it also inhibited NADPH oxidase activity. Niacin reduced -induced IL-8 levels.These findings suggest that niacin, through inhibiting hepatocyte DGAT2 and NADPH oxidase activity, attenuates hepatic fat accumulation and ROS production respectively. Decreased ROS production, at least in part, may have contributed to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory IL-8 levels.

Carbon monoxide releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) has been reported to stimulate up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes. However, the role of CORM-A1 in improving lipid metabolism, antioxidant signaling and mitochondrial functions in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is unknown. In this study, we report that CORM-A1 prevents hepatic steatosis in high fat high fructose (HFHF) diet fed C57BL/6J mice, used as model of . The beneficial effects of CORM-A1 in HFHF fed mice was associated with improved lipid homeostasis, Nrf2 activation, upregulation of antioxidant responsive (ARE) genes and increased ATP production. As, mitochondria are intracellular source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and important sites of lipid metabolism, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of CORM-A1-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function in  (PA) treated HepG2 cells. Cellular oxidative stress and cell viability were found to be improved in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells via Nrf2 translocation and activation of cytoprotective genes. Furthermore, in PA treated cells, CORM-A1 improved mitochondrial oxidative stress, membrane potential and rescued mitochondrial biogenesis thru upregulation of Drp1, TFAM, PGC-1α and NRF-1 genes. CORM-A1 treatment improved cellular status by lowering glycolytic respiration and maximizing OCR. Improvement in mitochondrial respiration and increment in ATP production in PA + CORM-A1 treated cells further corroborate our findings. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that CORM-A1 ameliorates tissue damage in steatotic liver via Nrf2 activation and improved mitochondrial function, thus, suggesting the anti- potential of CORM-A1.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.
