Currently available treatments relieve symptoms, but do not modify the neurodegeneration underlying DN.  (CA) triterpenes improved microcirculation in earlier clinical studies, and showed neurotropic effects in preclinical models suggesting a potential disease modifying effect in DN. This 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of CAST, a standardized CA extract containing triterpenes, on neuropathy symptoms in Type II diabetic subjects.The study enrolled patients with a history of Type II , with evidence of symptomatic symmetrical DN with total symptom score (TSS) ≥4, and stable HbA1c level <8. The primary outcome measure was TSS, which assessed intensity and frequency of parasthesia, numbness, pain and burning symptoms self-reported by patients. Secondary measures were nerve conduction, neurological impairment score, and quantitative sensory testing.Comparing CAST (n=21) and Placebo (n=22) groups, significant reductions from baseline for TSS (p<0.01) and paresthesia (p<0.01) were seen only in CAST treated groups. Numbness increased from baseline only in the Placebo group (p<0.05) and was significantly higher than for the CAST group (p<0.001). Burning sensation was reduced in both groups (p<0.01). Plasma triterpene levels in patients treated with CAST mirrored neurotropic concentrations .CAST is a potential oral treatment for diabetic neuropathy, as it is well tolerated and effective in reducing the severity of DN symptoms in patients with Type II .</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774506>Anti-inflammatory effects of  via the suppression of NF-kappaB pathway in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of  and madecassoside isolated from Centella asiatica (Umbelliferae) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells.

Herein, we explored the mechanism of this anti-PF effect with regard to gut hormones.A PF model was established in mice by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Haematoxylin and eosin stain and Masson's trichrome stain were used to assess histological changes in the lung. Quantitative-PCR and Western blot detected mRNA and protein levels, respectively, and cytokines were measured by ELISA. Small interfering RNA was used for gene-silencing. EMSA was applied to detect DNA-binding activity.Administration of madecassoside, p.o., but not its main metabolite , exhibited a direct anti-PF effect in mice. However, i.p. madecassoside had no anti-PF effect. Madecassoside increased the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in colon tissues, and HGF receptor antagonists attenuated its anti-PF effect. Madecassoside facilitated the secretion of HGF from colonic epithelial cells by activating the PPAR-γ pathway, as shown by an up-regulation of PPAR-γ mRNA expression, nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity both in vitro and in vivo. Also GW9662, a selective PPAR-γ antagonist, almost completely prevented the madecassoside-induced increased expression of HGF and amelioration of PF.The potent anti-PF effects induced by p.o. madecassoside in mice are not mediated by its metabolites or itself after absorption into blood. Instead, madecassoside increases the activity of PPAR-γ, which subsequently increases HGF expression in colonic epithelial cells. HGF then enters into the circulation and lung tissue to exert an anti-PF effect.© 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021372>Comparison of three different extracts of Centella asiatica for anti-amnesic, antioxidant and anticholinergic activities: in vitro and in vivo study.</a></h2><p>Centella asiatica (CA) has been used by Ayurvedic medical practitioners in India for almost 3000 years. The neuropharmacological properties of CA and its constituents have been studied extensively. Anti-oxidant, free radical scavenging and cholinergic modulatory activities are the reported mechanisms of action for its efficacy in memory disorders. Its medicinal values are mainly attributed to the presence of several triterpenes, namely asiatic acid, , asiaticoside, and madecassoside. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of these triterpenes content in CA extract on the antioxidant, cholinesterase modulation and anti-amnesic properties. The fractions of CA extract enriched for (CAE-EF) and depleted/freed of (CAE-FF) triterpenes contents were compared with methanolic extract (CAE). Both in vitro and in vivo methods for evaluation of antioxidant and anticholinergic activities were used. In vitro, free radical scavenging assays (ABTS, DPPH, NO, NORAC, and ORAC) and cholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) inhibition assays were used. For evaluation of anti-amnesic effect, scopolamine induced amnesia in rats, as the acute model of memory loss was used. Following behavioural assessments (MWM, PA, EPM), biomarkers of oxidative stress (reduced GSH, MDA and SOD activity) and cholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) status were also estimated in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rat brain. The methanolic extract (CAE) was found to perform best among all three fractions for in vitro free radical scavenging, cholinesterase inhibition, improvement of scopolamine-induced amnesia and also in vivo antioxidant effect and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Interestingly triterpenes free fraction (CAE-FF) showed better antioxidant activity than triterpenes enriched fraction (CAE-EF) along with comparable anti-amnesic effect. This indicates that triterpenes are not solely responsible for antioxidant activity, cholinesterase inhibitory and anti-amnesic effect of CA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Urban. (Apiaceae) that has been used as a wound-healing, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent. Up to now, the effects of MA against oxidative stress remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of MA and its mechanisms on hypoxia-induced human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (hRMECs). hRMECs were pre-treated with different concentrations of MA (0-50μM) for 30min before being incubated under hypoxia condition (37°C, 5% CO and 95% N). Cell apoptosis was evaluated with MTT assay and TUNEL staining, and the expression of apoptosis- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related molecules was assessed with western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Intracellular ROS level was evaluated using DCFH-DA. Intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated using related Kits. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) nuclear translocation was assessed with western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence staining. MA significantly reduced oxidative stress in hypoxia-induced hRMECs, as shown by increased cell viability, SOD and GSH-PX leakage, decreased TUNEL- and ROS-positive cell ratio, LDH and MDA leakage, caspase-3 and -9 activity, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, MA also attenuated hypoxia-induced ER stress in hRMECs, as shown by reduced mRNA levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CHOP), protein levels of cleaved activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring kinase/endonuclease 1 alpha (IRE1α), phosphorylation of pancreatic ER stress kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), cleaved caspase-12 and ATF4 translocation to nucleus. The current study indicated that the regulation of oxidative stress and ER stress by MA would be a promising therapy to reverse the process and development of hypoxia-induced hRMECs dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we aimed to compare MS, AS, MA, and AA for their neurite outgrowth activities and mechanisms in Neuro-2a cells. Immunofluorescent cell staining showed MS and AS significantly increased the percentage of neurite-bearing cells (%NBC) and the neurite length with higher potency than MA and AA. The triterpenoid glycosides induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, while their aglycones activated only transient signaling of ERK1/2. Suppression of ERK1/2 activation significantly abolished not only cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation but also the increment of %NBC and neurite length in MS- and AS-treated cells. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation did not produce similar blockage of CREB activation and neurite outgrowth in MA- and AA-treated cells. On the other hand, inactivation of protein kinase B (Akt) resulted in a suppression of neurite lengthening in all studied triterpenoids. This is the first study discerning the different signaling  of neurite outgrowth activity induced by  triterpenoid glycosides and aglycones. Neurite outgrowth activity of the glycosides MS and AS was found to involve the activation of sustained ERK phosphorylation leading to CREB activation, while ERK activation was not associated with MA- and AA-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, Akt activation was evident to be more involved in neurite elongation process.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980864>Determination and quantification of asiaticoside in endophytic fungus from Centella asiatica (L.)

The asiaticoside, one of the most important constituents of the plant, is a triterpenoid saponin having memory enhancement property. Given its medicinal properties, we isolated and characterized endophytic fungi from this plant with the aim to screen these microorganisms for asiaticoside production. In total, we isolated 13 endophytic fungi from the leaves of the plant, out of which one of the isolates produced asiaticoside. This asiaticoside producing isolate was identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides by internal transcribed spacer-based rDNA sequencing. The presence of asiaticoside in ethyl acetate extract of C. gloeosporioides was confirmed by LC-MS. The production of asiaticoside measured in relation to incubation time and subculture generation revealed presence of 62.29\u2009±\u20093.36\xa0µg/100\xa0mL of asiaticoside by C. gloeosporioides on the 15th day in first subculture generation followed by a decrease in subsequent generations. A similar trend was also shown by yield and growth curve of C. gloeosporioides. The asiaticoside production and yield were found to be positively correlated.

This study was designed as an open-labeled, 2-sequence dosage, single- and repeated-dose study investigated under fasting conditions. Plasma concentrations of the parent compounds and their relative acid metabolites were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and any observed adverse events. A key finding of this study was that the pharmacokinetics of ECa 233 in healthy volunteers did not correspond with its pharmacokinetics in animal studies. As indicated in human pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of the parent compounds (madecassoside and asiaticoside) were very low, while their respective metabolites ( and asiatic acid) demonstrated higher values. Based on the pharmacokinetic results observed in the dose comparison, accumulation of active metabolites after repeated dose is highly suggestive. In addition, the asiatic acid profile showed 2-fold increase in C and AUC after increasing dose from 250 to 500\u2009mg of ECa 233.

The levels of madecassoside and asiaticoside, as well as their postulated triterpenic metabolites,  and asiatic acid, in biological samples, were simultaneously measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that all animals had a good tolerability for ECa 233, whereas madecassic and asiatic acids were found in negligible amounts after pharmacokinetic assessment. Madecassoside and asiaticoside demonstrated rather similar absorption and tissue distribution profiles.

Such a disconnection between poor pharmacokinetic property and undoubted bioactivity also exists in many other herbal medicines. However, there is no reasonable explanation for this phenomenon to date. Here we showed that orally administered madecassoside displayed marked therapeutic effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats, which was accompanied by a systemic downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In vitro assays demonstrated that neither madecassoside nor its main metabolite  could directly interfere with the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and IL-10. Intraperitoneal injection of madecassoside or  was absent of significant effects on CIA progression, which further excluded the possibility of systemic action and highlighted the indispensable role of intestinal tracts. Notably, madecassoside could dramatically enhance the secretion of IL-10 from the small intestine of CIA rats probably through increasing the number of Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes in the lamina propria. In conclusion, madecassoside displays anti-arthritis property not by absorption into blood or by its metabolite, but through an intestine-dependent manner. The action can be mediated by, at least partially, the mobilization of IL-10 that originates from small intestines.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Urban. (Apiaceae) that has been used as a wound-healing, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent. Up to now, the effects of MA against oxidative stress remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of MA and its mechanisms on hypoxia-induced human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (hRMECs). hRMECs were pre-treated with different concentrations of MA (0-50μM) for 30min before being incubated under hypoxia condition (37°C, 5% CO and 95% N). Cell apoptosis was evaluated with MTT assay and TUNEL staining, and the expression of apoptosis- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related molecules was assessed with western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Intracellular ROS level was evaluated using DCFH-DA. Intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated using related Kits. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) nuclear translocation was assessed with western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence staining. MA significantly reduced oxidative stress in hypoxia-induced hRMECs, as shown by increased cell viability, SOD and GSH-PX leakage, decreased TUNEL- and ROS-positive cell ratio, LDH and MDA leakage, caspase-3 and -9 activity, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, MA also attenuated hypoxia-induced ER stress in hRMECs, as shown by reduced mRNA levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CHOP), protein levels of cleaved activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring kinase/endonuclease 1 alpha (IRE1α), phosphorylation of pancreatic ER stress kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), cleaved caspase-12 and ATF4 translocation to nucleus. The current study indicated that the regulation of oxidative stress and ER stress by MA would be a promising therapy to reverse the process and development of hypoxia-induced hRMECs dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study was design to evaluate the preventive role of ethanolic extract of C. asiatica in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were gavaged orally with C. asiatica extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight once daily) for 21 days and thereafter subjected to right MCAO for 2 h followed by 22-h reperfusion. Brain injury was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Behavioural outcomes as neurological deficit, rota rod test, and grip strength were assessed. In addition, lipid peroxidation, enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants were analyzed to assess the oxidative stress. Our results revealed that C. asiatica administration greatly improved neurobehavioral activity and diminished infarction volume along with the restored histological morphology of brain in MCAO rats. Furthermore, supplementation with this extract to MCAO group has reduced the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, restored glutathione content and augmented the activities of antioxidant enzymes-catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase in a dose-dependent manner in ischemic rats. The remarkable antioxidant activity of C. asiatica may be attributed to its bioactive triterpenes, asiatic acid, asiaticoside,  and madecosside and may be translated to clinical level for prevention of ischemic stroke.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22816768>Bioavailability, distribution, and antioxidative effects of selected triterpenes in mice.</a></h2><p>This study analyzed the content of eight triterpenes (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, arjunolic acid, asiatic acid, boswellic acid, corosolic acid, , and maslinic acid) in ten vegetables and eight fruits. These compounds at 0.5% were supplied to mice for 4 or 8 weeks. The bioavailability, tissue distribution, and antioxidative protection of these triterpenes were examined. Results showed that triterpenes were detected in eight vegetables and six fruits. Basil and brown mustard contained seven test triterpenes, in the range of 14-102 mg/100 g dry weight. The level of each triterpene in plasma, brain, heart, liver, kidney, colon, and bladder increased as the feeding period was increased from 4 weeks to 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Renal homogenates from mice with triterpene intake had greater antioxidative effects against glucose-induced glutathione loss and malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione production when compared with those from control groups (P < 0.05). These data support that these triterpenes were absorbed and deposited in their intact forms, which in turn exerted in vivo antioxidative protection.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856998>An improved HPLC method for quantitative determination of six triterpenes in Centella asiatica extracts and commercial products.</a></h2><p>An improved HPLC qualitative and quantitative method of six triterpenes (asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, , terminolic acid, and asiaticoside-B) in Centella asiatica (raw plant material and preparations) is described in this paper.

It is a reconstituted mixture of 3 triterpenes extracted from the plant, asiatic acid,  and asiaticoside. In this report, we studied the effects of TECA and its separated components in the wound chamber model described by Schilling et al. Stainless steel wound chambers were surgically inserted under the skin of rats and received serial injections of either TECA or its purified components. Chambers were collected at days 7, 14, 21 or 28 for biochemical analysis or histological examination. TECA-injected wound chambers were characterized by increased dry , DNA, total protein, collagen and uronic acid contents. Peptidic hydroproline was also increased, showing an increased remodeling of the collagen matrix in the wound. The 3 purified components of TECA were all able to reproduce the effects of the complete drug, with some differences depending on the product. Asiatic acid and asiaticoside were the most active of the 3 triterpenes. Asiaticoside exerted a preferential stimulation of collagen synthesis and was active at low doses only. In addition to collagen, the 3 components were also able to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25556066>A LC-ESI-MS method for the simultaneous determination of madecassoside and its metabolite  in rat plasma: comparison pharmacokinetics in normal and collagen-induced arthritic rats.</a></h2><p>To develop a simple and highly sensitive high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of madecassoside and its major metabolite  in rat plasma, and compare the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds in normal and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Glycyrrhetinic acid was used as the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was accomplished on an Inertsil ODS-3 column, using a gradient elution with the mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water acidified with 0.1% (V/V) formic acid. Detection was achieved by ESI-MS under the negative selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. In normal and CIA rats, madecassoside (30 mg·kg(-1)) was orally administered for 21 consecutive days from the day of arthritis onset. For madecassoside, the linear range was 10-1 000 ng·mL(-1) with the square regression coefficient (r) of 0.998 9, while for , the linear range was 10-500 ng·mL(-1) with the square regression coefficient (r) of 0.996 1. The lower limit of quantification was 10 ng·mL(-1) for both analytes. The intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 1.78% to 13.42% for madecassoside and 2.30% to 14.90% for , and the accuracy was between -0.95% and 6.30% for madecassoside and between -1.48% and 5.34% for . The average recoveries of madecassoside,  and IS from spiked plasma samples were > 81%. The developed method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of madecassoside and  in rats after an oral administration of madecassoside. During initial 7 days of dosing, the cmax and AUC of madecassoside were greatly decreased and Vd/F was markedly increased in CIA rats, and no significant difference was observed on the first day of dosing. In contrast, the T1/2, cmax and AUC of  were significantly increased, and Ke of  was greatly decreased in CIA rats compared with normal rats. Along with repeated administration of madecassoside, the differences of pharmacokinetic parameters of both madecassoside and  between CIA and normal rats gradually subsided. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of both madecassoside and  in rats were significantly altered by arthritis status, and the differences of pharmacokinetic parameters between arthritis and normal rats coincide with the severity of arthritis.Copyright © 2014 China Pharmaceutical University.
