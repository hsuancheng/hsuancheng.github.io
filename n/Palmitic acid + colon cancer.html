An in vitro Bacillus subtilis well-agar diffusion assay was employed to test the hypothesis that himastatin was enzymatically inactivated. The activity of himastatin against B. subtilis was inhibited when himastatin was mixed with mouse liver S9 fraction and microsomes. However, subsequent investigations demonstrated that the markedly decreased antibacterial activity was not enzymatic in nature but was related to the presence of certain fatty  salts. Saturated fatty  sodium salts with a carbon chain number of 8 or more reduced the antimicrobial activity of himastatin 50 to 100 times. If antibiotics such as ampicillin, bacitracin, chloramphenicol, and tunicamycin were used in place of himastatin, no meaningful reduction in antibacterial activity occurred. However, the antibacterial activity of the membrane-active peptide antibiotic polymyxin B, but not that of polymyxin E (colistin), was reduced in a manner similar to that of himastatin. Importantly, the activity of himastatin against HCT-116  adenocarcinoma cells in soft agar was markedly reduced in the presence of sodium palmitate as the reference fatty  salt. The data indicate that himastatin may be trapped in micelles in vitro. It may be speculated that the lack of distal site antitumor activity resulted from similar complex formation between himastatin and lipids in vivo. The results also suggest that the  cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of himastatin may result from interactions with the cell membrane.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28262033>Fatty  composition and anticancer activity in  carcinoma cell lines of Prunus dulcis seed oil.</a></h2><p>Almond oil is used in traditional and complementary therapies for its numerous health benefits due to high unsaturated fatty acids content.This study investigated the composition and in vitro anticancer activity of almond oil from Northern Cyprus and compared with almond oil from Turkey.Almond oil from Northern Cyprus was obtained by supercritical CO extraction and analyzed by GC-MS. Almond oil of Turkey was provided from Turkish pharmacies. Different concentrations of almond oils were incubated for 24 and 48 h with Colo-320 and Colo-741 cells. Cell growth and cytotoxicity were measured by MTT assays. Anticancer and antiprolifetarive activities of almond oils were investigated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against to BMP-2, β-catenin, Ki-67, LGR-5 and Jagged 1.Oleic  (77.8%; 75.3%), linoleic  (13.5%; 15.8%),  (7.4%; 6.3%), were determined as the major compounds of almond oil from Northern Cyprus and Turkey, respectively. In the MTT assay, both almond oils were found to be active against Colo-320 and Colo-741 cells with 1:1 dilution for both 24 h and 48 h. As a result of immunohistochemical staining, while both almond oils exhibited significant antiproliferative and anticancer activity, these activities were more similar in Colo-320 cells which were treated with Northern Cyprus almond oil.Almond oil from Northern Cyprus and Turkey may have anticancer and antiproliferative effects on  cells through molecular signalling pathways and, thus, they could be potential novel therapeutic agents.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3156589>5'-O-Palmitoyl- and 3',5'-O-dipalmitoyl-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine--novel lipophilic analogues of 5'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine: synthesis, incorporation into liposomes and preliminary biological results.</a></h2><p>5'-O-palmitoyl- and 3',5'-O-dipalmitoyl-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine were prepared by the reaction of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine in dimethylacetamide with  chloride.

In this study we show that cycloheximide did not significantly inhibit the incorporation of myristic  into either proteoglycan or total protein pool. This lack of inhibition occurred under a condition in which protein synthesis was inhibited greater than 90%. Cycloheximide, on the other hand, did not affect the incorporation of [3H]myristic  into fatty  nor the intracellular interconversion of myristate to palmitate. Characterization of fatty acyl moiety in the proteoglycan and protein by reverse-phase HPLC revealed that approximately 60% of the covalently bound fatty acids was myristate and the remaining 40% was palmitate. These results indicate that in human  carcinoma cells myristoylation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and proteins occurs post-translationally, presumably in the Golgi complex.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19643728>Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 promotes cell survival by regulating lipid synthesis and eliminating carbonyls.</a></h2><p>Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) is primarily expressed in the normal human  and small intestine but overexpressed in liver and lung . Our previous studies have shown that AKR1B10 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-alpha. In this study, we demonstrate that AKR1B10 is critical to cell survival. In human  carcinoma cells (HCT-8) and lung carcinoma cells (NCI-H460), small-interfering RNA-induced AKR1B10 silencing resulted in caspase-3-mediated apoptosis. In these cells, the total and subspecies of cellular lipids, particularly of phospholipids, were decreased by more than 50%, concomitant with 2-3-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial cytochrome c efflux, and caspase-3 cleavage. AKR1B10 silencing also increased the levels of alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyls, leading to the 2-3-fold increase of cellular lipid peroxides. Supplementing the HCT-8 cells with  (80 mum), the end product of fatty  synthesis, partially rescued the apoptosis induced by AKR1B10 silencing, whereas exposing the HCT-8 cells to epalrestat, an AKR1B10 inhibitor, led to more than 2-fold elevation of the intracellular lipid peroxides, resulting in apoptosis. These data suggest that AKR1B10 affects cell survival through modulating lipid synthesis, mitochondrial function, and oxidative status, as well as carbonyl levels, being an important cell survival protein.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28450226>Human carbonyl reductase 1 participating in intestinal first-pass drug metabolism is inhibited by fatty acids and acyl-CoAs.</a></h2><p>Human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, reduces a variety of carbonyl compounds including endogenous isatin, prostaglandin E and 4-oxo-2-nonenal. It is also a major non-cytochrome P450 enzyme in the phase I metabolism of carbonyl-containing drugs, and is highly expressed in the intestine. In this study, we found that long-chain fatty acids and their CoA ester derivatives inhibit CBR1. Among saturated fatty acids, myristic,  and stearic acids were inhibitory, and stearic  was the most potent (IC 9µM). Unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, elaidic, γ-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids) and acyl-CoAs (palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and oleoyl-CoAs) were more potent inhibitors (IC 1.0-2.5µM), and showed high inhibitory selectivity to CBR1 over its isozyme CBR3 and other SDR superfamily enzymes (DCXR and DHRS4) with CBR activity. The inhibition by these fatty acids and acyl-CoAs was competitive with respect to the substrate, showing the K values of 0.49-1.2µM. Site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate-binding residues of CBR1 suggested that the interactions between the fatty acyl chain and the enzyme's Met141 and Trp229 are important for the inhibitory selectivity. We also examined CBR1 inhibition by oleic  in cellular levels: The fatty  effectively inhibited CBR1-mediated 4-oxo-2-nonenal metabolism in  DLD1 cells and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in the drug-resistant gastric  MKN45 cells that highly express CBR1. The results suggest a possible new food-drug interaction through inhibition of CBR1-mediated intestinal first-pass drug metabolism by dietary fatty acids.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It was found markedly more cytotoxic than sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols from plant used as a standard (STD), due to a stronger ability to inhibit DNA alpha-polymerase (IC(50): 378 microg/mL, vs 1784 microg/mL for STD). After a 48-h continuous treatment, IC(50) values for growth inhibition were in the range of 20-46 microg/mL instead of 94 to >250 microg/mL for STD, and those for inhibition of metabolic activity were in the range of 34-87 microg/mL instead of >250 microg/mL for STD.

DGs containing stearic, oleic, , and myristic  side chains were found in fecal extracts from each of eight subjects. Synthetic 1,2-DGs, containing the fatty acids found in endogenous fecal DGs, induced mitogenesis in cultures of premalignant cells from each of 13 adenomas, covering all histological classes, and in cultures from two of four carcinomas. The potent adenoma mitogen, dimyristin, had no mitogenic activity on cultures of normal  epithelial cells from seven different subjects. These results suggest DGs may act as endogenous mitogens in the development of human . The extent of adenoma mitogenesis was correlated with the chain length of the saturated R-groups: 16 greater than 14 greater than 12 greater than 10 greater than 8 much greater than 18. DGs with oleic  residues, C18:1, were among the most active, while substitution of even one fatty  residue with a stearic  residue, C18:0, reduced or eliminated mitogenic activity.

PKCζ, a member of atypical PKC family, has been reported to mediate glucose metabolism. However, whether and how PKCζ regulates tumor cells fatty  β-oxidation are unknown. Here, we report that the phosphorylation of SIRT6 is significantly increased after  (PA) treatment in  cells. PKCζ can physically interact with SIRT6 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction enhances following PA treatment. Further experiments show that PKCζ is the phosphorylase of SIRT6 and phosphorylates SIRT6 at threonine 294 residue to promote SIRT6 enrichment on chromatin. In the functional study, we find that the expression of ACSL1, CPT1, CACT, and HADHB, the genes related to fatty  β-oxidation, increases after PA stimulation. We further confirm that PKCζ mediates the binding of SIRT6 specifically to the promoters of fatty  β-oxidation-related genes and elicits the expression of these genes through SIRT6 phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate the mechanism of PKCζ as a new phosphorylase of SIRT6 on maintaining tumor fatty  β-oxidation and define the new role of PKCζ in lipid homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The antineoplastic properties of many PUFAs such as linoleic  and their metabolites are known. We tested the hypothesis that natural vegetable oils, such as sesame oil and its component linoleic , when added to human  adenocarcinoma cells growing in tissue culture would inhibit their growth and that normal  cells would not be similarly affected. Three human  cell lines and one normal human  cell line were exposed to the following: (1) pure linoleic ; (2) lipase-digested sesame oil; (3) undigested sesame oil; (4) five additional common vegetable oils; (5) mineral oil. Linoleic  inhibited the in vitro growth of all three malignant human  adenocarcinoma cell lines. The normal  cell line showed dramatically less inhibition of growth. Lipase-digested sesame oil (LDSO) and undigested sesame oil (UDSO) produced greater inhibition of growth of all three malignant  cell lines than of the normal  cells. Five other common vegetable oils containing various amounts of PUFAs such as corn, soybean, safflower, olive and coconut oils, all in their lipase-digested form, were found to dramatically inhibit the growth of the HT-29 malignant human  cell line. Undigested olive and safflower oils also inhibited the HT-29 cells although not as markedly as the lipase-digested oils. Mineral oil did not inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells. Both lauric and , which are saturated fatty acids found in abundance in coconut oil inhibits the HT-29 cells more strongly than linoleic , while oleic  did not inhibit. We conclude that many vegetable oils including sesame contain in vitro antineoplastic properties and that this finding warrants further investigation both in vitro and in vivo to assess their possible chemotherapeutic potential.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19085838>Role of fatty acids in malignancy and visual impairment: epidemiological evidence and experimental studies.</a></h2><p>International variation in breast and  incidence is positively related to total fat intake. However, total fat consists of different fatty  families, e.g., saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Epidemiological evidence and experimental studies suggest that these fatty  families have different effects on breast and  carcinogenesis. Therefore the action of each fatty  on carcinogenesis should be evaluated separately. Although it is difficult to establish firm conclusions on the effect of each fatty  in human epidemiological studies, experimental studies on animals and cultured cells suggest that n-6 PUFAs (linoleic  and arachidonic ) may have a tumor promoting effect, while n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic  and alpha-linolenic ) and conjugated fatty acids (CFAs; a mixture of positional and geometric isomers of PUFAs with conjugated double bonds) exert an inhibitory effect on tumor growth. SFAs such as  and stearic  show little or no tumor promoting effect, and the action of oleic , a MUFA, is inconclusive. In addition to regulation of abnormal cell growth seen in cancers, fatty acids also control cell loss seen in degenerative eye diseases, such as degeneration of lens material in cataract and degeneration of photoreceptor cells in retinitis pigmentosa. Experiments suggest that n-6 PUFAs cause deleterious effects, while n-3 PUFAs result in beneficial effects on the lens and retina. In particular, docosahexaenoic  is known to be effective in rescuing photoreceptor cells from damage. Thus, understanding the function of each fatty  is likely to be important for making progress in treating these and other diseases.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768267>Type 2 Diabetes Promotes Cell Centrosome Amplification via AKT-ROS-Dependent Signalling of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes is associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage which can cause centrosome amplification.

Together, they increased AKT activation as well as the expression, binding and centrosome translation of ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ.

To determine 4-HPR activity in a multidrug-resistant  cell line as well as to study ceramide metabolism, MCF-7/AdrR cells (redesignated NCI/ADR-RES) were treated with 4-HPR and sphingolipids were analyzed. TLC analysis of cells radiolabeled with [3H] showed that 4-HPR elicited a dose-responsive increase in radioactivity migrating in the ceramide region of the chromatogram and a decrease in cell viability. Results from liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry revealed large elevations in dihydroceramides (N-acylsphinganines), but not desaturated ceramides, and large increases in complex dihydrosphingolipids (dihydrosphingomyelins, monohexosyldihydroceramides), sphinganine, and sphinganine 1-phosphate. To test the hypothesis that elevation of sphinganine participates in the cytotoxicity of 4-HPR, cells were treated with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor d-erythro-N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS), with and without 4-HPR. After 24 h, the 4-HPR/DMS combination caused a 9-fold increase in sphinganine that was sustained through +48 hours, decreased sphinganine 1-phosphate, and increased cytotoxicity. Increased dihydrosphingolipids and sphinganine were also found in HL-60 leukemia cells and HT-29  cells treated with 4-HPR. The 4-HPR/DMS combination elicited increased apoptosis in all three cell lines. We propose that a mechanism of 4-HPR-induced cytotoxicity involves increases in dihydrosphingolipids, and that the synergy between 4-HPR and DMS is associated with large increases in cellular sphinganine.

However, most epidemiologic studies assess alcoholic beverage consumption using self-reported data, leading to potential exposure misclassification. Biomarkers of alcohol consumption may provide an alternative, complementary approach that reduces misclassification and incorporates individual differences in alcohol metabolism. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between previously identified alcohol consumption-related metabolites and colorectal  and adenoma using serum metabolomics data from two studies. Data on colorectal  were obtained from a nested case-control study of 502 US adults (252 cases, 250 controls) within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian  Screening Trial. Data on colorectal adenoma were obtained from a case-control study of 197 US adults (120 cases, 77 controls) from the Navy  Adenoma Study. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were fit to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for eight alcohol consumption-related metabolites identified in a previous analysis: ethyl glucuronide; 4-androstene-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate 1; 5-alpha-androstan-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate; 16-hydroxypalmitate; bilirubin (E,Z or Z,E); cyclo (-leu-pro); dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6); and palmitoleate (16:1n7). We found no clear association between these alcohol consumption-related metabolites and either endpoint. However, we did observe an inverse association between cyclo (-leu-pro) and colorectal adenoma that was only observed in the highest metabolite quantile (OR 4th vs. 1st Quantile = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12-0.78; P-trend = 0.047), but no association for colorectal .

Molecular targets of AEs, which have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract, include cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors (activated by AEA), transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1, activated by AEA and OEA), the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha, activated by OEA and, to a less extent, by PEA), and the orphan G-coupled receptors GPR119 (activated by OEA) and GPR55 (activated by PEA and, with lower potency, by AEA and OEA). Modulation of AE levels in the gut may provide new pharmacological strategies not only for the treatment of feeding disorders but also for the prevention or cure of widespread intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and .</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2322935>Injury induced by fatty acids or bile  in isolated human colonocytes prevented by calcium.</a></h2><p>Measurement of the modulation of the growth fraction of isolated normal colonocytes from adult subjects in primary monolayer culture was used as a sensitive quantitative assay to evaluate toxic effects of several endogenous compounds found within the .

We have recently demonstrated that feeding fish oil, compared with corn oil, decreases  Ras membrane localization and reduces tumor formation in rats injected with a  carcinogen. Because the biological activity of Ras is regulated by posttranslational lipid attachment and its interaction with stimulatory lipids, we investigated whether docosahexaenoic  (DHA), found in fish oil, compared with linoleic  (LA), found in corn oil, alters Ras posttranslational processing, activation, and effector protein function in young adult mouse  cells overexpressing H-ras (YAMC-ras). We show here that the major n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) constituent of fish oil, DHA, compared with LA (an n-6 PUFA), reduces Ras localization to the plasma membrane without affecting posttranslational lipidation and lowers GTP binding and downstream p42/44(ERK)-dependent signaling.

Plant sphingolipids differ structurally from those of mammals [soy glucosylceramide (GlcCer) consists predominantly of a 4,8-sphingadiene backbone and alpha-hydroxy-], which might affect their bioactivity. Soy GlcCer was added to the AIN-76A diet (which contains <0.005% sphingolipid) to investigate whether it would also suppress tumorigenesis in these mouse models. Soy GlcCer reduced  cell proliferation in the upper half of the crypts in mice treated with DMH by 50 and 56% (P < 0.05) at 0.025 and 0.1% of the diet (wt/wt), respectively, and reduced the number of aberrant  crypt foci (an early marker of  carcinogenesis) by 38 and 52% (P < 0.05). Min mice fed diets containing 0.025 and 0.1% (wt/wt) soy GlcCer developed 22 and 37% fewer adenomas (P < 0.05), respectively. The effects of dietary sphingolipids on gene expression in the intestinal mucosal cells of Min mice were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. Soy GlcCer affected the expression of 96 genes by > or = 2-fold in a dose-dependent manner, increasing 32 and decreasing 64. Decreases in the mRNA expression of two transcription factors associated with , hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) and transcription factor 4 (TCF4), were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. In conclusion, soy GlcCer suppressed  tumorigenesis in two mouse models; hence, plant sphingolipids warrant further investigation as inhibitors of .

We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to investigate the distribution and composition of SM species in pork chop consisting of longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle (loin), intermuscular fat tissue, transparent tissue, and spinalis muscle. Four SM species were identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem MS (MS/MS) and MALDI-MS/MS and visualized using MALDI-IMS. SM species containing stearic  were predominantly distributed in the loin and spinalis muscle, whereas SM species containing , lignoceric, and nervonic acids were predominantly distributed in transparent tissue. These results indicated that the distribution of SM species differed among the pork tissues, depending on the tissue-specific fatty  composition. The total amount including all identified SM species was higher in the loin than in spinalis muscle. Pork is reportedly associated with increased risk for chronic diseases due to the high amount of heme iron. From the observation of color, the amount of heme iron was lower in loin than in spinalis muscle. Thus, the degree of risk for chronic diseases might be lower in the loin than in spinalis muscle. This is the first report on the tissue-specific distribution of SM species in meat at a microscopic resolution using IMS. MALDI-IMS analysis may be useful in assessing the association between SM species and quality parameters of pork meat. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sphingomyelin (SM) species are major sphingolipids in pork meat. SM species affect quality parameters such as health benefits due to their protective properties against  and atherosclerosis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry analysis combined with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry is a suitable method to directly investigate the distribution and composition of SM species at microscopic level among different tissues of pork meat. Therefore, this method is useful to assess the SM species-induced health effect of different tissues of pork meat.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15630255>A bitter melon extract inhibits the P-glycoprotein activity in intestinal Caco-2 cells: monoglyceride as an active compound.</a></h2><p>P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a 170 kDa membrane protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. In normal tissues, P-gp functions as an ATP-dependent efflux pump that excretes highly hydrophobic xenobiotic compounds, playing an important role in protecting the cells/tissues from xenobiotics. In the present study, chemical substances that could directly modulate the intestinal P-gp activity were searched in vegetables and fruits. By using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells as a model of the small intestinal cells, we observed that a bitter melon fraction extracted from 40% methanol showed the greatest increase of the rhodamine-123 accumulation by Caco-2 cells. Inhibitory compounds in the bitter melon fraction were then isolated by HPLC using Pegasil C4 and Pegasil ODS columns. The HPLC fraction having the highest activity was analyzed by (1)H-NMR and FAB-MS, and the active compound was identified as 1-monopalmitin.

ACCA is upregulated in multiple types of human cancers and small interfering RNA-mediated ACCA silencing in human breast and prostate  cells results in oxidative stress and apoptosis. This study reports for the first time that TOFA (5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic ), an allosteric inhibitor of ACCA, is cytotoxic to lung  cells NCI-H460 and  carcinoma cells HCT-8 and HCT-15, with an IC(50) at approximately 5.0, 5.0, and 4.5 microg/ml, respectively. TOFA at 1.0-20.0 microg/ml effectively blocked fatty  synthesis and induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The cell death was characterized with PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and annexin-V staining, all of which are the features of the apoptosis. Supplementing simultaneously the cells with  acids (100 microM), the end-products of the fatty  synthesis pathway, prevented the apoptosis induced by TOFA. Taken together, these data suggest that TOFA is a potent cytotoxic agent to lung and  cells, inducing apoptosis through disturbing their fatty  synthesis.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26865113>Identification of Palmitoylated Transitional Endoplasmic Reticulum ATPase by Proteomic Technique and Pan Antipalmitoylation Antibody.</a></h2><p>Protein palmitoylation plays a significant role in a wide range of biological processes such as cell signal transduction, metabolism, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. For high-throughput analysis of protein palmitoylation, approaches based on the acyl-biotin exchange or metabolic labeling of azide/alkynyl-palmitate analogs are commonly used. No palmitoylation antibody has been reported. Here, the palmitoylated proteome of human  cell lines SW480 was analyzed via a TS-6B-based method. In total, 151 putative palmitoylated sites on 92 proteins, including 100 novel sites, were identified.

The underlying mechanisms are not, however, known with certainty. In the present studies we have examined whether certain specific fatty acids (FA) might act by enhancing the role of an activated oncogene in a model cell culture system. We found that when the rat fibroblast cell line Rat 6 was transfected with an activated human c-H-ras oncogene and the cells subsequently grown in medium supplemented with myristic ,  or stearic  (20-80 microM) there was a marked enhancement of the number of transformed foci obtained. On the other hand arachidonic  had a marked inhibitory effect in this transformation assay. However, this inhibitory effect can be partially reversed by indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, at dose response manner. Control studies indicated that these results were not simply due to the effects of the FAs on growth of the Rat 6 cells or the process of transfection per se. Lipid analyses of cells grown in the presence of stearic  indicated that the added FA was extensively incorporated into the major lipid classes of the cell and produced transient changes in lipid composition. This simple cell culture system may be useful for elucidating the mechanisms by which various dietary lipids and nutritional factors influence the carcinogenic process.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9770727>Effects of fatty acids on liver metastasis of ACL-15 rat  cells.</a></h2><p>The effects of eicosapentaenoic  [EPA; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA)], linoleic  (LA; n-6 PUFA), and  (PA; saturated fatty ) on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced F344 rat  carcinoma cells (ACL-15) were investigated in vivo and in vitro. The number and size of liver metastatic foci via a superior mesenteric vein injection of ACL-15 cells in F344 rats were significantly inhibited in the EPA-treated group compared with the LA-treated group (p < 0.01); the PA-treated animals and those fed commercial rodent chow (standard diet) demonstrated intermediate values. In a dot immunoblotting assay, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression on ACL-15 cells was downregulated by EPA-ethyl ester treatment and upregulated by LA-ethyl ester treatment compared with the untreated control cells, whereas the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 2 was not influenced by the fatty  ethyl esters. In a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, EPA-ethyl ester suppressed ACL-15 cell growth in a schedule-dependent manner, and LA-ethyl ester showed schedule-dependent stimulation. In contrast, PA demonstrated no regulatory effect on cell growth at lower concentrations (< or = 5 mg/ml) but concentration-dependent inhibition at higher concentrations. According to our in vivo cell kinetic study, the difference in tumor growth at the metastatic site was due to different tumor cell proliferation rates; the cell loss rate was not altered. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of liver metastasis on ACL-15 cells by EPA can be explained by a decreased ability of tumor cell adhesion to the capillary bed (low expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) and a lower potential of tumor cell proliferation (low mitotic rate) at the secondary site.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22449545>Further insights into chemical characterization through GC-MS and evaluation for anticancer potential of Dracaena draco leaf and fruit extracts.</a></h2><p>The present study reports for the first time the amino  and fatty  compositions and the antitumoral activity of aqueous extracts obtained from Dracaena draco L. leaf and fruit.

Such modifications have not been reported in cell-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, although these macromolecules are known to be hydrophobic. Here, we report that a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan is acylated with both myristate and palmitate, two long-chain saturated fatty acids. When  carcinoma cells were labeled with [3H]myristic , a significant proportion of the label was shown to be specifically incorporated into the protein core of the proteoglycan. Characterization of fatty acyl moiety in the purified proteoglycan by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed that approximately 60% of the covalently bound fatty acids was myristate. We further show that this relatively rare 14-carbon fatty  was bound to the protein core via a hydroxylamine- and alkali-resistant amide bond. The remaining 40% was the more common 16-carbon palmitate, which was bound via a hydroxylamine- and alkali-sensitive thioester bond. Palmitate appeared to be added post-translationally and derived in part from intracellular elongation of myristate, a process that occurred within the first two hours and was insensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis. Acylation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan represents a novel modification of this gene product and could play a role in a number of biological functions including specific interactions with membrane receptors and ligand stabilization.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15930461>Increased carnitine-dependent fatty  uptake into mitochondria of human  cells induces apoptosis.</a></h2><p>Carnitine-dependent fatty  import into mitochondria and beta-oxidation seem to be impaired in tumor cells. In the present study we show that a supply of palmitoylcarnitine together with L-carnitine potently induces apoptosis in HT-29 human  cells as a consequence of accelerated fatty  oxidation. Caspase-3-like activities, measured by the cleavage rate of a fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate and nuclear fragmentation determined after DNA labeling in fixed cells by fluorescence microscopy, served as indicators of apoptosis. Neither L-carnitine nor palmitoylcarnitine alone were able to increase caspase-3-like activities and DNA fragmentation, but when provided together, apoptosis occurred. That exogenous carnitine was indeed able to enhance fatty  uptake into mitochondria was demonstrated by an increased influx of a fluorescent  analog. Enhanced fatty  availability in mitochondria led to an increased generation of O*2-, as detected by a O*2- -sensitive fluorogenic dye, indicating oxidation of delivered substrates. Benzoquinone, an O*2- scavenger, blocked O*2- generation and prevented apoptosis as initiated by the combination of palmitoylcarnitine and carnitine. The lack of effect of the ceramide synthesis inhibitor fumonisin on palmitoylcarnitine/carnitine-induced apoptosis further supports the notion that apoptotic cell death is specifically due to fatty  oxidation. In contrast to HT-29 cells, nontransformed human colonocytes did not respond to exogenous palmitoylcarnitine/carnitine and no apoptosis was observed. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that a limited mitochondrial fatty  import in human  cells prevents high rates of mitochondrial O*2- production and protects  cells from apoptosis that can be overcome by an exogenous carnitine supply.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1707612>Hexadecanoic and neuraminic  incorporations in two rat  carcinoma cell lipids: selective influence of 1-O-octadecyl 2-O-methyl-3-phosphocholine on glycerolipid and ganglioside biosynthesis.</a></h2><p>[3H] hexadecanoic and N-acetyl [14C] neuraminic acids were incorporated in glycerolipids or gangliosides of 2 rat  carcinoma cell lines, having (PRO cells), or not (REG cells) invasive capacities when inoculated in syngeneic BD IX rats. The cells were cultured (48 h) in presence of 1-0-octadecyl-2-0-methyl-3-phosphocholine (ET 18-0-CH3) 20 or 40 microM, which, on transformed cells, inhibits the cell growth, modifies the glycerolipid biosynthesis, and activates the sialyltransferases. ET 18-0-CH3 20 microM activated, in PRO and in REG cells the incorporation of [3H] hexadecanoate in monosialogangliosides (1.45 fold compared to controls), but not in disialogangliosides and the distribution of this fatty  between monosialo- (82%) and disialogangliosides (18%) was unchanged with controls. After [14C] neuraminic  labelings, and for control experiments, the total radioactivities in gangliosides, in PRO cells, were twice higher than in REG cells, a difference which, probably, reflects the ganglioside content. ET 18-0-CH3 20 microM did not increase the incorporation of the [14C] neuraminic  in PRO and in REG cells, and did not change its distribution between monosialo (70-80% for controls and experiments with ET 18-0-CH3) and disialogangliosides (20-30%). Similar results were obtained with ET 18-0-CH3 40 microM for the distribution of [14C] neuraminic  in monosialo- and disialogangliosides. Whatever the precursor, the trisialogangliosides were never radiolabeled. Analysis of the [3H] glycerolipids (the main radiolabeled lipid classes in controls were: phosphatidylcholines, triglycerides, sphingomyelins and phosphatidyl-inositols) revealed that ET 18-0-CH3, compared to controls, did not activate the incorporation of [3H] hexadecanoate in total glycerolipids (PRO or REG cells). It activated (3 fold) its incorporation in triglyerides, inhibited it (0.5-0.6 fold) in phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and phosphatidyl-inoditols and all these most noticeable differences were observed in PRO and in REG cells. These findings reflect the impossibility of ET 18-0-CH3 to activate the sialyltransferases during the ganglioside biosynthesis in  carcinoma cells, while it modified ceramide, glycerophospholipid and neutral glycerolipid biosynthesis.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989671>PPARγ promotes diabetes-associated centrosome amplification via increasing the expression of SKA1 directly at the transcriptional level.</a></h2><p>We have recently published that type 2 diabetes can induce cell centrosome amplification due to the action of high glucose, , and insulin, and ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ are signal mediators. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms of the centrosome amplification in  HCT116 cells. Treatment of the cells with high glucose, , and insulin increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) as well as the spindle and kinetochore associated protein 1 (SKA1), knockdown of each of which resulted in the inhibition of the treatment-triggered centrosome amplification. Knockdown of PPARγ inhibited the treatment-evoked increase in the SKA1 level, whereas knockdown of SKA1 did not modify the treatment-increased PPARγ level. We found a predicted binding site for PPARγ in the promoter region of the SKA1 gene from the JASPAR database. Experimental results showed that the treatment increased the messenger RNA level of SKA1, which could be inhibited by PPARγ chemical inhibitor or small interfering RNA. Moreover, we were able to show that PPARγ could bind to the binding site in the SKA1 gene promoter, which was increased by the experimental treatment. In conclusion, it is suggested that the pathophysiological factors in type 2 diabetes, high glucose, , and insulin, induce the cell centrosome amplification through the PPARγ-SKA1 pathway, in which PPARγ increases the expression of SKA1 via directly enhancing the SKA1 gene transcription.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7214312>Neutral glycolipid composition in human .</a></h2><p>Neutral glycolipid composition of human gastric and   was studied in comparison to healthy mucosa.

Acyl-CoA synthetase activity increased approximately 40%, and the incorporation of  into triacylglycerol relative to phosphatidylcholine increased nearly 2-fold during Caco-2 differentiation. A rate-limiting enzyme activity in the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, was at levels comparable with rat jejunum and remained unchanged during differentiation. In contrast, the activity of monoacylglycerol acyltransferase, which is unique to the monoacylglycerol pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis, was present at < 7% of the levels in rat jejunum. Further analysis of the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway showed that the rate-limiting enzyme activities for diacylglycerol conversion to triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and phosphatidylcholine, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, increased 2-3-fold and decreased approximately 40%, respectively, during Caco-2 differentiation. In addition, a 2-fold increase in cellular diacylglycerol mass was observed during enterocytic conversion. These data indicate that fatty  esterification to triacylglycerol in Caco-2 cells occurs primarily via the glycerol 3-phosphate pathway.

High glucose, insulin, and  also increased the expressions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), individual knockdown of which upregulated the treatment-increased expression of 14-3-3σ and promoted the centrosome amplification. In contrast, overexpression of JNK1 inhibited the centrosome amplification. Knockdown of Stat3 enhanced the centrosome translocation of 14-3-3σ. Moreover, we showed that knockdown of JNK1 inhibited the treatment-increased expression of Stat3. Knockdown of PCNA, JNK1, or Stat3 did not have an effect on NPM and vice versa. In conclusion, our results suggest that PCNA and JNK1-Stat3 pathways respectively promotes and feedback inhibits the centrosome amplification by targeting at the ROCK1/14-3-3σ complex, and NPM serves as an independent signal for the centrosome amplification.© 2018 The Authors.

Monolayers were incubated for 24 h, at the apical or lumenal side, with  (16:0) or linoleic  (18:2) in physiological concentrations. Incubation with 1.0 mM 16:0 or 18:2 resulted in differences in the composition and amount of secreted lipoproteins. Radiolabeled lipids in the lipoproteins secreted during incubation with 18:2 were found in the chylomicron/VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) density whereas with 16:0 the secreted lipoproteins were in the intermediate density/low density lipoprotein (IDL/LDL) density range. More triglyceride was secreted into the (basolateral) medium during incubation with 1.0 mM 18:2 (41 +/- 12% of total triglyceride synthesized) than with 1.0 mM 16:0 (18 +/- 3% of total). The biochemical findings correlate with conspicuous morphological changes in the cells in the presence of 16:0, but not 18:2. Increasing concentrations of 16:0 (0.1-1.0 mM) caused gradual accumulation of intracellular membrane. Microvilli became strongly reduced in number. With 1.0 mM  we found an increased incorporation of [1-14C] into phosphatidic  (14.8% of total incorporation into phospholipid with 16:0 vs. < 0.5% with 18:2) and diacylglycerol (12.5% with 16:0 vs. < 0.5% with 18:2) and diacylglycerol (12.5% with 16:0 vs. 0.5% with 18:2) and the amount of intracellular phospholipid doubled. The morphological changes were completely reversed after 24 h with 1.0 mM 18:2. We conclude from our results that, compared to 18:2, 16:0 is not efficiently incorporated into triglycerides. 16:0 is incorporated into cellular phospholipids in a greater proportion than 18:2, causing accumulation of intracellular phospholipid and the precursors phosphatidic  and diacylglycerol. Different processing of 18:2 and 16:0 by Caco-2 cells resulted in profound differences in triglyceride synthesis and lipoprotein composition and secretion.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8143994>Biochemical epidemiology of : effect of types of dietary fiber on  diacylglycerols in women.</a></h2><p>In view of the potential significance of dietary fat and fiber in  and the possible indirect involvement of diacylglycerols (DAGs) in the pathogenesis of , the effect of types of dietary fiber on fecal DAG in premenopausal women was investigated.Forty-eight women consuming a typical western diet provided two 24-hour stool specimens and two sets of preintervention 4-day food records. They were randomly assigned to one of the fiber groups, namely, a wheat, oat, or corn bran supplement. They consumed their control diet plus 13-15 g of dietary fiber from each source for 8 weeks. At the end of the fiber period, each subject provided two 24-hour stool specimens and 4-day food records. Stool samples collected during the two periods were analyzed for total fat and DAG fatty acids.All sources of dietary fiber increased the amount of fecal fat excreted. Dietary wheat bran decreased the concentrations of total DAG and DAG containing lauric , myristic , , stearic , and linoleic , whereas oat bran increased the DAG composed of oleic  and linoleic  compared with the control diet. Corn bran decreased the DAG containing stearic .These results show that the modifying effect of dietary fiber on DAG depends on the type of fiber consumed.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2844941>Modification of CaCo-2 cell membrane fatty  composition by eicosapentaenoic  and : effect on cholesterol metabolism.</a></h2><p>Membrane fatty  composition of CaCo-2 cells was modified by incubating the cells for 8 days in medium containing 100 microM eicosapentaenoic  or .

Obesity and elevated waist circumference (WC) increase the likelihood of developing precancerous  adenomas.Venous blood was collected from 126 males, ages 48 to 65 years, who received routine colonoscopies. Plasma phospholipid (PPL) FAs were isolated, derivatized, and then analyzed using gas chromatography. ORs and 95% confidence intervals were determined using polytomous logistic regression after adjusting for confounding factors [i.e., age, smoking, WC, and body mass index (BMI)].PPL  (PA) was inversely correlated with the presence of  adenomas (P = 0.01). For each unit increase in palmitoleic  (OR, 3.75; P = 0.04) or elaidic  (OR, 2.92; P = 0.04), an individual was more likely to have adenomas relative to no  polyps. Higher enzyme activity estimates (EAE) of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1; P = 0.02) and elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein-6 (ELOVL-6; P = 0.03) were associated with an individual being approximately 1.5 times more likely to have an adenoma compared with no polyps.PPL FAs and EAEs, which have previously been associated with colorectal , are significantly different in those with adenomas when compared with those without polyps. PPL PA, elaidic , and SCD-1 and ELOVL-6 EAEs are associated with adenomas independent of BMI and WC.PPL PA, elaidic , and SCD-1 and ELOVL-6 EAEs are associated with adenomas even after adjusting for obesity-related risk factors and may function as novel biomarkers of early colorectal  risk.©2015 American Association for  Research.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8014005>Non-proteolytic release of carcinoembryonic antigen from normal human  epithelial cells cultured in collagen gel.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have shown that, even with a minimal content of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), normal human  epithelial cells express substantial amounts of CEA mRNA and  mucosal fragments cultured in vitro produce CEA quite actively, indicating that CEA should no longer be considered to be of an oncofetal nature. To understand the basis of the usefulness of CEA as a tumor marker, we analyzed the release of CEA, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, from  epithelial cells, by culturing isolated  crypts in collagen gel. The crypts appeared to preserve their morphological and biochemical integrity in the gel for at least 16 hr, and released CEA spontaneously. Three forms of CEA--spontaneously released CEA, CEA liberated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and CEA in cell lysates--were indistinguishable on SDS-PAGE. This is in contrast to recombinant CEA spontaneously released from CHO transfectants, which showed a smaller molecular mass than that of PI-PLC-cleaved recombinant CEA. By phase separation using Triton X-114, CEA in the cell lysates of crypts was separated mostly into the detergent phase, while the spontaneously released and the PI-PLC-cleaved CEA were separated into the aqueous phase. When the cells were metabolically labeled with the precursors of the GPI-anchor, 3H-ethanolamine but not 3H- was found in the spontaneously released CEA. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the proteolysis-like release of the recombinant CEA from CHO cells, CEA in normal  epithelial cells is released by a non-proteolytic cleavage, which probably occurs through the action of some endogenous phospholipase.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30560565>Antitumor effect of -conjugated DsiRNA for  in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.</a></h2><p>In this study, we synthesized Dicer-substrate siRNA conjugated with  at the 5'-end of the sense strand (C16-DsiRNA), and examined its RNAi effect on β-catenin as a target gene in a  cell line, HT29Luc, both in vitro and in vivo. We examined the in vitro RNAi effect in HT29Luc cells and found that C16-DsiRNA strongly inhibited expression of the β-catenin gene in comparison with non-modified DsiRNA. Also, high membrane permeability of C16-DsiRNA was exhibited, and it was confirmed that most of the C16-DsiRNA was localized in cytoplasm of HT29Luc cells. In regard to the in vivo RNAi effect, C16-DsiRNA complexed with Invivofectamine targeting the β-catenin gene was locally administered to a subcutaneous tumor formed by implantation of HT29Luc cells into the subcutis of nude mice; we evaluated the effect by measuring the bioluminescence increase, which reflects tumor growth, using an in vivo imaging system. As a result, C16-DsiRNA strongly inhibited the growth of tumors formed in subcutis of nude mice compared with non-modified DsiRNA, and this in vivo RNAi effect lasted up to 15 days.

Examples of this class of compounds are the fecal diglycerides (DGs)(E. Friedman et al.,  Res., 49: 544-548, 1989), which may act as endogenous tumor promoters. At the concentration found in vivo, fecal DGs composed of oleic, myristic, and  fatty acids induced mitogenesis of all classes of benign tumor cells and of half of the resected carcinomas tested in primary culture, but induced no detectable mitogenesis of normal colonocytes.  tumor cells also exhibit selective responses to these endogenous modulators as measured by another biological parameter, secretion of urokinase from carcinomas than from normal colonocytes. Fecal DGs also induced a 13-fold increase in urokinase mRNA synthesis in  carcinoma cells and induced secretion of active urokinase from each of five resected carcinomas.  carcinomas, at both the primary site and metastatic to the liver, secreted the Mr 55,000 form of urokinase constitutively and secreted the same form upon treatment with fecal DGs. An increase in the steady-state level of urokinase secretion by saturated-chain DGs exhibited a strong dependency on the chain length of the fatty  residues, those of 14 and 16 carbons having the greatest activity. Thus, fecal DGs composed of oleic, myristic, and  residues induce two biological activities selectively in  tumor cells, each of which would enhance tumor development. Selective mitogenesis would increase adenoma and carcinoma cell number relative to normal colonocyte number, and induction of the proteolytic enzyme urokinase would aid local invasion of the carcinoma within the bowel wall.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30769921>Hexadecenoic Fatty  Positional Isomers and De Novo PUFA Synthesis in  Cells.</a></h2><p> metabolism involves delta-9 and delta-6 desaturase enzymes forming palmitoleic  (9-16:1; -7 series) and sapienic  (6-16:1; -10 series), respectively. The corresponding biological consequences and lipidomic research on these positional monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) isomers are under development. Furthermore, sapienic  can bring to the de novo synthesis of the -10 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) sebaleic  (5,8-18:2), but such transformations in  cells are not known. The model of Caco-2 cell line was used to monitor sapienic  supplementation (150 and 300 μM) and provide evidence of the formation of -10 fatty acids as well as their incorporation at levels of membrane phospholipids and triglycerides. Comparison with palmitoleic and  acids evidenced that lipid remodelling was influenced by the type of fatty  and positional isomer, with an increase of 8-18:1, -10 PUFA and a decrease of saturated fats in case of sapienic . Cholesteryl esters were formed only in cases with sapienic . Sapienic  was the less toxic among the tested fatty acids, showing the highest ECs and inducing death only in 75% of cells at the highest concentration tested. Two-photon fluorescent microscopy with Laurdan as a fluorescent dye provided information on membrane fluidity, highlighting that sapienic  increases the distribution of fluid regions, probably connected with the formation of 8-18:1 and the -10 PUFA in cell lipidome.

On the basis of the 2H quadrupole splittings of [6,6,7,7,8-2H5]deoxycholate and [11,11,12,12-2H4]chenodeoxycholate in the presence of lamellar multibilayers of egg yolk lecithin, these bile acids were found to be incorporated in such a manner that the B-D rings lie parallel with the normal of the bilayers when the ratio of the bile  to lipid is low (less than 0.11). When the ratio is increased, these bile  molecules are not dispersed entirely in the bilayer but aggregate to form micelles with lipids. Further, we studied the resultant perturbation of the multibilayers of egg yolk lecithin analyzed by using the 2H quadrupole splitting of [18,18,18-2H3]stearic  as a probe and by 31P chemical shift anisotropy. We found that the bilayer structure is retained even at the bile -to-lipid ratio of 0.25, although a small amount of an isotropic phase appeared such as small vesicles and micelles. The molecular ordering of fatty acyl chains was rather enhanced by the presence of 1 mM deoxycholate in erythrocyte ghosts as seen from the 2H quadrupole splitting of [16,16,16-2H3], although deoxycholate caused hemolysis in this condition. The former observation can be explained by the way the lipid-protein interaction is modified by deoxycholate located in the interface between the lipids and proteins.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p></html>
