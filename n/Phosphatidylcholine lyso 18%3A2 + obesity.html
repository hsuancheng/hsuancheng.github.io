<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599289>Altered triglyceride and phospholipid metabolism predates the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in obese pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with  and long-term health risks, is usually diagnosed at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. An understanding of lipid metabolism in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered lipid metabolism at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15- weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The lipid, sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and  (38:5). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:, 42:3), - (16:0, :1),  (35:, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:5, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant. We concluded that both lipid and triglyceride metabolism were altered at least 10 weeks before diagnosis of GDM. Further investigation is required to determine the functional consequences of these differences and the mechanisms by which they arise.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30967146>Plasma metabolomic profiling of amino acids and polar lipids in Iranian obese adults.</a></h2><p>, widely recognized as a serious health concern, is characterized by profoundly altered metabolism. However, the intermediate metabolites involved in this change remain largely unknown.We conducted targeted metabolomics profiling to identify moieties associated with adult .In this case-control study of Iranian adults, 200 obese patients were compared with 100 controls based on 104 metabolites profiled by a targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analysis comprised acylcarnitines, diacyl- (PCaa), acyl-alkyl- (PCae), sphingomyelins (SM), -phospholipids (LPC) and amino acids. We performed multivariable linear regression to identify metabolites associated with , adjusting for age, sex, total energy intake, total physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing.A pattern of 19 metabolites was significantly associated with . Branched chain amino acids, alanine, glutamic acid, proline, tyrosine LPCa C16:1, PCaa C32:1, PCaa C32: and PCaa C38:3 were positively, while serine, asparagine, LPCa C18:1, LPCa C18:, LPCe C18:0, PCae C34:3, PCae C38:4 and PCae C40:6 were negatively associated with  (all p < 0.00048).A metabolomic profile containing 9 amino acids and 10 polar lipids may serve as a potential biomarker of adult . Further studies are warranted to replicate these findings as well as investigate potential changes in this profile after weight reduction.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p></html>
