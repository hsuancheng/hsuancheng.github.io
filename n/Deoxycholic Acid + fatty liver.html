The association between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and hepatocyte metabolism disorders prompted us to characterize ER stress-induced hepatic metabolic dysfunction in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hiPSC-Hep), to explore regulatory pathways and validate a phenotypic  model for progression of  steatosis. We treated hiPSC-Hep with a ratio of unsaturated and saturated  acids in the presence of an inducer of ER stress to synergistically promote triglyceride accumulation and dysregulate lipid metabolism. We monitored lipid accumulation by high-content imaging and measured gene regulation by RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses. Our results show that ER stress potentiated intracellular lipid accumulation by 5-fold in hiPSC-Hep in the absence of apoptosis. Transcriptome pathway analysis identified ER stress pathways as the most significantly dysregulated of all pathways affected. Obeticholic  dose dependently inhibited lipid accumulation and modulated gene expression downstream of the farnesoid X receptor. We were able to identify modulation of hepatic markers and gene pathways known to be involved in steatosis and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD), in support of a hiPSC-Hep disease model that is relevant to clinical data for human NASH. Our results show that the model can serve as a translational discovery platform for the understanding of molecular pathways involved in NAFLD, and can facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic molecules based on high-throughput screening strategies.© 2018.

Here, we summarize the effect of obesity on NASH and how it has a cascading effect on cardiovascular dysfunction. We also review the current and emerging treatment options for NASH.The link between NASH and cardiac dysfunction has been further delineated in recent studies demonstrating endothelial dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, and increased coronary artery calcification in patients with known NASH. Standard treatment of obesity with lifestyle interventions including diet, exercise, and behavioral modification has been shown to improve NASH as well as reduce cardiovascular dysfunction. In addition to FDA-approved drugs like vitamin E and pioglitazone, several agents including NGM282, obeticholic , elafibranor, and liraglutide are currently being investigated for their therapeutic potential in NASH. Recent studies show that bariatric surgery results in significant improvement or resolution of NASH.Obesity is a major factor in the development of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and its progression to steatohepatitis. Patients with NAFLD have a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk. For biopsy-proven NASH, vitamin E and pioglitazone are the recommended medical treatments in addition to lifestyle modification.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26817117>[COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT REGIMENS IN PATIENTS WITH NONALCOHOLIC  DISEASE].</a></h2><p>To compare the effectiveness of different treatment strategies of nonalcoholic  disease.51 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were included in an open randomized prospective comparative study with no control. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the chosen treatment strategy. Group 1 (n = 25) had been receiving standard treatment of NASH (Ursodeoxycholic  15 mg/kg once a day, per os divided into 3 doses, Atorvastatin 20 mg per os at night, Vitamin E 800 IU/day per os for 12 months); Group 2 (n = 26) had been receiving losartan 50 mg/day per os for 12 months in addition to the above mentioned standard treatment of NASH.In overall, the results of this work suggest that long-term, for 12 months, losartan usage in a daily dose of 50 mg in the complex therapy of patients with NASH is followed by a significant decrease in the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in serum and improvement in 13C-metathetin breath test results. These results indicate a decrease in inflammation and slowing of formation and regression of  fibrosis. Absence of progress in  fibrosis in patients on losartan treatment was revealed.Additional inclusion of losartan in the standard therapy of NASH has a positive therapeutic effect on the process of fibrogenesis in the , so it is advisable to appoint losartan in a daily dose of 50 mg for 1 year to these patients.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31197565>Nonsteroidal FXR Ligands: Current Status and Clinical Applications.</a></h2><p>FXR agonists have demonstrated very promising clinical results in the treatment of  disorders such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH, in particular, is one of the last uncharted white territories in the pharma landscape, and there is a huge medical need and a large potential pharmaceutical market for a NASH pharmacotherapy. Clinical efficacy superior to most other treatment options was shown by FXR agonists such as obeticholic  (OCA) as they improved various metabolic features including  steatosis as well as  inflammation and fibrosis. But OCA's clinical success comes with some major liabilities such as pruritus, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) lowering, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) increase, and a potential for drug-induced  toxicity. Some of these effects can be attributed to on-target effects exerted by FXR, but with others it is not clear whether it is FXR- or OCA-related. Therefore a quest for novel, proprietary FXR agonists is ongoing with the aim to increase FXR potency and selectivity over other proteins and to overcome at least some of the OCA-associated clinical side effects through an improved pharmacology. In this chapter we will discuss the historical and ongoing efforts in the identification and development of nonsteroidal, which largely means non-bile -type, FXR agonists for clinical use.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744638>[Cellular senescence and chronic inflammation].</a></h2><p>It has recently become apparent that obesity is associated with chronic inflammation and several common types of cancer development. Although several events were proposed to be involved in these pathologies, the precise mechanisms underlying obesity-associated inflammation and cancer largely remain unclear. Here, we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) plays crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of a bacterial metabolite that cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of the bacterial metabolites provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn, secretes various inflammatory and tumour promoting factors in the , thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Importantly, reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the induction of SASP by the gut bacterial metabolite in HSCs plays key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Interestingly, moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), implying that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights into the development of obesity-associated cancer.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128056>Emerging Treatments for Nonalcoholic  Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>This review discusses completed phase II randomized clinical trials with high-quality published results for compounds that demonstrate effects on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis histology (obeticholic , elafibranor, and liraglutide).

Dyslipidemia and its related disorders, including non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), obesity and other metabolic diseases, are of increasing public health concern due to their increasing prevalence in the population. Besides their well-characterized functions in cholesterol homoeostasis and nutrient absorption, bile acids are also important metabolic regulators and function as signaling hormones by activating specific nuclear receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and multiple signaling pathways. Recent studies identified a new signaling pathway by which conjugated bile acids (CBA) activate the extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2). CBA-induced activation of S1PR2 is a key regulator of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) and hepatic gene expression.

Fibrosis generally results from chronic hepatic injury caused by various factors, mainly viral infection, schistosomiasis, and alcoholism; however, the exact pathological mechanisms are still unknown. Although numerous drugs have been shown to have antifibrotic activity  and in animal models, none of these drugs have been shown to be efficacious in the clinic. Importantly, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a key role in the initiation, progression, and regression of  fibrosis by secreting fibrogenic factors that encourage portal fibrocytes, fibroblasts, and bone marrow-derived myofibroblasts to produce collagen and thereby propagate fibrosis. These cells are subject to intricate cross-talk with adjacent cells, resulting in scarring and subsequent  damage. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of  fibrosis and their relationships with HSCs is essential for the discovery of new therapeutic targets. This comprehensive review outlines the role of HSCs in  fibrosis and details novel strategies to suppress HSC activity, thereby providing new insights into potential treatments for  fibrosis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26698410>Pediatric parenteral nutrition-associated  disease and cholestasis: Novel advances in pathomechanisms-based prevention and treatment.</a></h2><p>Parenteral nutrition constitutes a life-saving therapeutic tool in patients unable to ingest/absorb oral or enteral delivered nutrients.  function tests abnormalities are a common therapy-related complication, thus configuring the so-called Parenteral Nutrition Associated  Disease (PNALD) or cholestasis (PNAC). Although the damage is frequently mild, and resolves after discontinuation of parenteral nutrition, in some cases it progresses into cirrhotic changes, especially in neonates and infants. We present a literature review focusing on the pathogenetic mechanisms-driven prevention and therapies for the cases where parenteral nutrition cannot be discontinued. Ursodeoxycholic  has been proposed in patients with cholestatic hepatopathy, but its efficacy needs to be better established. Little evidence is available on efficacy of anti-oxidants, antibiotics, probiotics and anti TNFα. Lipid emulsions based on fish oil with a high content of long-chain polyunsaturated  acids ω-3 appear effective both in decreasing intrahepatic inflammation and in improving biliary flow. Most recent promising variations such as soybean/MCT/olive/fish oil emulsion [third generation lipid emulsion (SMOFlipid)] are under investigation.

Here, we explore a role for this axis in mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity (DIO).Intestinal uroguanylin expression and secretion, and hypothalamic GUCY2C expression and anorexigenic signaling, were quantified in mice on high-calorie diets for 14 weeks. The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in suppressing uroguanylin in DIO was explored using tunicamycin, an inducer of ER stress, and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that inhibits ER stress. The impact of consumed calories on uroguanylin expression was explored by dietary manipulation. The role of uroguanylin in mechanisms underlying obesity was examined using Camk2a-Cre-ER(T2)-Rosa-STOP(loxP/loxP)-Guca2b mice in which tamoxifen induces transgenic hormone expression in brain.DIO suppressed intestinal uroguanylin expression and eliminated its postprandial secretion into the circulation. DIO suppressed uroguanylin through ER stress, an effect mimicked by tunicamycin and blocked by TUDCA. Hormone suppression by DIO reflected consumed calories, rather than the pathophysiological milieu of obesity, as a diet high in calories from carbohydrates suppressed uroguanylin in lean mice, whereas calorie restriction restored uroguanylin in obese mice. However, hypothalamic GUCY2C, enriched in the arcuate nucleus, produced anorexigenic signals mediating satiety upon exogenous agonist administration, and DIO did not impair these responses. Uroguanylin replacement by transgenic expression in brain repaired the hormone insufficiency and reconstituted satiety responses opposing DIO and its associated comorbidities, including visceral adiposity, glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis.These studies reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism contributing to obesity in which calorie-induced suppression of intestinal uroguanylin impairs hypothalamic mechanisms regulating food consumption through loss of anorexigenic endocrine signaling. The correlative therapeutic paradigm suggests that, in the context of hormone insufficiency with preservation of receptor sensitivity, obesity may be prevented or treated by GUCY2C hormone replacement.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21079772>Changes in hepatic gene expression upon oral administration of taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  in ob/ob mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and associated with considerable morbidities. Unfortunately, there is no currently available drug established to treat NAFLD. It was recently reported that intraperitoneal administration of taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) improved hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice. We hereby examined the effect of oral TUDCA treatment on hepatic steatosis and associated changes in hepatic gene expression in ob/ob mice. We administered TUDCA to ob/ob mice at a dose of 500 mg/kg twice a day by gastric gavage for 3 weeks. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and hepatic gene expression were examined in comparison with control ob/ob mice and normal littermate C57BL/6J mice. Compared to the control ob/ob mice, TUDCA treated ob/ob mice revealed markedly reduced  fat stained by oil red O (44.2±5.8% vs. 21.1±10.4%, P<0.05), whereas there was no difference in body weight, oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and ER stress. Microarray analysis of hepatic gene expression demonstrated that oral TUDCA treatment mainly decreased the expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis among the components of lipid homeostasis. At pathway levels, oral TUDCA altered the genes regulating amino , carbohydrate, and drug metabolism in addition to lipid metabolism. In summary, oral TUDCA treatment decreased hepatic steatosis in ob/ob mice by cooperative regulation of multiple metabolic pathways, particularly by reducing the expression of genes known to regulate de novo lipogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177958>Reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress using chemical chaperones or Grp78 overexpression does not protect muscle cells from palmitate-induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a novel link between elevated  acids levels, obesity and insulin resistance in  and adipose tissue. However, it is unknown whether ER stress also contributes to lipid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, the major tissue responsible of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Here, we investigated the possible role of ER stress in palmitate-induced alterations of insulin action, both in vivo, in gastrocnemius of high-palm diet fed mice, and in vitro, in palmitate-treated C(2)C(12) myotubes. We demonstrated that 8 weeks of high-palm diet increased the expression of ER stress markers in muscle of mice, whereas ex-vivo insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation was not altered in this tissue. In addition, exposure of C(2)C(12) myotubes to either tuncamycine or palmitate induced ER stress and altered insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation. However, alleviation of ER stress by either TUDCA or 4-PBA treatments, or by overexpressing Grp78, did not restore palmitate-induced reduction of insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation in C(2)C(12) myotubes. This work highlights that, even ER stress is associated with palmitate-induced alterations of insulin signaling, ER stress is likely not the major culprit of this effect in myotubes, suggesting that the previously proposed link between ER stress and insulin resistance is less important in skeletal muscle than in adipose tissue and .Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

These organs have been shown to have increased susceptibility to cold ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury in comparison with otherwise comparable lean livers; the mechanisms governing this increased susceptibility to CIR injury are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important link between hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In this study, we investigated ER stress signaling and blockade in the mediation of CIR injury in severely steatotic rodent allografts. Steatotic allografts from genetically leptin-resistant rodents had increased ER stress responses and increased markers of hepatocellular injury after  transplantation into strain-matched lean recipients. ER stress response components were reduced by the chemical chaperone taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), and this resulted in an improvement in the allograft injury. TUDCA treatment decreased nuclear factor kappa B activation and the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β. However, the predominant response was decreased expression of the ER stress cell death mediator [CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)]. Furthermore, activation of inflammation-associated caspase-11 was decreased, and this linked ER stress/CHOP to proinflammatory cytokine production after steatotic  transplantation. These data confirm ER stress in steatotic allografts and implicate this as a mediating mechanism of inflammation and hepatocyte death in the steatotic  allograft.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075296>Therapeutic options in pediatric non alcoholic  disease: current status and future directions.</a></h2><p>The epidemics of overweight and obesity has resulted in a significant increase of non alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), a potentially progressive condition.

However, the mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not well understood. In this study, we performed a nontargeted metabolomic analysis of children with epilepsy treated with VPA (n=23). Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the   pathway, citrate cycle, urea cycle, amino  metabolism, and bile  pathway were altered in children with epilepsy exhibiting VPA hepatotoxicity. In particular, the VPA-induced perturbation of bile  homeostasis has not been observed previously. Based on these findings, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to characterize bile  profiles and further determined the effects of VPA on the synthesis, transport, and regulation of bile acids in mice. The bile  metabolomic profiles of the livers of mice treated with VPA indicated an increase in most bile acids, especially chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and  (DCA), as well as unconjugated bile acids. The upregulation of genes related to bile  synthesis (CYP7A1and CYP8B1) and the downregulation of genes related to conjugation (BAAT and BACS) and regulation (FXR and SHP) were detected in the , suggesting that hydrophobic bile  production was increased and FXR signaling was impaired.

Several electronic databases were searched up to Nov 15, 2015. Outcomes include  histological outcomes (i.e., fibrosis), all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, and safety. A network meta-analysis was applied to estimate pooled risk ratios (RR). Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria.A total of 44 studies (n = 3802) were eligible. When compared with placebo, obeticholic  (OCA) was the only intervention that significantly improved fibrosis with RR (95% CI) of 1.91 (1.15, 3.16), while pentoxyfylline (PTX) demonstrated improved fibrosis without statistical significance with RR (95% CI) of 2.27 (0.81, 6.36).

These bile  composition changes in VSG mice explained observed downregulation of hepatic lipogenic and bile  synthetic genes.VSG in obese mice results in greater hepatic steatosis reduction than seen with caloric restriction alone. VSG surgery increases serum bile acids that correlate with weight lost postsurgery and changes serum bile composition that could explain suppression of hepatic genes responsible for lipogenesis.Copyright © 2013 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581663>Undernourishment in utero Primes Hepatic Steatosis in Adult Mice Offspring on an Obesogenic Diet; Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the possible involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the developmental origins of hepatic steatosis associated with undernourishment in utero, we herein employed a fetal undernourishment mouse model by maternal caloric restriction in three cohorts; cohort 1) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 9 weeks of age (wks) before a high fat diet (HFD), cohort 2) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks, cohort 3) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 22 wks on a HFD after the alleviation of ER stress with a chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), from 17 wks to 22 wks. Undernourishment in utero significantly deteriorated hepatic steatosis and led to the significant integration of the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks.

However, it is still unclear how FXR agonists protect against NASH and which cell type is the main target of FXR agonists. In this study, we examined the effects of OCA on the development of NASH using melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice that progressively developed hepatic steatosis and NASH on Western diet (WD). Treatment with OCA effectively prevented chronic inflammation and  fibrosis in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice with only marginal effect on body weight and hepatic steatosis. Hepatic crown-like structure (hCLS) is a unique histological structure characteristic of NASH, which triggers hepatocyte death-induced interstitial fibrosis. Intriguingly, treatment with OCA markedly reduced hCLS formation even after MC4R-KO mice developed NASH, thereby inhibiting the progression of  fibrosis. As its mechanism of action, OCA suppressed metabolic stress-induced p53 activation and cell death in hepatocytes. Our findings in this study highlight the role of FXR in hepatocytes in the pathogenesis of NASH. Collectively, this study demonstrates the anti-fibrotic effect of OCA in a murine model of NASH with obesity and insulin resistance, which suggests the clinical implication for human NASH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742378>A System for In Vivo Imaging of Hepatic Free   Uptake.</a></h2><p>Alterations in hepatic free   (FFA) uptake and metabolism contribute to the development of prevalent  disorders such as hepatosteatosis.

We fed wild-type (WT) and FXR KO mice a MCD diet (model of steatohepatitis) and found that Chop mRNA expression is upregulated in WT but not FXR KO mice. The absence of FXR aggravates hepatic inflammation after MCD feeding. In HepG2 cells, we found that Chop expression is regulated in a FXR/Retinoid X receptor (RXR)-dependent manner.

The ER stress response is activated in the livers of mice fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, yet the role of ER stress in the pathogenesis of MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis is unknown. Using chemical chaperones on hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation and fibrosis in mice fed a MCD diet, we aim to determine the effects of reducing ER stress. C57BL/6J mice were fed a MCD diet with or without the ER chemical chaperones 4-phenylbutyric  (PBA) and tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) for 2 wk. TUDCA and PBA effectively attenuated the ER stress response in MCD diet-fed mice, as evidenced by reduced protein levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and phosphorylated JNK and suppression of mRNA levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein, glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa, and X-box binding protein 1. However, PBA and TUDCA did not decrease MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis. MCD diet-induced hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by increased plasma alanine aminotransferase and induction of hepatic TNFα expression, was also not reduced by PBA or TUDCA. PBA and TUDCA did not attenuate MCD diet-induced upregulation of the fibrosis-associated genes tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. ER chemical chaperones reduce MCD diet-induced ER stress, yet they do not improve MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or activation of genes associated with fibrosis.

Here, we examined the role of SMILE in the regulation of nuclear receptor  X receptor (LXR)-mediated sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) gene expression. We found that SMILE inhibited T0901317 (T7)-induced transcriptional activity of LXR, which functions as a major regulator of lipid metabolism by inducing SREBP-1c,   synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) gene expression. Moreover, we demonstrated that SMILE physically interacts with LXR and represses T7-induced LXR transcriptional activity by competing with coactivator SRC-1. Adenoviral overexpression of SMILE (Ad-SMILE) attenuated fat accumulation and lipogenic gene induction in the  of T7 administered or of high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism by which ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) inhibits LXR-induced lipogenic gene expression. Interestingly, UDCA treatment significantly increased SMILE promoter activity and gene expression in an adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, UDCA treatment repressed T7-induced SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC protein levels, whereas knockdown of endogenous SMILE gene expression by adenovirus SMILE shRNA (Ad-shSMILE) significantly reversed UDCA-mediated repression of SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC protein levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that UDCA activates SMILE gene expression through adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase phosphorylation, which leads to repression of LXR-mediated hepatic lipogenic enzyme gene expression.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528832>[CORRECTION OF BILE FLOW CHARACTERISTICS IN PATIENTS WITH NON-ALCOHOLIC  DISEASE IN COMBINATION WITH HYPERURICEMIA].</a></h2><p>Basis on study through integrated comparative assessment of clinical, biochemical survey data revealed that in patients with impaired metabolism of uric  in a greater percentage of common biliary sludge, a violation of the rheological properties of bile, a violation of cholate-cholesterol ratio index, which indicates an increased risk of bile stones.

Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular lipid metabolism. UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic lipid metabolism.To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an oleic  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA, lipid accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD.

Changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were examined, in addition to nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of particle sizes and sub-fraction concentrations. OCA elicited changes in circulating cholesterol and particle size of LDL and HDL. OCA decreased HDL cholesterol and increased LDL cholesterol, independently of dose. HDL particle concentrations declined as a result of a reduction in medium and small HDL. Total LDL particle concentrations increased because of an increase in large LDL particles.

Bile acids (BAs) bind to the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and energy expenditure. The present study aimed to determine associations between the circulating BAs and the skeletal muscle volume (SMV), and lipid and glucose metabolism in patients with NAFLD. Methods Serum BAs and metabolic parameters were measured in 55 patients with NAFLD (median age, 55 years). The changes (Δ) in serum BA (ΔBA) and metabolic parameters were determined in 17 patients (male, n=10; female, n=7) who received nutritional counseling for 12 months. Results Spearman's test revealed that the levels of 12α-hydroxysterol (12α-OH) BAs, including  (DCA), were inversely correlated with the SMV of the upper and lower limbs and the total SMV. A multivariate analysis revealed that the level of DCA was correlated with a reduced total SMV, whereas non-12α-OH BAs, including chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), were correlated with an increased SMV of the lower limbs. Changes in CDCA were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs, and inversely correlated with the Δwaist-hip ratio and Δtotal cholesterol. Changes in the total non-12α-OH BA level were positively correlated with the ΔSMV of the lower limbs. Conclusion Circulating BAs were associated with SMV. The 12α-OH BAs, including DCA were associated with reduced SMV levels, whereas non-12α-OH BAs including CDCA were associated with increased SMV levels.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active microbiota. Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human  is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly ). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to  (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular . Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic , p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic , indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney , cardiovascular , autism and schizophrenia.

Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the , and converted into secondary bile acids such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  by gut microbiota. Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19),  gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in  gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling.

There are many reports showing that the administration of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) suppresses lipogenesis and reduces the lipid contents in the  of experimental animals. Since UDCA is not recognized as an FXR agonist, these effects of UDCA cannot be readily explained by its direct activation of FXR. We observed that the dietary administration of UDCA in mice decreased the expression levels of SREBP1c and its target lipogenic genes. Alpha- and β-muricholic acids (MCA) and cholic  (CA) were the major bile acids in the mouse  but their contents decreased upon UDCA administration. The hepatic contents of chenodeoxycholic  and  (DCA) were relatively low but were not changed by UDCA. UDCA did not show FXR agonistic or antagonistic potency in in vitro FXR transactivation assay. Taking these together, we deduced that the above-mentioned change in hepatic bile  composition induced upon UDCA administration might cause the relative increase in the FXR activity in the , mainly by the reduction in the content of β-MCA, a farnesoid X receptor antagonist, which suggests a mechanism by which UDCA suppresses lipogenesis and decreases the lipid contents in the mouse .</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397535>Prevention and treatment of intestinal failure-associated  disease in children.</a></h2><p>Intestinal failure-associated  disease (IFALD), a serious complication occurring in infants, children, and adults exposed to long-term parenteral nutrition (PN), causes a wide-spectrum of disease, ranging from cholestasis and steatosis to fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. Known host risk factors for IFALD include low birth weight, prematurity, short bowel syndrome, and recurrent sepsis. The literature suggests that components of PN may also play a part of the multifactorial pathophysiology. Because some intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) may contribute to inflammation and interfere with bile excretion, treatment with ILE minimization and/or ILEs composed primarily of omega-3  acids can be helpful, but requires careful monitoring for growth failure and essential   deficiency (EFAD). Data from randomized controlled trials are awaited to support widespread use of these approaches. Other IFALD treatments include cycling PN, ursodeoxycholic , sepsis prevention, photoprotection, and polyvinylchloride-free tubing.

In that regard, nuclear receptors are arising as key molecular targets for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Here we show that, in a typical model of NASH-associated  damage, microRNA-21 (miR-21) ablation results in a progressive decrease in steatosis, inflammation and lipoapoptosis, with impairment of fibrosis. In a complementary fast food (FF) diet NASH model, mimicking features of the metabolic syndrome, miR-21 levels increase in both  and muscle, concomitantly with decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a key miR-21 target. Strikingly, miR-21 knockout mice fed the FF diet supplemented with farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA) display minimal steatosis, inflammation, oxidative stress and cholesterol accumulation. In addition, lipoprotein metabolism was restored, including decreased   uptake and polyunsaturation, and  and muscle insulin sensitivity fully reinstated. Finally, the miR-21/PPARα axis was found amplified in  and muscle biopsies, and in serum, of NAFLD patients, co-substantiating its role in the development of the metabolic syndrome. By unveiling that miR-21 abrogation, together with FXR activation by OCA, significantly improves whole body metabolic parameters in NASH, our results highlight the therapeutic potential of nuclear receptor multi-targeting therapies for NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25717264>Autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cirrhosis concurrent with biliary stricture after  transplantation.</a></h2><p>Although the development of de novo autoimmune  disease after  transplantation (LT) has been described in both children and adults, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)-primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) overlap syndrome has rarely been seen in  transplant recipients.

This report describes a comprehensive investigation of the effect of agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO) on HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, including alterations in short-chain   contents and bile  metabolism in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet or HFD, with or without AGO. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis produced their fecal microbiota profiles. Profiles of cecal organic acids and serum bile acids were determined, respectively, using HPLC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems. T-RFLP analyses showed that an HFD changed the gut microbiota significantly. Changes in the microbiota composition induced by an HFD were characterized by a decrease in the order Lactobacillales and by an increase in the Clostridium subcluster XIVa. These changes of the microbiota community generated by HFD treatment were suppressed by AGO supplementation. As supported by the data of the proportion of Lactobacillales order, the concentration of lactic  increased in the HFD + AGO group. Data from the serum bile  profile showed that the level of , a carcinogenic secondary bile  produced by gut bacteria, was increased in HFD-receiving mice. The upregulation tended to be suppressed by AGO supplementation. Finally, results show that AGO supplementation suppressed the azoxymethane-induced generation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon derived from HFD-treated mice. Our results suggest that oral intake of AGO prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, thereby inhibiting colon carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853202>Ursodeoxycholic : Effects on hepatic unfolded protein response, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is a secondary hydrophilic bile  (BA) used as therapy for a range of hepatobiliary diseases. Its efficacy in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is still under debate. Here, we aimed to decipher molecular mechanisms of UDCA in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, apoptosis and oxidative stress in morbidly obese patients.In this randomized controlled pharmacodynamic study,  and serum samples from 40 well-matched morbidly obese NAFLD-patients were analysed. Patients received UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) or no treatment 3 weeks before samples were obtained during bariatric surgery.Patients treated with UDCA displayed higher scoring of steatosis (S), activity (A) and fibrosis (F), the so called SAF-scoring. UDCA partially disrupted ER homeostasis by inducing the expression of the ER stress markers CHOP and GRP78. However, ERDJ4 and sXBP1 levels were unaffected. Enhanced CHOP expression, a suggested pro-apoptotic trigger, failed to induce apoptosis via BAK and BAX in the UDCA treated group. Potentially pro-apoptotic miR-34a was reduced in the vesicle-free fraction in serum but not in  after UDCA treatment. Thiobarbituric  reactive substances, 4-hydroxynonenal and mRNA levels of several oxidative stress indicators remained unchanged after UDCA treatment.Our data suggest that UDCA treatment has ambivalent effects in NAFLD patients. While increased SAF-scores and elevated CHOP levels may be disadvantageous in the UDCA treated cohort, UDCA's cytoprotective properties potentially changed the apoptotic threshold as reflected by absent induction of pro-apoptotic triggers.

In animal models, OCA decreases insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the effects of OCA on insulin sensitivity in patients with nonalcoholic  disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given placebo (n = 23), 25 mg OCA (n = 20), or 50 mg OCA (n = 21) once daily for 6 weeks. A 2-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp was used to measure insulin sensitivity before and after the 6-week treatment period. We also measured levels of  enzymes, lipid analytes, fibroblast growth factor 19, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (a BA precursor), endogenous bile acids, and markers of  fibrosis.When patients were given a low-dose insulin infusion, insulin sensitivity increased by 28.0% from baseline in the group treated with 25 mg OCA (P = .019) and 20.1% from baseline in the group treated with 50 mg OCA (P = .060). Insulin sensitivity increased by 24.5% (P = .011) in combined OCA groups, whereas it decreased by 5.5% in the placebo group. A similar pattern was observed in patients given a high-dose insulin infusion. The OCA groups had significant reductions in levels of γ-glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase and dose-related weight loss. They also had increased serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibroblast growth factor 19, associated with decreased levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and endogenous bile acids, indicating activation of farnesoid X receptor. Markers of  fibrosis decreased significantly in the group treated with 25 mg OCA. Adverse experiences were similar among groups.In this phase 2 trial, administration of 25 or 50 mg OCA for 6 weeks was well tolerated, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced markers of  inflammation and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic  disease.

A major challenge has been the lack of suitable models expressing OSTα/β. Based on observations first reported here that hepatic OSTα/β is upregulated in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the aim of this research was to develop an in vitro model to evaluate OSTα/β function and interaction with drugs and bile acids. OSTα/β expression in human  tissue was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Radiolabeled compounds were used to determine OSTα/β-mediated transport in the established in vitro model. The effect of bile acids and drugs, including those associated with cholestatic drug-induced  injury, on OSTα/β-mediated transport was evaluated. Expression of OSTα/β was elevated in the  of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis, whereas hepatocyte expression of OSTα/β was low in control  tissue. Studies in the novel cell-based system showed rapid and linear OSTα/β-mediated transport for all tested compounds: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, digoxin, estrone sulfate, and taurocholate. The interaction study with 26 compounds revealed novel OSTα/β inhibitors: a biomarker for cholestasis, glycochenodeoxycholic ; the major metabolite of troglitazone, troglitazone sulfate; and a macrocyclic antibiotic, fidaxomicin. Additionally, some drugs (e.g., digoxin) consistently stimulated taurocholate uptake in OSTα/β-overexpressing cells. Our findings demonstrate that OSTα/β is an important transporter in  disease and imply a role for this transporter in bile -bile  and drug-bile  interactions, as well as cholestatic drug-induced  injury. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The organic solute transporter OSTα/β is highly expressed in hepatocytes of  tissue obtained from patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis. OSTα/β substrates exhibit rapid, linear, and concentration-driven transport in an OSTα/β-overexpressing cell line. Drugs associated with hepatotoxicity modulate OSTα/β-mediated taurocholate transport. These data suggest that hepatic OSTα/β plays an essential role in patients with cholestasis and may have important clinical implications for bile  and drug disposition.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22543705>Protective effects of tiopronin against high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h2><p>To study the protective effects of tiopronin against high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in rats.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a high-fat diet for 10 weeks. The rats were administered tiopronin (20 mg/kg) or a positive control drug ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA, 15 mg/kg) via gavage daily from week 5 to week 10. After the rats were sacrificed, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), free  acids (FFA), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), and  homogenate FFA, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using commercial analysis kits. The expression levels of CYP2E1 mRNA and protein were determined using RT-PCR and immunoblot assays, respectively.Tiopronin significantly lowered both the serum ALT and AST levels, while only the serum ALT level was lowered by UDCA. Tiopronin significantly decreased the serum and  levels of TG, TC and FFA as well as the serum LDL-C level, and increased the serum HDL-C level, while UDCA decreased the serum and  TC levels as well as the serum LDL-C level, but did not change the serum levels of TG, FFA and HDL-C. Tiopronin apparently ameliorated the hepatocyte degeneration and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the livers, but UDCA did not affect the pathological features of the livers. Both tiopronin and UDCA ameliorated the mitochondrial abnormality in the livers. The benefits of tiopronin were associated with increased SOD and GSH-Px activities, and with decreased MDA activity and CYP2E1 expression in the livers.Tiopronin exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in rats, which may be associated with its antioxidant properties and regulation of lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28692197>The Asia-Pacific Working Party on Non-alcoholic  Disease guidelines 2017-Part 2: Management and special groups.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864227>Obeticholic : expanding the therapeutic landscape of NASH.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470195>Microbiome: the bacterial tightrope.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22380924>Effects of cigarette smoke and ethanol intake on mouse oesophageal mucosa changes induced by dietary zinc deficiency and  supplementation.</a></h2><p>The noxious effects of dietary zinc deficiency (ZD) and  bile  (DCA) supplementation in the oesophagus were investigated.

NAFLD is a "hot potato" for pharmaceutical companies. Many clinical trials are underway to develop a first-in-class drug to treat NAFLD. However, there are several challenging issues regarding the diagnosis of NAFLD. Currently,  biopsy is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Ideally, globally recognized standards for histological diagnosis and methods to optimize observer agreement on biopsy interpretation should be developed.  biopsy is the best method rather than a perfect one. Recently, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imagery can estimate the amount of intrahepatic fat successfully and is widely used in clinical trials. But no diagnostic method can discriminate between steatohepatitis and simple steatosis. The other unresolved issue in regard to NAFLD is the absence of satisfactory treatment options.

Isomaltulose, a naturally‑occurring disaccharide, is reported to improve glucose and lipid metabolisms in obese patients. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of isomaltulose on insulin resistance and various metabolites in NAFLD patients. Five male patients with NAFLD consumed 20 g isomaltulose or sucrose (control). Changes in insulin resistance and metabolites were evaluated by alterations of serum C‑peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) and metabolomic analysis from baseline to 15 min after the administration, respectively.

The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal energy intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic fat deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high fat diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the  on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis. These results also provide an insight into interventions for the potential high-risk population of NAFLD, such as those born small or exposed to maternal undernourishment during the fetal period, with the alleviation of ER stress by dietary supplements and/or specific food including chaperones.© 2016 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29181663>Gene TNF Polymorphism -308G>A (rs1800629) and Its Relationship with the Efficiency of Ursodeoxycholic  Therapy in Patients with Nonalcoholic Stetohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Association of TNF gene polymorphism -308G>A with the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the Russian population was revealed.

In most cases of NAFLD, metabolic stress and cellular apoptosis are often driven by metabolic abnormality, eventually leading to inflammation and fibrosis . Along with a dramatic surge in the obesity epidemic, 10-20% of NAFLD patients ultimately progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a precursor to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as multi-organ systemic diseases. Currently, diet and exercise are chiefly recommended to achieve significant weight loss and improve metabolic dysfunction in patients with NAFLD. However, weight loss remains to be an elusive goal for both clinical practitioners and NAFLD patients.

In this study we examined whether AB23A protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice, and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects. NASH was induced in mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 4 weeks. The mice were simultaneously treated with AB23A (15, 30, and 60 mg·kg·d, ig) for 4 weeks. On the last day, blood samples and livers were collected. Serum  functional enzymes, inflammatoru markers were assessed. The livers were histologically examined using H&E, Oil Red O, Masson's trichrome and Sirius Red staining. Mouse primary hepatocytes were used for in vitro experiments. The mechanisms underlying AB23A protection were analyzed using siRNA, qRT-PCR, and Western blot assays. AB23A treatment significantly and dose-dependently decreased the elevated levels of serum ALT and AST in MCD diet-fed mice. Furthermore, AB23A treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic fibrosis in the mice. AB23A-induced decreases in serum and hepatic lipids were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis through decreasing hepatic levels of SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC1 and SCD1 and increased lipid metabolism via inducing PPARα, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration corresponded to deceased serum levels of mKC and MCP-1 and decreased hepatic gene expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1. The reduction in hepatic fibrosis was correlated with decreased hepatic gene expression of fibrosis markers. The protective effects of AB23A were FXR-dependent, because treatment with the FXR agonist CDCA mimicked AB23A-induced hepato-protection in the mice, whereas co-administration of FXR antagonist guggulsterone abrogated AB23A-induced hepato-protection. In mouse primary hepatocytes, FXR gene silencing abrogated AB23A-induced changes in gene expression of Apo C-II, CPT1α, ACADS and LPL.

Free  acids and bile acids promote DR5 expression. TRAIL/NK cell-mediated activation of TRAIL-R2/DR5 plays an important role during acute injury in NEMO(Δhepa) mice.To inhibit the progression of NASH in the absence of hepatocyte-NEMO/NF-kB signaling.NEMOf/f and NEMO(Δhepa) mice were fed with a low-fat diet, and with two anticholestatic diets; UDCA and NorUDCA. The impact of these treatments on the progression of NASH was evaluated.We show that high expression of DR5 in livers from NEMO(Δhepa) mice is accompanied by an abundant presence of bile acids (BAs), misregulation of BA transporters and significant alteration of lipid metabolism-related genes. Additionally, mice lacking NEMO in hepatocytes spontaneously showed ductular response at young age. Unexpectedly, feeding of NEMO(Δhepa) mice with low-fat diet failed to improve chronic  injury. Conversely, anti-cholestatic treatment with nor-ursodeoxycholic  (NorUDCA), but not with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), led to a significant attenuation of  damage in NEMO(Δhepa) mice. The strong therapeutic effect of NorUDCA relied on a significant downregulation of LXR-dependent lipogenesis and the normalisation of BA metabolism through mechanisms involving cross-talk between Cyp7a1 and SHP. This was associated with the significant improvement of  histology, NEMO(Δhepa)/NorUDCA-treated mice showed lower apoptosis and reduced CyclinD1 expression, indicating attenuation of the compensatory proliferative response to hepatocellular damage. Finally, fibrosis and ductular reaction markers were significantly reduced in NorUDCA-treated NEMO(Δhepa) mice.Overall, our work demonstrates the contribution of bile acids metabolism to the progression of NASH in the absence of hepatocyte-NF-kB through mechanisms involving DR5-apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our work suggests a potential therapeutic effect of NorUDCA in attenuating the progression of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21538633>Ursodeoxycholic  treatment of hepatic steatosis: a (13)C NMR metabolic study.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is commonly used for the treatment of hepatobiliary disorders. In this study, we tested whether a 4-week treatment with this bile  (12-15 mg/kg/day) could improve hepatic   oxidation in obese Zucker rats - a model for nonalcoholic  disease and steatosis. After 24 h of fasting, livers were perfused with physiological concentrations of [U-(13) C]nonesterified  acids and [3-(13) C]lactate/[3-(13) C]pyruvate. Steatosis was associated with abundant intracellular glucose, lactate, alanine and methionine, and low concentrations of choline and betaine. Steatotic livers also showed the highest output of glucose and lactate. Glucose and glycolytic products were mostly unlabeled, indicating active glycogenolysis and glycolysis after 24 h of fasting. UDCA treatment resulted in a general amelioration of  metabolic abnormalities with a decrease in intracellular glucose and lactate, as well as their output. Hepatic betaine and methionine were also normalized after UDCA treatment, suggesting the amelioration of anti-oxidative defenses. Choline levels were not affected by the bile , which may indicate a deficient synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins. The percentage contribution of [U-(13) C]nonesterified  acids to acetyl-coenzyme A entering the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle was significantly lower in livers from Zucker obese rats relative to control rats: 23.1 ± 4.9% versus 44.1 ± 2.7% (p < 0.01). UDCA treatment did not alter significantly   oxidation in control rats, but improved significantly oxidation in Zucker obese rats to 46.0 ± 6.1% (p > 0.05), comparable with control group values. The TCA cycle activity subsequent to   oxidation was reduced in steatotic livers and improved when UDCA was administered (0.24 ± 0.04 versus 0.37 ± 0.05, p = 0.05). We further suggest that the mechanism of action of UDCA is either related to the activity of the farnesoid receptor, or to the amelioration of the anti-oxidative defenses and cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+) /NADH) ratio, favoring TCA cycle activity and β-oxidation.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26931007>[THE CONTENT OF BILE ACIDS IN THE SERUM OF PATIENTS WITH NONALCOHOLIC  DISEASE].</a></h2><p>Rate content of primary, secondary, tertiary and unconjugated bile acids in the blood of patients with NAFLD.The study involved 74 patients with NAFLD (male--30, female--44) And 51 healthy individuals (male--14, female--37).

The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of biphenyl dimethyl dicarboxylate (DDB) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in patients with abnormal ALT.One-hundred thirty-five patients with elevated ALT were randomized to receive either 750 mg/day of DDB or 300 mg/day of UDCA for 24 weeks in 4 referral hospitals. Ninety-three (69%) patients had non-alcoholic steatohepatitits, 27 (20%) had alcoholic hepatitis, and 15 (11%) had chronic hepatitis. The primary end point was the rate of ALT normalization at week 24. The secondary endpoints were changes in AST,  stiffness, and the incidence of adverse events.A total of 101 patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. ALT normalization at week 24 was observed in 44 (80.0%) patients in DDB group and 16 (34.8%) in UDCA group (p<0.001). Higher mean reduction of ALT levels from baseline to 24 weeks was seen in DDB group compared with UDCA group (-70.0% vs. -35.9%, p<0.001). Normalization of AST level (p=0.53) and change in the  stiffness (p=0.703) were not significantly different between the two groups. Severe adverse drug reaction occurred in 1 patient in DDB group but the subject continued therapy during the study period.DDB was not inferior to UDCA for normalizing ALT level.

However, the majority of the gradient fractions (ρ= 1.05-1.07 g/mL and ρ = 1.95-1.23 g/mL) obtained from THDC-infused livers had significantly higher PDE activity compared to the control livers. The low density gradient fraction (ρ = 1.05-1.07 g/mL) which was envisaged to contain the putative vesicle population isolated from THDC-perfused livers had relatively small amounts of phospholipids and protein when compared to the relevant control fractions; however, they displayed an increase in cholesterol and PDE activity.

Obeticholic  (OCA) illustrates this limitation since its dyslipidemic effect in humans cannot be observed in these rodents. Conversely, Golden Syrian hamsters have a lipoprotein metabolism mimicking human dyslipidemia since it does express the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). We therefore developed a Diet-Induced NASH (DIN) hamster model and evaluated the impact of OCA. Compared with chow fed controls, hamsters fed for 20 weeks with a free-choice (FC) diet, developed obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and NASH (microvesicular steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal to bridging fibrosis). After 20 weeks of diet, FC fed hamsters were treated without or with obeticholic  (15mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks. Although a non-significant trend towards higher dietary caloric intake was observed, OCA significantly lowered body weight after 5 weeks of treatment. OCA significantly increased CETP activity and LDL-C levels by 20% and 27%, and reduced HDL-C levels by 20%. OCA blunted hepatic gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 and reduced fecal bile acids mass excretion by 64% (P < 0.05). Hamsters treated with OCA showed a trend towards higher scavenger receptor Class B type I (SR-BI) and lower LDL-receptor hepatic protein expression. OCA reduced NAS score for inflammation (P < 0.01) and total NAS score, although not significantly.

We hypothesize that UDCA-18:1LPE may directly inhibit the activation of immune cells. We found that UDCA-18:1LPE was capable of inhibiting the migration of phorbol ester-differentiated human THP-1 cells. We examined anti-inflammatory activity of UDCA-18:1LPE during activation of THP1-derived macrophages. Treatment of these macrophages by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. This release was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with UDCA-18:1LPE by ~ 65-90%. Derivatives with a different - chain in LPE moiety also exhibited anti-inflammatory property. Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence analyses revealed that UDCA-18:1LPE attenuated the expression of phosphorylated p38, MKK4/MKK7, JNK1/2, and c-Jun as well as nuclear translocation of NF-κB by ~ 22-86%. After LPS stimulation, the Toll-like receptor adaptor proteins, myeloid differentiation factor 88 and TNF receptor associated factor 6, were recruited into lipid rafts and UDCA-18:1LPE inhibited this recruitment by 22% and 58%, respectively. Moreover, LPS treatment caused a decrease of the known cytoprotective lysophosphatidylcholine species containing polyunsaturated  acids by 43%, and UDCA-18:1LPE co-treatment reversed this decrease. In conclusion, UDCA-18:1LPE and derivatives inhibited LPS inflammatory response by interfering with Toll-like receptor signaling in lipid rafts leading to an inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB activation.

Bile acids are produced in the  from cholesterol and metabolized in the intestine by the gut microbiota. Gut dysbiosis has been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer. However, the interplay between bile  metabolism and the gut microbiota during intestinal carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles of bile acids and the gut microbiota in the cholic  (CA; a primary bile )-induced intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Apc  mice, which spontaneously develop intestinal adenomas, were fed a diet supplemented with 0.4% CA for 12 weeks. Mice that were fed a normal diet were regarded as untreated controls. In CA-treated Apc  mice, the composition of the gut microbiota was significantly altered, and CA was efficiently transformed into  (a secondary bile ) by the bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation reaction. The intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence was observed in CA-treated Apc  mice and was accompanied by an impaired intestinal barrier function and IL-6/STAT3-related low-grade inflammation. More importantly, microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail globally compromised CA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, suggesting a leading role for the microbiota during this process. Overall, our data suggested that the crosstalk between bile acids and the gut microbiota mediated intestinal carcinogenesis, which might provide novel therapeutic strategies against intestinal tumor development.© 2019 The Authors.

Obeticholic  (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, shows promise in NASH trials. However, the precise mechanisms mediating OCA effects and impact on cholesterol metabolism are not fully understood. We explored the pharmaco-toxicological effects of OCA on patho-physiological pathways in hepatocytes using a previously described perfused organotypic  system that allows culture in near-physiological insulin/glucose milieus, and exhibits drug responses at clinically-relevant concentrations. Primary hepatocytes experienced 48-hour exposure to OCA at concentrations approximating therapeutic (0.5μM) and supratherapeutic (10μM) levels. Global transcriptomics by RNAseq was complimented by cellular viability (MTT), CYP activity assays, and secreted FGF19 levels in the media. Dose-dependent, transcriptional effects suggested suppression of bile  synthesis (↓CYP7A1, ↓CYP27A1) and increased bile efflux (↑ABCB4, ↑ABCB11, ↑OSTA, ↑OSTB). Pleiotropic effects included suppression of TGFβ and IL-6 signaling pathways, and signatures suggestive of HDL suppression (↑SCARB1, ↓ApoAI, ↓LCAT) and LDL elevation (↑ApoB, ↓CYP7A1). OCA exhibited direct FXR-mediated effects with increased FGF19 secretion. Transcriptomics revealed regulation of metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic pathways beneficial in NASH, and predicted cholesterol profiles consistent with clinical findings. Follow-up studies under lipotoxic/inflammatory conditions would corroborate these effects in a disease-relevant environment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the protective role of FXR against kidney damage induced by obesity in mice that had undergone uninephrectomy, a model resembling the clinical situation of kidney donation by obese individuals. Mice fed a high-fat diet developed the core features of metabolic syndrome, with subsequent renal lipid accumulation and renal injury, including glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and albuminuria. The effects were accentuated by uninephrectomy. In human renal biopsies, staining of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), and C/EBP-homologous protein, markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, was more prominent in the proximal tubules of 15 obese patients compared with 16 non-obese patients. In mice treated with the FXR agonist obeticholic , renal injury, renal lipid accumulation, apoptosis, and changes in lipid peroxidation were attenuated. Moreover, disturbed mitochondrial function was ameliorated and the mitochondrial respiratory chain recovered following obeticholic  treatment. Culturing renal proximal tubular cells with free   and FXR agonists showed that FXR activation protected cells from free  -induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, as denoted by a reduction in the level of reactive oxygen species staining and Grp78 immunostaining, respectively. Several genes involved in glutathione metabolism were induced by FXR activation in the remnant kidney, which was consistent with a decreased glutathione disulfide/glutathione ratio. In summary, FXR activation maintains endogenous glutathione homeostasis and protects the kidney in uninephrectomized mice from obesity-induced injury.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26692575>Long-term administration of a Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 inhibitor, ezetimibe, does not worsen bile lithogenicity in dyslipidemic patients with hepatobiliary diseases.</a></h2><p>Certain lipid-lowering drugs increase bile lithogenicity.

The lithogenic index of bile was unsaturated and unchanged in patients who were previously and concomitantly receiving ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). In patients who were not receiving UDCA, bile was initially supersaturated, but eventually was unsaturated. However, ezetimibe tended to elevate bile lithogenicity in cholecystectomy patients.Long-term treatment with ezetimibe improves lipid metabolism without significantly altering the bile lithogenicity.

Despite the need for pharmacological treatment and intense research in the field, there is currently no approved agent for NASH.There are medications shown to improve hepatic steatosis, including thiazolidinediones, vitamin E and pentoxifylline. However, hepatic fibrosis, the hard prognostic end-point for NASH, has shown little improvement with pharmaceutical intervention.

Here we evaluated the simultaneous effect of both agents on hepatic fibrogenesis in a rat model of NASH.Fischer 344 rats were fed a choline-deficient L-amino--defined (CDAA) diet for 8 weeks. The therapeutic effect of UDCA and ARB was evaluated along with hepatic fibrogenesis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) regulatory cascade, and intestinal barrier function. The direct inhibitory effect of both UDCA and ARB on Ac-HSC was assessed in vitro.Both UDCA and ARB had a potent inhibitory effect on hepatic fibrogenesis with suppression of the HSC activation and hepatic expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TLR4. UDCA decreased intestinal permeability by ameliorating zonula occuludens-1 (ZO-1) disruption induced by the CDAA diet. ARB was found to directly suppress regulation of Ac-HSC.UDCA and ARB have a synergistic repressive effect on hepatic fibrogenesis by counteracting endotoxemia induced by intestinal barrier dysfunction and suppressing the activation of Ac-HSC.

NAFLD has such an epidemic prevalence as to make it impossible to screen general population looking for NAFLD cases. Conversely, focusing on those cohorts of individuals exposed to the highest risk of NAFLD could be a more rational approach. NAFLD, which can be diagnosed with either non-invasive strategies or through  biopsy, is a pathogenically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. The existence of metabolic as opposed to genetic-associated disease, notably including "lean NAFLD" has recently been recognized. Moreover, NAFLD is a systemic condition, featuring metabolic, cardiovascular and (hepatic/extra-hepatic) cancer risk. Among the clinico-laboratory features of NAFLD we discuss hyperuricemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, gallstones, psoriasis and selected endocrine derangements. NAFLD is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome and progressive  disease develops in T2D patients in whom the course of disease is worsened by NAFLD. Finally, lifestyle changes and drug treatment options to be implemented in the individual patient are also critically discussed. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the new concepts on clinical and pathogenic heterogeneity of NAFLD, a systemic disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis and protean clinical manifestations. It is highly prevalent in certain cohorts of individuals who are thus potentially amenable to selective screening strategies, intensive follow-up schedules for early identification of -related and extrahepatic complications and in whom earlier and more aggressive treatment schedules should be carried out whenever possible.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24053454>The role of ursodeoxycholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a systematic review.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition that occurs during the progression of non-alcoholic  disease.

In this study, we investigated the effects of Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) in the treatment of NASH.Western and Chinese databases were searched by independent investigators using appropriate MESH headings to identify randomized, controlled Western and Chinese clinical trials, published between January 1990 and October 2012, testing the effects of UDCA in patients with NASH. Patient characteristics and trial endpoints were analyzed, with quality assessment according to widely acknowledged criteria. P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant in all trials.Twelve qualified randomized clinical trials, including six from China and involving 1160 subjects, were selected. Seven of these trials assessed the effects of UDCA Monotherapy, with the other five testing combinations of UDCA with vitamin E, polyene phosphatidylcholine, silymarin, glycyrrhizin and tiopronin. The duration of therapy ranged from 3 to 24 months, with two studies using high doses of UDCA (23-35 mg/kg/d).

One study of high-dose UDCA showed significant improvements in ALT, γGT and  fibrosis, whereas the other study showed no significant change in ALT and  pathology.UDCA therapy is effective in NASH, especially when combined with other drugs.

We previously demonstrated that  (DCA), a cytotoxic bile  implicated in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic  disease, inhibits miR-21 expression in hepatocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which DCA modulates miR-21 and whether miR-21 contributes for DCA-induced cytotoxicity. DCA inhibited miR-21 expression in primary rat hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and increased miR-21 pro-apoptotic target programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and apoptosis. Both miR-21 overexpression and PDCD4 silencing hampered DCA-induced cell death. Further, DCA decreased NF-κB activity, shown to represent an upstream mechanism leading to modulation of the miR-21/PDCD4 pathway. In fact, NF-κB overexpression or constitutive activation halted miR-21-dependent apoptosis by DCA while opposite results were observed upon NF-κB inhibition. In turn, DCA-induced oxidative stress resulted in caspase-2 activation and NF-κB/miR-21 inhibition, in a PIDD-dependent manner. Finally, modulation of the NF-κB/miR-21/PDCD4 pro-apoptotic pathway by DCA was also shown to occur in the rat  in vivo. These signalling circuits may constitute appealing targets for bile -associated  pathologies.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486698>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as a novel player in metabolic syndrome-induced erectile dysfunction: an experimental study in the rabbit.</a></h2><p>A pathogenic link between erectile dysfunction (ED) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) is now well established. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the hepatic hallmark of MetS, is regarded as an active player in the pathogenesis of MetS-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study was aimed at evaluating the relationship between MetS-induced NASH and penile dysfunction. We used a non-genomic, high fat diet (HFD)-induced, rabbit model of MetS, and treated HFD rabbits with testosterone (T), with the selective farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic  (OCA), or with the anti-TNFα mAb infliximab. Rabbits fed a regular diet were used as controls.  histomorphological and gene expression analysis demonstrated NASH in HFD rabbits. Several genes related to inflammation (including TNFα), activation of stellate cells, fibrosis, and lipid metabolism parameters were negatively associated to maximal acetylcholine (Ach)-induced relaxation in penis. When all these putative  determinants of penile Ach responsiveness were tested as covariates in a multivariate model, only the association between hepatic TNFα expression and Ach response was confirmed. Accordingly, circulating levels of TNFα were increased 15-fold in HFD rabbits. T and OCA dosing in HFD rabbits both reduced TNFα  expression and plasma levels, with a parallel increase of penile eNOS expression and responsiveness to Ach. Also neutralization of TNFα with infliximab treatment fully normalized HFD-induced hypo-responsiveness to Ach, as well as responsiveness to vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor. Thus, MetS-induced NASH in HFD rabbits plays an active role in the pathogenesis of ED, likely through TNFα, as indicated by treatments reducing  and circulating TNFα levels (T or OCA), or neutralizing TNFα action (infliximab), which significantly improve penile responsiveness to Ach in HFD rabbits.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The exact mechanisms behind these effects are not yet fully understood. Lately, they have come to the fore as putative therapeutics in metabolic diseases, such as e.g. nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). We elucidate to what extent BAs impacts on the mRNAome and microRNAome in hepatocytes to gather novel insights into the mechanisms behind metabolic and toxicologic effects of bile acids.Five batches of primary human hepatocytes were treated with 50μmol/l chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) for 24 or 48h. Total RNA was extracted, size fractionated and subjected to Next Generation Sequencing to generate mRNA and miRNA profiles.Expression of 738 genes and 52 miRNAs were CDCA dependently decreased, whereas 1566 genes and 29 miRNAs were significantly increased in hepatocytes. Distinct gene clusters controlling BA and lipid homeostasis (FGF(R), APO and FABP family members, HMGCS2) and drug metabolism (CYP, UGT and SULT family members) were significantly modulated by CDCA. Importantly, CDCA affected distinct microRNAs, including miR-34a, -505, -885, -1260 and -552 that systematically correlated in expression with gene clusters responsible for bile , lipid and drug homeostasis incorporating genes, such as e.g. SLCO1B1, SLC22A7, FGF19, CYP2E1, CYP1A2, APO family members and FOXO3.Bile acids significantly modulate metabolic and drug associated gene networks that are connected to distinct shifts in the microRNAome These findings give novel insights on how BA enfold metabolic and system toxic effects.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

Obeticholic  (OCA) improves steatosis in patients but for unknown reasons does not resolve NASH pathology. This study therefore investigated OCA effects in Wt mice, which develop obesity with atherogenic dietary feeding, and appetite-dysregulated, Alms1 mutant foz/foz mice fed the same diet, which develop metabolic obesity and diabetes.OCA (1 mg/kg) was administered orally to female foz/foz mice and Wt littermates from weaning until 28 weeks. Adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and  pathology were studied. Experiments were repeated with OCA 10 mg/kg.OCA reduced body weight and hepatic lipids and improved glucose disposal only in Wt mice. OCA limited Wt adipose expansion, altered morphometry in favor of small adipocytes, enhanced expression of genes indicating adipose browning, and reduced crown-like structure number in visceral adipose tissue. foz/foz mice showed more crown-like structures in all compartments; OCA failed to alter adipose morphometry, browning, inflammation, or improve NASH severity, even at 10 mg/kg.OCA improved adipose indices, glucose tolerance, and steatosis in a milder metabolic phenotype but failed to improve these factors in morbidly obese diabetic mice.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on  injury caused by co-administration with isoniazid and rifampicin, two famous antitubercular drugs.  injury was induced by co-treatment with isoniazid (75mg/kg) and rifampicin (150mg/kg) for one week. Mice were orally administered with UDCA (15, 50 and 150mg/kg) 30min before isoniazid and rifampicin. We show that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly increased in mice treated with isoniazid plus rifampicin. An obvious  accumulation, accompanied by mild necrosis and inflammation, was observed in  of mice treated with rifampicin plus isoniazid. In addition, isoniazid plus rifampicin resulted in hepatic apoptosis, as determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 activation. Additional experiment showed that isoniazid plus rifampicin significantly increased the level of hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and caused glutathione (GSH) depletion and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) residues in . UDCA pretreatment significantly attenuated isoniazid plus rifampicin induced oxidative stress in . Importantly, UDCA pretreatment significantly alleviated isoniazid plus rifampicin induced hepatic apoptosis. Moreover, UDCA-mediated anti-apoptotic effect seemed to be associated with its regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression in .

Since the FXR receptor regulates adipose cell function and  lipid metabolism, the aim of this work was to examine the effects of the FXR agonist 6ECDCA on alcoholic  steatosis development and on oxidative stress induced by ethanol consumption.Swiss mice (n=24) received a low-protein diet (6%) and a liquid diet containing 10% ethanol or water for 6weeks. In the last 15days mice received oral treatment with 6ECDCA (3mgkg(-1)) or 1% tween (vehicle). The experimental groups (n=6) were: water+tween, water+6ECDCA, ethanol+tween and ethanol+6ECDCA. Moreover, as a diet control, we used a basal group (n=6), fed by a normal-proteic diet (23%) and water. After the treatment period, the animals were anesthetized for sample collection to perform plasma biochemistry assays, hepatic oxidative stress assays, hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides measurements,  histology and hepatic gene expression.Ethanol associated with low-protein diet induced hepatic oxidative stress, increased plasma transaminases and induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Many of these parameters were reversed by the administration of 6ECDCA, including amelioration of lipid accumulation and lipoperoxidation, and reduction of reactive oxygen species. These effects were possibly mediated by regulation of Srebpf1 and FAS gene expression, both reduced by the FXR agonist.Our data demonstrated that 6ECDCA reverses the accumulation of lipids in the  and decreases the oxidative stress induced by ethanol and low-protein diet.

Prior to treatment, all mice underwent  biopsy for confirmation and stratification of  steatosis and fibrosis, using the nonalcoholic  disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis staging system. The mice were kept on the diet and received vehicle, liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg, SC, BID), obeticholic  (OCA, 30 mg/kg PO, QD), or elafibranor (30 mg/kg PO, QD) for eight weeks. Within-subject comparisons were performed on changes in steatosis, inflammation, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis scores. In addition, compound effects were evaluated by quantitative  histology, including percent fractional area of  fat, galectin-3, and collagen 1a1.Liraglutide and elafibranor, but not OCA, reduced body weight in both models. Liraglutide improved steatosis scores in DIO-NASH mice only. Elafibranor and OCA reduced histopathological scores of hepatic steatosis and inflammation in both models, but only elafibranor reduced fibrosis severity. Liraglutide and OCA reduced total  fat, collagen 1a1, and galectin-3 content, driven by significant reductions in  weight. The individual drug effects on NASH histological endpoints were supported by global gene expression (RNA sequencing) and  lipid biochemistry.DIO-NASH and -NASH mouse models show distinct treatment effects of liraglutide, OCA, and elafibranor, being in general agreement with corresponding findings in clinical trials for NASH.

Mice were fed an HFD to induce NAFLD and then treated with the FXR ligand obeticholic  (OCA). Histology and gene expression analyses were performed on  tissue. Eicosanoid levels were measured from serum and urine samples. The molecular mechanism underlying the effect of FXR activation on arachidonic  metabolism and NF-kB signaling was studied in human  Huh7 cells and primary cultured hepatocytes. NAFLD was characterized by higher (∼25%) proinflammatory [leukotrienes (LTB)] and lower (∼3-fold) anti-inflammatory [epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)] eicosanoid levels than in chow mice. OCA induced the expression of several hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) epoxygenases, the enzymes responsible for EET synthesis, and mitigated HFD-induced hepatic injury. In vitro, induction of CYP450 epoxygenases was sufficient to inhibit NF-kB signaling and cell migration. The CYP450 epoxygenase pan-inhibitor gemfibrozil fully abolished the protective effect of OCA, indicating that OCA-mediated inhibition of NF-kB signaling was EET-dependent. In summary, NAFLD was characterized by an imbalance in arachidonate metabolism. FXR activation reprogramed arachidonate metabolism by inducing P450 epoxygenase expression and EET production. In vitro, FXR-mediated NF-kB inhibition required active P450 epoxygenases.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21216209>[ and its clinical management in obese adolescents].</a></h2><p> steatosis, also called non-alcoholic , is characterized by a pathological fat accumulation in the , leading to  damage in the form of inflammation and fibrosis.

Hepatic steatosis was assessed at baseline and after 72 weeks of obeticholic  or placebo by  biopsy and MRI (scanners from different manufacturers, at 1.5T or 3T). We compared steatosis estimates by PDFF vs histology. Histologic steatosis grade was scored in consensus by a pathology committee. Cross-validated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed.At baseline, 34% of subjects had steatosis grade 0 or 1, 39% had steatosis grade 2, and 27% had steatosis grade 3; corresponding mean PDFF values were 9.8%±3.7%, 18.1%±4.3%, and 30.1%±8.1%. PDFF classified steatosis grade 0-1 vs 2-3 with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98), and grade 0-2 vs grade 3 steatosis with an AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). PDFF cut-off values at 90% specificity were 16.3% for grades 2-3 and 21.7% for grade 3, with corresponding sensitivities of 83% and 84%. After 72 weeks' of obeticholic vs placebo, 42% of subjects had a reduced steatosis grade (mean reduction in PDFF from baseline of 7.4%±8.7%), 49% had no change in steatosis grade (mean increase in PDFF from baseline of 0.3%±6.3%), and 9% had an increased steatosis grade (mean increase in PDFF from baseline of 7.7%±6.0%). PDFF change identified subjects with reduced steatosis grade with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.91) and increased steatosis grade with an AUROC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.63-0.99). A PDFF reduction of 5.15% identified subjects with reduced steatosis grade with 90% specificity and 58% sensitivity, whereas a PDFF increase of 5.6% identified those with increased steatosis grade with 90% specificity and 57% sensitivity.Based on data from a phase 2 randomized controlled trial of adults with NASH, PDFF estimated by MRI scanners of different field strength and at different sites, accurately classifies grades and changes in hepatic steatosis when histologic analysis of biopsies is used as a reference.Copyright © 2017 AGA Institute.

We examined whether tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a known inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, protects steatotic and nonsteatotic  grafts preserved during 6 h in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and transplanted. The protective mechanisms of TUDCA were also examined. Neither unfolded protein response (UPR) induction nor ER stress was evidenced in steatotic and nonsteatotic  grafts after 6 h in UW preservation solution. TUDCA only protected steatotic livers grafts and did so through a mechanism independent of ER stress. It reduced proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and damage. When PPARγ was activated, TUDCA did not reduce damage. TUDCA, which inhibited PPARγ, and the PPARγ antagonist treatment up-regulated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), specifically the TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFNβ (TRIF) pathway. TLR4 agonist treatment reduced damage in steatotic  grafts. When TLR4 action was inhibited, PPARγ antagonists did not protect steatotic  grafts. In conclusion, TUDCA reduced PPARγ and this in turn up-regulated the TLR4 pathway, thus protecting steatotic  grafts.

To this end, stable cell lines expressing   transporters as well as primary hepatocytes from mouse and human livers were incubated with primary and secondary bile acids to determine their effects on LCFA uptake rates.

Both UDCA and DCA were able to inhibit LCFA uptake by primary hepatocytes in a FATP5-dependent manner. Subsequently, mice were treated with these secondary bile acids in vivo to assess their ability to inhibit diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Administration of DCA in vivo via injection or as part of a high-fat diet significantly inhibited hepatic   uptake and reduced  triglycerides by more than 50%.The data demonstrate a novel role for specific bile acids, and the secondary bile  DCA in particular, in the regulation of hepatic LCFA uptake.

There is a reported but poorly understood link between ER stress, autophagy, and cell death. We hypothesized that autophagy plays a role in ER stress-dependent cell death in rat hepatocytes.Primary hepatocytes isolated from both lean and obese male Zucker rats were cultured and treated with tunicamycin (TM), tauroursodeoxycholic , 3-methyladenine, and wortmannin for 12 h. The ER stress-associated genes glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein were examined via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. Immunostaining with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 as well as electron microscopy were used to evaluate autophagy activity. Trypan blue exclusion was used to determine hepatocyte cell viability.In both lean and steatotic hepatocytes, we found that TM induced both C/EBP homologous protein and glucose-regulated protein 78 messenger RNA expression. Cells with increased ER stress were undergoing increased autophagy and had a significant decrease in cell viability. Both tauroursodeoxycholic  and 3-methyladenine treatments attenuated TM induced ER stress, autophagy, and cell death, whereas wortmannin treatment reduced autophagy and cell death but without changing ER stress.These data suggest that autophagy is a likely downstream mediator of ER stress-induced cell death in rat hepatocytes.

Activation of FXR lowers plasma triacylglycerols and glucose levels through a mechanism that involves both the repression of key regulatory genes in the  and the modulation of insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. In the present study we have investigated whether administering obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats, a genetic model of obesity associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, with an FXR ligand protects against lipid-induced cardiomyopathy.FXR is expressed in neonatal cardiomyocytes and the treatment with FXR agonists, chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and GW4064, increased the mRNA expression of FXR and its canonical target gene, the small heterodimer partner (SHP), as well as proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARα, acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK-4). Feeding obese fa/fa rats with CDCA, 12 weeks, reduced hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidaemia. The histological-pathological analysis of hearts demonstrated that treatment with the FXR ligand reduced lipid heart content decreased the rate of apoptosis, fibrosis scores and restored heart insulin signalling. Chronic CDCA administration, in the heart, induced PPARα and PPARα-regulated genes involved in β-oxidation.FXR agonism exerts beneficial effects in a genetic model of lipid-induced cardiomyopathy.

Since it is unknown if βMCA has beneficial effects on hepatocyte cell death we determined the effect of tauro-βMCA (TβMCA) on apoptosis in vitro.Human Ntcp-transfected HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes from rat and mouse were incubated with the proapoptotic glycochenodeoxycholic  (GCDCA) as well as the free   palmitate in the absence and presence of TβMCA. Apoptosis was quantified using caspase 3/7-assays and after Hoechst 33342 staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured fluorometrically using JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazol-carbocyaniniodide). Immunoblotting was performed against the proapoptotic Bcl-2-protein Bax.In Ntcp-HepG2 cells, GCDCA markedly increased apoptosis after 4h. Co-incubation with TβMCA reduced apoptosis to 49% (p<0.01 vs. GCDCA, each; n=6). While GCDCA (100μmol/L) reduced the MMP to 34% after 6h, combination treatment with TβMCA restored the MMP to control levels at all time points (n=4). TβMCA also restored breakdown of the MMP induced by palmitate. GCDCA induced a translocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria that was inhibited by simultaneous treatment with TβMCA in eqimolar concentrations.TβMCA restricts hepatocellular apoptosis induced by low micromolar concentrations of GCDCA or palmitate via inhibition of Bax translocation to mitochondria and preservation of the MMP. Thus, further studies are warranted to evaluate a potential use of TβMCA in ameliorating  injury in cholestasis.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High fat diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic lipid extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated  acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and oleic . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated  acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of arachidonic  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of   oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal   oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective   metabolism during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered lipid profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects.

We performed a secondary analysis of data from this trial to identify clinical parameters associated with a histologic response.We used a logistic regression model with a stepwise selection procedure to identify baseline and early on-treatment factors associated with a histologic response at 72 weeks. Baseline demographics,  histology, medical history, concomitant medications, cardiometabolic parameters, and serum biochemistry, as well as the changes over the course of the trial (at weeks 12 and 24), were evaluated as potential predictors of a histologic response. The model was cross-validated by a jackknife method, and performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.The logistic regression model found that obeticholic  treatment, baseline NAS > 5, baseline triglyceride level ≤ 154 mg/dL, baseline international normalized ratio ≤ 1, baseline aspartate aminotransferase level ≤ 49 U/L, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level at week 24 by 17 U/L or more, to be significantly associated with histologic response (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.89; P < .0001).In a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial of obeticholic  in patients with NASH, we identified routine clinical and laboratory parameters during the first 24 weeks of treatment (such as baseline NAS, triglyceride levels, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase level) to significantly associate with histologic markers of response.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Experiments were designed to test the following hypotheses: (1) therapeutic effects of ω3PUFA are due to attenuation of cellular apoptosis induced by hydrophobic bile  exposure, which occurs in cholestasis, and (2) attenuation of apoptosis by EPA and DHA is additive or synergistic.Cultured HepG2 cells were treated with 50-200 µM chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in the presence and absence of EPA, DHA, or EPA + DHA. Apoptosis was evaluated using cell staining with fluorescence microscopy and the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 assay. Specific apoptotic mediators were evaluated with quantitative RT-PCR.Treatment with EPA alone and DHA alone resulted in 22% and 9% attenuation of caspase-3/7 activity, respectively. Caspase-3/7 activity was attenuated by 52% when cells were treated with a combination of EPA and DHA (P = .0034). Treatment with EPA alone, DHA alone, and the combination of EPA and DHA all resulted in equal attenuation of apoptotic mediator gene expression.The combination of EPA and DHA resulted in a synergistic attenuation of bile -induced hepatocellular apoptosis, as assessed by caspase-3/7 activity, compared to EPA and DHA separately. The combination of EPA and DHA did not result in a synergistic attenuation of the upregulation of Fas or TRAIL-R2. These data suggest that EPA and DHA may be working via multiple intracellular pathways to attenuate bile -induced apoptosis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30912732>Ingestion of difructose anhydride III partially suppresses the deconjugation and 7α-dehydroxylation of bile acids in rats fed with a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Difructose anhydride III (DFAIII) is a prebiotic involved in the reduction of secondary bile acids (BAs).

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) versus vitamin E plus vitamin C in non-diabetic patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Patients with elevated aminotransferase levels and drinking, less than 40 g alcohol/week with NASH diagnose were randomly assigned to receive either UDCA 15 mg/per kg/day (group A) or vitamin E 800mg/day plus vitamin C 500 mg/day (group B) for 12 months and control group,which did not receive any medical treatment. Lifestyle modification was advised to all groups. The primary study endpoint was improvement in alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, secondary endpoints were improvement in steatosis score and improvement in fibrosis score. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between groups. After 12 months treatment with vitamin E plus C, as compared with UDCA, was associated with a significant reduction ofmean alanineaminotransferase (ALT) levels. Similarly, there was significant reduction of both mean steatosis score and fibrosis score.

As an experimental approach for treatment of NAFLD, we synthesized the bile -phospholipid conjugate ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE). Previous work demonstrated profound hepatoprotective properties of the conjugate in vitro and in vivo. Here we investigated the effects of UDCA-LPE in two nutritional mouse models of NAFLD. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 28 weeks, resulting in steatosis with hyperlipidemia. In a second model, mice received a methionin-choline-deficient (MCD) diet for up to 11 weeks, which induced advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Establishment of  injury was followed by intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg/kg UDCA-LPE three times a week for different time periods. UDCA-LPE ameliorated both HFD- and MCD-induced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values near to normalization. As for metabolic parameters, UDCA-LPE reduced elevated serum triglyceride and cholesterol values in HFD mice.  histology showed improvement of steatosis in HFD and MCD mice concomitant with reductions in hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Additionally, the conjugate lowered serum caspase-8 activity in both models and decreased lipid hydroperoxides in MCD mice. Abundance of proinflammatory lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which was detectable in both HFD and MCD mice, was reduced by UDCA-LPE. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction qRT-PCR of  specimens revealed that UDCA-LPE strongly down-regulated inflammatory genes and modified the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.The current study demonstrates that UDCA-LPE improves hepatic injury at different stages of NAFLD. By concurrently lowering hepatic lipid overloading as well as susceptibility of hepatocytes toward inflammatory stimuli, the conjugate may be able to ameliorate disease progression. Thus, UDCA-LPE represents a promising compound suitable for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27548081>Treatment of Non-Alcoholic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of conditions from steatosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Steatosis is a benign reversible condition, which does not need treatment. Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are the end stages of any chronic  disease and do not have etiology-specific treatments. In this chapter, we will review treatment options for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which is the progressive form of NAFLD. Basically there are 2 strategies, the first of which is to address lifestyle and the second to use medication. The first approach is the most physiologic, the least expensive, but is also the most difficult to implement. The second approach, which should help patients who failed the first approach, is at the advanced clinical research stage.© 2016 S.

The bile--activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile , lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses, barrier function and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in physiology of the digestive system and the related diseases.

Steatotic livers show impaired regenerative response and reduced tolerance to hepatic injury. We examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) and 4-phenyl butyric  (PBA) in steatotic and non-steatotic livers during partial hepatectomy under I/R (PH+I/R). Their effects on the induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were also evaluated. We report that PBA, and especially TUDCA, reduced inflammation, apoptosis and necrosis, and improved  regeneration in both  types. Both compounds, especially TUDCA, protected both  types against ER damage, as they reduced the activation of two of the three pathways of UPR (namely inositol-requiring enzyme and PKR-like ER kinase) and their target molecules caspase 12, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and C/EBP homologous protein-10. Only TUDCA, possibly mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase upregulation, inactivated glycogen synthase kinase-3β. This is turn, inactivated mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel, reduced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and caspase 9 activation and protected both  types against mitochondrial damage. These findings indicate that chemical chaperones, especially TUDCA, could protect steatotic and non-steatotic livers against injury and regeneration failure after PH+I/R.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214981>[EFFICIENCY OF URSODEOXYCHOLIC  APPLICATION IN NONALCOCHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS].</a></h2><p>to estimate the efficiency of ursodeoxycholic  (UDHC) in nonalcocholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by analysis of conventional clinical datas, apoptosis and  perfusion parameters.UDHC was used as monotherapy in treatment of 92 NASH patients in daily dose 10-15 mg/kg.

The primary outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis. We reported relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05-1.00) and obeticholic  (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic  over placebo in improving ballooning degeneration.

Many therapeutic options for NASH have been studied. However, there is very little evidence supporting the efficacy of most regimens for the treatment of NASH.To provide a review focusing on the current therapeutic options available for patients with NASH as well as to briefly introduce possible future interventions.A MEDLINE, Pubmed and Cochrane Review database search using a combination of keywords, which included non-alcoholic  disease, non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, NAFLD, NASH, treatment, therapeutics, vitamin E, orlistat and bariatric surgery. An overall summary of the articles was developed for each section of discussion in this review.NASH associated with metabolic syndrome can progress advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Weight loss and lifestyle modification have been shown to improve NASH. Other medications used for weight loss and metabolic syndrome have been evaluated, such as orlistat, metformin and thiazolidinediones. Alternative regimens using ursodeoxycholic , statins and probiotics as well as bariatric surgery have been evaluated, but have not been recommended as first-line treatment for NASH. Vitamin E for NASH patients without diabetes seems to be promising. The lack of effective treatment for NASH suggests the heterogeneity of patients presenting with the NASH phenotype.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms linking obesity and cancer are not fully understood yet. Recently, we have reported that dietary or genetic obesity provokes alterations of gut microbiota profile, thereby increasing the levels of  (DCA), a secondary bile  produced solely by the 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by gut bacteria. The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes DNA damage and consequent cellular senescence in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which, in turn, secrete various inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors in the , thus facilitating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Interestingly, signs of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, implying that a similar pathway is likely to contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well.

The modulation of gut microbiota, bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut microbiota, bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

Hence, accumulation of lipids in the  is considered to be one of the risk factors for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is widely used for the treatment of  dysfunction. We investigated the therapeutic effects of UDCA on type 2 diabetes mellitus exacerbating hepatic steatosis and the underlying mechanisms of its action using KK-A(y) mice fed a high-fat diet. KK-A(y) mice were prefed a high-fat diet; and 50, 150, and 450 mg/kg of UDCA was orally administered for 2 or 3 weeks. Administration of UDCA decreased fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analyses showed that UDCA improved hepatic (but not peripheral) insulin resistance. Hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents were significantly reduced by treatment with UDCA, although the genes involved in the synthesis of  acids and cholesterol, including   synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, were upregulated. Fecal levels of bile acids, neutral sterols,  acids, and phospholipids were significantly increased by UDCA treatment. The gene expression levels and protein phosphorylation levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers were not changed by UDCA treatment. These results indicate that UDCA ameliorates hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia by improving hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis in high-fat diet-fed KK-A(y) mice. Reduction of hepatic lipids might be due to their excretion in feces, followed by enhanced utilization of glucose for the synthesis of  acids and cholesterol.

On the Chol+/CA diet, the wild-type (WT) mice had levels of aortic lesions and hypercholesterolemia similar to those of DKO mice but had no intestinal pathology. The diet-associated inflammatory responses in the DKO mice included increased colonic proinflammatory serum amyloid A3 expression, plasma lipopolysaccharide, and TNF-α levels. The Chol+/CA diet lowered the expression of the unfolded protein response genes ATF6, CHOP, unspliced Xbp(U) , and Grp78/Bip, in WT and DKO mice compared with mice on the Chol- diet.We concluded that a cholesterol diet weakens the colon unfolded protein response, which can aggravate spontaneous colitis, leading to gut barrier breakdown.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated   (omega-3) has been reported to alleviate experimental NASH, although its beneficial effect was not evident when tested clinically. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the additive effect of omega-3 and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) on diet-induced NASH in mice. C57BL/6 mice were given a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks, at which point the mice were divided into three groups and fed HFD alone, HFD with omega-3 or HFD with omega-3 in combination with UDCA for another 24 weeks. Feeding mice an HFD and administering omega-3 improved histologically assessed  fibrosis, and UDCA in combination with omega-3 further attenuated this disease. The assessment of collagen α1(I) expression agreed with the histological evaluation. Omega-3 in combination with UDCA resulted in a significant attenuation of inflammation whereas administering omega-3 alone failed to improve histologically assessed  inflammation. Quantitative analysis of tumor necrosis factor α showed an additive effect of omega-3 and UDCA on  inflammation. HFD-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation was attenuated by omega-3 and adding UDCA accentuated this effect. In accordance with this result, the expression of sterol regulatory binding protein-1c decreased after omega-3 administration and adding UDCA further diminished SREBP-1c expression. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which may reflect oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, was suppressed by omega-3 administration and adding UDCA further attenuated iNOS expression.

We hypothesized that a combination of ursodiol (Urso) and ezetimibe (EZ) could increase biliary secretion and reduce cholesterol reabsorption, respectively, to promote cholesterol excretion. Treatment with Urso increased hepatic ABCG5 ABCG8 (G5G8) protein and both biliary and fecal sterols in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether the drug combination (Urso-EZ) further increased cholesterol excretion, mice were treated with Urso alone or in combination with two doses of EZ. EZ produced an additive and dose-dependent increase in fecal neutral sterol (FNS) elimination in the presence of Urso. Finally, we sequentially treated wide-type and G5G8-deficient mice with Urso and Urso-EZ to determine the extent to which these effects were G5G8 dependent. Although biliary and FNS were invariably lower in G5G8 KO mice, the relative increase in FNS following treatment with Urso alone or the Urso-EZ combination was not affected by genotype. In conclusion, Urso increases G5G8, biliary cholesterol secretion, and FNS and acts additively with EZ to promote fecal sterol excretion. However, the stimulatory effect of these agents was not G5G8 dependent.Copyright © 2015 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388096>Circulating microbiota-derived metabolites: a "liquid biopsy?</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) causes a wide spectrum of  damage, from simple steatosis (SS) to cirrhosis.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between microbiota-derived metabolites and the degrees of NAFLD; also, to investigate whether these metabolites could be included in a panel of NASH biomarkers.We used liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole-mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ) analysis to quantify choline and its derivatives, betaine, endogenous ethanol, bile acids, short-chain  acids and soluble TLR4 in serum from women with normal weight (n = 29) and women with morbid obesity (MO) (n = 82) with or without NAFLD. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to evaluate the hepatic and intestinal expression level of all genes studied (TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, LXRα, SREBP1C, ACC1, FAS, PPARα, CPT1α, CROT, SREBP2, ABCA1, ABCG1 and FXR in the ; TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR9, GLP-1R, DPP-4, FXR and PPARɣ in the jejunum) in 82 women with MO with normal  histology (NL, n = 29), SS (n = 32), and NASH (n = 21).Hepatic FAS, TLR2, and TLR4 expression were overexpressed in NAFLD patients. TLR2 was overexpressed in NASH patients. In women with MO with NAFLD, we found upregulation of intestinal TLR9 expression and downregulation of intestinal FXR expression in women with NASH. Circulating TMAO, glycocholic  and  levels were significantly increased in NAFLD patients. Endogenous circulating ethanol levels were increased in NASH patients in comparison to those in SS patients.These findings suggest that the intestine participates in the progression of NAFLD. Moreover, levels of certain circulating microbiota-related metabolites are associated with NAFLD severity and could be used as a "liquid biopsy" in the noninvasive diagnosis of NASH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027487>Effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  on PUFA levels and inflammation in an animal and cell model of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

Necroinflammation was evaluated in  sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein. Arachidonic  (C20:4n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3) in  tissue and THLE-3 cells were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured in tissue and cell samples. Hepatic ER stress was accomplished by TM and was alleviated by TUDCA. TM treatment significantly decreased PUFAs in both  and THLE-3 cells compared to controls.

Glycyrrhizin (GL), extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine liquorice, has potent hepatoprotective effects in both preclinical animal models and in humans. However, little is currently known about its effects and mechanisms in treating NASH. To explore the effects of GL on NASH, GL or its active metabolite glycyrrhetinic  (GA) was administered to mice treated with a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model, and histologic and biochemical analyses were used to measure the degree of lipid disruption,  inflammation, and fibrosis. GL significantly improved MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis and inhibited activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. GL significantly attenuated serum bile  accumulation in MCD diet-fed mice partially by restoring inflammation-mediated hepatic farnesoid X receptor inhibition. In Raw 264.7 macrophage cells, both GL and GA inhibited -induced NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation. Notably, both intraperitoneal injection of GL's active metabolite GA and oral administration of GL prevented NASH in mice, indicating that GL may attenuate NASH via its active metabolite GA. These results reveal that GL, via restoration of bile  homeostasis and inhibition of inflammatory injury, can be a therapeutic option for treatment of NASH.U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28892150>Hepatic inflammation caused by dysregulated bile  synthesis is reversible by butyrate supplementation.</a></h2><p>Dysregulated bile  (BA) synthesis or reduced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) levels are found in patients having metabolic diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, and  cirrhosis or cancer. The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the  pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and  tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes, microbiota profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human  cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice. Microbiota transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

Due to our incomplete understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease, the therapeutic options are still rather limited. Bile acids play a key role in mediating cholangiocellular and hepatocellular injury in cholangiopathies such as PSC. Therefore, strategies targeting bile composition and homeostasis are valid approaches in PSC. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the paradigm therapeutic bile  and its role in medical therapy of PSC is still under debate. Promising novel bile -based therapeutic options include 24-norursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA), a side chain-shortened C23 homologue of UDCA, and bile  receptor/farnesoid X receptor agonists (e.g. obeticholic ). Other nuclear receptors such as  -activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, vitamin D receptor and vitamin A receptors (retinoic  receptor, retinoid X receptor) are also of potential interest and can be targeted by already available drugs. Furthermore, drugs targeting the gut- axis (e.g. intregrin blockers such as vedolizumab, antibiotics) appear promising, based on the close link of PSC to inflammatory bowel disease and the emerging relevance of the gut microbiome for the development of PSC. Finally, fibrosis represents a valid therapeutic target for anti-fibrotic drugs (e.g. simtuzumab) in PSC as paradigm fibro-obliterative disease. This review summarizes the current status and recent progress in the development of targeted therapeutic approaches based on increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of this disease.© 2015 S.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and may reduce  injury in NASH. To date, no studies have assessed the efficacy of UDCA in carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), serum lipids, apolipoprotein A1 (apo A), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and apolipoprotein B/A1 (apo B/A1) ratios in patients with NASH.In this prospective study, 30 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and 25 healthy adults as a control group were evaluated. None of the participants had diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Patients with NASH received UDCA 15 mg/kg/day for 6 months. BMI, waist circumference, homeostasis model assessment, lipids, apo A1, apo B, apo B/A1 ratios, and CIMT were analyzed before and after the treatment period.At the end of the study, there were no statistically significant changes in BMI or waist circumference.  enzymes decreased gradually. The homeostasis model assessment decreased from 3.4 ± 1.89 to 2.06 ± 1.68 (P < 0.001). No significant changes in the mean triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, or apo B levels were observed. The mean high-density lipoprotein (42.9 ± 7.1 vs. 45.5 ± 9.8; P = 0.037) and apo A1 (127.6 ± 17.7 vs. 135.9 ± 22.2; P = 0.02) increased significantly.

On paper, it has had an impeccable track record of cytoprotection in vitro and in vivo due to its pleiotropic effects on many pathways leading to cell injury. Most of its hepatoprotective effects demonstrated under experimental conditions proved able to counteract pathogenic mechanisms involved in the transition from steatosis to steatohepatitis, and early clinical studies suggested a potentially beneficial effect in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well. Yet, only scant data on the efficacy of UDCA specifically in experimental models of steatosis/NASH are available, and the few available randomized controlled clinical studies have substantial methodological issues and are discussed in this review. Thus, at this point, there is not enough evidence to either confirm or reject the efficacy of UDCA in NASH, although many NASH patients clearly experience biochemical improvements with prolonged UDCA treatment. Also, a few new UDCA derivatives have shown promising activity in preclinical models and may be worth testing in clinical trials.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Eight-week-old ob/ob mice exhibited marked obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and fasting hyperglycemia. Administration of both CA and UDCA was associated to decreased hepatic triglyceride content and complete reversion of histological steatosis. BA-fed animals did not exhibit significant differences in glucose tolerance. In addition, neither CA nor UDCA administration significantly influenced portal or systemic GLP-1 levels. CA and UDCA strongly ameliorated established  in ob/ob mice independently of the GLP-1 incretin pathway.

In 5-20%, there is a progression from NAFL to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Anakinra, a recombinant version of IL-1Ra shows promising metabolic effects with improved hyperglycemia and beta-cell secretory function in a double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial in type 2 diabetic patients but such studies are still in their preliminary stages for NASH.

This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between March 16, 2011, and Dec 3, 2012, 141 patients were randomly assigned to receive obeticholic  and 142 to placebo. 50 (45%) of 110 patients in the obeticholic  group who were meant to have biopsies at baseline and 72 weeks had improved  histology compared with 23 (21%) of 109 such patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 2·8; p=0·0002). 33 (23%) of 141 patients in the obeticholic  developed pruritus compared with nine (6%) of 142 in the placebo group.Obeticholic  improved the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its long-term benefits and safety need further clarification.National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Intercept Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Targeting the gut- axis and bile -based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses, obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169861>Trials of obeticholic  for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis - Authors' reply.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184632>Is vitamin e or ursodeoxycholic  a valid treatment option for nonalcoholic  disease in 2016?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286519>Comparative characteristics of hepatoprotectors used for the treatment of non alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with herpesvirus infection in sufferers of the Chornobyl accident.</a></h2><p>Objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of various groups of hepatoprotectors in the treatment of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) sufferers of the accident at the Chornobyl NPP following the assessment of metabolic changes and control of persistent infections.The study included 104 males with NASH, who were sufferers of the Chornobyl disaster and underwent examination and treatment in the conditions of the clinics of the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine.

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile -farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic ), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor α pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of -related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy. It is very likely that in the next few years several medications will be available to clinicians treating patients with NAFLD across the entire spectrum of disease.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

So far no effective drug treatment has been established to cure this disease. Bile acids (BAs) have a variety of signaling properties, which can be used therapeutically for modulating hepatic metabolism and inflammation. A side-chain shorted derivative of ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is 24 nor-ursodeoxycholic  (NorUDCA) and it represents a new class of drugs for treatment of  diseases. NorUDCA has unique biochemical and therapeutic properties, since it is relatively resistant to conjugation with glycine or taurine compared to UDCA. NorUDCA undergoes cholehepatic shunting, resulting in ductular targeting, bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis, and cholangiocyte protection. Furthermore, it showed anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-lipotoxic properties in several animal models. As such, NorUDCA is a promising new approach in the treatment of cholestatic and metabolic  diseases. This review is a summary of current BA-based therapeutic approaches in the treatment of the  disease.© 2017 S.

An increase of body mass provides a pathogenetic basis for many diseases including those of digestive system This review deals with pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholelithiasis and non-alcoholic  disease in obese patients. This pathology and its aggravation result from such pathophysiological processes as a rise in intra-abdominal pressure, excess adipokine, cholesterol and free   synthesis, activation of lipid peroxidation. Gastroesophageal reflux disease in obese patients has an atypical clinical course characterized by discrepancy between clinical, endoscopic and morphological features in oesophagus and frequent formation of Barrett's oesophagus. Cholelethiasis in obesity is fraught with further progress of the disease after prescription of low-fat diet. The risk of calculi formation can be reduced by prescription of ursodeoxycholic  that produces both litholytic and hypolipidemic effects. Treatment of non-alcoholic  disease requires combined therapy with statins, insulin sensitizers, hepatoprotectors and adequate physical activity. Sustained remission of diseases of digestive organs is impossible without correction of body mass and their pharmacotherapy requires increasing doses of medicines and duration of their administration.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26169860>Trials of obeticholic  for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803760>Obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite promotes  cancer through senescence secretome.</a></h2><p>Obesity has become more prevalent in most developed countries over the past few decades, and is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for several common types of cancer. As the worldwide obesity epidemic has shown no signs of abating, better understanding of the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated cancer is urgently needed. Although several events were proposed to be involved in obesity-associated cancer, the exact molecular mechanisms that integrate these events have remained largely unclear. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of  (DCA), a gut bacterial metabolite known to cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn secretes various inflammatory and tumour-promoting factors in the , thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Notably, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the DCA-SASP axis in HSCs has key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, indicating that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights into the development of obesity-associated cancer and open up new possibilities for its control.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25753820>Obeticholic  and resveratrol in nonalcoholic  disease: all that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107284>Superior reductions in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with co-administration of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and obeticholic  in mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an unmet need associated with metabolic syndrome. There are no approved therapies for NASH; however, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonists are promising drug targets. We investigated the therapeutic effects of co-administration of a GLP-1R agonist, IP118, with FXR agonist obeticholic  (OCA) in mice.OCA and IP118 alone and in combination were sub-chronically administered to Lep/Lep mice with diet-induced NASH or diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Metabolic (body weight and glucose) and  (biochemical and histological) endpoints were assessed. NASH severity in Lep/Lep mice was graded using a customized integrated scoring system.OCA reduced  weight and lipid in NASH mice (both by -17%) but had no effect on plasma ALT or AST levels. In contrast, IP118 significantly reduced  weight (-21%),  lipid (-15%), ALT (-29%), and AST (-27%). The combination of OCA + IP118 further reduced  weight (-29%),  lipid (-22%), ALT (-39%), and AST (-36%). Combination therapy was superior to monotherapies in reducing hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Here, we show that the intrahepatic retention of hydrophobic BAs including deoxycholate (DCA), taurocholate (TCA), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and taurolithocholate (TLCA) were substantially increased in a streptozotocin and high fat diet (HFD) induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) mouse model. Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed  tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in  and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote  carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21222338>[Gastroenterology and hepatology.

Between 1994 and 2008, four prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the treatment of NASH with UDCA were conducted. The first study, by Lindor et al., compared the impact of 13-15 mg/kg/day of UDCA to a placebo. The second study by Dufour et al. had an additional third arm that administered combination therapy with UDCA and vitamin E. The third and fourth studies by Leuschner et al. and by Ratziu et al. evaluated high doses of UDCA at 25-35 mg/kg/day, and used  biopsies and serum  enzyme levels to evaluate the impact of UDCA. With the exception of Ratziu et al.'s study, which was lacking a second  biopsy, none of these studies showed any significant differences in the treatment of NASH with UDCA compared with a placebo. However, Dufour et al. did observe a significant improvement of NASH with the combination (UDCA/VitE) vs placebo therapy, whereas UDCA monotherapy was not effective in the treatment of NASH.

Here, we aimed at evaluating the miR-34a/Sirtuin 1(SIRT1)/p53 pro-apoptotic pathway in human NAFLD, and to elucidate its function and modulation by UDCA in the rat  and primary rat hepatocytes. biopsies were obtained from NAFLD morbid obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Rat livers were collected from animals fed a 0.4% UDCA diets. Primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with bile acids or free  acids (FFAs) and transfected with a specific miRNA-34a precursor and/or with a p53 overexpression plasmid. p53 transcriptional activity was assessed by ELISA and target reporter constructs.miR-34a, apoptosis and acetylated p53 increased with disease severity, while SIRT1 diminished in the NAFLD . UDCA inhibited the miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 pathway in the rat  in vivo and in primary rat hepatocytes. miR-34a overexpression confirmed its targeting by UDCA, which prevented miR-34a-dependent repression of SIRT1, p53 acetylation, and apoptosis. Augmented apoptosis by FFAs in miR-34a overexpressing cells was also inhibited by UDCA. Finally, p53 overexpression activated miR-34a/SIRT1/p53, which in turn was inhibited by UDCA, via decreased p53 transcriptional activity.Our results support a link between  cell apoptosis and miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling, specifically modulated by UDCA, and NAFLD severity.

No adverse reactions occurred due to the combined use of Ursofalk and atorvastatin.It is reasonable to co-administer urosofalk and statins as an agent of hypolipidemic therapy in patients with AID concurrent with disseminated atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia that is accompanied by  infiltration of the  with elements of fibrosis in 90% of cases and that is a pre-stage of steatohepatitis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29512910>Editorial: weight change,  histology and the metabolic effects of obeticholic  in NASH.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27895393>Emerging role of obeticholic  in the management of nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the commonest chronic  disease and its prevalence is increasing driven by the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. NAFLD can progress to cirrhosis and is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and hepatocellular cancer. Diet and exercise are limited by suboptimal long-term adherence in patients with NAFLD. On the other hand, current pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has limited efficacy and unfavorable safety profile. In this context, obeticholic  (OCA), a selective agonist of the farnesoid X receptors, might represent a useful option in these patients. Preclinical studies suggest that OCA improves hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A proof-of-concept study and the randomized, placebo-controlled Farnesoid X Receptor Ligand Obeticholic  in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Treatment (FLINT) trial also showed improvements in  histology in patients with NAFLD who received OCA. Weight loss and reduction in blood pressure were also observed. However, the effects of OCA on insulin resistance are conflicting and the lipid profile is adversely affected by this agent. In addition, pruritus is frequently observed during treatment with OCA and might lead to treatment discontinuation. However, given the limitations of existing treatments for NAFLD, OCA might represent a useful therapeutic option in selected patients with NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24865256>Tauroursodeoxycholic  attenuates progression of steatohepatitis in mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient diet.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. A methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet induces robust ER stress response and steatohepatitis, but the effects of ER stress modulation on the course of steatohepatitis remain uncertain. The present study evaluated whether reducing ER stress using the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) could limit hepatocyte lipoapoptosis and progression of MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis.HuH7 cells stably transfected with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (HuH-Ntcp cells) and palmitate (PA) were used. Experimental steatohepatitis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice using an MCD diet, and three different doses of TUDCA (500, or 1,000 mg/kg, once daily; or 500 mg/kg twice daily) were administered by gavage from the start of the MCD diet regimen or after 4 weeks.TUDCA reduced PA-induced ER stress as manifested by decreased eIF2α phosphorylation, XBP1 splicing and expression of BiP, ATF4, and CHOP in HuH-Ntcp cells. TUDCA also decreased PA-induced JNK phosphorylation, Puma up-regulation and Bax activation, which in turn suppressed caspase-dependent hepatocyte lipoapoptosis. Mice given TUDCA did not show a significant decrease in the intrahepatic triglyceride contents and steatosis. However, TUDCA treatment significantly reduced hepatic damage compared to controls for both early and late treatment groups. TUDCA treatment reduced the expression of ER stress markers and pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to decreased apoptosis and oxidative stress. Finally, TUDCA reduced histological fibrosis along with the down-regulation of pro-fibrotic gene expression in both early and late treatment groups.These results show that TUDCA attenuates the progression of MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis by reducing ER stress.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28714405>Emerging Targets to Relieve Fat Stress-Induced  Diseases: UDCA, Tocotrienol, ω-3 PUFAs, and IgY Targeted NPC1L1 Cholesterol Transporter.</a></h2><p>Fat stress-induced  disease is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome initiated by excess fat accumulation and encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases from non-alcoholic  disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a precursor lesion progressing to more aggressive  cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the incidence of these fat stress-induced  diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide in parallel with the growing epidemics of obesity and metabolic diseases, its exact pathogenesis is not well defined. Although obesity, sedentary life-style, altered dietary pattern, insulin resistance, altered intestinal barrier function, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress have been acknowledged as contributing factors because of the indefinite pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, the only reliable treatment is lifestyle intervention composed of restrictive diet and exercise. Additionally, some existing medications such as pioglitazone and antioxidants such as vitamin E were reported to be effective; in this review, several novel agents especifically targeting nonalcoholic  disease pathogenesis under clinical trial will be introduced. These include an NPC1L1 blocker (ezetimibe), which significantly improved histological and symptomatic scores associated with steatohepatitis and fibrosis; clofibrate, phentoxyfylline, ursodeoxycholic , and tocopherol, all of which are prescribed to relieve fat stress; and additional IgY targeted NPC1L1, tocotrienol, ursodeoxycholic , and ω-3 polyunsaturated  acids, which are actively under investigation to confirm the safety of long-term use.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874313>New therapeutic perspectives in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is focused on restitution of metabolic derangement, weight loss and drugs able to improve steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis.
