Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a newly emerging pharmaceutical target and FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate cholestasis and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of obeticholic  (OCA) treatment in preventing SBS-ALDs.Piglets underwent 75% small-bowel resection (SBS) or sham surgery (sham) and were assigned to either a daily dose of OCA (2.4 mg/kg/day) or were untreated. Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool fat and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced fat malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs. We postulate that extensive small resection impacts the ability of the remnant intestine to respond to FXR activation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1945747>Bile acids and their amidates inhibit 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase obtained from rat kidney.</a></h2><p>Recently it has been demonstrated that interaction of corticosteroids with extraadrenal target cells can effectively be modulated by metabolic transformation of the steroid hormone. As far as 11-hydroxylated glucocorticoids are concerned 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) is the most important enzyme charged with target cell metabolism. Inhibition of 11 beta-HSD function either by genetically transmitted deficiency or by exogenous enzyme inhibitors causes severe pathophysiological derangements, which result in a syndrome of "apparent mineralocorticoid excess". In the present paper we have tested whether or not endogenous inhibitors of this enzyme system might exist. The effects of the main naturally occurring mono-, di-, and trihydroxylated bile acids in man on 11 beta-HSD have been studied in in vitro experiments. Using rat renal microsomes it could be demonstrated that unconjugated bile acids of all three classes as well as the corresponding glycine and taurine amidates effectively inhibit oxidative as well as reductive activity of 11 beta-HSD, with  and chenodeoxycholic  being the most potent compounds. It is concluded that bile acids are potent endogenous inhibitors of 11 beta-HSD and, therefore, could participate in abnormalities of cortisol metabolism observed in liver cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction and, possibly, after ingestion of bile acids.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14518282>[Hepatocellular transport of bile acids and organic anions in infection and SIRS--evidence for different mechanisms for regulating membrane transport proteins].</a></h2><p>The alteration of proinflammatory mediators during sepsis and SIRS results in a large variety of adaptive changes of metabolic and physiologic variables. This study investigated the alterations of hepatocellular transport in a rat sepsis model (LPS i.p.) as well as in a model inducing SIRS by sterile abscess formation (turpentine i.m.). Two bile acids (Cholyltaurine and Chemodeoxycholyltaurine) and one organic anion (Sulfolithocholyltaurine) were used as marker substrates to investigate the time course of hepatocellular transport function. Experiments were performed in isolated perfused rat livers and plasma membrane vesicles. During sepsis, both, the transport of bile acids and that of the organic anion was markedly reduced. In contrast no alteration of transport was detected during SIRS. However, biliary secretion of glutathione (+90%) and bile  independent bile flow (%) were increased. mRNA levels of bile  and organic anion transport proteins were reduced. The lowest values were noted 12 h after injection of LPS or turpentine. Almost unchanged kinetic parameters during SIRS pointed to a normal population of transporters with regard to quantity and substrate affinity. Therefore it seems that transcriptional regulation plays an important role for the expression of transport proteins during sepsis, whereas posttranscriptional regulation may be of importance during SIRS. The clinical phenomenon of septic cholestasis including jaundice implies endotoxemia and differenciates against SIRS.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643938>Bile Acids.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a large family of molecules that have a steroidal structure and are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and actively secreted along with cholesterol and phospholipids into the bile. Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile acids act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile acids are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile acids synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile acids are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile acids, predominantly deoxycholic  and . The reabsorbed bile acids are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile acids are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile acids are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile acids by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile acids also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile acids can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile acids (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile acids that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile acids are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile acids can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other  effects of bile acids can be useful in treating  diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile acids are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction , graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile acids. References given in this overview section are limited to general publications on bile  metabolism and use as therapeutic agents. Drug Class: Gastrointestinal Agents: Chenodiol (Chenodeoxycholic ).

The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids and depleted of .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and  activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism. Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28580281>Glucagon-like peptide-2 promotes gallbladder refilling via a TGR5-independent, GLP-2R-dependent pathway.</a></h2><p>Glucagon-like peptides (GLPs) are secreted from enteroendocrine cells in response to nutrients and bile acids and control metabolism via actions on structurally-related yet distinct G protein coupled receptors. GLP-1 regulates gut motility, appetite, islet function, and glucose homeostasis, whereas GLP-2 enhances intestinal nutrient absorption. GLP-1R agonists are used to treat diabetes and , and a GLP-2R agonist is approved to treat short bowel syndrome. Unexpectedly, reports of gallbladder disease have been associated with the use of both GLP-1R and GLP-2R agonists and after bariatric surgery, although the mechanisms remain unknown.We investigated whether GLP-1 or GLP-2 acutely controls gallbladder (GB) volume and whether GLP-2 regulates GB muscle activity in mice. The expression of , , and  was assessed in mouse GB, and the effects of GLP-2 on hepatic bile  (BA) flow, intestinal and liver BA uptake, and GB gene expression were determined. GLP-2 regulation of GB volume was assessed in wildtype,  and  mice. The effect of GLP-2 on GB smooth muscle (GBSM) calcium transients was characterized .Acute administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 lowered glucose but had no effect on GB volume in mice. In contrast, GLP-2 rapidly enhanced GB filling in a dose-dependent manner, actions maintained in the presence of cholecystokinin, and mediated through the canonical GLP-2R. GLP-2 also rapidly induced immediate early gene expression in GB, consistent with detection of the endogenous  in GB RNA. The ability of GLP-2 to increase GB volume was not abrogated by systemic administration of hexamethonium, propranolol, a vasoactive peptide receptor antagonist or N-Nitroarginine methyl ester, and was maintained in  mice. In contrast, , a Tgr5 agonist, increased GB filling in  but not in  mice. GLP-2 had no effect on ileal uptake or hepatic clearance of taurocholic  or on hepatic bile flow, yet reduced the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients in murine GBSM , in a tetrodotoxin-sensitive manner.Our data extend endocrine concepts of regulation of GB filling beyond FXR-FGF15/19 and the direct effects of BA via Tgr5, to encompass a novel BA-Tgr5-L cell GLP-2 axis providing nutrient-mediated feedback from BA to terminate meal-related GB contraction. These findings have implications for conditions characterized by elevated circulating levels of GLP-2 such as after bariatric surgery and the development and use of agents that promote Tgr5 activation, L cell secretion, or GLP-2R agonism for the treatment of metabolic disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765751>Decoding the vasoregulatory activities of bile -activated receptors in systemic and portal circulation: role of gaseous mediators.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are end products of cholesterol metabolism generated in the liver and released in the intestine. Primary and secondary bile acids are the result of the symbiotic relation between the host and intestinal microbiota. In addition to their role in nutrient absorption, bile acids are increasingly recognized as regulatory signals that exert their function beyond the intestine by activating a network of membrane and nuclear receptors. The best characterized of these bile -activated receptors, GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5) and the farnesosid-X-receptor (FXR), have also been detected in the vascular system and their activation mediates the vasodilatory effects of bile acids in the systemic and splanchnic circulation. GPBAR1, is a G protein-coupled receptor, that is preferentially activated by  (LCA) a secondary bile . GPBAR1 is expressed in endothelial cells and liver sinusoidal cells (LSECs) and responds to LCA by regulating the expression of both endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), an enzyme involved in generation of hydrogen sulfide (HS). Activation of CSE by GPBAR1 ligands in LSECs is due to genomic and nongenomic effects, involves protein phosphorylation, and leads to release of HS. Despite that species-specific effects have been described, vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 ligands in the liver microcirculation and aortic rings is abrogated by inhibition of CSE but not by eNOS inhibitor. Vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 (and FXR) ligands also involves large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels likely acting downstream to HS. The identification of GPBAR1 as a vasodilatory receptor is of relevance in the treatment of complex disorders including metabolic syndrome-associated diseases, liver steatohepatitis, and portal hypertension.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28823924>A novel partial agonist of GPBA reduces blood glucose level in a murine glucose tolerance test.</a></h2><p>GPBA is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by bile acids. Because activation of GPBA leads to increased cAMP levels and secretion of incretins and insulin, GPBA has been proposed as a promising drug target for the treatment of . Previously, we have developed a ligand-screening system to identify novel agonists of GPBA by means of a fusion protein of GPBA with G protein stimulatory α subunit (Gsα) and by a [S]GTPγS-binding assay. To express the GPBA-Gsα fusion protein, transgenic silkworms were employed in this study, and cell membrane fractions were prepared from their fat body or pupae. We applied them to the screening of a chemical library that contains 10,625 compounds from the RIKEN Natural Products Depository (NPDepo). Eventually, a unique partial agonist, GUM2, was successfully identified. Our results indicated that the GPCR-Gα fusion proteins were beneficial for ligand identification and that the transgenic silkworms were useful for large-scale production of GPCRs. In HEK293 cells transiently expressing GPBA, GUM2 showed 50% effective concentration (EC) of 3.5 ± 2.4μM and induced GPBA internalization as effectively as did an endogenous agonist, TLC. We also confirmed that GUM2 stimulates insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. Moreover, a single 2mg/kg dose of GUM2 significantly reduced blood glucose levels in mice during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test even though GUM2 is only a partial agonist with a low intrinsic activity. We concluded that GUM2 is a good candidate for research on GPBA signaling under physiological conditions and for the development of GPBA-targeting therapeutic compounds.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) and obeticholic  (OCA) are the only two FDA-approved drugs for its treatment. Thus, there is a clear need to develop new therapeutic approaches for cholestasis. Here, anti-cholestasis effects of the lignans from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Schisandra sphenanthera, were investigated as well as the involved mechanisms.Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 9 groups including the control group, LCA group, LCA with specific lignan treatment of Schisandrin A (SinA), Schisandrin B (SinB), Schisandrin C (SinC), Schisandrol A (SolA), Schisandrol B (SolB), Schisantherin A (StnA) and Schisantherin B (StnB), respectively. Mice were treated with each drug (qd) for 7 days, while the administration of  (LCA) (bid) was launched from the 4th day. Twelve hours after the last LCA injection, mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. Serum biochemical measurement and histological analysis were conducted. Metabolomics analysis of serum, liver, intestine and feces were performed to study the  profile of bile acids. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the hepatic expression of genes and proteins related to bile  homeostasis. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to investigate the transactivation effect of lignans on human pregnane X receptor (hPXR). RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect induction effects of lignans on hPXR-targeted genes in HepG2 cells.Lignans including SinA, SinB, SinC, SolA, SolB, StnA, StnB were found to significantly protect against LCA-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, as evidenced by significant decrease in liver necrosis, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. More importantly, serum total bile acids (TBA) and total bilirubin (Tbili) were also significantly reduced. Metabolomics analysis revealed these lignans accelerated the metabolism of bile acids and increased the bile  efflux from liver into the intestine or feces. Gene analysis revealed these lignans induced the hepatic expressions of PXR-target genes such as Cyp3a11 and Ugt1a1. Luciferase reporter gene assays illustrated that these bioactive lignans can activate hPXR. Additionally, they can all upregulate hPXR-regulate genes such as CYP3A4, UGT1A1 and OATP2.These results clearly demonstrated the lignans from Schisandra sphenanthera exert hepatoprotective effects against LCA-induced cholestasis by activation of PXR. These lignans may provide an effective approach for the prevention and treatment of cholestatic liver injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
