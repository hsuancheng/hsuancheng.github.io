<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743046>13-HODE,  and ALOX15 as potential players in Rett syndrome OxInflammation.</a></h2><p>Mutations in the MECP2 gene are the main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT), a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder, that shows also multisystem disturbances associated with a metabolic component. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an increased production of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, specifically 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), can contribute to the altered the redox and immune homeostasis, suggested to be involved in RTT. Serum levels of 9- and 13-HODEs were elevated in RTT and associated with the expression of arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase (ALOX15) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids supplementation has shown to lower HODEs levels in RTT. Statistically significant correlation was demonstrated between the increased plasma HODEs levels and the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity. Collectively, these findings reinforce the concept of the key role played by lipid peroxidation in RTT, and the possible ability of omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids supplementation in improving the oxinflammation status in RTT.Copyright © 2019.

HDL2 from ACS patients have better antiplatelet potency than HDL from non ACS subjects. ACS remodels the antiplatelet properties of HDL subclasses. Oxidized polyunsaturated  acids content of HDL is modified by ACS.Background Although HDLs have antithrombotic effects by reducing platelet activation, the relationship between HDL levels and the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is unclear, as HDL particles are heterogeneous in composition and biological properties. Objective To characterize the effects of HDL2 and HDL3 subclasses from ACS patients and non-coronary artery disease (CAD) subjects on platelet activation. Methods We measured platelet aggregation and ex vivo thrombus formation, analyzed signaling pathways by flow cytometry, and performed a targeted lipidomics analysis on HDL subclasses. Results Analysis of human platelet aggregation in suspension, adhesion on von Willebrand factor and thrombus formation on collagen under arterial shear demonstrated that HDL2 from ACS patients had higher antiplatelet potency than HDL3 from ACS patients and HDL from non-CAD subjects. HDL binding to scavenger receptor class B type I was essential for this effect. A lipidomics analysis revealed that HDL2 from ACS patients had more oxidized polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs). An inverse correlation between the concentrations of 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (), 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), the eicosapentaenoic acid metabolite 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid isomers in HDL2 and platelet aggregation was observed. This relationship was further demonstrated by the direct inhibitory effects of 18-HEPE, , 13-HODE, 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid and 14-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid on collagen-related peptide-induced platelet aggregation, indicating that oxidized PUFAs contribute to the antithrombotic effect of ACS HDL2. Conclusions Our data shed new light on the antiplatelet effects of HDL subclasses, and suggest physiological adaptation through the modulation of HDL properties in ACS patients that may limit their platelet-dependent thrombotic risk.© 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340670>Diesel Exhaust Induces Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Hyperlipidemia, and  Steatosis.</a></h2><p>Air pollution is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Our goal was to dissect the mechanisms involved. Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on lipid metabolism in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized  acids  (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of  and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with oleic acid. As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and oleic acid did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse , with DE particles and oleic acid also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and  steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased lipid catabolism.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p></html>
