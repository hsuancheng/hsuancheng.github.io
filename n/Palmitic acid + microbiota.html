In addition, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analyzed using ion chromatography. The results showed that sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly reduced liver triacylglyceride (TG) content compared with the sn2PA fat only group. Moreover, the supplementation with sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA significantly promoted the growth of Lactobacillus in the feces at the genus level. On the other hand, the growth of the opportunistic pathogen Desulfovibrio was significantly inhibited by sn2PA fat in combination with ARA compared with the sn2PA fat group.

PA in PO is esterified predominantly at the SN-1,3 position of triacylglycerol (TAG), and infant formulas are now available in which a greater proportion of PA is in the SN-2 position (typical configuration in human milk). As there are some concerns about the use of PO, we aimed to review literature on health effects of PO and SN-2-palmitate in infant formulas.PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched for relevant studies on possible beneficial effects or harms of either PO or SN-2-palmitate in infant formula on various health outcomes.We identified 12 relevant studies using PO and 21 studies using SN-2-palmitate. Published studies have variable methodology, subject characteristics, and some are underpowered for the key outcomes. PO is associated with harder stools and SN-2-palmitate use may lead to softer stool consistency. Bone effects seem to be short-lasting. For some outcomes (infant colic, faecal , lipid metabolism), the number of studies is very limited and summary evidence inconclusive. Growth of infants is not influenced. There are no studies published on the effect on markers of later diseases.There is insufficient evidence to suggest that PO should be avoided as a source of fat in infant formulas for health reasons.

However, the mechanism of dysfunction remains unknown. In this study, we examined mitochondrial function in the mechanistic study in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to establish the DIO model for GLP-1 reduction. The mice were then treated with berberine (BBR) (100 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks to test the impact on GLP-1 expression. Mitochondrial activities of the colon enterocytes were compared among three groups of mice (lean, DIO, and DIO + BBR) at the end of treatment. Gut  and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were examined to understand the mitochondrial responses. A cellular model treated with  (PA) was used in the mechanism study.A reduction in GLP-1 expression was observed in DIO mice with mitochondrial stress responses in the colon enterocytes. The mitochondria exhibited cristae loss, membrane rupture, and mitochondrial swelling, which was observed with an increase in ATP abundance, complex I activity, and deficiency in the activities of complexes II and IV. Those changes were associated with dysbiosis and a reduction in SCFAs in the colon of DIO mice. In the cellular model, an increase in ATP abundance, loss of mitochondrial potential, and elevation of apoptosis were induced by PA. All of the alterations in DIO mice and the cellular model were attenuated by BBR.The mitochondrial stress responses were observed in the colon enterocytes of DIO mice for GLP-1 reduction. The stress was prevented by BBR in the restoration of GLP-1 expression, in which BBR may act through direct and indirect mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100480>Antioxidant and antidiabetic activity of blackberry after gastrointestinal digestion and human gut  fermentation.</a></h2><p>Blackberry fruit contains high levels of polyphenols particularly anthocyanins which contribute to its biological activities. Bioavailability of polyphenols especially anthocyanins is generally low, it has been proposed that metabolites from polyphenol biotransformation under colonic fermentation are components that exert health benefits. In this study, blackberry was subjected to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and gut  fermentation at different time intervals (0-48 h) to study the changes in bioactive components, its antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Phenolic compounds, during digestion and fermentation were also analysed. Gut metabolites of blackberry significantly increased the glucose consumption and glycogen content in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, gut metabolites ameliorated high glucose plus -induced ROS overproduction, mitochondrial membrane collapse, and glutathione depletion in HepG2 cells. The mechanism of antidiabetic activity of blackberry was via its potent antioxidant activity. Therefore, our results suggest that blackberry could be recommended as a functional food due to potential antioxidant and antidiabetic activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have described the microbial communities and metabolic character of traditional sour cream and butter. The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial  and metabolic character of eight samples collected from herdsmen in Buryatia, Russia. Using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing techniques, we identified a total of 294 species and/or subspecies in 169 bacterial genera, belonging to 14 phyla. The dominant phylum was Firmicutes (81.47%) and the dominant genus was  (59.28%). There were differences between the bacterial compositions of the sour cream and butter samples. The relative abundances of , , and  were significantly higher in sour cream than in butter, and the abundance of   was significantly lower in sour cream than in butter. Using a pure culture method, 48 strains were isolated and identified to represent seven genera and 15 species and/or subspecies. Among these isolates,  subsp.  (22.50%) was the dominant LAB species. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry at elevated energy was used in combination with statistical methods to detect metabolite differences between traditional sour cream and butter. A total of 27,822 metabolites were detected in all samples, and Lys-Lys, isohexanal, , Leu-Val, and 2'-deoxycytidine were the most dominant metabolites found in all samples. In addition, 27 significantly different metabolites were detected between the sour cream and butter samples, including short peptides, organic acids, and amino acids.

In this study, blackberry anthocyanins were prepared and subjected to in vitro human gut  fermentation at different time intervals (0-48 h) to study their gut metabolites and antioxidant properties. The content of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was found highest in blackberry and it degraded completely after 6 h fermentation.

Using DIO and DR mouse models, this study aimed to examine gut , colonic inflammation and cognitive function to elucidate the role of -gut-brain regulation in DIO. C57Bl6/J mice fed a chronic saturated- diet for 22 weeks showed significant body weight gain differences, with the top one third gaining 48% heavier body weight than the lower one third. There was significant reduction in gut  richness and diversity in DIO mice but not in DR mice. At the phylum level, DIO mice had increased abundance of Firmicutes and Antinobacteria, and decreased abundance of Bacterioides and Proteobacteria in gut . DIO mice exhibited reduced tight junction proteins, increased plasma endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increased inflammation in the colon and liver. Recognition memory and spatial memory were impaired in DIO mice, associated with decreased Bacteroidetes. Further examination showed that hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor was significantly decreased in DIO mice (vs. DR). Conversely, DR mice showed no changes in the above parameters measured. Therefore, gut , colon inflammation and circulating LPS may play a major role in the development of the obese phenotype and cognitive decline associated with a chronic high-saturated- diet.Copyright © 2018.

Stool samples were collected at enrollment and at 6 weeks for the quantification of bacteria.At 6 weeks, the HBP and BF groups had higher Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria counts than the LBP group (P<0.01). The Lactobacillus counts at 6 weeks were not significantly different between the HBP and BF groups. Lactobacillus counts were 1.2×10¹⁰, 1.2×10¹¹, and 5.6×10¹⁰ CFU/g for LBP, HBP, and BF groups, respectively. Bifidobacteria counts were 5.1×10⁹, 1.2×10¹¹, and 3.9×10¹⁰ CFU/g for LBP, HBP, and BF groups, respectively.HBP formula beneficially affected infant gut  by increasing the Lactobacillus and bifidobacteria counts in fecal stools.ClinicalTrials.gov .</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30601634>[The oleic triglycerides of palm oil and  triglycerides of creamy fat.

Food habit changes, such as the quality of fatty acids in the diet, are proposed to treat and prevent these disorders. Some studies demonstrated that saturated fatty acids (SFA) are considered detrimental for treating these disorders. A high fat diet rich in , a SFA, is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and it may also increase atherosclerosis parameters. On the other hand, a high intake of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids may promote positive effects, especially on triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are effective at limiting the hepatic steatosis process through a series of biochemical events, such as reducing the markers of non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, increasing the gene expression of lipid metabolism, decreasing lipogenic activity, and releasing adiponectin.

In this study, the impact of SA on insulin sensitivity was tested in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice through dietary supplementation. At a dosage of 30 mg/kg/day, SA improved insulin sensitivity in the mice after 8-week treatment as indicated by HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) and glucose tolerance test (GTT).

In this work, a selective process using carbon feast-famine cycles was applied to obtain an indigenous microbial community of hydrocarbon-degrading and lipid-accumulating bacteria, using a real lubricant-based wastewater as carbon source. In the conditions applied, the enriched bacterial community, dominated by members of the genus Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, was able to degrade almost all hydrocarbons present in the wastewater within 24 h' incubation and to accumulate, although in low levels, triacylglycerol (TAG) (<5% of cell dry weight (CDW)) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.8% ± 1.1% of the CDW) as well as an unknown lipid (29% ± 6% of CDW), presumably a wax ester-like compound. The influence of culture conditions, namely carbon and nitrogen concentrations (and C/N ratio) and cultivation time, on the amount and profile of produced storage compounds was further assessed using a statistical approach based on a central composite circumscribed design and surface response methodology. The regression analysis of the experimental design revealed that only nitrogen concentration and C/N ratio are significant for neutral lipid biosynthesis (p < 0.05). Maximum neutral lipid content, i.e. 33% (CDW basis), was achieved for the lowest carbon and nitrogen concentrations evaluated (10 g COD L and 0.02 g N L). PHA accounted for less than 5% of CDW. In these conditions, neutral lipid content was mainly composed by TAG, about 70% (w/w). TAG precursors, namely monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG) and fatty acids (FA), accounted for 22% of total neutral lipids and WE for about 7%. Nevertheless, according to the applied response surface model, further improvement of neutral lipids content is still possible if even lower nitrogen concentrations are used. The fatty acids detected in TAG extracts ranged from myristic  (C14:0) to linoleic  (C18:2), being the most abundant  (C16:0), stearic  (C18:0) and oleic  (C18:1). This study shows the feasibility of combining treatment of hydrocarbon contaminated wastewater, herein demonstrated for lubricant-based wastewater, with the production of bacterial neutral lipids using open mixed bacterial communities.

Previous studies have shown the effects of specific dietary fatty acids (FAs) on intestinal , but little is known about the effect of the stereospecifically numbered sn-2 position in triglycerides (TG) of human milk on the gut microbiome of infants. This study aimed at examining possible effects of sn-2 FAs of human milk on the gut microbial development of breastfeeding babies. Sn-2 FAs and intestinal  were assessed by GC-MS and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. The results showed that breast milk from mothers in China contained ten major sn-2 FAs dominated by  (C, 54.42%), oleic  (C n-9, 14.95%), linoleic  (LA, C n-6, 12.81%), myristic  (C, 4.50%) and C (3.17%). Total long chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCUFA) decreased from colostrum to mature milk, while total saturated fatty acids (SFA) showed no significant difference during lactation. A significant association between sn-2 FAs in milk and infant gut  was found between decanoic  (C), myristic  (C), stearic  (C), C, arachidonic  (AA, C n-6), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C n-3) with Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium.

Herein, we discuss two pivotal aspects of the pathogenesis of NASH. We first analyse the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on liver cells. In particular, the role of free fatty acids such as , cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged.

Earlier experiments in rodents show that a diet with a higher proportion of palmitate at the sn-2 position of triacylglycerols improves dietary fat and calcium absorption compared with a diet with a lower sn-2 palmitate content. A high-sn-2 palmitate diet increased fecal short-chain fatty acids, reduced gut inflammation in a colitis model, and altered tissue endocannabinoid concentrations in laboratory rodents. Recent studies in infants confirm that formula with a high sn-2 palmitate content reduces stool fat, , fat soaps, palmitate soaps, and calcium compared with formula with a low sn-2 palmitate content. These effects have been associated with improved bone strength, increased fecal bifidobacteria, and reduced crying in infants. In some studies, findings with formula high in sn-2 palmitate match those seen in breast-fed infants. However, in many studies, high sn-2 palmitate formula remains inferior to breast-feeding. It is concluded that infant formula high in sn-2 palmitate is superior to formula with low sn-2 palmitate but does not fully match human breast milk. Recent studies showing altered gut  (human infants) and tissue endocannabinoids (rodent model) suggest the potential for marked physiological impact of high sn-2 palmitate that needs to be explored further in human trials.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Genomic analysis identified 41/1864 coding genes as ORFans (2.2%) and at least 620/1808 (34.9%) orthologous proteins which are not shared with the closest phylogenetic species. We believe that the extension of the human anaerobic gut compendium by culturomics is one of the first steps that will improve the understanding of the links between the microbiome and health or disease.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
