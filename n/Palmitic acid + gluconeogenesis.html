Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in FFAs accumulation and its modulation could drive the development of potential therapies for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of picroside II, a phytoactive found in , on fatty  accumulation vis-à-vis silibinin, a known hepatoprotective phytoactive from .HepG2 cells were loaded with FFAs (oleic :/2:1) for 20 hours to mimic hepatic steatosis. The FFAs concentration achieving maximum fat accumulation and minimal cytotoxicity (500 μM) was standardized. HepG2 cells were exposed to the standardized FFAs concentration with and without picroside II pretreatment.Picroside II pretreatment inhibited FFAs-induced lipid accumulation by attenuating the expression of fatty  transport protein 5, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Preatreatment with picroside II was also found to decrease the expression of forkhead box protein O1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.These findings suggest that picroside II effectively attenuated fatty  accumulation by decreasing FFAs uptake and lipogenesis. Picroside II also decreased the expression of gluconeogenic genes.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093212> CsrA regulates a metabolic switch from amino  to glycerolipid metabolism.</a></h2><p> CsrA plays a crucial role in the life-stage-specific expression of virulence phenotypes and metabolic activity. However, its exact role is only partly known. To elucidate how CsrA impacts  metabolism we analysed the CsrA depended regulation of metabolic functions by comparative C-isotopologue profiling and oxygen consumption experiments of a  wild-type (wt) strain and its isogenic  mutant. We show that a  mutant has significantly lower respiration rates when serine, alanine, pyruvate, α-ketoglutarate or palmitate is the sole carbon source. By contrast, when grown in glucose or glycerol, no differences in respiration were detected. Isotopologue profiling uncovered that the transfer of label from [U-C]serine via pyruvate into the citrate cycle and  was lower in the mutant as judged from the labelling patterns of protein-derived amino acids, cell-wall-derived diaminopimelate, sugars and amino sugars and 3-hydroxybutyrate derived from polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Similarly, the incorporation of [U-C]glucose via the glycolysis/Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway but not via the pentose phosphate pathway was repressed in the  mutant. On the other hand, fluxes due to [U-C]glycerol utilization were increased in the  mutant. In addition, we showed that exogenous [1,2,3,4-C] is efficiently used for PHB synthesis via C-acetyl-CoA. Taken together, CsrA induces serine catabolism via the tricarboxylic  cycle and glucose degradation via the ED pathway, but represses glycerol metabolism, fatty  degradation and PHB biosynthesis, in particular during exponential growth. Thus, CsrA has a determining role in substrate usage and carbon partitioning during the  life cycle and regulates a switch from amino  usage in replicative phase to glycerolipid usage during transmissive growth.© 2017 The Authors.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30362509>Taurine improves low-level inorganic arsenic-induced insulin resistance by activating PPARγ-mTORC2 signalling and inhibiting hepatic autophagy.</a></h2><p>Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is reportedly associated with the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes in the population. Here, we found that iAs exposure significantly decreased the expression of glycolytic genes and glycogen content and increased  gene levels in C57/BL6J mice. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) were decreased in the livers of iAs-treated mice. Furthermore, in iAs-treated HepG2 cells, we found that PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (RGS) increased the expression of mTORC2, inhibited autophagy, and improved glucose metabolism. mTORC2 agonist  inhibited autophagy and improved glucose metabolism as well as the autophagosome formation inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Taurine, a natural compound, reversed impaired glucose metabolism and decreased expression of PPARγ and mTORC2 induced by iAs in mice liver and HepG2 cells. These data indicated that taurine administration could ameliorate iAs-induced insulin resistance through activating PPARγ-mTORC2 signalling and subsequently inhibiting hepatic autophagy.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25724108> induces central leptin resistance and impairs hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in male mice.</a></h2><p>The consumption of diets rich in saturated fat largely contributes to the development of obesity in modern societies. A diet high in saturated fats can induce inflammation and impair leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. However, the role of saturated fatty acids on hypothalamic leptin signaling, and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism remains largely undiscovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of a saturated fatty ,  (PA, C16:0), on central leptin sensitivity, hypothalamic leptin signaling, inflammatory molecules and hepatic energy metabolism in C57BL/6J male mice. We found that the icv administration of PA led to central leptin resistance, evidenced by the inhibition of central leptin's suppression of food intake. Central leptin resistance was concomitant with impaired hypothalamic leptin signaling (JAK2-STAT3, PKB/Akt-FOXO1) and a pro-inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and pIκBa) in the mediobasal hypothalamus and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the pre-administration of icv PA blunted the effect of leptin-induced decreases in mRNA expression related to  (G6Pase and PEPCK), glucose transportation (GLUT2) and lipogenesis (FAS and SCD1) in the liver of mice. Therefore, elevated central PA concentrations can induce pro-inflammatory responses and leptin resistance, which are associated with disorders of energy homeostasis in the liver as a result of diet-induced obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance remain not completely understood. Transcriptional dysregulation, post-transcriptional modifications and protein degradation contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs) are RNA-binding proteins that are involved in post-transcriptional control pathways. However, there are little studies about the roles of PCBPs in insulin resistance. PCBP2 is the member of the RNA-binding proteins and is thought to participate in regulating hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway which are involved in regulating insulin signaling pathway. Here, we investigated the influence of PCBP2 on hepatic insulin resistance. We showed that the protein and mRNA levels of PCBP2 were down-regulated under insulin-resistant conditions. In addition, we showed that over-expression of PCBP2 ameliorates palmitate (PA)-induced insulin resistance, which was indicated by elevated phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). We also found that over-expression of PCBP2 inhibits HIF1α and STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, glucose uptake was found to display a similar tendency with the phosphorylation of Akt. The expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), two key gluconeogenic enzymes, were down-regulated following Over-expression of PCBP2. Accordingly, PA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation was suppressed in over-expression of PCBP2 HepG2 cells. In addition, we found that over-expression of PCBP2 inhibits HIF1α and STAT3 pathway. Our results demonstrate that PCBP2 was involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity might via HIF-1α and STAT3 pathway in HepG2 cells.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we evaluated ability of pterostilbene (PTS), a methoxylated analogue of resveratrol and a known antioxidant, to reverse  (PA)-mediated IR in HepG2 cells. PTS prevented reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and subsequent oxidative lipid damage by reducing the expression of NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) in PA treated HepG2 cells. Hepatic glucose production was used as a measure of IR and PTS reversed PA-mediated increase in hepatic glucose production by reducing expression of genes coding for gluconeogenic enzymes namely glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase (PC); and their transcription factors cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and fork head class Box O (FOXO1) along with its coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1 α (PGC1α). PTS reversed PA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which in turn altered insulin signalling pathway by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser 307, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β. PTS also reduced PA-mediated lipid accumulation by reducing expression of transcription factors SREBP1c and PPARα. SREBP1c activates genes involved in fatty  and triglyceride synthesis while PPARα activates CPT1, a rate limiting enzyme for controlling entry and oxidation of fatty acids into mitochondria. PTS, however, did not influence PA uptake confirmed by using BODIPY-labelled fluorescent C16 fatty  analogue. Thus, our data provides a possible mechanistic explanation for reversal of PA-mediated IR in HepG2 cells.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930324>Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 enzymatic activity influences the expression of neonatal metabolic genes.</a></h2><p>The success of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibition as a type 2 diabetes therapy has encouraged deeper examination of the post-proline DPP enzymes. DPP9 has been implicated in immunoregulation, disease pathogenesis and metabolism. The DPP9 enzyme-inactive (Dpp9 gene knock-in; Dpp9 gki) mouse displays neonatal lethality, suggesting that DPP9 enzyme activity is essential in neonatal development. Here we present gene expression patterns in these Dpp9 gki neonatal mice. Taqman PCR arrays and sequential qPCR assays on neonatal liver and gut revealed differential expression of genes involved in cell growth, innate immunity and metabolic pathways including long-chain-fatty- uptake and esterification, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA binding, trafficking and transport into mitochondria, lipoprotein metabolism, adipokine transport and  in the Dpp9 gki mice compared to wild type. In a liver cell line, Dpp9 knockdown increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, which suggests a potential mechanism. DPP9 protein levels in liver cells were altered by treatment with EGF, HGF, insulin or palmitate, suggesting potential natural DPP9 regulators. These gene expression analyses of a mouse strain deficient in DPP9 enzyme activity show, for the first time, that DPP9 enzyme activity regulates metabolic pathways in neonatal liver and gut.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Clarification of the molecular mechanism of metabolic disorder and exploration of drug targets are crucial for the treatment of T2DM.  We examined miR-125a-5p levels in -induced AML12 cells and the livers of type 2 diabetic rats and mice, and then validated its target gene. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, the effects of miR-125a-5p via targeting of STAT3 on regulating glycolipid metabolism were further illustrated  and .  We found that miR-125a-5p was significantly decreased in the livers of diabetic mice and rats, and STAT3 was identified as the target gene of miR-125a-5p. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p in C57BL/6 mice decreased STAT3 level and downregulated the expression levels of p-STAT3 and SOCS3. Consequently, SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis pathway was inhibited, and PI3K/AKT pathway was activated. Moreover, silencing of miR-125a-5p significantly increased the expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3 and SOCS3, thus activating SREBP-1c pathway and suppressing PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and decreased liver glycogen appeared in C57BL/6 mice. In -induced AML12 cells, miR-125a-5p mimic markedly increased glucose consumption and uptake and decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets by regulating STAT3 signaling pathway. Consistently, miR-125a-5p overexpression obviously inhibited STAT3 expression in diabetic KK-Ay mice, thereby decreasing blood glucose and lipid levels, increasing hepatic glycogen content, and decreasing accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets in diabetic mice. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-125a-5p in KK-Ay mice aggravated glycolipid metabolism dysfunction through regulating STAT3.  Our results confirmed that miR-125a-5p should be considered as a regulator of glycolipid metabolism in T2DM, which can inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and  and elevate glycogen synthesis by targeting STAT3.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988636>Resveratrol affects hepatic  via histone deacetylase 4.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether resveratrol (Rev) affects the expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), which in turn affects  in hepatocytes under an insulin-resistant state.HepG2 cells were treated with 0.25 mmol/L  (PA) to establish an insulin resistance model.

Therefore, we further explored the probable mechanism of VA on dismissing hepatic  through the activation of adenosine-5' monophosphate kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro.We developed type 2 diabetic mice with STZ and oral administration with VA (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg) once a day for 6 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted. The expression levels of AMPK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) proteins in live were evaluated by western blot. Then, we further explored the mechanism of VA on hepatic  in vitro experiments. Glucose production and the expression of AMPK, PEPCK and G6Pase proteins were detected after VA treatment with the presence of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C.VA reduced FBG and caused a significant improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in STZ-induced mice. VA inhibited the elevated expression of  key enzymes (PEPCK and G6Pase) and up-regulated AMPK activity in liver. In  (PA)-induced HepG2 cells, VA decreased glucose production and the expression of PEPCK and G6Pase proteins, also activated AMPK pathway.

PAHSAs reduce ambient glycemia and improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant aged chow- and high-fat diet-fed (HFD-fed) mice. Here, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which PAHSAs improve insulin sensitivity. Both acute and chronic PAHSA treatment enhanced the action of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose production (EGP) in chow- and HFD-fed mice. Moreover, chronic PAHSA treatment augmented insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle and heart in HFD-fed mice. The mechanisms by which PAHSAs enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity included direct and indirect actions involving intertissue communication between adipose tissue and liver. PAHSAs inhibited lipolysis directly in WAT explants and enhanced the action of insulin to suppress lipolysis during the clamp in vivo. Preventing the reduction of free fatty acids during the clamp with Intralipid infusion reduced PAHSAs' effects on EGP in HFD-fed mice but not in chow-fed mice. Direct hepatic actions of PAHSAs may also be important, as PAHSAs inhibited basal and glucagon-stimulated EGP directly in isolated hepatocytes through a cAMP-dependent pathway involving Gαi protein-coupled receptors.

Variation in bull fertility has been demonstrated even among those animals exhibiting normal sperm numbers, motility, and morphology. Despite advances in research, molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the causes of low fertility in some bulls have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic profile of bull spermatozoa using non-targeted metabolomics. Statistical analysis and bioinformatic tools were employed to evaluate the metabolic profiles high and low fertility groups. Metabolic pathways associated with the sperm metabolome were also reported.A total of 22 distinct metabolites were detected in spermatozoa from bulls with high fertility (HF) or low fertility (LF) phenotype. The major metabolite classes of bovine sperm were organic acids/derivatives and fatty acids/conjugates.

However, it is presently unknown whether BACE1 and the product of its activity, soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), contribute to lipid-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells.Studies were conducted in mouse C2C12 myotubes, skeletal muscle from Bace1mice and mice treated with sAPPβ and adipose tissue and plasma from obese and type 2 diabetic patients.We show that BACE1 inhibition or knockdown attenuates palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance and prevents the reduction in Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) and fatty  oxidation caused by palmitate in myotubes. The effects of palmitate on ER stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, PGC-1α down-regulation, and fatty  oxidation were mimicked by soluble APPβ in vitro. BACE1 expression was increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and type 2 diabetic patients and this was accompanied by a decrease in PGC-1α mRNA levels and by an increase in sAPPβ plasma levels of obese type 2 diabetic patients compared to obese non-diabetic subjects. Acute sAPPβ administration to mice reduced PGC-1α levels and increased inflammation in skeletal muscle and decreased insulin sensitivity.Collectively, these findings indicate that the BACE1 product sAPPβ is a key determinant in ER stress, inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and  in liver.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

On the fifth day, the men ingested an oral (13)C-labeled fructose load (0.75 g/kg), and their total fructose oxidation ((13)CO2 production), fructose storage (fructose ingestion minus (13)C-fructose oxidation), fructose conversion into blood (13)C glucose ( from fructose), blood VLDL-(13)C palmitate (a marker of hepatic de novo lipogenesis), and lactate concentrations were monitored over 7 postprandial h. On one occasion, participants remained lying down throughout the experiment [fructose treatment alone with no exercise condition (NoEx)], and on the other 2 occasions, they performed a 60-min exercise either 75 min before fructose ingestion [exercise, then fructose condition (ExFru)] or 90 min after fructose ingestion [fructose, then exercise condition (FruEx)].Fructose oxidation was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the FruEx (80% ± 3% of ingested fructose) than in the ExFru (46% ± 1%) and NoEx (49% ± 1%).

The present study aimed to explore whether miR‑214 and ATF4 were involved in the MEG3‑mediated increase of FoxO1 expression. MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 expression were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The interaction among MEG3, miR‑214 and ATF4 was analysed using the luciferase reporter assay. MEG3‑targeting small interference RNAs were injected into high‑fat diet (HFD)‑fed mice to verify the role of MEG3 in hepatic insulin resistance in vivo. MEG‑3 and ATF4 were demonstrated to be upregulated and miR‑214 was indicated to be downregulated in the livers of HFD‑fed and ob/ob mice. In mouse primary hepatocytes, palmitate time‑dependently increased MEG3 and ATF4 but decreased miR‑214 expression levels. Furthermore, MEG3 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR‑214 to facilitate ATF4 expression, while miR‑214 inhibition and ATF4 overexpression reversed the MEG3 knockdown‑mediated decrease in the expression of FoxO1 and FoxO1‑downstream targets phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose‑6‑phosphatase catalytic subunit.

Glycogen synthesis was measured using [(14)C]glucose. Palmitate treatment reduced insulin signaling at the level of Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, which were little affected by FMO3 overexpression. However, the fatty  also increased the levels of several ER stress markers and activation of caspase 3, which were counteracted by FMO3 overexpression and exacerbated by FMO3 knockdown. Although FMO3 expression did not reverse lipid effects on protein thiol redox in hepatocytes, it did prevent up-regulation of the gluconeogenic enzyme PEPCK by pharmacological ER stress inducers or by palmitate. ER stress and PEPCK levels were also reduced in livers of fat-fed protein kinase Cδ-deficient mice. Our data indicate that FMO3 can contribute to the regulation of glucose metabolism in the liver by reducing lipid-induced ER stress and the expression of PEPCK, independently of insulin signal transduction.</p><p>Keyword: gluconeogenesis</p></html>
