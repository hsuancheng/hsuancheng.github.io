The triple combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), long-acting beta agonists (LABAs), and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) has become an option for maintenance treatment of COPD and as a "step-up" therapy from single or double combination treatments. There is evidence that triple combination ICS/LABA/LAMA with different inhalers improves lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduces exacerbations. A new triple fixed-dose combination of extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate (100 µg/puff)/formoterol fumarate (6 µg/puff)/glycopyrronium bromide (12.5 µg/puff) has been developed as a hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered dose inhaler. Two large pivotal studies showed that this extrafine fixed ICS/LABA/LAMA triple combination is superior to fixed ICS/LABA combined therapy and also superior to the LAMA tiotropium in terms of lung function and exacerbation prevention in COPD patients at risk of exacerbation. This review considers the new information provided by these clinical trials of extrafine triple therapy and the implications for the clinical management of COPD patients.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29429593>Extrafine inhaled triple therapy versus dual bronchodilator therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (TRIBUTE): a double-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Evidence is scarce on the relative risk-benefit of inhaled triple therapy, consisting of inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and long-acting β-agonist, versus dual bronchodilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to compare a single-inhaler triple combination of beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G) versus a single-inhaler dual bronchodilator combination of indacaterol plus glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) in terms of the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks of treatment.This randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study was done at 187 sites across 17 countries. Eligible patients had symptomatic COPD, severe or very severe airflow limitation, at least one moderate or severe exacerbation in the previous year, and were receiving inhaled maintenance medication. After a 2 week run-in period with one inhalation per day of IND/GLY (85 μg/43 μg), patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive response technology system, to receive 52 weeks of treatment with two inhalations of extrafine BDP/FF/G (87 μg/5 μg/9 μg) twice per day or one inhalation of IND/GLY (85 μg/43 μg) per day. Randomisation was stratified by country and severity of airflow limitation. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations across 52 weeks of treatment in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .Between May, 29 2015, and July 10, 2017, 1532 patients received BDP/FF/G (n=764) or IND/GLY (n=768). Moderate-to-severe exacerbation rates were 0·50 per patient per year (95% CI 0·45-0·57) for BDP/FF/G and 0·59 per patient per year (0·53-0·67) for IND/GLY, giving a rate ratio of 0·848 (0·723-0·995, p=0·043) in favour of BDP/FF/G. Adverse events were reported by 490 (64%) of 764 patients receiving BDP/FF/G and 516 (67%) of 768 patients receiving IND/GLY. Pneumonia occurred in 28 (4%) patients receiving BDP/FF/G versus 27 (4%) patients receiving IND/GLY. One treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in each group: dysuria in a patient receiving BDP/FF/G and atrial fibrillation in a patient receiving IND/GLY.In patients with symptomatic COPD, severe or very severe airflow limitation, and an exacerbation history despite maintenance therapy, extrafine BDP/FF/G significantly reduced the rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations compared with IND/GLY, without increasing the risk of pneumonia.Chiesi Farmaceutici.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of both drugs following adoption of the new policy.Between June 2012 and September 2014, a therapeutic efficacy study was conducted in East Sepik and Milne Bay Provinces of PNG in accordance with the standard World Health Organization (WHO) protocol for surveillance of anti-malarial drug efficacy. Patients ≥ 6 months of age with microscopy confirmed Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax mono-infections were enrolled, treated with AL or DHA-PPQ, and followed up for 42 days. Study endpoints were adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on days 28 and 42. The in vitro efficacy of anti-malarials and the prevalence of selected molecular markers of resistance were also determined.A total of 274 P. falciparum and 70 P. vivax cases were enrolled. The day-42 PCR-corrected ACPR for P. falciparum was 98.1% (104/106) for AL and 100% (135/135) for DHA-PPQ. The day-42 PCR-corrected ACPR for P. vivax was 79.0% (15/19) for AL and 92.3% (36/39) for DHA-PPQ. Day 3 parasite clearance of P. falciparum was 99.2% with AL and 100% with DHA-PPQ. In vitro testing of 96 samples revealed low susceptibility to chloroquine (34% of samples above IC threshold) but not to lumefantrine (0%). Molecular markers assessed in a sub-set of the study population indicated high rates of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum (pfcrt SVMNT: 94.2%, n = 104) and in P. vivax (pvmdr1 Y976F: 64.8%, n = 54).AL and DHA-PPQ were efficacious as first- and second-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria in PNG. Continued in vivo efficacy monitoring is warranted considering the threat of resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs in the region and scale-up of artemisinin-based combination therapy in PNG.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475489>Differential modulation of innate immune response by epinephrine and estradiol.</a></h2><p>Background Although it is widely accepted that catecholamines and estrogens influence  and have consequences for health, their effect on innate  (e.g. monocytes and neutrophils) is still not fully investigated. Materials and methods Our study aimed to analyze the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and IL-8 by whole blood cells following short-term exposure to epinephrine (Epi) and 17β-estradiol (E2) in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We also evaluated the in vitro effect of these hormones on expression of β2 integrin (CD11b/CD18) and L-selectin (CD62L) by circulating neutrophils and monocytes in the blood of healthy subjects. Results Epi has shown a potential to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Its exposure resulted in significantly increased production of IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. On the contrary, a dose-dependent suppression of LPS-induced production of IL-1β, IL-8, and MCP-1 by Epi was observed. In neutrophils, a modest rise in CD11b expression was observed after Epi exposure. Simultaneously, Epi suppressed LPS-induced expression of CD11b and CD18. In monocytes, Epi suppressed LPS-induced expression of C11b. E2 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production and caused a significant decrease in CD62L expression in both cell populations. No significant changes were observed after double exposure of cells with Epi and E2. Conclusions Thus, our results show that Epi and E2 differentially modulate the innate immune response and have a dual effect on cytokine modulation. The findings suggest that the observed immunoregulatory role of Epi and E2 may influence the outcome in endotoxin responses and can be critical in the regulation of inflammatory responses.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25526818>Targeting ß2 adrenergic receptors regulate human T cell function directly and indirectly.</a></h2><p>It is well-established that central nervous system activation affects peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) function through the release of the catecholamines (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE), which act on ß2-adrenergic receptors (ß2AR). However, most studies have used non-specific stimulation of cells rather than antigen-specific responses. Likewise, few studies have parsed out the direct effects of ß2AR stimulation on T cells versus indirect effects via adrenergic stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APC). Here we report the effect of salmeterol (Sal), a selective ß2AR agonist, on IFN-γ(+) CD4 and IFN-γ(+) CD8 T cells following stimulation with Cytomegalovirus lysate (CMVL-strain AD169) or individual peptides spanning the entire region of the HCMV pp65 protein (pp65). Cells were also stimulated with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Additionally, we investigated the effect of Epi and Sal on cytotoxic cell killing of transfected target cells at the single cell level using the CD107a assay. The results show that Sal reduced the percentage of IFN-γ(+) CD4 and IFN-γ(+) CD8 T cells both when applied directly to isolated T cells, and indirectly via treatment of APC. These inhibitory effects were mediated via a ß2 adrenergic-dependent pathway and were stronger for CD8 as compared to CD4 T cells. Similarly, the results show that Sal suppressed cytotoxicity of both CD8 T and NK cells in vitro following stimulation with Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with MICA(*009) (T-CHO) and the human erythromyeloblastoid leukemic (K562) cell line. The inhibitory effect on cytotoxicity following stimulation with T-CHO was stronger in NK cells compared with CD8 T cells. Thus, targeting the ß2AR on lymphocytes and on APC leads to inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production and target cell killing. Moreover, there is a hierarchy of responses, with CD8 T cells and NK cells inhibited more effectively than CD4 T cells.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and biotherapy are common strategies for treating mucosal melanoma of the head and neck. Episcleritis is an idiopathic, immune-mediated disease, and is classified into two types: simple episcleritis and nodular episcleritis.In this case report we describe ocular changes involving simple episcleritis in a 65-year-old Chinese man with mucosal melanoma of the head and neck after treatment with interferon alfa-2b and radiotherapy. On the third day of interferon alfa-2b treatment, he began to develop simple episcleritis in his left eye. Moreover, the percentage of CD3 T cells in lymphocytes from blood was increased after interferon alfa-2b treatment. After approximately 6 days, the symptoms of eye pain, hyperemia, and edema disappeared gradually. Then, after radiotherapy was performed three times, he again developed episcleritis in his left eye. The same symptoms of hyperemia and edema occurred again; CD3 T cell frequency was also at a higher level. After approximately a week, all the symptoms disappeared completely. Simple treatment involving topical ofloxacin and phenylephrine was administered during the two periods of episcleritis.Episcleritis in this patient might have been due to the treatment with interferon alfa-2b and radiotherapy, leading to an increase in the level of CD3 T cells and activation of immune system cells, which provides the guide for clinical clinicians.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410489>Choline Regulates the Function of Bovine Immune Cells and Alters the mRNA Abundance of Enzymes and Receptors Involved in Its Metabolism .</a></h2><p>Dietary choline can impact systemic , but it remains unclear whether this is primarily via direct impacts on immune cells or secondary effects of altered metabolic function. To determine whether increased choline concentrations (3.2, 8.2, 13.2 μM) in cell culture alter the function of bovine innate and adaptive immune cells, we isolated cells from dairy cows in early and mid-lactation as models of immuno-compromised and competent cells, respectively. Phagocytic and killing capacity of isolated neutrophils were linearly diminished with increasing doses of choline. In contrast, lymphocyte proliferation was linearly enhanced with increasing doses of choline. Furthermore, increasing doses of choline increased the mRNA abundance of genes involved in the synthesis of choline products (betaine, phosphatidylcholine, and acetylcholine) as well as muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in a quadratic and linear fashion for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Phagocytic and killing capacity of neutrophils and proliferation of lymphocytes were not affected by stage of lactation or its interaction with choline or LPS. In neutrophils from early lactation cows, choline linearly increased the mRNA abundance of muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors, whereas choline-supplemented monocytes from mid-lactation cows linearly increased the mRNA abundance of several genes coding for choline metabolism enzymes. These data demonstrate that choline regulates the inflammatory response of immune cells and suggest that the mechanism may involve one or more of its metabolic products.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453438>Altered  in crowded Mythimna separata is mediated by octopamine and dopamine.</a></h2><p>Similar to pathogenic infection, high population density alters insects' prophylactic . Density-dependent prophylaxis has been reported in many polyphenic insects, but the regulatory mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. The biogenic monoamines are known to play critical roles in mediating insect immune responses. In the current study, the immune capacity and the levels of three biogenic monoamines were investigated in the polyphenic larvae of Mythimna separata, reared at the densities of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 30 larvae per 650-mL jar. Concomitant with the increased phenoloxidase (PO) activity and total haemocyte count in the larvae at high densities (5, 10, 30 larvae/jar), the octopamine level was also increased. In contrast, the dopamine level was decreased, and the 5-hydroxytryptamine level was not significantly affected. Injection of octopamine induced significant increases in the total haemocyte count and PO activity. Conversely, epinastine, a specific antagonist of octopamine, decreased the total haemocyte count and PO activity. Another octopamine antagonist, phentolamine, inhibited the activity of PO and lysozymes. In addition, injection of dopamine induced a significant increase in PO activity and decreased the total haemocyte count and lysozyme activity. These results suggested that both octopamine and dopamine mediate the increases in total haemocyte count and PO activity in the crowded larvae.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354245>Palmitoylethanolamide Promotes a Proresolving Macrophage Phenotype and Attenuates Atherosclerotic Plaque Formation.</a></h2><p>Objective- Palmitoylethanolamide is an endogenous fatty acid mediator that is synthetized from membrane phospholipids by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D. Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial inflammation, such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high-fat diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29358124>A2E-associated cell death and  in retinal pigmented epithelial cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is observed in retinal degenerative diseases including Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. Bis-retinoid N-retinyl-N-retinylidene  (A2E) is a major component of lipofuscin. A2E has been implicated in RPE atrophy and retinal ; however, mice with A2E accumulation display only a mild retinal phenotype. In the current study, human iPSC-RPE (hiPSC-RPE) cells were generated from healthy individuals to examine effects of A2E in human RPE cells. hiPSC-RPE cells displayed RPE-specific features, which include expression of RPE-specific genes, tight junction formation and ability to carry out phagocytosis. hiPSC-RPE cells demonstrated cell death and increased VEGF-A production in a time-dependent manner when they were cocultured with 10μM of A2E. PCR array analyses revealed upregulation of 26 and 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines upon A2E and HO exposure respectively, indicating that A2E and HO can cause  in human retinas. Notably, identified gene profiles were different between A2E- and HO- treated hiPSC-RPE cells. A2E caused inflammatory changes observed in retinal degenerative diseases more closely as compared to HO. Collectively, these data obtained with hiPSC-RPE cells provide evidence that A2E plays an important role in pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases in humans.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

These stressors are thought to impair immune defences and might contribute, at least partly, to the prophylactic use of antibiotics. Robustness was recently defined as the ability of an individual to express a high-production potential in a wide variety of environmental conditions. Increasing robustness thus appears as a valuable option to improve resilience to stressors and could be obtained by selecting piglets upon their adrenocortical activity. In this study, we aimed at depicting the consequences of an acute social stress on the immune capacity of piglets genetically selected upon divergent hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity. For this purpose, we monitored neuroendocrine and immune parameters, in high- (HPA) and low- (HPA) responders to ACTH, just before and immediately after a one-hour mixing with unfamiliar conspecifics. As expected, stressed piglets displayed higher levels of circulating cortisol and norepinephrine. Blood cell count analysis combined to flow cytometry revealed a stress-induced leukocyte mobilization in the bloodstream with a specific recruitment of CD8α lymphocytes. Besides, one-hour mixing decreased LPS-induced IL-8 and TNFα secretions in whole-blood assays (WBA) and reduced mononuclear cell phagocytosis. Altogether, our data demonstrate that acute social stress alters immune competence of piglets from both groups, and bring new insights in favour of good farming practices. While for most parameters high- and low-responders to ACTH behaved similarly, HPA piglets displayed higher number of CD4 CD8α T cells, as well as increased cytokine production in WBA (LPS-induced TNFα and PIL-induced IL-8), which could confer them increased resistance to pathogens. Finally, a principal component analysis including all parameters highlighted that overall stress effects were less pronounced on piglets with a strong HPA axis. Thus, selection upon adrenocortical axis activity seems to reduce the magnitude of response to stress and appears as a good tool to increase piglet robustness.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

NE binds to the adrenergic receptors on immune cells, including T cells, resulting in either suppressed or enhanced function depending on the type of cell, activation status of the cell, duration of NE exposure and concentration of NE. Here, we aim to analyze the effects of NE on the functionality of naïve (Tn), central memory (Tcm) and effector memory (Tem) CD8 T cells.We isolated CD8 T cell subsets from healthy human adults and treated cells in vitro with NE (1×10(-6)M) for 16h; we then stimulated NE treated and untreated CD8 T cell subsets with antibodies for CD3 and CD28 for 24 and 72h. We assessed the level of beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) expression in these cells as well as global gene expression changes in NE treated Tcm cells by microarray analysis. Altered expressed genes after NE treatment were identified and further confirmed by RT-qPCR, and by ELISA for protein changes. We further determined whether the observed NE effects on memory CD8 T cells are mediated by ADRB2 using specific adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonists. Finally, we examined the levels of mRNA and protein of the NE-induced genes in healthy adults with high serum levels of NE (>150pg/mL) compared to low levels (<150pg/mL).We found that memory (Tcm and Tem) CD8 T cells expressed a significantly higher level of ADRB2 compared to naïve cells. Consequently, memory CD8 T cells were significantly more sensitive than naïve cells to NE induced changes in gene expressions in vitro. Global gene expression analysis revealed that NE induced an elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in resting and activated memory CD8 T cells in addition to a reduced expression of growth-related cytokines. The effects of NE on memory CD8 T cells were primarily mediated by ADRB2 as confirmed by the adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist assays. Finally, individuals with high serum levels of NE had similar elevated gene expressions observed in vitro compared to the low NE group.Our results demonstrate that NE preferentially modulates the functions of memory CD8 T cells by inducing inflammatory cytokine production and reducing activation-induced memory CD8 T cell expansion.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30111600>Before platelets: the production of platelet-activating factor during growth and stress in a basal marine organism.</a></h2><p>Corals and humans represent two extremely disparate metazoan lineages and are therefore useful for comparative evolutionary studies. Two lipid-based molecules that are central to human , platelet-activating factor (PAF) and Lyso-PAF were recently identified in scleractinian corals. To identify processes in corals that involve these molecules, PAF and Lyso-PAF biosynthesis was quantified in conditions known to stimulate PAF production in mammals (tissue growth and exposure to elevated levels of ultraviolet light) and in conditions unique to corals (competing with neighbouring colonies over benthic space). Similar to observations in mammals, PAF production was higher in regions of active tissue growth and increased when corals were exposed to elevated levels of ultraviolet light. PAF production also increased when corals were attacked by the stinging cells of a neighbouring colony, though only the attacked coral exhibited an increase in PAF. This reaction was observed in adjacent areas of the colony, indicating that this response is coordinated across multiple polyps including those not directly subject to the stress. PAF and Lyso-PAF are involved in coral stress responses that are both shared with mammals and unique to the ecology of cnidarians.© 2018 The Authors.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26576764>The comprehensive immunomodulation of NeurimmiRs in haemocytes of oyster Crassostrea gigas after acetylcholine and norepinephrine stimulation.</a></h2><p>Neural-endocrine-immune (NEI) system is a major modulation network among the nervous, endocrine and immune system and weights greatly in maintaining homeostasis of organisms during stress and infection. Some microRNAs are found interacting with NEI system (designated NeurimmiRs), addressing swift modulations on immune system. The oyster Crassostrea gigas, as an intertidal bivalve, has evolved a primary NEI system. However, the knowledge about NeurimmiRs in oysters remains largely unknown.Six small RNA libraries from haemocytes of oysters stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) were sequenced to identify neurotransmitter-responsive miRNAs and survey their immunomodulation roles. A total of 331 miRNAs (132 identified in the present study plus 199 identified previously) were subjected to expression analysis, and twenty-one and sixteen of them were found ACh- or NE-responsive, respectively (FDR < 0.05). Meanwhile, 21 miRNAs exhibited different expression pattern after ACh or NE stimulation. Consequently, 355 genes were predicted as putative targets of these neurotransmitter-responsive miRNAs in oyster. Through gene onthology analysis, multiple genes involved in death, immune system process and response to stimulus were annotated to be modulated by NeurimmiRs. Besides, a significant decrease in haemocyte phagocytosis and late-apoptosis or necrosis rate was observed after ACh and NE stimulation (p < 0.05) while early-apoptosis rate remained unchanged.A comprehensive immune-related network involving PRRs, intracellular receptors, signaling transducers and immune effectors was proposed to be modulated by ACh- and NE-responsive NeurimmiRs, which would be indispensable for oyster haemocytes to respond against stress and infection.

Additionally, it is unclear if multiple subsets of KCs are present during NASH. Here, we characterized the liver macrophage subsets during methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH and recovery. We observed a significant reduced contribution of Ly6CClec4FTim4KCs to the hepatic macrophage pool in MCD fed mice, which normalized during recovery. Ly6CClec4FTim4 monocyte-derived macrophages increased during MCD feeding and returned to baseline during recovery. Ly6CClec4FTim4 monocyte-derived KCs developed during initial recovery but did not self-renew as their numbers were reduced after full recovery. Initial recovery from MCD diet feeding was further characterized by increased proportions of Ki-67 proliferating KCs. In conclusion, the hepatic macrophage pool undergoes substantial albeit transient changes during NASH and recovery, with the KC pool being maintained by proliferation and differentiation of short-lived monocyte-derived KCs.Copyright © 2017.

The aim of this report was to investigate the effects of choline on cardiovascular damage in hypertension. Eight-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats were intraperitoneally injected with choline or vehicle (8 mg/kg/day). After 8 weeks, choline restored the cardiac function of the SHRs, as evidenced by decreased heart rate, systolic blood pressure, left ventricle systolic pressure, and ±dp/dt and increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening. Choline also ameliorated the cardiac hypertrophy of the SHRs, as indicated by reduced left ventricle internal dimensions and decreased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Moreover, choline improved mesenteric arterial function and preserved endothelial ultrastructure in the SHRs. Notably, the protective effect of choline may be due to its anti-inflammatory effect. Choline downregulated expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α and upregulated IL-10 in the mesenteric arteries of SHRs, possibly because of the inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4. Furthermore, choline restored baroreflex sensitivity and serum acetylcholine level in SHRs, thus indicating that choline improved vagal activity. This study suggests that choline elicits cardiovascular protective effects and may be useful as a potential adjunct therapeutic approach for hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874446>Characterization of Two Novel Lipopolysaccharide Phosphoethanolamine Transferases in Pasteurella multocida and Their Role in Resistance to Cathelicidin-2.</a></h2><p>The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen  has phosphoethanolamine (PEtn) residues attached to lipid A, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo), heptose, and galactose.

The proportion of cured patients with antibodies against EXP1, MSP3, GLURP, RAMA, SEA and EBA181 was higher than the proportion of patients with recrudescent infection. The presence of these antibodies was associated with higher odds of treatment cure. Sera containing all six antibodies impaired the invasion of P. falciparum clinical isolates into erythrocytes. These results suggest that antibodies specific against EXP1, MSP3, GLURP, RAMA, SEA and EBA181 in P. falciparum infections could assist anti-malarial drug treatment and contribute to the resolution of the malarial infection.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695417>Platelet-Activating Factor-Induced Reduction in Contact Hypersensitivity Responses Is Mediated by Mast Cells via Cyclooxygenase-2-Dependent Mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulates numerous cell types via activation of the G protein-coupled PAF receptor (PAFR). PAFR activation not only induces acute proinflammatory responses, but it also induces delayed systemic immunosuppressive effects by modulating host . Although enzymatic synthesis and degradation of PAF are tightly regulated, oxidative stressors, such as UVB, chemotherapy, and cigarette smoke, can generate PAF and PAF-like molecules in an unregulated fashion via the oxidation of membrane phospholipids. Recent studies have demonstrated the relevance of the mast cell (MC) PAFR in PAFR-induced systemic immunosuppression. The current study was designed to determine the exact mechanisms and mediators involved in MC PAFR-mediated systemic immunosuppression. By using a contact hypersensitivity model, the MC PAFR was not only found to be necessary, but also sufficient to mediate the immunosuppressive effects of systemic PAF. Furthermore, activation of the MC PAFR induces MC-derived histamine and PGE release. Importantly, PAFR-mediated systemic immunosuppression was defective in mice that lacked MCs, or in MC-deficient mice transplanted with histidine decarboxylase- or cyclooxygenase-2-deficient MCs. Lastly, it was found that PGs could modulate MC migration to draining lymph nodes. These results support the hypothesis that MC PAFR activation promotes the immunosuppressive effects of PAF in part through histamine- and PGE-dependent mechanisms.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29479349>Adrenergic Signaling: A Targetable Checkpoint Limiting Development of the Antitumor Immune Response.</a></h2><p>An immune response must be tightly controlled so that it will be commensurate with the level of response needed to protect the organism without damaging normal tissue. The roles of cytokines and chemokines in orchestrating these processes are well known, but although stress has long been thought to also affect immune responses, the underlying mechanisms were not as well understood. Recently, the role of nerves and, specifically, the sympathetic nervous system, in regulating immune responses is being revealed. Generally, an acute stress response is beneficial but chronic stress is detrimental because it suppresses the activities of effector immune cells while increasing the activities of immunosuppressive cells. In this review, we first discuss the underlying biology of adrenergic signaling in cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system. We then focus on the effects of chronic adrenergic stress in promoting tumor growth, giving examples of effects on tumor cells and immune cells, explaining the methods commonly used to induce stress in preclinical mouse models. We highlight how this relates to our observations that mandated housing conditions impose baseline chronic stress on mouse models, which is sufficient to cause chronic immunosuppression. This problem is not commonly recognized, but it has been shown to impact conclusions of several studies of mouse physiology and mouse models of disease. Moreover, the fact that preclinical mouse models are chronically immunosuppressed has critical ramifications for analysis of any experiments with an immune component. Our group has found that reducing adrenergic stress by housing mice at thermoneutrality or treating mice housed at cooler temperatures with β-blockers reverses immunosuppression and significantly improves responses to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. These observations are clinically relevant because there are numerous retrospective epidemiological studies concluding that cancer patients who were taking β-blockers have better outcomes. Clinical trials testing whether β-blockers can be repurposed to improve the efficacy of traditional and immunotherapies in patients are on the horizon.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30510101>Downregulation of the Central Noradrenergic System by  Infection.</a></h2><p> is associated with physiological effects in the host. Dysregulation of catecholamines in the central nervous system has previously been observed in chronically infected animals. In the study described here, the noradrenergic system was found to be suppressed with decreased levels of norepinephrine (NE) in brains of infected animals and in infected human and rat neural cells  The mechanism responsible for the NE suppression was found to be downregulation of dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) gene expression, encoding the enzyme that synthesizes norepinephrine from dopamine, with downregulation observed  and in infected brain tissue, particularly in the dorsal locus coeruleus/pons region. The downregulation was sex specific, with males expressing reduced DBH mRNA levels whereas females were unchanged. Rather, DBH expression correlated with estrogen receptor in the female rat brains for this estrogen-regulated gene. DBH silencing was not a general response of neurons to infection, as human cytomegalovirus did not downregulate DBH expression. The noradrenergic-linked behaviors of sociability and arousal were altered in chronically infected animals, with a high correlation between DBH expression and infection intensity. A decrease in DBH expression in noradrenergic neurons can elevate dopamine levels, which provides a possible explanation for mixed observations of changes in this neurotransmitter with infection. Decreased NE is consistent with the loss of coordination and motor impairments associated with toxoplasmosis. Further, the altered norepinephrine synthesis observed here may, in part, explain behavioral effects of infection and associations with mental illness.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27660287>Nicotine Mediates CD161a+ Renal Macrophage Infiltration and Premature Hypertension in the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat.</a></h2><p>Renal inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of hypertension. CD161a immune cells are dominant in the (SHR) spontaneously hypertensive rat and expand in response to nicotinic cholinergic activation.We aimed to phenotype CD161a immune cells in prehypertensive SHR after cholinergic activation with nicotine and determine if these cells are involved in renal inflammation and the development of hypertension.Studies used young SHR and WKY (Wistar-Kyoto) rats. Splenocytes and bone marrow cells were exposed to nicotine ex vivo, and nicotine was infused in vivo. Blood pressures, kidney, serum, and urine were obtained. Flow cytometry, Luminex/ELISA, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and Western blot were used. Nicotinic cholinergic activation induced proliferation of CD161a/CD68 macrophages in SHR-derived splenocytes, their renal infiltration, and premature hypertension in SHR. These changes were associated with increased renal expression of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and VLA-4 (very-late antigen-4). LLT1 (lectin-like transcript 1), the ligand for CD161a, was overexpressed in SHR kidney, whereas vascular cellular and intracellular adhesion molecules were similar to those in WKY. Inflammatory cytokines were elevated in SHR kidney and urine after nicotine infusion. Nicotine-mediated renal macrophage infiltration/inflammation was enhanced in denervated kidneys, not explained by angiotensin II levels or expression of angiotensin type-1/2 receptors. Moreover, expression of the anti-inflammatory α7-nAChR (α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) was similar in young SHR and WKY rats.A novel, inherited nicotinic cholinergic inflammatory effect exists in young SHR, measured by expansion of CD161a/CD68 macrophages. This leads to renal inflammation and premature hypertension, which may be partially explained by increased renal expression of LLT-1, MCP-1, and VLA-4.© 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104209>Isomeric Separation and Recognition of Anionic and Zwitterionic N-glycans from Royal Jelly Glycoproteins.</a></h2><p>Royal jelly has received attention because of its necessity for the development of queen honeybees as well as claims of benefits on human health; this product of the hypopharyngeal glands of worker bees contains a large number of proteins, some of which have been claimed to have various biological effects only in their glycosylated state.

Similarly to recent in-depth studies on other insect species, previously overlooked glucuronic acid termini, sulfation of mannose residues and core β-mannosylation of the N-glycans were found; additionally, a relatively rare zwitterionic modification with phosphoethanolamine is present, in contrast to the phosphorylcholine occurring in lepidopteran species. Indicative of tissue-specific remodelling of glycans in the Golgi apparatus of hypopharyngeal gland cells, only a low amount of fucosylated or paucimannosidic glycans were detected as compared with other insect samples or even bee venom.

Functional analyses of the BDR-associated SNP in NFKB1 revealed potential regulatory function in bronchial smooth muscle cells. The SNP is also an expression quantitative trait locus for a neighboring gene, SLC39A8. The lack of other asthma study populations with BDR and whole-genome sequencing data on minority children makes it impossible to perform replication of our rare variant associations. Minority underrepresentation also poses significant challenges to identify age-matched and population-matched cohorts of sufficient sample size for replication of our common variant findings.The lack of minority data, despite a collaboration of eight universities and 13 individual laboratories, highlights the urgent need for a dedicated national effort to prioritize diversity in research.

A few studies have previously used MRS to examine sperm, but these have either looked at seminal plasma from men with different ejaculate qualities or at the molecules present in pooled samples of lyophilized sperm.Sperm suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C were examined by 1H MRS scanning using a 1H excitation-sculpting solvent suppression sequence after recovery from fresh ejaculates by one of three different methods: (i) simple centrifugation; (ii) DGC with one wash; or (iii) DGC with two washes. In the case of DGC, sperm were collected both from the pellet ('80%' sperm) and the 40/80 interface ('40%' sperm). Spectrum processing was carried out using custom Matlab scripts to determine; the degree of seminal plasma/Percoll contamination, the minimum sperm concentration for 1H MRS detection and differences between the 1H MRS spectra of '40%' and '80%' sperm.DGC with two washes minimized the 1H MRS peak intensity for both seminal plasma and Percoll/PBS solution contamination while retaining sperm specific peaks. For the MRS scanner used in this study, the minimum sperm concentration required to produce a choline/GPC 1H MRS peak greater than 3:1 signal to noise ratio (SNR) was estimated at ~3 × 106/ml. The choline/GPC and lactate/lipid regions of the 1H spectrum were significantly different by two-way ANOVA analysis (P < 0.0001; n = 20). ROC curve analysis of these region showed significant ability to distinguish between the two sperm populations: choline/GPC ROC AUC = 0.65-0.67, lactate/lipid ROC AUC = 0.86-0.87.Only 3-4 semen samples were used to assess the efficacy of each sperm washing protocol that were examined. The estimated minimum sperm concentration required for MRS is specific to the hardware used in our study and may be different in other spectrometers. Spectrum binning is a low resolution analysis method that sums MRS peaks within a chemical shift range. This can obscure the identity of which metabolite(s) are responsible for differences between sperm populations. Further work is required to determine the relative contribution of somatic cells to the MRS spectrum from the '40%' and '80%' sperm.1H MRS can provide information about the molecules present in live human sperm and may therefore permit the study of the underlying functional biology or metabolomics of live sperm. Given the relatively low concentration of sperm required to obtain a suitable MRS signal (~3 × 106/ml), this could be carried out on sperm from men with oligo-, astheno- or teratozoospermia. This may lead to the development of new diagnostic tests or ultimately novel treatments for male factor infertility.This work was supported by the Medical Research Council Grant MR/M010473/1.

The significantly increased phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency of prawn received OA for 8 h returned to control levels after 16 h of injection. In addition, the significantly increased glucose and decreased lactate were observed within 1 h of OA injection. In the susceptibility test, prawn received OA at 25.0 or 250.0 pmol/prawn for 2 h then challenged with Lactococcus garvieae at 10 colony-forming units/prawn significantly increased the resistance of prawns by 23.3% and 30.0%, respectively, compared to the saline-challenged control after 144 h of challenge. In addition, the changes on immunocompetence induced by OA were observed to be blocked by adrenoceptors antagonists. These results suggest that OA administration at 250.0 pmol/prawn or less causes the mediate a transient up-regulation in immune and physiologic responses to promote the resistance of M. rosenbergii to L. garvieae, which are thought to be mediated by α- and β-adrenergic-like octopamine receptors.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two regimens.An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using data from 231 children with Plasmodium falciparum and/or Plasmodium vivax infections in an open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial. Recruited children were randomized 1:1 to receive once daily AN for 3 days with water or twice daily AL for 3 days given with fat. World Health Organisation (WHO) definitions were used to determine clinical/parasitological outcomes. The cost of transport between the home and clinic, plus direct health-care costs, served as a basis for determining each regimen's incremental cost per incremental treatment success relative to AL by Day 42 and its cost per life year saved.In the usual care setting, AN was more effective for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in children aged 0.5-5.9 years. AL and AN were equally efficacious for the treatment of falciparum malaria, however AN had increased anti-malarial treatment costs per patient of $10.46, compared with AL. AN was the most effective regimen for treatment of vivax malaria, but had increased treatment costs of $14.83 per treatment success compared with AL.Whilst AN has superior overall efficacy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in PNG children, AL was the less costly regimen. An indicative extrapolation estimated the cost per life year saved by using AN instead of AL to treat uncomplicated malaria to be $12,165 for girls and $12,469 for boys (discounted), which means AN may not be cost-effective and affordable for PNG at current cost. However, AN may become acceptable should it become WHO prequalified and/or should donated/subsidized drug supply become available.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015629>Elastomeric sensor surfaces for high-throughput single-cell force cytometry.</a></h2><p>As cells with aberrant force-generating phenotypes can directly lead to disease, cellular force-generation mechanisms are high-value targets for new therapies. Here, we show that single-cell force sensors embedded in elastomers enable single-cell force measurements with ~100-fold improvement in throughput than was previously possible. The microtechnology is scalable and seamlessly integrates with the multi-well plate format, enabling highly parallelized time-course studies. In this regard, we show that airway smooth muscle cells isolated from fatally asthmatic patients have innately greater and faster force-generation capacity in response to stimulation than healthy control cells. By simultaneously tracing agonist-induced calcium flux and contractility in the same cell, we show that the calcium level is ultimately a poor quantitative predictor of cellular force generation. Finally, by quantifying phagocytic forces in thousands of individual human macrophages, we show that force initiation is a digital response (rather than a proportional one) to the proper immunogen. By combining mechanobiology at the single-cell level with high-throughput capabilities, this microtechnology can support drug-discovery efforts for clinical conditions associated with aberrant cellular force generation.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071871>Efficacy of heat-killed Lactococcus lactis JCM 5805 on  and fatigue during consecutive high intensity exercise in male athletes: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial.</a></h2><p>Lactococcus lactis JCM 5805 (LC-Plasma) is a unique lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). We aimed to evaluate the effect of LC-Plasma on dendritic cell (DC) activity and subjective indices of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and fatigue in athletes under high intensity exercise.We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. Fifty-one male subjects belonging to a university sports club were randomized into placebo (n = 25) and LC-Plasma (n = 26) groups. Individuals ingested placebo capsules containing cornstarch or LC-Plasma capsules containing 100 billion cells of heat-killed LC-Plasma per day for 13 days. During the intervention period, subjects performed high intensity exercise according to their sports club training regime. Blood and saliva sampling were obtained at days 1 and 14, and physical conditions were recorded in a diary. We investigated expression of maturation markers on DCs, muscle damage and stress markers and used student's t test adjusted by Bonferoni's method for multiple comparison between groups. These data were presented as mean ± SD. We also investigated cumulative days of symptoms regarding infections and fatigue and used Chi-square test for comparison between groups. These data were presented as cumulative number.CD86 as maturation marker on pDC was significantly increased in the LC-Plasma group at day 14 (Placebo: 296 ± 70 vs. LC-Plasma: 365 ± 115; Mean Fluorescent Intensity; p = 0.013).

It imparts  to infants against wide range of pathogenic infections. Several in vitro studies have shown inhibition of LPO activity by pharmaceutical compounds including commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin and gentamicin, and molecules like prednisolone, norepinephrine, etc. Prescription of such drugs to lactating mothers might have adverse health effects on infants. The aim of our study was the elucidation of the structural aspects of the inhibitory mechanism of ampicillin, gentamicin, amoxicillin, prednisolone and norepinephrine on LPO.Three dimensional structure of camel LPO (cLPO) was developed using homology modeling and used for in silico experimental studies. The Schrödinger induced fit docking along with binding affinity estimation experiments were performed. The cLPO and Ligands were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard and Ligprep modules available in Schrodinger suite. For estimating Binding affinity Prime Molecular Mechanics with Generalized Born and Surface Area (MMGB-SA) module was used.The five drug ligands formed three to five hydrogen bonding interactions with cLPO. Amino acids Arg-231, Asp-232, Ser-370, Arg-371 and Glu-374 of cLPO were crucial for these interactions. The binding affinity values for gentamicin were highest and for norepinephrine were the lowest.This study concludes that the five drug molecules show potential ability to inhibit the LPO activity. Further, a very high sequence similarity of cLPO with human LPO imparts high significance to these conclusions in relation to human health especially in new born infants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated whether PAF is able to modulate the infection of human macrophages by Leishmania braziliensis, the main Leishmania sp. in Brazil. Monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated with promastigote forms in absence or presence of exogenous PAF. We observed that the treatment of macrophages with low concentrations of PAF prior to infection increased the phagocytosis of L. braziliensis. More importantly, exogenous PAF reduced the parasitism when it was added before, during or after infection. In addition, treatment with a PAF antagonist (PCA 4248) resulted in a significant increase of macrophage infection in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that endogenous PAF is important to control L. braziliensis infection. Mechanistically, while exogenous PAF increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) treatment with PCA 4248 reduced oxidative burst during L. braziliensis infection. The microbicidal effects of exogenous PAF were abolished when macrophages were treated with apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. The data show that PAF promotes the production of ROS induced by L. braziliensis, suggesting that this lipid mediator may be relevant to control L. braziliensis infection in human macrophages.© FEMS 2017.

However, it is not known whether the nervous system can regulate the production of inflammatory myeloid cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells in disease conditions. Myeloid cell numbers in diabetic patients were strongly correlated with plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, suggesting the role of sympathetic neuronal activation in myeloid cell production. The spleens of diabetic patients and mice contained higher numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing leukocytes that produced catecholamines. Granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) expressed the β adrenergic receptor, a target of catecholamines. Ablation of splenic sympathetic neuronal signaling using surgical, chemical, and genetic approaches diminished GMP proliferation and myeloid cell development. Finally, mice lacking TH-producing leukocytes had reduced GMP proliferation, resulting in diminished myelopoiesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that catecholamines produced by leukocytes and sympathetic nerve termini promote GMP proliferation and myeloid cell development.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There was an initial rise in peripheral P. falciparum gametocyte density with both treatments, but it was more pronounced in the artemisinin-naphthoquine group. Model-derived estimates of the median pretreatment sequestered gametocyte population were 21/μl for artemether-lumefantrine and 61/μl for artemisinin-naphthoquine (P < 0.001). The median time for P. falciparum gametocyte density to fall to <2.5/μl (below which transmission becomes unlikely) was 16 days in the artemether-lumefantrine group and 20 days in artemisinin-naphthoquine group (P < 0.001). Gametocyte prevalence modeling suggested that artemisinin-naphthoquine-treated children became gametocytemic faster (median, 2.2 days) than artemether-lumefantrine-treated children (median, 5.3 days; P < 0.001) and had a longer median P. falciparum gametocyte carriage time per individual (20 versus 13 days; P < 0.001). Clearance of P. vivax gametocytes was rapid (within 3 days) in both groups; however, consistent with the reappearance of asexual forms in the main trial, nearly 40% of children in the artemether-lumefantrine group developed P. vivax gametocytemia between days 28 and 42 compared with 3% of children in the artemisinin-naphthoquine group. These data suggest that artemisinin is less active than artemether against sequestered gametocytes. Greater initial gametocyte release after artemisinin-naphthoquine increases the period of potential P. falciparum transmission by 4 days relative to artemether-lumefantrine, but the longer elimination half-life of naphthoquine than of lumefantrine suppresses P. vivax recurrence and consequent gametocytemia.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Experimental animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (PCs) also mobilize in response to sympathetic stimulation. Here we tested the effects of acute psychological stress and brief pharmacological β-adrenergic (βAR) stimulation on peripheral PC numbers in humans.In two studies, we investigated PC mobilization in response to an acute speech task (n=26) and βAR-agonist (isoproterenol) infusion (n=20). A subset of 8 participants also underwent the infusion protocol with concomitant administration of the βAR-antagonist propranolol. Flow cytometry was used to enumerate lymphocyte subsets, total progenitor cells, total haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), early HSC (multi-lineage potential), late HSC (lineage committed), and endothelial PCs (EPCs).Both psychological stress and βAR-agonist infusion caused the expected mobilization of total monocytes and lymphocytes and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Psychological stress also induced a modest, but significant, increase in total PCs, HSCs, and EPC numbers in peripheral blood. However, infusion of a βAR-agonist did not result in a significant change in circulating PCs.PCs are rapidly mobilized by psychological stress via mechanisms independent of βAR-stimulation, although the findings do not exclude βAR-stimulation as a possible cofactor. Considering the clinical and physiological relevance, further research into the mechanisms involved in stress-induced PC mobilization seems warranted.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A key regulator of the immune response and a target for regulation by stress-induced signals is the transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-κB). NF-κB shapes the course of both innate and adaptive immune responses and plays an important role in susceptibility to disease. In this review, we summarise the literature that has been accumulated in the past 20years on adrenergic modulation of NF-κB function. We here focus on the molecular basis of the reported interactions and show that both physiological and pharmacological triggers of β2-ARs intersect with the NF-κB signalling cascade at different levels. Importantly, the action of β2-AR-derived signals on NF-κB activity appears to be highly cell type specific and gene selective, providing opportunities for the development of selective NF-κB modulators.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we have shown that the respiratory pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae disables neutrophils by exploiting molecular mimicry to degrade platelet-activating factor (PAF), a host-derived inflammatory phospholipid. Using mass spectrometry and murine upper airway infection models, we demonstrated that phosphorylcholine (ChoP) moieties that are shared by PAF and the bacterial cell wall allow S. pneumoniae to leverage a ChoP-remodeling enzyme (Pce) to remove PAF from the airway. S. pneumoniae-mediated PAF deprivation impaired viability, activation, and bactericidal capacity among responding neutrophils. In the absence of Pce, neutrophils rapidly cleared S. pneumoniae from the airway and impeded invasive disease and transmission between mice. Abrogation of PAF signaling rendered Pce dispensable for S. pneumoniae persistence, reinforcing that this enzyme deprives neutrophils of essential PAF-mediated stimulation. Accordingly, exogenous activation of neutrophils overwhelmed Pce-mediated phagocyte disruption. Haemophilus influenzae also uses an enzyme, GlpQ, to hydrolyze ChoP and subvert PAF function, suggesting that mimicry-driven immune evasion is a common paradigm among respiratory pathogens. These results identify a mechanism by which shared molecular structures enable microbial enzymes to subvert host lipid signaling, suppress inflammation, and ensure bacterial persistence at the mucosa.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336953>Palmitoylethanolamide induces microglia changes associated with increased migration and phagocytic activity: involvement of the CB2 receptor.</a></h2><p>The endogenous fatty acid amide palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory actions mainly through inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory molecules from mast cells, monocytes and macrophages. Indirect activation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is among the several mechanisms of action that have been proposed to underlie the different effects of PEA in vivo. In this study, we used cultured rat microglia and human macrophages to evaluate whether PEA affects eCB signaling. PEA was found to increase CB2 mRNA and protein expression through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) activation. This novel gene regulation mechanism was demonstrated through: (i) pharmacological PPAR-α manipulation, (ii) PPAR-α mRNA silencing, (iii) chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, exposure to PEA induced morphological changes associated with a reactive microglial phenotype, including increased phagocytosis and migratory activity. Our findings suggest indirect regulation of microglial CB2R expression as a new possible mechanism underlying the effects of PEA.

It also clears mature P. falciparum (Pf) gametocytes, thereby reducing post-treatment transmission. Randomized PQ treatment in a treatment-to-reinfection cohort in Papua New Guinean children permitted the study of Pv and Pf gametocyte carriage after radical cure and to investigate the contribution of Pv relapses.Children received radical cure with Chloroquine, Artemether-Lumefantrine plus either PQ or placebo. Blood samples were subsequently collected in 2-to 4-weekly intervals over 8 months. Gametocytes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR targeting pvs25 and pfs25.PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which was comparable to the effect of PQ on incidence of blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% of Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and to a lesser extent Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of gametocytes were significantly reduced in mixed-species infections compared to single-species infections for both species (ORPv = 0.39 [95% CI 0.25-0.62], ORPf = 0.33 [95% CI 0.18-0.60], p<0.001). No difference between the PQ and placebo treatment arms was observed in density of Pv gametocytes or in the proportion of Pv infections that carried gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment, likely caused by a relapsing hypnozoite, were equally likely to carry gametocytes than first infections after PQ treatment, likely caused by an infective mosquito bite.Pv relapses and new infections are associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia.

Immune deficiency did not change the responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) and phenylephrine at baseline but decreased arterial distensibility and increased stiffness PP. Adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells into Rag1 mice decreased the response to ACh while increasing distensibility and wall thickness. When compared to PP Rag1, vessels from PP CD4-deficient mice, which have B cells and CD8 T cells, but no CD4 cells, show increased distensibility and decreased responsiveness to ACh in a pattern similar to that seen in Rag1 given CD8 T cells prior to mating.

TRM was used to quantify regional physiologic response in adults with asthma who underwent a bronchodilator challenge. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the national research ethics committee and was performed with informed consent. Imaging was performed in 20 adult patients with asthma by using hyperpolarized helium 3 (He) ventilation MR imaging. Two sets of baseline images were acquired before inhalation of a bronchodilating agent (salbutamol 400 μg), and one set was acquired after. All images were registered for voxelwise comparison. Regional treatment response, ΔR(r), was calculated as the difference in regional gas distribution (R[r] = ratio of inhaled gas to total volume of a voxel when normalized for lung inflation volume) before and after intervention. A voxelwise activation threshold from the variability of the baseline images was applied to ΔR(r) maps. The summed global treatment response map (ΔR) was then used as a global lung index for comparison with metrics of bronchodilator response measured by using spirometry and the global imaging metric percentage ventilated volume (%VV). Results ΔR showed significant correlation (P < .01) with changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = 0.70), forced vital capacity (r = 0.84), and %VV (r = 0.56). A significant (P < .01) positive treatment effect was detected with all metrics; however, ΔR showed a lower intersubject coefficient of variation (64%) than all of the other tests (coefficient of variation, ≥99%). Conclusion TRM provides regional quantitative information on changes in inhaled gas ventilation in response to therapy. This method could be used as a sensitive regional outcome metric for novel respiratory interventions.

Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as a potential factor in the development of MS, with a number of studies having shown that patients with MS exhibit gut dysbiosis. The gut microbiota helps the host remain healthy by regulating various functions, including food metabolism, energy homeostasis, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, inhibition of colonization by pathogenic organisms, and shaping of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Alteration of the gut microbiota, and subsequent changes in its metabolic network that perturb this homeostasis, may lead to intestinal and systemic disorders such as MS. Here we discuss the findings of recent MS microbiome studies and potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota can predispose to, or protect against, MS. These findings highlight the need of an improved understanding of the interactions between the microbiota and host for developing therapies based on gut commensals with which to treat MS.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25461918>β-Adrenergic blockade protects BALB/c mice against infection with a small inoculum of Leishmania mexicana mexicana (LV4).</a></h2><p>In order to test the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on Leishmania mexicana infection, groups of female BALB/c mice were treated (i.p.) with the non-selective β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) antagonist (S)-propranolol (5mg/kg thrice a day), the β2-AR agonist clenbuterol (1mg/kg once a day) or the α2-AR antagonist yohimbine (2mg/kg twice a day) during 5days. During the second day of treatments, mice were inoculated in the footpad with 1×10(6) or 1×10(3) metacyclic promastigotes of L. mexicana mexicana (LV4). The lesion size was measured weekly, and parasite burden on week 12. In mice treated with (S)-propranolol, the percentage of splenic T lymphocytes producing IFN-γ after antigen challenge was determined by flow cytometry. In mice infected with 1×10(6) parasites, only (S)-propranolol caused a reduction of footpad swelling (p<0.05, weeks 11-12), without effects on parasite burden, or in the percentage of IFN-γ-immunopositive CD4(+) or CD8(+) T lymphocytes. In mice infected with 1×10(3) parasites, the effects of treatments vs. control group were as follows: (a) inhibition of footpad swelling by (S)-propranolol (p<0.01, weeks 3-12), clenbuterol (p<0.05, weeks 7-10), and yohimbine (p<0.01, week 7); (b) a decrease of the parasite burden by (S)-propranolol (p<0.01) and yohimbine (p<0.05); (c) in control mice the percentage of CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN-γ was 6.2±0.5%, while in those treated with (S)-propranolol it increased to 8.7±0.6% (p<0.01); (d) in control mice the percentage of CD8(+) T-cells producing IFN-γ was 3.1±0.4%, while in those treated with (S)-propranolol it increased to 10.4±0.2% (p<0.01). These results indicate that the blockade of β-ARs during infection of BALB/c mice with an inoculum of L. mexicana mexicana similar to that delivered by the bite of a sand fly produces a Th1 bias in the immune response, favoring an increment of T lymphocytes secreting IFN-γ, which correlated with a reduced parasite burden (p<0.05, Spearman's test). We suggest that β-AR antagonists could be of therapeutic value, either as treatment or as adjuvant of vaccines for L. mexicana.Copyright © 2014.

However, the increased risk of infection is still a concern. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the predominant cells producing type 1 interferon (IFN) against infection. The effect of LABA/ICS on type 1 IFN expression in human pDCs is unknown. Circulating pDCs were isolated from healthy human subjects and were pretreated with glucocorticoid (GCS), LABA or a cAMP analog, and were stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist CpG (TLR9) or imiquimod (TLR7) in the presence of IL-3. The expression of type 1 IFN (IFN-α/β) were measured by ELISA. The mechanisms were investigated using receptor antagonists, pathway inhibitors, Western blotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation. GCS suppressed TLR-induced IFN-α expression, and LABA enhanced the suppressive effect. LABA alone also suppressed TLR-induced IFN-α/β expression, and the effect was reversed by the β2-adrenoreceptor antagonist ICI118551. Dibutyryl-cAMP, a cAMP analog, conferred a similar suppressive effect, and the effect was abrogated by the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) inhibitor HJC0197 or intracellular free Ca chelator BAPTA-AM. Formoterol suppressed TLR-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-p38/ERK. Formoterol suppressed interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3/IRF-7 expression. Formoterol suppressed CpG-induced translocation of H3K4 specific methyltransferase WDR5 and suppressed H3K4 trimethylation in the IFNA and IFNB gene promoter region. LABA suppressed TLR7/9-induced type 1 IFNs production, at least partly, via the β-adrenoreceptor-cAMP-Epac-Ca, IRF-3/IRF-7, the MAPK-p38/ERK pathway, and epigenetic regulation by suppressing histone H3K4 trimethylation through inhibiting the translocation of WDR5 from cytoplasm to nucleus.

The role of ALIAmides in the control of inflammatory processes has recently gained much attention and prompted the use of these molecules or their analogs, and the pharmacologic manipulation of their endogenous levels, as plausible therapeutic strategies in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory conditions. Since chronic  is mainly driven by cells of adaptive immunity, particularly T lymphocytes, we aimed at investigating whether such bioactive lipids could directly modulate T-cell responses. We found that OEA, PEA, and eicosatrienoyl ethanolamide (ETEA) could directly inhibit both T-cell responses by reducing their production of TNF-α and IFN-γ from CD8 T cells and TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17 from CD4 T cells. Furthermore, neither SEA nor docosatrienoyl ethanolamide (DTEA) could affect cytokine production from both T cell subsets.

We have shown that LytB cleaves the GlcNAc-β-(1,4)-MurNAc glycosidic bond of peptidoglycan building units. The hydrolysis occurs at sites with fully acetylated GlcNAc moieties, with preference for uncross-linked muropeptides. The necessity of GlcN acetylation and the presence of a single acidic moiety (Glu585) essential for catalysis strongly suggest a substrate-assisted mechanism with anchimeric assistance of the acetamido group of GlcNAc moieties. Additionally, modelling of the catalytic region bound to a hexasaccharide tripentapeptide provided insights into substrate-binding subsites and peptidoglycan recognition. Besides, cell-wall digestion products and solubilisation rates might indicate a tight control of LytB activity to prevent unrestrained breakdown of the cell wall.

Adrenergic receptor (AR) mechanisms using non-AR-selective (labetalol) as well as specific α-(prazosin) and β-(propranolol) receptor antagonists were tested. Results show that only labetalol and propranolol were able to recuperate cytotoxicity in the presence of NE, evidencing a β-receptor-mediated effect. The CB2 agonist, AM1241, inhibited phagocytosis at 10 µM and spontaneous peroxide release by PMNs. Use of the inverse CB2 receptor agonist SR144528 led to partial recuperation of ROS production, confirming the functional role of CB2. Additionally, AM1241 delayed early activation of monocytes and induced suppression of IL-2 and IL-6 levels in response to Candida via lower activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These findings provide new insights into key mechanisms of innate immunity under stressful conditions where ligands to the sympatho-adrenergic and EC system are released.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068752>Enhanced activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) in mesenteric but not epididymal fat correlates with higher production of epinephrine in mesenteric adipocytes in rat model of cachectic rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>Cachectic rheumatoid arthritis, the less frequent form of the disease, is associated with loss of fat mass and often more severe course of the disease. Its experimental model represents rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) characterized by edema, lack of appetite, sharp body weight and fat loss. As individual fat depots display functional differences, here we studied lipolytic activity and sensitivity to lipolytic stimuli of nodeless epididymal fat (eWAT) and perinodal mesenteric fat (mWAT) depots at the peak of AA. We also examined changes in catecholamine and cytokine levels involved in lipolysis in plasma and/or isolated adipocytes from both WATs to identify the contribution of local, adipocyte-based processes and/or systemic events to adiposity loss in cachectic rheumatoid arthritis. AA was induced to male Lewis rats by complete Freund's adjuvant. Groups of ad libitum-fed and pair-fed controls were used to distinguish the effects of food restriction from inflammation-induced cachexia. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and its phosphorylated form (pHSL) were analyzed by western blot. CRP and catecholamine levels in plasma or adipocyte lysates were determined using ELISA kits. Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1/CXCL1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and leptin in adipocyte lysate were analyzed by quantitative protein microarray. Plasma glycerol and FFA were measured spectrophotometrically. AA rats developed severe cachexia, with lower adiposity in mWAT compared to normal and pair-fed controls, whereas in eWAT the adiposity was similarly reduced in AA and pair-fed groups. ATGL levels in both WATs were not affected by AA or pair feeding. AA upregulated levels of HSL, pHSL and pHSL/HSL ratio in mWAT, whereas none of these parameters has changed in eWAT of AA rats or in either WATs of pair-fed rats. In AA rats plasma glycerol was elevated, whereas FFA concentration was reduced. Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were increased in AA compared with both groups of controls. In eWAT adipocytes, AA but not pair feeding, upregulated norepinephrine levels. In mWAT adipocytes, AA rats showed higher epinephrine levels than pair-fed controls. Leptin levels in both WATs were depleted in AA animals in accordance with body weight loss. None of the measured cytokines in eWAT and mWAT was enhanced. Our results demonstrate augmented lipolytic activity in mWAT and not eWAT during cachectic arthritis. The adipocyte-derived cytokines do not seem to contribute to activated lipolysis. We first demonstrated enhanced presence of norepinephrine in perinodal adipocytes that may contribute to the regulation of local lipolytic activity by auto/paracrine fashion and thus provide independent fuel supply to activated lymph nodes.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621717>Treatment response to indacaterol/glycopyrronium versus salmeterol/fluticasone in exacerbating COPD patients by gender: a post-hoc analysis in the FLAME study.</a></h2><p>The burden of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is increasing in women, with recent evidence suggesting gender differences in disease characteristics and potentially in treatment outcomes.FLAME was a 52-week randomized controlled trial in patients with severe-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbations. In this post-hoc analysis, gender-based baseline differences and treatment outcomes between indacaterol/glycopyrronium 110/50 μg once daily (IND/GLY) and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 twice daily (SFC) were assessed in terms of rate of exacerbations, time-to-first exacerbation, lung function, health status, and rescue medication use.This post-hoc analysis included 2557 men and 805 women. Baseline characteristics differed between genders, with women being younger, having better lung function and more often experiencing ≥2 exacerbations in the previous year. Compared with SFC, IND/GLY treatment was associated with reductions in the annualized rates of moderate/severe exacerbations (rate ratio [95% CI]: 0.81 [0.73-0.91], 0.89 [0.74-1.07] in men and women, respectively). Similarly, time-to-first moderate/severe exacerbation was also delayed (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.79 [0.70-0.89] and 0.76 [0.63-0.91] in men and women, respectively). Results were similar for all (mild/moderate/severe) exacerbations. Improvements in lung function, health status and rescue medication use with IND/GLY vs SFC were comparable between men and women. The smaller sample size for women may account for some observed discrepancies in treatment responses.Although there were gender differences in baseline characteristics, IND/GLY demonstrated similar trends for exacerbation prevention and lung function improvement in men and women with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbations compared with SFC. Small differences in the effects seen between genders may be attributed to the different sizes of the two groups and need to be further evaluated in randomized trials that are appropriately powered for gender analysis.Post hoc analysis of the FLAME study.

In the present study, the mutual modulation and underlying mechanism between norepinephrine and NO were explored in haemocytes of the scallop Chlamys farreri. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, NO production increased to a significant level at 24 h, and norepinephrine concentration rose to remarkable levels at 3 h and 12~48 h. A significant decrease of NO production was observed in the haemocytes concomitantly stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and α-adrenoceptor agonist, while a dramatic increase of NO production was observed in the haemocytes incubated with lipopolysaccharide and β-adrenoceptor agonist. Meanwhile, the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) decreased significantly in the haemocytes treated by lipopolysaccharide and α/β-adrenoceptor agonist, while the content of Ca(2+) was elevated in those triggered by lipopolysaccharide and β-adrenoceptor agonist. When the haemocytes was incubated with NO donor, norepinephrine concentration was significantly enhanced during 1~24 h. Collectively, these results suggested that norepinephrine exerted varied effects on NO production at different immune stages via a novel α/β-adrenoceptor-cAMP/Ca(2+) regulatory pattern, and NO might have a feedback effect on the synthesis of norepinephrine in the scallop haemocytes.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27015179>Neurometabolite Alterations Associated With Cognitive Performance in Perinatally HIV-Infected Children.</a></h2><p>Despite treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), cognitive impairment is still observed in perinatally HIV-infected children.

This cross-sectional study evaluated neurometabolites, as measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), in perinatally HIV-infected children stable on cART (n = 26) and healthy controls (n = 36).Participants were included from a cohort of perinatally HIV-infected children and healthy controls, matched group-wise for age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), myo-inositol (mI), and choline (Cho) levels were studied as ratios over creatine (Cre). Group differences and associations with HIV-related parameters, cognitive functioning, and neuronal damage markers (neurofilament and total Tau proteins) were determined using age-adjusted linear regression analyses.HIV-infected children had increased Cho:Cre in white matter (HIV-infected = 0.29 ± 0.03; controls = 0.27 ± 0.03; P value = 0.045).

We sought to determine whether MKP-1 contributed to catecholamine suppression of innate immunity and also wanted to know whether early catecholamine treatment after traumatic injury increases the risk of later nosocomial infection.We performed experiments using THP-1 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. We exposed cells to epinephrine and/or LPS and measured inflammatory gene transcription and MAP kinase activation. We inhibited MKP-1 activity to determine its role in catecholamine-induced immune suppression. Finally, we studied injured subjects to determine whether early catecholamine treatment was associated with nosocomial infection.Epinephrine increases MKP-1 transcripts and protein and decreases LPS-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation and TNF-α gene transcription. RNAi inhibition of MKP-1 at least partially restores LPS-induced TNF-α gene expression (p = 0.024).

These innate immune cells express CD18, an adhesion molecule that facilitates leukocyte activation. In the context of fatty liver, activation of infiltrated leukocytes is believed to enhance hepatocellular injury. The objective of this study was to determine the degree to which activated innate immune cells promote steatohepatitis by comparing hepatic outcomes in wild-type and CD18-mutant mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. After 3 weeks of MCD feeding, hepatocyte injury, based on serum ALT elevation, was 40% lower in CD18-mutant than wild-type mice. Leukocyte infiltration into the liver was not impaired in CD18-mutant mice, but leukocyte activation was markedly reduced, as shown by the lack of evidence of oxidant production. Despite having reduced hepatocellular injury, CD18-mutant mice developed significantly more hepatic steatosis than wild-type mice after MCD feeding. This coincided with greater hepatic induction of pro-inflammatory and lipogenic genes as well as a modest reduction in hepatic expression of adipose triglyceride lipase. Overall, the data indicate that CD18 deficiency curbs MCD-mediated liver injury by limiting the activation of innate immune cells in the liver without compromising intrahepatic cytokine activation. Reduced liver injury occurs at the expense of increased hepatic steatosis, which suggests that in addition to damaging hepatocytes, infiltrating leukocytes may influence lipid homeostasis in the liver.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935569>Anaesthesia, surgery, and life-threatening allergic reactions: management and outcomes in the 6th National Audit Project (NAP6).</a></h2><p>Anaphylaxis during anaesthesia is a serious complication for patients and anaesthetists.

Quality of management was assessed against published guidelines.Appropriately senior anaesthetists resuscitated all patients. Immediate management was 'good' in 46% and 'poor' in 15%. Recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis were prompt in 97% and 83% of cases, respectively. Epinephrine was administered i.v. in 76%, i.m. in 14%, both in 6%, and not at all in 11% of cases. A catecholamine infusion was administered in half of cases. Cardiac arrests (40 cases; 15%) were promptly treated but cardiac compressions were omitted in half of patients with unrecordable BP. The surgical procedure was abandoned in most cases, including 10% where surgery was urgent. Of 54% admitted to critical care, 70% were level 3, with most requiring catecholamine infusions. Ten (3.8%) patents (mostly elderly with cardiovascular disease) died from anaphylaxis. Corticosteroids and antihistamines were generally administered early. We found no clear evidence of harm or benefit from chlorphenamine. Two patients received vasopressin and one glucagon. Fluid administration was inadequate in 19% of cases. Treatment included sugammadex in 19 cases, including one when rocuronium had not been administered.

Here, we show that PAF-R agonists are produced in melanoma cells by chemotherapy that is administered in vitro, in vivo, or in human subjects. Structural characterization of the PAF-R agonists induced revealed multiple oxidized glycerophosphocholines that are generated nonenzymatically. In a murine model of melanoma, chemotherapeutic administration could augment tumor growth by a PAF-R-dependent process that could be blocked by treatment with antioxidants or COX-2 inhibitors or by depletion of regulatory T cells. Our findings reveal how PAF-R agonists induced by chemotherapy treatment can promote treatment failure.

In inflammatory bowel disease, sympathetic innervation in intestinal mucosa is reduced. Our aim was to investigate the role of sympathetic innervation to the intestine on regulation of the innate immune responses.In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, we evaluated the effect of adrenergic receptor activation on cytokine production and metabolic profile. In vivo, the effect of sympathetic denervation on mucosal innate immune responses using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or using surgical transection of the superior mesenteric nerve (sympathectomy) was tested in Rag1 mice that lack T- and B-lymphocytes.In murine macrophages, adrenergic β2 receptor activation elicited a dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokines, reduced LPS-induced glycolysis and increased maximum respiration. Sympathectomy led to a significantly decreased norepinephrine concentration in intestinal tissue. Within 14 days after sympathectomy, mice developed clinical signs of colitis, colon oedema and excess colonic cytokine production. Both 6-OHDA and sympathectomy led to prominent goblet cell depletion and histological damage of colonic mucosa.We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system plays a regulatory role in constraining innate immune cell reactivity towards microbial challenges, likely via the adrenergic β2 receptor.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366092>Transient enhancement of immune resistance functions in Litopenaeus vannamei through a low-dose octopamine injection.</a></h2><p>Octopamine (OA) is known to play an important role in regulating invertebrate immune responses.

Results showed significant increases in THC, semigranular cells (SGCs), and PO activity per 50 μL of haemolymph at 0.5-4 h; granular cells at 0.5-2 h; respiratory bursts (RBs) at 0.5-1 h; phagocytic activity at 2-4 h; and clearance efficiency at 2-8 h, but PO activity per granulocyte at 0.5-2 h significantly decreased after the OA injection. All of the immune parameters had returned to control values by 8 h after receiving OA except granular cells at 4 h, RBs at 2 h, clearance efficiency at 16 h, and PO activity per granulocyte at 4 h. However, no significant differences were observed in hyaline cells, RBs per haemocyte, lysozyme and SOD activities, glucose, or lactate during the experimental period. An injection of OA also significantly decreased the mortality of shrimp challenged with V. alginolyticus. In another experiment, the immune-related genes of transglutaminase-I, lipopolysaccharide- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein, prophenoloxidase-II, and peroxidase of shrimp that received 1000 pmol OA shrimp for 1 h were significantly higher than those of shrimp that received the saline control.

We studied the expression of multiple phospholipase A2 enzymes in human macrophages and the effect that polarization of the cells has on their levels. At least 11 phospholipase A2 genes were found at significant levels in human macrophages, as detected by quantitative PCR. None of these exhibited marked changes after treating the cells with IFN-γ plus LPS. However, macrophage treatment with IL-4 led to strong upregulation of the secreted group V phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-V), both at the mRNA and protein levels. In parallel with increasing sPLA2-V expression levels, IL-4-treated macrophages exhibited increased phagocytosis of yeast-derived zymosan and bacteria, and we show that both events are causally related, because cells deficient in sPLA2-V exhibited decreased phagocytosis, and cells overexpressing the enzyme manifested higher rates of phagocytosis. Mass spectrometry analyses of lipid changes in the IL-4-treated macrophages suggest that  lysophospholipid (LPE) is an sPLA2-V-derived product that may be involved in regulating phagocytosis. Cellular levels of LPE are selectively maintained by sPLA2-V. By supplementing sPLA2-V-deficient cells with LPE, phagocytosis of zymosan or bacteria was fully restored in IL-4-treated cells. Collectively, our results show that sPLA2-V is required for efficient phagocytosis by IL-4-treated human macrophages and provide evidence that sPLA2-V-derived LPE is involved in the process.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26941040>The Characterization of an Adrenergic Signalling System Involved in the Encystment of the Ocular Pathogen Acanthamoeba spp.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the receptor system involved in controlling encystment in Acanthamoeba using specific agonists and antagonists and to examine whether endogenous stores of catecholamines are produced by the organism.

In this study we investigated the isolation, chemical characterization, and immunostimulatory activity in vitro of the hemicelluloses from bamboo shavings. Shavings were first pretreated by steam explosion. The optimal pretreatment was found to be steam explosion at 2.2 MPa for 1 min. Following this pretreatment, the yield of hemicelluloses reached (2.05±0.22)% (based on the dry dewaxed raw materials), which was 5.7-fold higher than that of untreated samples. Bamboo-shavings hemicellulose (BSH) was then prepared by hot water extraction and ethanol precipitation from the steam-exploded shavings. Purification of BSH by anion-exchange chromatography of diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)-sepharose Fast Flow resulted in a neutral fraction (BSH-1, purity of 95.3%, yield of 1.06%) and an acidic fraction (BSH-2, purity of 92.5%, yield of 0.79%). The weight-average molecular weights (M) of BSH-1 and BSH-2 were 12 800 and 11 300 g/mol, respectively. Chemical and structural analyses by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1D (H and C) and 2D (heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC)) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed that BSH-1 was O-acetylated-arabinoxylan and BSH-2 was O-acetylated-(4-O-methylglucurono)-arabinoxylan. BSH-1 had a higher content of acetyl groups than BSH-2. For the immunomodulatory activity in vitro, BSH and BSH-2 significantly stimulated mouse splenocyte proliferation while BSH-1 had no effect; BSH, BSH-1, and BSH-2 markedly enhanced the phagocytosis activity and nitric oxide production of the murine macrophage RAW264.7 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that the water-extractable hemicelluloses from steam-exploded bamboo shavings are naturally acetylated and have immunostimulatory activity.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29880645>Choline transport links macrophage phospholipid metabolism and .</a></h2><p>Choline is an essential nutrient that is required for synthesis of the main eukaryote phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. Macrophages are innate immune cells that survey and respond to danger and damage signals. Although it is well-known that energy metabolism can dictate macrophage function, little is known as to the importance of choline homeostasis in macrophage biology. We hypothesized that the uptake and metabolism of choline are important for macrophage . Polarization of primary bone marrow macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an increased rate of choline uptake and higher levels of PC synthesis. This was attributed to a substantial increase in the transcript and protein expression of the choline transporter-like protein-1 (CTL1) in polarized cells. We next sought to determine the importance of choline uptake and CTL1 for macrophage immune responsiveness. Chronic pharmacological or CTL1 antibody-mediated inhibition of choline uptake resulted in altered cytokine secretion in response to LPS, which was associated with increased levels of diacylglycerol and activation of protein kinase C. These experiments establish a previously unappreciated link between choline phospholipid metabolism and macrophage immune responsiveness, highlighting a critical and regulatory role for macrophage choline uptake via the CTL1 transporter.© 2018 Snider et al.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30911771>Inter-kingdom signaling between gut microbiota and their host.</a></h2><p>The crosstalk between prokaryotic bacteria and eukaryotic gut epithelial cells has opened a new field for research. Quorum sensing system (QS) molecules employed by gut microbiota may play an essential role in host-microbial symbioses of the gut. Recent studies on the gut microbiome will unveil evolved mechanisms of the host to affect bacterial QS and shape bacterial composition. Bacterial autoinducers (AIs) could talk to the host's gut by eliciting proinflammatory effects and modulating the activities of T lymphocyte, macrophage, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In addition, the gut mucosa could interfere with bacterial AIs by degrading them or secreting AI mimics. Moreover, bacterial AIs and gut hormones epinephrine and noradrenaline may be interchangeable in the crosstalk between the microbiota and human gut. Therefore, inter-kingdom signaling between gut microbiota and host may provide a novel target in the management of gut microbiota-related conditions or diseases in the future.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26585860>The relationship between early-life environment, the epigenome and the microbiota.</a></h2><p>Children exposed to early-life adversity carry a greater risk of poor health and disease into adulthood.

We previously observed an increase in arrhythmias during spontaneous prolonged hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM. We examined changes in cardiac autonomic function and repolarization during sustained experimental hypoglycemia. Twelve adults with T2DM and 11 age- and BMI-matched control participants without diabetes underwent paired hyperinsulinemic clamps separated by 4 weeks. Glucose was maintained at euglycemia (6.0 mmol/L) or hypoglycemia (2.5 mmol/L) for 1 h. Heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rate variability were assessed every 30 min and corrected QT intervals and T-wave morphology every 60 min. Heart rate initially increased in participants with T2DM but then fell toward baseline despite maintained hypoglycemia at 1 h accompanied by reactivation of vagal tone. In control participants, vagal tone remained depressed during sustained hypoglycemia. Participants with T2DM exhibited greater heterogeneity of repolarization during hypoglycemia as demonstrated by T-wave symmetry and principal component analysis ratio compared with control participants. Epinephrine levels during hypoglycemia were similar between groups. Cardiac autonomic regulation during hypoglycemia appears to be time dependent. Individuals with T2DM demonstrate greater repolarization abnormalities for a given hypoglycemic stimulus despite comparable sympathoadrenal responses. These mechanisms could contribute to arrhythmias during clinical hypoglycemic episodes.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222010>Sympathetic neural signaling via the β2-adrenergic receptor suppresses T-cell receptor-mediated human and mouse CD8(+) T-cell effector function.</a></h2><p>Postganglionic sympathetic neurons innervate secondary lymphoid organs and secrete norepinephrine (NE) as the primary neurotransmitter. NE binds and signals through five distinct members of the adrenergic receptor family. In this study, we show elevated expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) on primary human CD8(+) effector memory T cells. Treatment of both human and murine CD8(+) T cells with NE decreased IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion and suppressed their cytolytic capacity in response to T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. The effects of NE were specifically reversed by β2-specific antagonists. Adrb2(-/-) CD8(+) T cells were completely resistant to the effects of NE. Further, the ADRB2-specific pharmacological ligand, albuterol, significantly suppressed effector functions in both human and mouse CD8(+) T cells. While both TCR activation and stimulation with IL-12 + IL-18 were able to induce inflammatory cytokine secretion, NE failed to suppress IFN-γ secretion in response to IL-12 + IL18. Finally, the long-acting ADRB2-specific agonist, salmeterol, markedly reduced the cytokine secretion capacity of CD8(+) T cells in response to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. This study reveals a novel intrinsic role for ADRB2 signaling in CD8(+) T-cell function and underscores the novel role this pathway plays in adaptive T-cell responses to infection.© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it remains unknown whether psychological stress plays a role in the in vivo immune response to exercise. We examined the relationship between anxiety and perceived psychological stress reported before exercise and in vivo  after exercise using skin sensitisation with Diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). In a randomised design, sixty four, thoroughly familiarised, males completed widely used psychological instruments to assess state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress before exercise, and ran either 30 minutes at 60% (30MI) or 80% (30HI) V . O2peak, 120 minutes at 60% (120MI) V . O2peak or rested (CON) before DPCP sensitisation. Cutaneous recall to DPCP was measured as the dermal thickening response to a low-dose series DPCP challenge 4-weeks after sensitisation. After accounting for exercise (R2 = 0.20; P < 0.01), multiple-regression showed that pre-exercise state-anxiety (STAI-S; ΔR2 = 0.19; P < 0.01) and perceived psychological stress (ΔR2 = 0.13; P < 0.05) were moderately associated with the DPCP response after exercise. The STAI-S scores before exercise were considered low-to-moderate in these familiarised individuals (median split; mean STAI-S of low 25 and moderate 34). Further examination showed that the DPCP response after exercise (30MI, 30HI or 120MI) was 62% lower in those reporting low vs. moderate state-anxiety before exercise (mean difference in dermal thickening: -2.6 mm; 95% CI: -0.8 to -4.4 mm; P < 0.01). As such, the results indicate a beneficial effect of moderate (vs. low) state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress on in vivo  after exercise. Moreover, correlations were of comparable strength for the relationship between physiological stress (heart rate training impulse) and the summed dermal response to DPCP (r = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.62; P = 0.01), and state-anxiety and the summed dermal response to DPCP (r = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.63; P < 0.01). In conclusion, state-anxiety and perceived psychological stress levels before exercise play animportant role in determining the strength of the in vivo immune response after exercise. These findings indicate a similar strength relationship for the level of state-anxiety prior to exercise and the level of physiological stress during exercise with the in vivo immune response after exercise. Future research is required to investigate exercise-immune responses in athletes, military personnel and others in physically demanding occupations experiencing higher levels of psychological stress than those reported in this study e.g. related to important competition, military operations and major life events. Nevertheless, the present findings support the recommendation that exercise scientists should account for anxiety and psychological stress when examining the immune response to exercise.Copyright © 2016 International Society of Exercise and Immunology.

A potential application is paediatric therapeutic dose monitoring (TDM) in acute severe asthma.At presentation, the children receive multiple doses of salbutamol (inhaled, nebulised and occasionally intravenous) but it is difficult to distinguish children who do not respond to treatment because of inadequate concentrations from those with toxicity, as symptoms are similar. A comparison was made between traditional dried blood spots (DBS) and the newly developed technique volumetric absorptive micro-sampling (VAMS), with specific investigation into the effect of drying time on analyte recovery.For both sampling techniques, the final assay demonstrated good precision and accuracy across the concentration range tested (3-100 ng/mL), including both the normal therapeutic and toxic range. The method was developed to comply with FDA guidelines with precision and accuracy ≤15% for all concentrations, except the limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) where they were ≤20%. VAMS offered advantages in sampling ease and reduced GC-MS interference. The assay was successfully applied to the quantification of blood salbutamol concentrations in three healthy volunteers dosed with 1 mg salbutamol by inhalation.This demonstrated its potential for use in paediatric TDM studies, where in the acute situation considerably higher doses of salbutamol will have been administered.

In this article, we demonstrate that β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) activation in LPS-stimulated DC does not impair their ability to promote T cell proliferation; however, it diminishes IL-12p70 secretion, leading to a shift in the IL-12p70/IL-23 ratio. Although β2AR stimulation in DC induces protein kinase A-dependent cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, the effect of changing the profile of cytokines produced upon LPS challenge occurs in a protein kinase A-independent manner and, rather, is associated with inhibition of the NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways. Moreover, as a consequence of the inverted IL-12p70/IL-23 ratio following β2AR stimulation, LPS-stimulated DC promoted the generation of CD4(+) T cells that, upon TCR engagement, produced lower amounts of IFN-γ and higher levels of IL-17. These findings provide new insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms by which β2AR stimulation in murine DC can influence the generation of adaptive immune responses and may explain some aspects of how sympathetic nervous system activity can modulate immune function.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26109853>Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, induces phagocytic activity in Greek COPD patients.</a></h2><p>A new approach to the treatment of COPD includes controlling inflammation because of its important role in exacerbation of the disease.

To understand the molecular details of PHS resistance, we analyzed the metabonomes of the transgenic and wild-type (control) wheat seeds at various stages using NMR and GC-FID/MS. 60 metabolites were dominant in these seeds including sugars, organic acids, amino acids, choline metabolites and fatty acids. At day-20 post-anthesis, only malate level in transgenic wheat differed significantly from that in controls whereas at day-30 post-anthesis, levels of amino acids and sucrose were significantly different between these two groups. For mature seeds, most metabolites in glycolysis, TCA cycle, choline metabolism, biosynthesis of proteins, nucleotides and fatty acids had significantly lower levels in transgenic seeds than in controls. After 30-days post-harvest ripening, most metabolites in transgenic seeds had higher levels than in controls including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, fatty acids, choline metabolites and NAD(+). These indicated that anti-trx-s lowered overall metabolic activities of mature seeds eliminating pre-harvest sprouting potential. Post-harvest ripening reactivated the metabolic activities of transgenic seeds to restore their germination vigor.

Here we report two cases of delayed hemolytic anemia in a patient with severe falciparum malaria after treatment with oral artemether-lumefantrine (AL). The first patient, a 20-year-old Japanese male student, was diagnosed with falciparum malaria and was administered AL. As having a high parasitemia rate (20.6%) was the only severe malaria criterion met in this case and his general condition was stable, we continued with AL treatment. Despite disappearance of malarial parasites after 4 days of AL administration, a persistent fever remained. On days 13 and 16, a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia was made (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]: 1,466 U/L, hemoglobin [Hb]: 7.2 g/dL). A blood smear at that time revealed no parasites. He recovered naturally from delayed hemolysis. The second patient, a 27-year-old Japanese female student, was diagnosed with falciparum malaria (parasitemia: 4.5%) and treated initially with oral quinine hydrochloride and doxycycline. The following day, parasitemia increased to 7.9% and oral AL was initiated. She was discharged on day 4 after achieving parasite clearance and afebrility. However, on day 5, fever (body temperature > 38°C) recurred, and on day 11, a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia was made (LDH: 712 U/L, Hb: 8.8 g/dL). A follow-up confirmed that her condition improved gradually. AL treatment of severe malaria can cause delayed hemolytic anemia.

Importantly, their complex metabolism represents a highly controlled cellular signaling network that is essential for mounting an effective innate immune response. Phospholipids in innate cells are subject to dynamic regulation by enzymes, whose activities are highly responsive to activation status. Along with their metabolic products, they regulate multiple aspects of innate immune cell biology, including shape change, aggregation, blood clotting, and degranulation. Phospholipid hydrolysis provides substrates for cell-cell communication, enables regulation of hemostasis, immunity, thrombosis, and vascular , and is centrally important in cardiovascular disease and associated comorbidities. Phospholipids themselves are also recognized by innate-like T cells, which are considered essential for recognition of infection or cancer, as well as self-antigens.

In Papua New Guinea (PNG), artemether-lumefantrine is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, but it has limited efficacy against P. vivax. Artemisinin-naphthoquine should have greater activity in vivax malaria because the elimination of naphthoquine is slower than that of lumefantrine. In this study, the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of these ACTs were assessed in PNG children aged 0.5-5 y.An open-label, randomized, parallel-group trial of artemether-lumefantrine (six doses over 3 d) and artemisinin-naphthoquine (three daily doses) was conducted between 28 March 2011 and 22 April 2013. Parasitologic outcomes were assessed without knowledge of treatment allocation. Primary endpoints were the 42-d P. falciparum PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitologic response (ACPR) and the P. vivax PCR-uncorrected 42-d ACPR. Non-inferiority and superiority designs were used for falciparum and vivax malaria, respectively. Because the artemisinin-naphthoquine regimen involved three doses rather than the manufacturer-specified single dose, the first 188 children underwent detailed safety monitoring. Of 2,542 febrile children screened, 267 were randomized, and 186 with falciparum and 47 with vivax malaria completed the 42-d follow-up. Both ACTs were safe and well tolerated. P. falciparum ACPRs were 97.8% and 100.0% in artemether-lumefantrine and artemisinin-naphthoquine-treated patients, respectively (difference 2.2% [95% CI -3.0% to 8.4%] versus -5.0% non-inferiority margin, p = 0.24), and P. vivax ACPRs were 30.0% and 100.0%, respectively (difference 70.0% [95% CI 40.9%-87.2%], p<0.001). Limitations included the exclusion of 11% of randomized patients with sub-threshold parasitemias on confirmatory microscopy and direct observation of only morning artemether-lumefantrine dosing.Artemisinin-naphthoquine is non-inferior to artemether-lumefantrine in PNG children with falciparum malaria but has greater efficacy against vivax malaria, findings with implications in similar geo-epidemiologic settings within and beyond Oceania.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12610000913077.

However, the contribution of the host metabolome is not known.The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of host metabolites in genital Ct infection.We used high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and mapped lipid profiles in genital swabs obtained from female guinea pigs at days 3, 9, 15, 30 and 65 post Ct serovar D intravaginal infection.Across all time points assessed, 13 distinct lipid species including choline,  and glycerol were detected. Amongst these metabolites, phosphatidylcholine (PC) was the predominant phospholipid detected from animals actively shedding bacteria i.e., at 3, 9, and 15 days post infection. However, at days 30 and 65 when the animals had cleared the infection, PC was observed to be decreased compared to previous time points. Mass spectrometry analyses of PC produced in guinea pigs (in vivo) and 104C1 guinea pig cell line (in vitro) revealed distinct PC species following Ct D infection. Amongst these, PC 16:0/18:1 was significantly upregulated following Ct D infection ( < 0.05, >twofold change) in vivo and in vitro infection models investigated in this report. Exogenous addition of PC 16:0/18:1 resulted in significant increase in Ct D in Hela 229 cells.This study demonstrates a role for host metabolite, PC 16:0/18:1 in regulating genital Ct infection in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30069878>Increased β2-adrenoceptor phosphorylation in airway smooth muscle in severe asthma: possible role of mast cell-derived growth factors.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether growth factors produced by activated human lung mast cells (HLMCs) impair β -adrenoceptor (β -AR) function in human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Protein array analysis confirmed the presence of various growth factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, in the supernatants of high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)-activated HLMCs which, when applied to ASM cells, impaired albuterol-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, an effect that was prevented following neutralization of TGF-β1. This blunted β -AR response was reproduced by treating ASM cells with TGF-β1 or fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, which induced β -AR phosphorylation at tyrosine residues Tyr and Tyr , and significantly reduced the maximal bronchorelaxant responses to isoproterenol in human precision cut lung slices (PCLS). Finally, ASM cells isolated from severe asthmatics displayed constitutive elevated β -AR phosphorylation at both Tyr and Tyr and a reduced relaxant response to albuterol. This study shows for the first time that abnormal β -AR phosphorylation/function in ASM cells that is induced rapidly by HLMC-derived growth factors, is present constitutively in cells from severe asthmatics.© 2018 British Society for Immunology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608913>Bidirectional Counterregulation of Human Lung Mast Cell and Airway Smooth Muscle β2 Adrenoceptors.</a></h2><p>Human lung mast cells (HLMCs) play a central role in asthma pathogenesis through their relocation to the airway smooth muscle (ASM) bundles. β2 adrenoceptor (β2-AR)-agonists are used to relieve bronchoconstriction in asthma, but may reduce asthma control, particularly when used as monotherapy. We hypothesized that HLMC and human ASM cell (HASMC) responsiveness to β2-AR agonists would be attenuated when HLMCs are in contact with HASMCs. Cells were cultured in the presence of the short-acting β2-agonist albuterol, and the long-acting β2-agonists formoterol and olodaterol. Constitutive and FcεRI-dependent HLMC histamine release, HASMC contraction, and β2-AR phosphorylation at Tyr(350) were assessed. Constitutive HLMC histamine release was increased in HLMC-HASMC coculture and this was enhanced by β2-AR agonists. Inhibition of FcεRI-dependent HLMC mediator release by β2-agonists was greatly reduced in HLMC-HASMC coculture. These effects were reversed by neutralization of stem cell factor (SCF) or cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1). β2-AR agonists did not prevent HASMC contraction when HLMCs were present, but this was reversed by fluticasone. β2-AR phosphorylation at Tyr(350) occurred within 5 min in both HLMCs and HASMCs when the cells were cocultured, and was inhibited by neutralizing SCF or CADM1. HLMC interactions with HASMCs via CADM1 and Kit inhibit the potentially beneficial effects of β2-AR agonists on these cells via phosphorylation of the β2-AR. These results may explain the potentially adverse effects of β2-ARs agonists when used for asthma therapy. Targeting SCF and CADM1 may enhance β2-AR efficacy, particularly in corticosteroid-resistant patients.Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709709>Tissue-selective alteration of  plasmalogen metabolism in dedifferentiated colon mucosa.</a></h2><p>Human colon lipid analysis by imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) demonstrates that the lipid fingerprint is highly sensitive to a cell's pathophysiological state. Along the colon crypt axis, and concomitant to the differentiation process, certain lipid species tightly linked to signaling (phosphatidylinositols and arachidonic acid (AA)-containing diacylglycerophospholipids), change following a rather simple mathematical expression. We extend here our observations to  plasmalogens (PlsEtn), a unique type of glycerophospholipid presenting a vinyl ether linkage at sn-1 position. PlsEtn distribution was studied in healthy, adenomatous, and carcinomatous colon mucosa sections by IMS. In epithelium, 75% of PlsEtn changed in a highly regular manner along the crypt axis, in clear contrast with diacyl species (67% of which remained constant). Consistently, AA-containing PlsEtn species were more abundant at the base, where stem cells reside, and decreased while ascending the crypt. In turn, mono-/diunsaturated species experienced the opposite change. These gradients were accompanied by a gradual expression of ether lipid synthesis enzymes. In lamina propria, 90% of stromal PlsEtn remained unchanged despite the high content of AA and the gradient in AA-containing diacylglycerophospholipids. Finally, both lipid and protein gradients were severely affected in polyps and carcinoma. These results link PlsEtn species regulation to cell differentiation for the first time and confirm that diacyl and ether species are differently regulated. Furthermore, they reaffirm the observations on cell lipid fingerprint image sensitivity to predict cell pathophysiological status, reinforcing the translational impact both lipidome and IMS might have in clinical research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of sepsis on heart rate (HR), HR variability, and conduction parameters in a murine model of sepsis. Electrocardiograms were recorded noninvasively from conscious mice before and after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham surgery. Responses of isolated atria to tyramine and isoproterenol were quantified to assess the functional state of sympathetic nerves and postjunctional sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation. Cecal ligation and puncture mice had lower HR compared with sham at 16 to 18 h postsurgery (sham, 741 ± 7 beats/min; CLP, 557 ± 31 beats/min; n = 6/group; P < 0.001), and there was significant prolongation of the PR, QRS, and QTc intervals. Slowing of HR and conduction developed within 4 to 6 h after CLP and were preceded by a decrease in HR variability. Treatment of CLP mice with isoproterenol (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at 25 h after surgery failed to increase HR or decrease conduction intervals. The lack of in vivo response to isoproterenol cannot be attributed to hypothermia because robust chronotropic and inotropic responses to isoproterenol were evoked from isolated atria at 25 °C and 30 °C. These findings demonstrate that impaired regulation of HR (i.e., reduced HR variability) develops before the onset of overt cardiac rate and conduction changes in septic mice. Subsequent time-dependent decreases in HR and cardiac conduction can be attributed to hypothermia and would contribute to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion. Because isolated atria from septic mice showed normal responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation, we conclude that impaired effectiveness of isoproterenol in vivo can be attributed to reversible effects of systemic factors on adrenergic receptors and/or postreceptor signaling.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675448>Inhibition of microsomal PGE synthase-1 reduces human vascular tone by increasing PGI : a safer alternative to COX-2 inhibition.</a></h2><p>The side effects of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors on the cardiovascular system could be associated with reduced prostaglandin (PG)I synthesis. Microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1) catalyses the formation of PGE from COX-derived PGH . This enzyme is induced under inflammatory conditions and constitutes an attractive target for novel anti-inflammatory drugs. However, it is not known whether mPGES-1 inhibitors could be devoid of cardiovascular side effects. The aim of this study was to compare, in vitro, the effects of mPGES-1 and COX-2 inhibitors on vascular tone in human blood vessels.The vascular tone and prostanoid release from internal mammary artery (IMA) and saphenous vein (SV) incubated for 30 min with inhibitors of mPGES-1 or COX-2 were investigated under normal and inflammatory conditions.In inflammatory conditions, mPGES-1 and COX-2 proteins were more expressed, and increased levels of PGE and PGI were released. COX-2 and NOS inhibitors increased noradrenaline induced vascular contractions in IMA under inflammatory conditions while no effect was observed in SV. Interestingly, the mPGES-1 inhibitor significantly reduced (30-40%) noradrenaline-induced contractions in both vessels. This effect was reversed by an IP (PGI receptor) antagonist but not modified by NOS inhibition. Moreover, PGI release was increased with the mPGES-1 inhibitor and decreased with the COX-2 inhibitor, while both inhibitors reduced PGE release.In contrast to COX-2 inhibition, inhibition of mPGES-1 reduced vasoconstriction by increasing PGI synthesis. Targeting mPGES-1 could provide a lower risk of cardiovascular side effects, compared with those of the COX-2 inhibitors.This article is part of a themed section on Targeting Inflammation to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk.

We analysed pooled data from two replicate, double-blind studies of olodaterol (5 µg QD via Respimat) compared to formoterol (12 µg twice daily [BID]) or placebo over 48 weeks (1222.13, ; 1222.14, ). Patients could continue their background treatment. The analysis considered adverse events (AEs) typically associated with β-agonists, including cardiovascular events, as well as administration-related events. Descriptive statistics were provided for the incidence of AEs and aggregated AEs. The analysis included 1379 patients: 460 placebo, 459 olodaterol and 460 formoterol; AEs were reported by 70.9, 71.7 and 69.1% of patients, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of cardiac AEs (arrhythmia and myocardial ischaemia) and cough were numerically lower in the olodaterol group than the formoterol group, while nasopharyngitis, throat irritation, metabolism and psychiatric disorders were numerically higher in the olodaterol group. The most frequent event in the olodaterol group was nasopharyngitis (placebo 8.0%; olodaterol 12.9%; formoterol 10.0%). Except for cough (incidence rate ratio of 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.24, 0.89] in favour of olodaterol), there were no significant differences between active groups. In conclusion, olodaterol 5 µg QD was well tolerated over 48 weeks with a typical β-agonist safety profile comparable to formoterol 12 µg BID.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30245326>An integrated portable system for single chip simultaneous measurement of multiple disease associated metabolites.</a></h2><p>Metabolites, the small molecules that underpin life, can act as indicators of the physiological state of the body when their abundance varies, offering routes to diagnosis of many diseases. The ability to assay for multiple metabolites simultaneously will underpin a new generation of precision diagnostic tools. Here, we report the development of a handheld device based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology with multiple isolated micro-well reaction zones and integrated optical sensing allowing simultaneous enzyme-based assays of multiple metabolites (choline, xanthine, sarcosine and cholesterol) associated with multiple diseases. These metabolites were measured in clinically relevant concentration range with minimum concentrations measured: 25 μM for choline, 100 μM for xanthine, 1.25 μM for sarcosine and 50 μM for cholesterol. Linking the device to an Android-based user interface allows for quantification of metabolites in serum and urine within 2 min of applying samples to the device. The quantitative performance of the device was validated by comparison to accredited tests for cholesterol and glucose.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Exposure of primary murine dermal microvascular endothelial cells (pDMECs) to NE followed by co-culture with Langerhans cells (LCs), responsive CD4 T-cells and antigen resulted in modulation of CD4 T-cell responses. NE-treatment of pDMECs induced increased production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17A while down-regulating interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-22 release. This effect did not require contact between pDMECs and LCs or T-cells and depended upon pDMEC production of IL-6. The presence of NE-treated pDMECs increased the proportion of CD4 T-cells expressing intracellular IL-17A and increased IL-17A mRNA while decreasing the proportion of IFN-γ- or IL-22-expressing CD4 T-cells and mRNA levels for those cytokines. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR-γt) mRNA was significantly increased in CD4 T-cells while T-box transcription factor (T-bet) mRNA was decreased. Intradermal administration of NE prior to hapten immunization at the injection site produced a similar bias in draining lymph node CD4 T-cells towards IL-17A and away from IFN-γ and IL-22 production. Under stress, release of NE may have significant regulatory effects on the outcome of antigen presentation through actions on ECs with enhancement of inflammatory skin disorders involving IL-17/T helper type 17 (Th17) cells.© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26631175>Proteomic Analysis of Neutrophil Priming by PAF.</a></h2><p>Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are the main cells of the innate  inflammatory response. Several factors can activate or stimulate neutrophils, including platelet-activating factor (PAF), a lipid mediator. Some authors consider the activation induced by PAF priming because it triggers limited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and it amplifies the response of the cell to a subsequent activator. The stimulation is reversible, which is critical for modulating the inflammatory response. Exacerbated inflammatory responses lead to serious diseases, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), among others. Characterizing the stimulation of neutrophils during the possible reversion or prevention of an exaggerated inflammatory response is critical for the development of control strategies. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to identify 36 proteins that differ in abundance between quiescent neutrophils and PAFstimulated neutrophils. The identified proteins were associated with increased DNA repair processes, calcium flux, protein transcription, cytoskeleton alterations that facilitate migration and degranulation, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and proteins that modulate the inflammatory response. Some of the identified proteins have not been previously reported in neutrophils.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475022>Innate immune function after breast, lung, and colorectal cancer surgery.</a></h2><p>The cytotoxic activity and count of natural killer (NK) cells appear to be reduced after surgery; however, it is unknown whether the magnitude of this immune suppression is similar among different types of oncological surgery.

Cytotoxicity assays were performed to measure the function of NK cells. We also determined the plasma concentrations of interleukins (IL) 2 and 4, interferon-γ, granzyme B, perforin, soluble major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A, and epinephrine, both before and 24 h after surgery. Differences in immunologic parameters were compared preoperatively and postoperatively and by type of surgery. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.The preoperative NK cell count differed statistically (P < 0.006) among all three types of surgeries; however, within surgery postoperative counts and changes compared with baseline did not. The postoperative function of NK cells was similar among types of surgeries, but was significantly reduced compared with preoperative levels (mastectomy P < 0.0001, thoracotomy P = 0.001, and liver resections P = 0.002). We observed a significant increase in the postoperative plasma concentrations of epinephrine, whereas the concentrations of major histocompatibility class I polypeptide-related sequence A and the IL-2 and/or IL-4 ratio remained unchanged before and after surgery.The magnitude of innate immune suppression is similar among different oncological procedures.

The incorporation of ChoP on the LPS surface involves the lic1 operon, which consists of the licA, licB, licC, and licD genes. Among which, licB is a choline transporter gene required for acquisition of choline from environmental sources. In this study, we investigated the pathogenesis of the licB gene in an aged mice infection model. Due to immediate clearance of H. influenzae upon infection in mice, we employed influenza A virus and H. influenzae co-infection model. Our data showed that in the co-infection model, the secondary bacterial infection with a very low H. influenzae concentration of 100 colony forming unit is lethal to the aged mice. Although we did not observe any differences in weight loss between parent and licB mutant strains during the course of infection, a significant reduction of lung tissue damage was observed in the licB mutant infected aged mice. These results suggest that the licB gene is a virulence factor during H. influenzae infection in the lung in aged mice, possibly due to the increased binding to the host cell receptor via ChoP expression on the bacterial surface. In addition, when aged mice and mature mice were compared in the challenge experiments, we did not observe any protective  in the co-infection model suggesting the detrimental effects of the secondary bacterial infection on the aged mice in contrast to obvious immune-protections observed in the mature mice. The results of our experiments also implied that the co-infection model with influenza A virus and H. influenzae may be employed as a model system to study H. influenzae pathogenesis in vivo in aged mice.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we combine DNA stable isotope probing with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and C-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by metagenome data assembly, to identify the key microbes responsible for methanogenesis from choline. Microcosm incubation with C-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identifies Deltaproteobacteria of the genera Pelobacter as the major choline utilizers. Methanogenic Archaea of the genera Methanococcoides become enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of metagenomic DNA results in the identification of bins classified as Pelobacter and Methanococcoides. Analyses of these bins reveal that Pelobacter have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway.

At the end of the feeding trial, fish were challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus. Meanwhile, plasma proteomics of fish in each group were also evaluated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and differentially expressed proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrophotometry (MS/MS), then a Western blot analysis or real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm differential expressions of immune-enhancing proteins. Results showed that choline significantly increased survival of E. coioides 48 days after being injected with V. alginolyticus. From maps of plasma proteins, a comparative analysis between the control and choline groups revealed that 111 spots matched, with 26 altered expression spots in the choline group. Of these 26 spots, 16 were upregulated and 10 downregulated. After protein identification by reverse-phase nano-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization MS/MS analysis, eight of 26 proteins were found to be immune-related proteins, all of which were upregulated, including complement 3 (C3), alpha-2-macroglobulin-P-like isoform (A2M), fibrinogen beta chain precursor (FBG), and immunoglobulin heavy constant mu (Ighm) proteins. Expression of the A2M protein and A2M enzyme activity in plasma of fish fed choline significantly increased compared to the control group. Additionally, A2M messenger (m)RNA transcripts were also upregulated in the liver and kidneys. Significantly higher C3 expressions at both the mRNA and protein levels were detected in the liver of fish in the choline group. Moreover, FBG gene expressions in the liver and kidneys significantly increased, while Ighm increased in the kidneys and spleen of fish in the choline group.

The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) are beneficial for cardiovascular health, with potential to improve the dysregulated adaptive immune responses associated with metabolic imbalance. We aimed to explore the mechanisms through which n-3PUFA may alter T cell motility and tissue distribution to promote a less inflammatory environment and improve lymphocyte function in CVMD.Using mass spectrometry lipidomics, cellular, biochemical, and in vivo and ex vivo analyses, we investigated how eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main n-3PUFA, modify the trafficking patterns of activated CD4+ T cells. In mice subjected to allogeneic immunization, a 3-week n-3PUFA-enriched diet reduced the number of effector memory CD4+ T cells found in adipose tissue, and changed the profiles of eicosanoids, octadecanoids, docosanoids, endocannabinoids, 2-monoacylglycerols, N-acyl  and ceramides, in plasma, lymphoid organs and fat tissues. These bioactive lipids exhibited differing chemotactic properties when tested in chemotaxis assays with activated CD4+ T cells in vitro. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells treated with EPA and DHA showed a significant reduction in chemokinesis, as assessed by trans-endothelial migration assays, and, when implanted in recipient mice, demonstrated less efficient migration to the inflamed peritoneum. Finally, EPA and DHA treatments reduced the number of polarised CD4+ T cells in vitro, altered the phospholipid composition of membrane microdomains and decreased the activity of small Rho GTPases, Rhoα and Rac1 instrumental in cytoskeletal dynamics.Our findings suggest that EPA and DHA affect the motility of CD4+ T cells and modify their ability to reach target tissues by interfering with the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for cell migration. This can explain, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory effects of n-3PUFA supporting their potential use in interventions aiming to address adipocyte low grade inflammation associated with cardiovascular metabolic disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, we have shown that NE utilizes redox signaling as evidenced by increased superoxide (O2●-) causally linked to the observed changes in these cells; however, the source of this reactive oxygen species (ROS) remains elusive. Herein, we hypothesized that the source of increased O2●- in NE-stimulated T-lymphocytes is due to disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics. To address this hypothesis, we utilized purified mouse splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes stimulated with NE and assessed O2●- levels, mitochondrial metabolism, cellular proliferation, and cytokine profiles. We demonstrate that the increase in O2●- levels in response to NE is time-dependent and occurs at later points of T-lymphocyte activation. Moreover, the source of O2●- was indeed the mitochondria as evidenced by enhanced MitoSOX Red oxidation as well as abrogation of this signal by the addition of the mitochondrial-targeted O2●--scavenging antioxidant MitoTempol. NE-stimulated T-lymphocytes also demonstrated decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which suggests disruption of mitochondrial metabolism and the potential source of increased mitochondrial O2●-. The effects of NE in regards to redox signaling appear to be adrenergic receptor-dependent as specific receptor antagonists could reverse the increase in O2●-; however, differential receptors regulating these processes were observed in CD4+ versus CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Finally, mitochondrial O2●- was shown to be mechanistic to the NE-mediated T-lymphocyte phenotype as supplementation of MitoTempol could reverse specific changes in cytokine expression observed with NE treatment. Overall, these studies indicate that mitochondrial metabolism and O2●--mediated redox signaling play a regulatory role in the T-lymphocyte response to NE.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26081138>NMR-Based Serum Metabolomics Discriminates Takayasu Arteritis from Healthy Individuals: A Proof-of-Principle Study.</a></h2><p>Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a debilitating, systemic disease that involves the aorta and large arteries in a chronic inflammatory process that leads to vessel stenosis. Initially, the disease remains clinically silent (or remains undetected) until the patients present with vascular occlusion. Therefore, new methods for appropriate and timely diagnosis of TA cases are needed to start proper therapy on time and also to monitor the patient's response to the given treatment. In this context, NMR-based serum metabolomic profiling has been explored in this proof-of-principle study for the first time to determine characteristic metabolites that could be potentially helpful for diagnosis and prognosis of TA. Serum metabolic profiling of TA patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 30) was performed using 1D (1)H NMR spectroscopy, and possible biomarker metabolites were identified. Using projection to least-squares discriminant analysis, we could distinguish TA patients from healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, TA patients had (a) increased serum levels of choline metabolites, LDL cholesterol, N-acetyl glycoproteins (NAGs), and glucose and (b) decreased serum levels of lactate, lipids, HDL cholesterol, and glucogenic amino acids.

This study aimed to investigate potential effects of Tr14 on the exercise-induced immune response. In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, healthy, untrained male subjects received either Tr14 (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for 24 h after a strenuous experimental exercise trial on a bicycle (60 min at 80%VO2 max). A range of antigen-stimulated cytokines (in vitro), white blood cell count, lymphocyte activation and apoptosis markers, and indicators of muscle damage were assessed up to 24 h following exercise. The area under the curve with respect to the increase (AUCI ) was compared between both groups. The Tr14 group showed a reduced exercise-induced leukocytosis and neutrocytosis (P < 0.01 for both), a higher AUCI score of antigen-stimulated IL-1β and IL-1α (absolute and per monocyte, all P < 0.05), a lower AUCI score of antigen-stimulated GM-CSF (P < 0.05) and by trend a lower AUCI score of antigen-stimulated IL-2 and IL-4 as well as a higher AUCI score of antigen-stimulated IL-6 (all P < 0.1). Tr14 might promote differentiated effects on the exercise-induced immune response by (a) decreasing the inflammatory response of the innate immune system; and (b) augmenting the pro-inflammatory cytokine response.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

According to ICD-10, nether acute nor chronic adenoiditis should be considered as a self-consistent nosological entity. Acute adenoiditis is usually regarded as a form of acute nasopharyngitis (J02) or acute respiratory viral infection (J06.9) whereas chronic adenoiditis is commonly referred to as representing other chronic diseases of the tonsils and adenoids (J 35.8). The reactive changes in the nasopharyngeal tonsils begin to be manifested on days 3-5 after the onset of acute respiratory viral infection; thereafter, they persist and gradually disappear within the next 2-3 weeks. In the majority of the cases, acute adenoiditis is actually a physiological reaction of the nasopharyngeal tonsils as the organs of regional mucosal  to antigenic stimulation. There is no universally accepted opinion as regards the duration of the inflammatory process which would allow these pathological changes to be considered as turned into chronic ones. This condition is actually not a serious pathology provided it is not associated with the concomitant complications and produces no clinically significant effect on the child's quality of life. Under practical conditions, such children are most frequently treated with the use of irrigation therapy. Taking into account that otorhinolaryngologists all over the world do not consider chronic adenoiditis as an independent nosological entity but distinguish only hypertrophy of adenoid vegetations or chronic rhinosinusitis (in the presence of inflammatory changes in the nasopharynx), it appears correct to speak about chronic adenoiditis provided the clinical manifestations of the disease persist for more than 12 weeks. Based on the predominant etiological component, the viral, bacterial, and allergic forms of nasopharyngeal adenoiditis can be distinguished even though it is rather difficult to actually determine which etiological factor prevails in each concrete case. The aforedescribed situation poses a large number of questions pertaining to the choice of either systemic or topical antibacterial therapy.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26959112>Radiation therapy generates platelet-activating factor agonists.</a></h2><p>Pro-oxidative stressors can suppress host  due to their ability to generate oxidized lipid agonists of the platelet-activating factor-receptor (PAF-R). As radiation therapy also induces reactive oxygen species, the present studies were designed to define whether ionizing radiation could generate PAF-R agonists and if these lipids could subvert host . We demonstrate that radiation exposure of multiple tumor cell lines in-vitro, tumors in-vivo, and human subjects undergoing radiation therapy for skin tumors all generate PAF-R agonists. Structural characterization of radiation-induced PAF-R agonistic activity revealed PAF and multiple oxidized glycerophosphocholines that are produced non-enzymatically. In a murine melanoma tumor model, irradiation of one tumor augmented the growth of the other (non-treated) tumor in a PAF-R-dependent process blocked by a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor. These results indicate a novel pathway by which PAF-R agonists produced as a byproduct of radiation therapy could result in tumor treatment failure, and offer important insights into potential therapeutic strategies that could improve the overall antitumor effectiveness of radiation therapy regimens.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28161165>Supplemental methionine, choline, or taurine alter in vitro gene network expression of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from neonatal Holstein calves.</a></h2><p>Isolated PMNL from neonatal calves were used to evaluate the effect of Met, choline, and taurine supplementation on mRNA expression of genes related to the Met cycle and innate . Five neonatal Holstein calves (3 wk old) were used for PMNL isolation and in vitro culture. The selected genes were related to the 1-carbon and Met cycles, cell signaling and cytokine mediators, inflammation, antimicrobial and killing mechanism associated genes, immune mediators, adhesion, and pathogen recognition. The results indicated that supplementation of Met, choline, and taurine increased homocysteine synthesis through upregulation of SAHH. Furthermore, the lower expression of CXCR1, IL10, IL6, IRAK1, NFKB1, NR3C1, SELL, TLR4, and TNFA indicated that all treatments mitigated the inflammatory activation of blood PMNL. As indicated by the modulation of GCLC and GPX1, choline and taurine supplementation also affected the antioxidant system.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) can reduce transmission when widely distributed in a campaign setting. Modelling mass antimalarial campaigns can elucidate how to most effectively deploy drug-based interventions and quantitatively compare the effects of cure, prophylaxis, and transmission-blocking in suppressing parasite prevalence.A previously established agent-based model that includes innate and adaptive  was used to simulate malaria infections and transmission. Pharmacokinetics of artemether, lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, and primaquine were modelled with a double-exponential distribution-elimination model including weight-dependent parameters and age-dependent dosing. Drug killing of asexual parasites and gametocytes was calibrated to clinical data. Mass distribution of ACTs and primaquine was simulated with seasonal mosquito dynamics at a range of transmission intensities.A single mass campaign with antimalarial drugs is insufficient to permanently reduce malaria prevalence when transmission is high. Current diagnostics are insufficiently sensitive to accurately identify asymptomatic infections, and mass-screen-and-treat campaigns are much less efficacious than mass drug administrations. Improving campaign coverage leads to decreased prevalence one month after the end of the campaign, while increasing compliance lengthens the duration of protection against reinfection. Use of a long-lasting prophylactic as part of a mass drug administration regimen confers the most benefit under conditions of high transmission and moderately high coverage. Addition of primaquine can reduce prevalence but exerts its largest effect when coupled with a long-lasting prophylactic.Mass administration of antimalarial drugs can be a powerful tool to reduce prevalence for a few months post-campaign. A slow-decaying prophylactic administered with a parasite-clearing drug offers strong protection against reinfection, especially in highly endemic areas. Transmission-blocking drugs have only limited effects unless administered with a prophylactic under very high coverage.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27986511>Anaphylaxis after zoster vaccine: Implicating alpha-gal allergy as a possible mechanism.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27875314>Receptor MER Tyrosine Kinase Proto-oncogene (MERTK) Is Not Required for Transfer of Bis-retinoids to the Retinal Pigmented Epithelium.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of bis-retinoids in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is a hallmark of aging and retinal disorders such as Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration. These aberrant fluorescent condensation products, including di-retinoid-pyridinium- (A2E), are thought to be transferred to RPE cells primarily through phagocytosis of the photoreceptor outer segments. However, we observed by two-photon microscopy that mouse retinas incapable of phagocytosis due to a deficiency of the c-Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (Mertk) nonetheless contained fluorescent retinoid condensation material in their RPE. Primary RPE cells from Mertk mice also accumulated fluorescent products in vitro Finally, quantification of A2E demonstrated the acquisition of retinal condensation products in Mertk mouse RPE prior to retinal degeneration. In these mice, we identified activated microglial cells that likely were recruited to transport A2E-like condensation products to the RPE and dispose of the dying photoreceptor cells.

Neutrophilic airway inflammation and neutrophil-derived proteases have been linked to disease progression in conditions such as COPD and cystic fibrosis, but the effects of hypoxia on potentially harmful neutrophil functional responses such as degranulation are unknown.Following exposure to hypoxia (0.8% oxygen, 3 kPa for 4 h), neutrophils stimulated with inflammatory agonists (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor or platelet-activating factor and formylated peptide) displayed a markedly augmented (twofold to sixfold) release of azurophilic (neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase), specific (lactoferrin) and gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinase-9) granule contents. Neutrophil supernatants derived under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions induced extensive airway epithelial cell detachment and death, which was prevented by coincubation with the antiprotease α-1 antitrypsin; both normoxic and hypoxic supernatants impaired ciliary function. Surprisingly, the hypoxic upregulation of neutrophil degranulation was not dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), nor was it fully reversed by inhibition of phospholipase C signalling. Hypoxia augmented the resting and cytokine-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT, and inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)γ (but not other PI3K isoforms) prevented the hypoxic upregulation of neutrophil elastase release.Hypoxia augments neutrophil degranulation and confers enhanced potential for damage to respiratory airway epithelial cells in a HIF-independent but PI3Kγ-dependent fashion.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Phagocytosis involves membrane reorganization and remodeling events on the cell surface, which play an essential role in innate  and tissue homeostasis and the control of inflammation. In this work, we report that cells deficient in membrane  plasmalogen demonstrate a reduced capacity to phagocytize opsonized zymosan particles. Amelioration of plasmalogen deficiency in these cells by incubation with lysoplasmalogen results in a significant augmentation of the phagocytic capacity of the cells. In parallel with these increases, restoration of plasmalogen levels in the cells also increases the number and size of lipid rafts in the membrane, reduces membrane fluidity down to levels found in cells containing normal plasmalogen levels, and improves receptor-mediated signaling. Collectively, these results suggest that membrane plasmalogen level determines characteristics of the plasma membrane such as fluidity and the formation of microdomains that are necessary for efficient signal transduction leading to optimal phagocytosis by macrophages.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006573>Modulation of anti-tumor  by the brain's reward system.</a></h2><p>Regulating  is a leading target for cancer therapy.

Polymyxins exhibit their antibacterial killing by initial interaction with lipid A in Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxin resistance can be mediated by phosphoethanolamine (PEA) modification of lipid A, which abolishes the initial electrostatic interaction with polymyxins. Both chromosome-encoded (e.g. EptA, EptB and EptC) and plasmid-encoded (e.g. MCR-1 and MCR-2) PEA transferases have been reported in Gram-negative bacteria; however, their sequence and functional heterogeneity remain unclear. This article reports a comparative analysis of PEA transferases across 10 clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial species using multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. The results show that the pairwise identities among chromosome-mediated EptA, EptB and EptC from Escherichia coli are low, and EptA shows the greatest similarity with MCR-1 and MCR-2. Among PEA transferases from representative strains of 10 clinically relevant species, the catalytic domain is more conserved compared with the transmembrane domain. In particular, PEA acceptor sites and zinc-binding pockets show high conservation between different species, indicating their potential importance for the function of PEA transferases. The evolutionary relationship of MCR-1, MCR-2 and EptA from the 10 selected bacterial species was evaluated by phylogenetic analysis. Cluster analysis illustrates that 325 EptA from 275 strains of 10 species within each individual species are highly conserved, whereas interspecies conservation is low.

This disease is endemic in the Far East, especially in mainland China. Because niclosamide is the only molluscicide recommended by the World Health Organization, 50% wettable powder of niclosamide  salt (WPN), the only chemical molluscicide available in China, has been widely used as the main snail control method for over two decades. Recently, a novel molluscicide derived from niclosamide, the salt of quinoid-2',5-dichloro-4'-nitro-salicylanilide (Liu Dai Shui Yang An, LDS), has been developed and proven to have the same molluscicidal effect as WPN, with lower cost and significantly lower toxicity to fish than WPN. The mechanism by which these molluscicides cause snail death is not known. Here, we report the next-generation transcriptome sequencing of O. hupensis; 145,008,667 clean reads were generated and assembled into 254,286 unigenes. Using GO and KEGG databases, 14,860 unigenes were assigned GO annotations and 4,686 unigenes were mapped to 250 KEGG pathways. Many sequences involved in key processes associated with biological regulation and innate  have been identified. After the snails were exposed to LDS and WPN, 254 unigenes showed significant differential expression. These genes were shown to be involved in cell structure defects and the inhibition of neurohumoral transmission and energy metabolism, which may cause snail death. Gene expression patterns differed after exposure to LDS and WPN, and these differences must be elucidated by the identification and annotation of these unknown unigenes. We believe that this first large-scale transcriptome dataset for O. hupensis will provide an opportunity for the in-depth analysis of this biomedically important freshwater snail at the molecular level and accelerate studies of the O. hupensis genome.

However, the effects of elevated norepinephrine and subsequent reactive oxygen species production in splenic T-lymphocytes during hypertension are not currently understood. We hypothesized that increased systemic levels of norepinephrine inhibits the activation of splenic T-lymphocytes via redox signaling. To address this hypothesis, we examined the status of T-lymphocyte activation in spleens of a mouse model of sympathoexcitation-driven hypertension (ie, norepinephrine infusion). Splenic T-lymphocytes from norepinephrine-infused mice demonstrated decreased proliferation accompanied by a reduction in interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor-α production as compared with T-lymphocytes from saline-infused mice. Additionally, norepinephrine directly inhibited splenic T-lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production ex vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, norepinephrine caused an increase in G1 arrest in norepinephrine-treated T-lymphocytes, and this was accompanied by a decrease in pro-growth cyclin D3, E1, and E2 mRNA expression. Interestingly, norepinephrine caused an increase in cellular superoxide, which was shown to be partially causal to the inhibitory effects of norepinephrine, as antioxidant supplementation (ie, Tempol) to norepinephrine-infused mice moderately restored T-lymphocyte growth and proinflammatory cytokine production. Our findings indicate that suppression of splenic T-lymphocyte activation occurs in a norepinephrine-driven model of hypertension due to, at least in part, an increase in superoxide. We speculate that further understanding of how norepinephrine mediates its inhibitory effects on splenic T-lymphocytes may elucidate novel pathways for therapeutic mimicry to suppress T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammation in an array of diseases.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789027> enhances intestinal functions by altering gut microbiome and mucosal anti-stress capacity in weaned rats.</a></h2><p> (Etn) contained in milk is the base constituent of phosphatidylethanolamine and is required for the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and bacteria, which is important for maintenance of the gut microbiome and intestinal development.

Norepinephrine, the primary neurotransmitter secreted by post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, binds to and activates β-adrenergic receptors expressed on the surface of immune cells and regulates the functions of these cells. While it is known that both activated and memory CD8 T-cells primarily express the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) and that signaling through this receptor can inhibit CD8 T-cell effector function, the mechanism(s) underlying this suppression is not understood. Under normal activation conditions, T-cells increase glucose uptake and undergo metabolic reprogramming. In this study, we show that treatment of murine CD8 T-cells with the pan β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) was associated with a reduced expression of glucose transporter 1 following activation, as well as decreased glucose uptake and glycolysis compared to CD8 T-cells activated in the absence of ISO. The effect of ISO was specifically dependent upon β2-AR, since it was not seen in adrb2 CD8 T-cells and was blocked by the β-AR antagonist propranolol. In addition, we found that mitochondrial function in CD8 T-cells was also impaired by β2-AR signaling. This study demonstrates that one mechanism by which β2-AR signaling can inhibit CD8 T-cell activation is by suppressing the required metabolic reprogramming events which accompany activation of these immune cells and thus reveals a new mechanism by which adrenergic stress can suppress the effector activity of immune cells.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30469384>Synergistic Effects of Weightlessness, Isoproterenol, and Radiation on DNA Damage Response and Cytokine Production in Immune Cells.</a></h2><p>The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375522>Identification of , and , Three Genes Involved in the Remodeling of  Cell Envelope.</a></h2><p>The brucellae are facultative intracellular bacteria that cause a worldwide extended zoonosis.

In this study, we examined the role of NA in the regulation of neutrophil functions. Neutrophils were isolated from the bone marrow of naïve mice and treated with NA at various concentrations to assess the effect on various neutrophil functions. Additionally, we performed cremaster intravital microscopy to examine neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions following NA superfusion in vivo. In a separate group of animals, mice were subjected to an experimental model of stroke and at 4 and 24 h neutrophils were isolated for assessment on their ability to migrate toward various chemokines. Treatment of neutrophils with NA for 4 h significantly impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and induced an N2 neutrophil phenotype with reduced expression of the genes critical for cytoskeleton remodeling and . Prolonged NA administration promoted neutrophils to release myeloperoxidase and IL-6, but suppressed the production of interferon-γ and IL-10, reduced neutrophil activation and phagocytosis. Superfusion of NA over the cremaster muscle almost completely inhibited fMLP-induced neutrophil adhesion/arrest and transmigration. Furthermore, using a mouse model of stroke, a pathological condition in which SNS activation is evident, neutrophils isolated from poststroke mice showed markedly reduced chemotaxis toward all of the chemokines tested. The findings from our study indicate that neutrophil chemotaxis, activation, and phagocytosis can all be negatively regulated in an NA-dependent manner. A better understanding of the relationship between sympathetic activation and neutrophil function will be important for the development of effective antibacterial interventions.©2017 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><p>Keyword: immunity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26210701>The acute modulation of norepinephrine on immune responses and genes expressions via adrenergic receptors in the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii.</a></h2><p>Norepinephrine (NE), immunocompetent parameters (total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory burst (RB), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency to Lactococcus garvieae), and prophenoloxidase (proPO) system-related genes (lipopolysaccharide- and β-1,3-glucan-binding protein, LGBP; prophenoloxidase, proPO; peroxinectin, PE; α2-macroglobulin, α2-M) expressions were investigated in Macrobrachium rosenbergii received NE through injection at 50 pmol/prawn after 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Furthermore, the PO activity, RB, SOD activity, phagocytic activity and proPO system-related genes expressions were determined in haemocytes incubated with cacodylate buffer (CAC), NE, and NE co-treated with various adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonists in vitro. Results showed that NE, THC, granular cells, PO activity, SOD activity, proPO system-related genes expressions, and phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency to L. garvieae increased; PO activity per granulocyte and RB per haemocyte decreased from 30 to 120 min; semigranular cells and RB increased in the initial 30 min, and then decreased at 120 min when the prawns received NE by injection. In vitro studies, all the determined immune parameters and genes expressions were significantly decreased in haemocytes incubated with NE after 30 min. The negative effects of NE were prevented on the PO activity and phagocytic activity by the β-AR antagonist of metoprolol (Met), on the SOD activity by the β-AR antagonist of propranolol (Pro), on the RB by the β-AR antagonist of Met and prazosin (Pra), and on the proPO system-related genes expressions by α-AR antagonist of Pra. These results show that NE modulates prawn haemocytes proPO system-related genes expressions via α1-AR, PO activity and phagocytosis via β1-AR, respiratory burst via α1-and β1-ARs, and SOD activity via β2-AR. It is concluded that NE stimulates the regulation of immunocompetence parameters and proPO system-related genes expressions in an acute response to maintain homeostasis of M. rosenbergii, which is primarily mediated through α1-, β1-and β2-ARs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

NE was added to the medium at the final concentrations of 0 (control group, N-C), 0.1 (low-dose group, N-L), 1 (mid-dose group, N-M), and 10 (high-dose group, N-H) nM, respectively.

The results showed that AlCl3 reduced the chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis, and TNF-α secretion and increased the cAMP content, β2-AR density, and mRNA expression of peritoneal macrophages. Meanwhile, the chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis, TNF-α secretion, β2-AR density, and mRNA expression were reduced while the cAMP content was increased in NE-treated groups than those in N-C group.

In normal aging, sympathetic dysregulation contributes to the dysregulation of innate and adaptive  and inflammaging. Sympathetic innervation of immune cells in secondary immune organs regulates immune responses. Previously in Fischer 344 (F344) rats, we reported an age-related increase in sympathetic tone and sympathetic dysfunction in beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling of splenic lymphocytes that contributes to immune senescence, although the responsible mechanisms remains unexplored. In this study, we extend our previous findings using the much longer-lived Brown-Norway (BN) rats, whose behavior and immune response profile differ strikingly from F344 rats. Here, we investigated whether increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in the aging spleen contributes to age-related sympathetic neuropathy and altered neurotransmission in splenic lymphocytes in BN rats. Fifteen-month male BN rats received 0, 0.5 or 1.5 μg/kg/day rilmenidine intraperitoneally for 90 days to lower sympathetic tone. Untreated young and age-matched rats controlled for effects of age. We found that elevated SNA in the aging BN rat spleen does not contribute significantly to sympathetic neuropathy or the aging-induced impairment of canonical β-AR signal transduction. Despite the rilmenidine-induced increase in β-AR expression, splenocyte c-AMP production was comparable with age-matched controls, thus dampening nerve activity had no effect on receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. Understanding how aging affects neuroimmune regulation in healthy aging rodent models may eventually lead to strategies that improve health in aging populations vulnerable to immunosenescence and low-grade systemic inflammation.Copyright © 2018.

Palmitoylethanolamide is an agonist of PPAR-α and an important regulator of pain and innate . In this study, we investigated the properties of the NAAA inhibitor, ARN077, in a mouse model of allergic contact dermatitis. Acute topical applications of ARN077 attenuated key signs of DNFB-induced dermatitis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, ARN077 increased tissue palmitoylethanolamide content and normalized circulating levels of cytokines and immunoglobulin E. No such effect was seen in PPAR-α-deficient mice. Moreover, mice lacking NAAA failed to develop edema or scratching behavior after challenge with DNFB, confirming that this enzyme plays an important role in dermatitis. Consistent with this conclusion, subchronic applications of ARN077 suppressed DNFB-induced inflammation when administered either before or after the DNFB challenge. The effects of subchronic ARN077 were dose dependent and comparable in size to those produced by the steroids clobetasol and dexamethasone. Unlike the latter, however, ARN077 did not cause skin atrophy. The results identify NAAA as a promising target for the development of effective and safe treatments for atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory disorders of the skin.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Six healthy volunteers participated and the concentration of catecholamines and cortisol, and the frequency and function of leukocytes in the peripheral blood were investigated before and after successive 7 days of hyperthermia treatment (20 min/day, 40°C, 100% relative humidity). After treatment, the blood level of adrenaline and cortisol on the 7th day was decreased compared with the 1st day, indicating the suppression of the sympathetic nervous system activity. Moreover, the frequency of CD56(+)NK, CD56(+)NKT and B cells on the 7th day tended to be increased compared with the 1st day. The frequency of HLA-DR-positive NK and NKT cells and expression of HLA-DR on B and T cells increased. The cytotoxicity of NK cells and proliferative response of B cells were also elevated.
