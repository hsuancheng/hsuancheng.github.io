The aim of the present study is the evaluation of tissue classification approaches based on various datasets derived from the molecular profile of the organic solvent extracts of a tissue. A set of possibilities are considered for the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis: all mass spectrometric peaks over 300 counts threshold; subset of peaks selected by ranking with support vector machine algorithm; peaks selected by random forest algorithm; peaks with the statistically significant difference of the intensity determined by the Mann-Whitney U-test; peaks identified as lipids; both identified and significantly different peaks. The best predictive potential is obtained for OPLS-DA model built on nonpolar glycerolipids (Q = 0.64, AUC = 0.95), the second one is OPLS-DA model with lipid peaks selected by random forest algorithm (Q = 0.58, AUC = 0.87). Moreover, models based on particular molecular classes are more preferable from biological point of view, resulting in new explanatory mechanisms of pathophysiology and providing a pathway analysis. Another promising features for OPLS-DA modeling are phosphatidylethanolamines (Q = 0.48, AUC = 0.86).This article is protected by copyright.

Here we applied hydrostatic pressure up to 2 GPa to modify the stacking order in the van der Waals magnetic insulator CrI. We observed an irreversible interlayer antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition in atomically thin CrI by magnetic circular dichroism and electron tunnelling measurements. The effect was accompanied by a monoclinic-to-rhombohedral stacking-order change characterized by polarized Raman spectroscopy. Before the structural change, the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling  can be tuned up by nearly 100% with pressure. Our experiment reveals the interlayer ferromagnetic ground state, which is established in bulk CrI but not observed in native exfoliated thin films. The observed correlation between the magnetic ground state and the stacking order is in good agreement with first principles calculations and suggests a route towards nanoscale magnetic textures by moiré engineering.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658601>Piezoelastic PVDF/TPU Nanofibrous Composite Membrane: Fabrication and Characterization.</a></h2><p>Poly (vinylidene fluoride) nanofibers (PVDF NFs) have been extensively used in  harvesting applications due to their promising piezoresponse characteristics. However, the mechanical properties of the generated fibers are still lacking. Therefore, we are presenting in this work a promising improvement in the elasticity properties of PVDF nanofibrous membrane through thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) additives. Morphological, physical, and mechanical analyses were performed for membranes developed from different blend ratios. Then, the impact of added weight ratio of TPU on the piezoelectric response of the formed nanofibrous composite membranes was studied. The piezoelectric characteristics were studied through impulse loading testing where the electric voltage had been detected under applied mass weights. Piezoelectric characteristics were investigated further through a pressure mode test the developed nanofibrous composite membranes were found to be mechanically deformed under applied electric potential. This work introduces promising high elastic piezoelectric materials that can be used in a wide variety of applications including  harvesting, wearable electronics, self-cleaning filters, and motion/vibration sensors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660605>Back to Basics: Laser Safety.</a></h2><p>Surgeons use lasers for a variety of inpatient and outpatient procedures.

Essential for these experiments is the presence of a two-level spin system whose  splitting can be chosen by applying a magnetic field. In recent years, a combination of electron spin resonance (ESR) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been demonstrated as a technique to detect magnetic properties of single atoms on surfaces and to achieve sub-μeV  resolution. Nevertheless, up to now the role of the required magnetic fields has not been elucidated. Here, we perform single-atom ESR on individual Fe atoms adsorbed on magnesium oxide (MgO), using a 2D vector magnetic field as well as the local field of the magnetic STM tip in a commercially available STM. We show how the ESR amplitude can be greatly improved by optimizing the magnetic fields, revealing in particular an enhanced signal at large in-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we demonstrate that the stray field from the magnetic STM tip is a versatile tool. We use it here to drive the electron spin more efficiently and to perform ESR measurements at constant frequency by employing tip-field sweeps. Lastly, we show that it is possible to perform ESR using only the tip field, under zero external magnetic field, which promises to make this technique available in many existing STM systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661645>Co-expression of cellulase and xylanase genes in  toward enhanced bioethanol production from corn stover.</a></h2><p>Lignocellulose is considered as a good resource for producing renewable . Previous  studies have shown the synergistic action between cellulase and xylanase during lignocellulose biohydrolysis. In order to achieve the same effect in  to enhance the practical biotransformation, two recombinant  strains (-CBH-CA and -CBH-TS) with co-expressed cellulase and xylanase were constructed.

This happens due to interactions with the plasma membrane of microorganisms which lead to changes in the structure of the triiodide anion. To verify this hypothesis, the triiodide complex [Na(12-crown-4)]I was prepared by an optimized one-pot synthesis and tested against 18 clinical isolates, 10 reference strains of pathogens and five antibiotics. The antimicrobial activities of this symmetrical triiodide complex were determined by zone of inhibition plate studies through disc- and agar-well-diffusion methods. The triiodide complex proved to be a broad spectrum microbicidal agent. The biological activities were related to the calculated partition coefficient (octanol/water). The microstructural analysis of SEM and EDS undermined the purity of the triiodide complex. The anionic structure consists of isolated, symmetrical triiodide anions [I-I-I] with halogen bonding. Computational methods were used to calculate the  required to release iodine from [I-I-I] and [I-I···I]. The halogen bonding in the triiodide ion reduces the antibacterial activities in comparison to the inhibitory actions of pure iodine but increases the long term stability of [Na(12-crown-4)]I.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660572>Capillary assemblies in a rotating magnetic field.</a></h2><p>Small objects floating on a fluid have a tendency to aggregate due to capillary forces. This effect has been used, with the help of a magnetic induction field, to assemble submillimeter metallic spheres into a variety of structures, whose shape and size can be tuned. Under time-varying fields, these assemblies can propel themselves due to a breaking of time reversal symmetry in their adopted shapes. In this article, we study the influence of an in-plane rotation of the magnetic field on these structures. Various rotational modes have been observed with different underlying mechanisms. The magnetic properties of the particles cause them to rotate individually. Dipole-dipole interactions in the assembly can cause the whole structure to align with the field. Finally, non-reciprocal deformations can power the rotation of the assembly. Symmetry plays an important role in the dynamics, as well as the frequency and amplitude of the applied field. Understanding the interplay of these effects is essential, both to explain previous observations and to develop new functions for these assemblies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659683>Microbial consortia including methanotrophs: some benefits of living together.</a></h2><p>With the progress of biotechnological research and improvements made in bioprocessing with pure cultures, microbial consortia have gained recognition for accomplishing biological processes with improved effectiveness. Microbes are indispensable tool in developing bioprocesses for the production of bioenergy and biochemicals while utilizing renewable resources due to technical, economic and environmental advantages. They communicate with specific cohorts in close proximity to promote metabolic cooperation. Use of positive microbial associations has been recognized widely, especially in food industries and bioremediation of toxic compounds and waste materials. Role of microbial associations in developing sustainable  sources and substitutes for conventional fuels is highly promising with many commercial prospects. Detoxification of chemical contaminants sourced from domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes has also been achieved through microbial catalysis in pure and co-culture systems. Methanotrophs, the sole biological sink of greenhouse gas methane, catalyze the methane monooxygenasemediated oxidation of methane to methanol, a high  density liquid and key platform chemical to produce commodity chemical compounds and their derivatives. Constructed microbial consortia have positive effects, such as improved biomass, biocatalytic potential, stability etc. In a methanotroph-heterotroph consortium, non-methanotrophs provide key nutrient factors and alleviate the toxicity from the culture. Non-methanotrophic organisms biologically stimulate the growth and activity of methanotrophs via production of growth stimulators. However, methanotrophs in association with co-cultured microorganisms are in need of further exploration and thorough investigation to study their interaction mode and application with improved effectiveness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658402>GeTFEP: A general transfer free  profile of transmembrane proteins.</a></h2><p>Free  of transferring amino acid side-chains from aqueous environment into lipid bilayers, known as transfer free  (TFE), provides important information on the thermodynamic stability of membrane proteins. In this study, we derived a TFE profile named General Transfer Free  Profile (GeTFEP) based on computation of the TFEs of 58 β-barrel membrane proteins (βMPs). The GeTFEP agrees well with experimentally measured and computationally derived TFEs. Analysis based on the GeTFEP shows that residues in different regions of the TM segments of βMPs have different roles during the membrane insertion process. Results further reveal the importance of the sequence pattern of transmembrane strands in stabilizing βMPs in the membrane environment. In addition, we show that GeTFEP can be used to predict the positioning and the orientation of βMPs in the membrane. We also show that GeTFEP can be used to identify structurally or functionally important amino acid residue sites of βMPs. Furthermore, the TM segments of α-helical membrane proteins can be accurately predicted with GeTFEP, suggesting that the GeTFEP is of general applicability in studying membrane protein.© 2019 The Protein Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658628>Agreement between the Apple Series 1, LifeTrak Core C200, and Fitbit Charge HR with Indirect Calorimetry for Assessing Treadmill  Expenditure.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to examine agreement in  expenditure between the Apple Series 1 Watch, LifeTrak Core C200, and Fitbit Charge HR with indirect calorimetry during various treadmill speeds in young adults. Participants were a sample of college-aged students (mean age = 20.1 (1.7) years; 13 females, 17 males). Participants completed six structured 10-minute exercise sessions on a treadmill with speeds ranging from 53.6 m·min to 187.7 m·min. Indirect calorimetry was used as the criterion. Participants wore the Apple Watch, LifeTrak, and Fitbit activity monitors on their wrists. Group-level agreement was examined using equivalence testing, relative agreement was examined using Spearman's rho, and individual-level agreement was examined using Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and Bland-Altman Plots. Activity monitor agreement with indirect calorimetry was supported using the Apple Watch at 160.9 m·min (Mean difference = -2.7 kcals, 90% C.I.: -8.3 kcals, 2.8 kcals; MAPE = 11.9%; r = 0.64) and 187.7 m·min (Mean difference = 3.7 kcals, 90% C.I.: -2.2 kcals, 9.7 kcals; MAPE = 10.7%; r = 0.72) and the Fitbit at 187.7 m·min (Mean difference = -0.2 kcals, 90% C.I.: -8.8 kcals, 8.5 kcals; MAPE = 20.1%; r = 0.44). No evidence for statistical equivalence was seen for the LifeTrak at any speed. Bland-Altman Plot Limits of Agreement were narrower for the Apple Series 1 Watch compared to other monitors, especially at slower treadmill speeds. The results support the utility of the Apple Series 1 Watch and Fitbit Charge HR for assessing  expenditure during specific treadmill running speeds in young adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658614>Inducible Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Sirt1 in Male Mice Reveals Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Sensitization of the Heart to Pressure Overload.</a></h2><p>Heart failure is associated with profound alterations of  metabolism thought to play a major role in the progression of this syndrome. SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor of cellular  and exerts essential functions on  metabolism, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, or aging. Importantly, SIRT1 deacetylates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of  metabolism involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid utilization. However, the exact role of SIRT1 in controlling cardiac  metabolism is still incompletely understood and conflicting results have been obtained. We generated a cardio-specific inducible model of Sirt1 gene deletion in mice () to decipher the role of SIRT1 in control conditions and following cardiac stress induced by pressure overload. SIRT1 deficiency induced a progressive cardiac dysfunction, without overt alteration in mitochondrial content or properties. Sixteen weeks after  deletion an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a higher rate of oxidative damage were observed, suggesting disruption of the ROS production/detoxification balance. Following pressure overload, cardiac dysfunction and alteration in mitochondrial properties were exacerbated in  mice. Overall the results demonstrate that SIRT1 plays a cardioprotective role on cardiac  metabolism and thereby on cardiac function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659293>Switching 2D magnetic states via pressure tuning of layer stacking.</a></h2><p>The physical properties of two-dimensional van der Waals crystals can be sensitive to interlayer coupling. For two-dimensional magnets, theory suggests that interlayer exchange coupling is strongly dependent on layer separation while the stacking arrangement can even change the sign of the interlayer magnetic exchange, thus drastically modifying the ground state. Here, we demonstrate pressure tuning of magnetic order in the two-dimensional magnet CrI. We probe the magnetic states using tunnelling and scanning magnetic circular dichroism microscopy measurements. We find that interlayer magnetic coupling can be more than doubled by hydrostatic pressure. In bilayer CrI, pressure induces a transition from layered antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase. In trilayer CrI, pressure can create coexisting domains of three phases, one ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic. The observed changes in magnetic order can be explained by changes in the stacking arrangement. Such coupling between stacking order and magnetism provides ample opportunities for designer magnetic phases and functionalities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660438>Rapid Cycling and Exceptional Yield in a Metal-Organic Framework Water Harvester.</a></h2><p>Sorbent-assisted water harvesting from air represents an attractive way to address water scarcity in arid climates. Hitherto, sorbents developed for this technology have exclusively been designed to perform one water harvesting cycle (WHC) per day, but the productivities attained with this approach cannot reasonably meet the rising demand for drinking water. This work shows that a microporous aluminum-based metal-organic framework, MOF-303, can perform an adsorption-desorption cycle within minutes under a mild temperature swing, which opens the way for high-productivity water harvesting through rapid, continuous WHCs. Additionally, the favorable dynamic water sorption properties of MOF-303 allow it to outperform other commercial sorbents displaying excellent steady-state characteristics under similar experimental conditions. Finally, these findings are implemented in a new water harvester capable of generating 1.3 L kg  day in an indoor arid environment (32% relative humidity, 27 °C) and 0.7 L kg  day in the Mojave Desert (in conditions as extreme as 10% RH, 27 °C), representing an improvement by 1 order of magnitude over previously reported devices. This study demonstrates that creating sorbents capable of rapid water sorption dynamics, rather than merely focusing on high water capacities, is crucial to reach water production on a scale matching human consumption.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661097>Two-dimensional ZrBC with multiple tunable Dirac states.</a></h2><p>In this paper, we designed a two-dimensional honeycomb monolayer ZrB2C2, which is predicted to be a stable nanosheet and exhibits favorable mechanical and thermal properties.

Compared with other transition metal borides which possess Dirac states, the twelve Dirac cones are all robust under different types of external strains, and the Dirac states could be shifted along the opposite direction crossing the Fermi  barrier by external strains and the gap of the two Dirac cones could be opened around the Fermi  level with the effect of spin-orbit coupling.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657928>Site-Dependent Fluctuations Optimize Electronic  Transfer in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson Protein.</a></h2><p>Light absorbed by light-harvesting antennae is transferred to the reaction center (RC). The excitation  transfer (EET) to the RC is known to proceed with nearly perfect quantum yield. However, understanding of EET is still limited at molecular level. Here, we examine the dynamics in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein by developing an efficient molecular dynamics simulation that can properly describe the electronic properties of the bacteriochlorophylls. We find that the FMO protein consists of sites with heterogeneous fluctuations extending from fast to slow modulation. We also find that efficient EETs are facilitated by site-dependent fluctuations that enhance the resonance condition between neighboring sites with large site- differences and circumvent exciton trapping on the pathway to the RC. The effect of underdamped vibrations on the population transfer and dephasing rates is also discussed. Knowledge of site-dependent fluctuations is an important component of understanding optimization of EET in photosynthetic systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660564>Evolution of intrinsic vacancies and prolonged lifetimes of vacancy clusters in black phosphorene.</a></h2><p>Due to the relatively low formation energies and highly mobile characteristics of atomic vacancies in phosphorene, understanding their evolution becomes crucial for its structural integrity, chemical activities and applications. Herein, by combining first-principles calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the time evolution and formation of atomic vacancy clusters from isolated monovacancies (MVs), aiming to uncover the mechanisms of diffusion, annihilation, and reaction of these atomic vacancies. We find that while isolated MVs possess a highly mobile characteristic, they react and form MV pairs which possess much lower mobility and high stability under ambient conditions. We also show that the disappearance of MVs at the edge is quite slow due to the relatively high  barrier, and as a result, around 80% of MVs remain even after two years under ambient conditions. Our findings on one hand provide useful information for the structural repairing of phosphorene through chemical functionalization of these vacancy clusters, and on the other hand, suggest that these rather stable vacancy clusters may be used as activated catalysts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660570>Fabrication of an anode composed of a N, S co-doped carbon nanotube hollow architecture with CoS confined within: toward Li and Na storage.</a></h2><p>Over the years, transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have attracted ample attention from researchers on account of their high theoretical capacity, through which they show great potential for use in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

Here, we report a bottom-up strategy to fabricate 3D halos through the co-assembly of Fe3O4 and Au nanoparticles (NPs). Typically, Fe3O4 NPs assemble into a 3D core (size around 500 nm) with simultaneous growth of Au NPs on the 3D surface during the assembly process. As a general approach, a variety of 3D halos were fabricated from the co-assembly of Fe3O4 and Au NPs of different sizes and shapes. To demonstrate the advantages of these 3D halo structures, their catalytic activity to mimic natural enzymes was investigated. Compared with Fe3O4 NP building blocks, enhanced catalytic efficiency was achieved by the 3D halos. In addition, the optical behavior of the 3D halos was simulated using a three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) method. As shown in the results, the 3D halos attached to 90 nm Au NPs could absorb more incident light owing to high electric field intensities, making these structures promising for applications in  harvesting and detection-related fields.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659858>Protein Kinase Cα Mediates Recovery of Renal and Mitochondrial Functions Following Acute Injury.</a></h2><p>Previously, we have shown that active PKCα promotes recovery of mitochondrial function after injury in vitro [24]. This study examined whether PKCα regulates recovery of mitochondrial and kidney functions after ischemia-induced acute injury (AKI) in vivo. Markers of kidney injury were increased after bilateral ischemia and returned to normal levels in wild-type (WT) mice. Maximum mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complexes and F F -ATPase decreased after ischemia and recovered in WT mice. Reperfusion after ischemia was accompanied by translocation of active PKCα to mitochondria. PKCα deletion reduced mitochondrial respiration and activities of respiratory complex I and F F -ATPase in non-injured kidneys, indicating that PKCα is essential in developing fully functional renal mitochondria. These changes in PKCα-deficient mice were accompanied by lower levels of complex I subunits (NDUFA9 and NDUFS3) and the γ-subunit of F F -ATPase. Also, lack of PKCα exacerbated ischemia-induced decreases in respiration, complex I and F F -ATPase activities, and blocked their recovery after injury, indicating a crucial role of PKCα in promoting mitochondrial recovery after AKI. Further, PKCα deletion exacerbated acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins of  metabolism after ischemia due to decreases in deacetylase and desuccinylase (sirtuin3 and sirtuin5) levels in renal mitochondria. Thus, our data show a novel role for PKCα in regulating levels of mitochondrial sirtuins and acetylation and succinylation of key mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that PKCα deletion: 1) affects renal physiology by decreasing mitochondrial capacity for maximum respiration, 2) blocks recovery of mitochondrial functions, renal morphology and functions after AKI, and 3) decreases survival after AKI.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661451>Adsorption behavior of diclofenac-containing wastewater on three kinds of sewage sludge.</a></h2><p>Diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the water environment. One of the main removal routes of DCF in wastewater is sludge adsorption, and the mechanisms need to be investigated. In this study, the effects of adsorption time, temperature, pH value, and ionic strength on the adsorption of DCF on suspended particles (SP), secondary sedimentation tank sludge (SSTS) and concentrated sludge (CS) were investigated. The results showed that most of the adsorption of DCF by the three matrices was conducted in the first 4 h and equilibrium was achieved at 8 h. The adsorption kinetics were well fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and the rate constants were 0.29-0.88 mg·(μg·min), with chemical adsorption as the dominant one. Adsorption isotherm conformed to Freundlich, Langmuir and Linear adsorption isotherm models. The order of adsorption capacity was: CS > SSTS > SP, which was proportional to the organic matter content and specific surface area of the adsorbents. The decrease of the pH value and the increase of ionic strength promoted the adsorption of DCF.

The sono-biostimulation effects in terms of higher CH generation over control lasted for 45 h. The increase in the concentration of NH-N and K considered the indication of cell lysis under applied US conditions. At best US intensity and irradiation time, the NH-N and K fraction in the medium remained similar as of control, which indicated that no cell lysis occurred.

We previously used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the ionic liquid ([BMIM+][Tf2N-]) in 22 unique solvents over a wide range of concentrations. By screening over a large parameter space, we reached several conclusions: (1) ion diffusivity increases monotonically as a function of increasing ionic liquid composition (2) pure solvent diffusivity strongly correlates with ion diffusivity and (3) conductivity predicted by the Nernst-Einstein (NE) Equation is maximum at intermediate compositions of ionic liquid. Building off this work, we now utilize the same parameter space to study the structure of ([BMIM+][Tf2N-]) solvated in organic solvents. We explore ion correlations through a number of structural and thermodynamic properties, including liquid density, pair correlation functions, ion pairing and ion caging lifetimes, and free  calculations. Through these analyses, we find that some solvents are much more effective at screening ion-ion interactions than others and that these differences impact the ion dynamics in these mixtures. In general, the strong pairing of ionic liquids negatively impacts transport properties, but some solvents can robustly screen these interactions, resulting in greatly enhanced ion dynamics. These results uncover trends connecting ionic liquid structure to transport, which can help in the design of new electrolytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657929> Formed IrLi Nanoparticles as Active Cathode Material in Li-Oxygen Batteries.</a></h2><p>Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries are a promising class of rechargeable Li batteries with a potentially very high achievable  density. One of the major challenges for Li-O2 batteries is the high charge overpotential, which results in a low  efficiency. In this work size-selected subnanometer Ir clusters are used to investigate cathode materials that can help control lithium superoxide formation during discharge, which has good electronic conductivity needed for low charge potentials. It is found that Ir particles can lead to lithium superoxide formation as the discharge product with Ir particle sizes of ~1.5 nm giving the lowest charge potentials. During discharge these 1.5 nm Ir nanoparticles surprisingly evolve to larger ones while incorporating Li to form core-shell structures with Ir3Li shells, which probably act as templates for growth of lithium superoxide during discharge. Various characterization techniques including DEMS, Raman, titration, and HRTEM are used to characterize the LiO2 discharge product and the evolution of the Ir nanoparticles. Density functional calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism for formation of the core-shell Ir3Li particles.

It is, therefore, highly desirable to develop novel materials and strategies for dealing with the clenbuterol. Herein, functional polymer microspheres prepared by Pickering emulsion polymerization were explored for the selective enrichment of the clenbuterol, and their structure and oxygen functionalities could be tailor-made by a molecular imprinting process. The clenbuterol imprinting was adequately demonstrated to not only increase the particle size (~52 nm vs. ~42 nm) and create cavities for the accommodation of the clenbuterol molecules, but also reduce the oxygen functionalities of the resulting molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (MIPMs) by approximately 4 at.%, which is believed to correlate with the high specificity of the MIPMs. Various characterization methods were employed to evidence these findings, including scanning electron microscopy, BET measurements, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental mapping examination. More importantly, the MIPMs showed a markedly superior enrichment capability towards clenbuterol to the counterpart, that is, non-molecularly imprinted polymer microspheres (NIPMs). Compared to the NIPMs without specificity for clenbuterol, the MIPMs exhibited an impressive selectivity to clenbuterol, with the relative selectivity coefficient () values largely exceeding 1, thus corroborating that the useful molecular imprinting led to the generation of the binding sites complementary to the clenbuterol molecule in the size and functionalities. The MIPMs were also employed as the stationary phase to fabricate molecularly imprinting solid-phase extraction column, and the spike recovery was demonstrated to be not significantly decreased even after nine cycles. Furthermore, the reliability of the method was also evidenced through the comparison of the MIPMs prepared from different batches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661086>Stretchable, transparent and imperceptible supercapacitors based on Au@MnO nanomesh electrodes.</a></h2><p>A highly transparent and stretchable electrode based on a Au nanomesh, electrodeposited with a thin layer of MnO2 with a transparency of 84.7% is introduced.

The influence of fire on surface albedo is a predominantly negative forcing in boreal forests, and one of the strongest overall, due to increased snow exposure in the winter and spring months. Albedo forcings are spatially and temporally heterogeneous and depend on a variety of factors related to soils, topography, climate, land cover/vegetation type, successional dynamics, time since fire, season, and fire severity. However, how these variables interact to influence albedo is not well understood, and quantifying these relationships and predicting post-fire albedo becomes increasingly important as the climate changes and management frameworks evolve to consider climate impacts. Here we developed a MODIS-derived "blue sky" albedo product and a novel machine learning modeling framework to predict fire-driven changes in albedo under historical and future climate scenarios across boreal North America. Converted to radiative forcing (RF), we estimated that fires generate an annual mean cooling of -1.77 ± 1.35 W/m from albedo under historical climate conditions (1971 - 2000) integrated over 70 years post-fire. Increasing post-fire albedo along a south-north climatic gradient was offset by a nearly opposite gradient in solar insolation, such that large-scale spatial patterns in RF were minimal. Our models suggest climate change will lead to decreases in mean annual post-fire albedo, and hence a decreasing strength of the negative RF, a trend dominated by decreased snow cover in spring months. Considering the range of future climate scenarios and model uncertainties, we estimate that for fires burning in the current era (2016) the cooling effect from long-term post-fire albedo will be reduced by 15%-28% due to climate change.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659860>Standard medical nutrition therapy of 25kcal/kg ideal body weight/day often does not reach even resting  expenditure in patients with type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In Japan, an ideal body weight (IBW) calculated by 22 × height (m) has commonly been used in the planning of medical nutrition therapy (MNT). However, there have been concerns regarding calorie deficits in fulfilling resting  expenditure (REE) in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing MNT as defined by 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.To measure REE in patients with type 2 diabetes and verify the validity of MNT with 25 kcal/kg IBW/day.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 52 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age was 65.9 ± 7.3 years, body weight 65.0 ± 11.3 kg, body mass index 24.9 ± 3.8 kg/m ). REE was measured by indirect calorimetry.Mean REE was 1601.0 ± 253.1 kcal/day. Assuming that all patients strictly observed daily  intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW/day, 41 of 52 patients (78.9%) did not reach their REE. The greater the body weight, the greater the difference between assumed  intake as 25 kcal/kg IBW and REE.We call attention to the potential risk of total dietary  intake set to 25 kcal/kg IBW/day. Clinicians should carefully plan MNT to not fall below patient's REE to prevent sarcopenia and ensure MNT continuity.© 2019 The Authors.

In present study the relationship between molecular descriptors and thermodynamic properties such as the standard enthalpies of formation (∆H_f^°), the standard enthalpies of fusion (∆H_fus^°), and the standard Gibbs free  of formation (∆G_f^°)of the cycloalkanes is represented.The genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regressions (MLR) were successfully used to predict the thermodynamic properties of cycloalkanes. A large number of molecular descriptors were obtained with Dragon program. The Genetic algorithm and backward method were used to reduce and select the suitable descriptors.QSPR models were used to delineate the important descriptors responsible for the properties of the studied cycloalkanes. The multicollinearity and autocorrelation properties of the descriptors contributed in the models were tested by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and the Durbin-Watson (DW) statistics. The predictive powers of the MLR models were discussed using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and test set validation methods. The statistical parameters of the training, and test sets for GA-MLR models were calculated.The results of present study indicate that the predictive ability of the models were satisfactory and molecular descriptors such as: the Functional group counts, Topological indices, GETAWAY descriptors, Constitutional indices, and molecular properties provides a promising route for developing highly correlated QSPR models for prediction the studied properties.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661455>Industrial effluent treatment with immersed MBRs: treatability and cost.</a></h2><p>A comprehensive OPEX analysis for both municipal and industrial wastewaters has been conducted encompassing , critical component (membrane) replacement, chemicals consumption, waste disposal and labour. The analysis was preceded by a review of recent data on industrial effluent treatability with reference to published chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal data for four effluent types: food and beverage, textile, petroleum and landfill leachate. Outcomes revealed labour costs to be the most significant of those considered, contributing 50% of the OPEX for a 10,000 m/day capacity municipal wastewater treatment works. An analysis of the OPEX sensitivity to 12 individual parameters (labour cost, flux, electrical  cost, membrane life, feed COD, membrane cost, membrane air-scour rate, chemicals cost, waste disposal cost, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, recirculation ratio, and transmembrane pressure) revealed OPEX to be most sensitive to labour effort and/or costs for all scenarios considered other than a large (100,000 m/day capacity) works, for which flux and electrical  costs were found to be slightly more influential. It was concluded that for small- to medium-sized plants cost savings are best made through improving the robustness of plants to limit manual intervention necessitated by unforeseen events, such as electrical/mechanical failure, foaming or sludging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659492>Nano-metering of Solvated Biomolecules Or Nanoparticles from Water Self-Diffusivity in Bio-inspired Nanopores.</a></h2><p>Taking inspiration from the structure of diatom algae frustules and motivated by the need for new detecting strategies for emerging nanopollutants in water, we analyze the potential of nanoporous silica tablets as metering devices for the concentration of biomolecules or nanoparticles in water. The concept relies on the different diffusion behavior that water molecules exhibit in bulk and nanoconfined conditions, e.g., in nanopores. In this latter situation, the self-diffusion coefficient of water reduces according to the geometry and surface properties of the pore and to the concentration of suspended biomolecules or nanoparticles in the pore, as extensively demonstrated in a previous study. Thus, for a given pore-liquid system, the self-diffusivity of water in nanopores filled with biomolecules or nanoparticles provides an indirect measure of their concentration. Using molecular dynamics and previous results from the literature, we demonstrate the correlation between the self-diffusion coefficient of water in silica nanopores and the concentration of proteins or nanoparticles contained therein. Finally, we estimate the time required for the nanoparticles to fill the nanopores, in order to assess the practical feasibility of the overall nano-metering protocol. Results show that the proposed approach may represent an alternative method for assessing the concentration of some classes of nanopollutants or biomolecules in water.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660549>Self-assembly growth of a multiferroic topological nanoisland array.</a></h2><p>Ferroelectric topological configurations confined in nanostructures have attracted intensive interest both in fundamental physics and potential applications in non-volatile nanoelectronic devices. However, the preparation approaches such as chemical synthesis and template or electron beam etching inevitably induce damage and contamination; also, these are complicated processes. Herein, by a delicate design of the wetting layer and growth temperature, self-assembled ferroelectric nanoislands were achieved with the BiFeO3/(La,Sr)MnO3/LaAlO3 heterostructure. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, the much lower surface  (∼0.47 J m-2) of the (La,Sr)MnO3 (∼2-12 nm)/LaAlO3 system than that (∼1.0 J m-2) of BiFeO3 provides the probability for the transformation of layered morphology into nanoislands. From the dynamic perspective, the high growth temperature (∼650-680 °C) helps to step over the  barrier (∼50 meV per atom) by stimulating the formation of periodically arrayed dislocations at the BiFeO3/(La,Sr)MnO3 interface, which on the one hand releases the epitaxial elastic  and on the other hand evokes the nucleation of the R-phase nanoisland array. More excitingly, this approach with a wonderful new growth mechanism can also be employed in other ferroelectric model systems such as BaTiO3, which provides a new strategy for the design of novel nanoelectronic devices based on ferroelectric perovskite nanostructures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661681>Modeling nonadiabatic dynamics in condensed matter materials: Some recent advances and applications.</a></h2><p>This review focuses on recent developments in the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NA-MD), with particular attention given to condensed-matter systems. NA-MD simulations for small molecular systems can be performed using high-level electronic structure calculations, methods accounting for the quantization of nuclear motion, and using fewer approximations in the dynamical methodology itself. Modeling condensed-matter systems imposes many limitations on various aspects of NA-MD computations, requiring approximations at various levels of theory - from the electronic structure, to the ways in which the coupling of electrons and nuclei are accounted for. Nonetheless, the approximate treatment of NA-MD in condensed-phase materials has gained a spin lately in many applied studies. A number of advancements of the methodology and computational tools have been undertaken, including general-purpose methods as well as those tailored to nanoscale and condensed matter systems.

The two closo-compounds displayed major absorption bands assignable to π-π* transitions involving the spirobifluorene group, as well as weak intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions between the o-carboranes and their spirobifluorene moieties. The nido-compounds exhibited slightly blueshifted absorption bands resulting from the absence of the ICT transitions corresponding to the o-carborane moieties due to the anionic character of the nido-o-carboranes. While SFC1 exhibited only high- emissions in THF at 298 K (only from local excited (LE) states assignable to π-π* transitions on the spirobifluorene group), remarkable emissions in the low- region were observed in the rigid state such as in THF at 77 K and in the film state. SFC2 displayed intense emissions in the low- region in all states. The fact that neither of the nido-derivatives of SFC1 and SFC2 exhibited low- emissions and the TD-DFT calculation results of each closo-compound clearly verified that the low- emission was based on ICT-based radiative decay. The conformational barriers from each relative  calculation upon changing the dihedral angles around the o-carborane cages for both compounds confirmed that the rotation of the o-carborane cages and terminal phenyl rings for SFC1 is freer than that for SFC2 .© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Indeed, improvements in modelling gas-liquid mass transfer can bring huge benefits in terms of reaction rates, plant  expenditure, acid-base equilibria and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these efforts, there is still no universally valid correlation between the design and operating parameters of a wastewater treatment plant and the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficients. That is why the current practice for oxygen mass transfer modelling is to apply overly simplified models, which come with multiple assumptions that are not valid for most applications. To deal with these complexities, correction factors were introduced over time. The most uncertain of them is the α-factor. To build fundamental gas-liquid mass transfer knowledge more advanced modelling paradigms have been applied more recently. Yet these come with a high level of complexity making them impractical for rapid process design and optimisation in an industrial setting. However, the knowledge gained from these more advanced models can help in improving the way the α-factor and thus gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient should be applied. That is why the presented work aims at clarifying the current state-of-the-art in gas-liquid mass transfer modelling of oxygen and other gases, but also to direct academic research efforts towards the needs of the industrial practitioners.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658376>The Effect of Temperature and Exposure Time on Stability of Cholesterol and Squalene in Latent Fingermarks Deposited on PVDF Membrane.</a></h2><p>Cholesterol and squalene are fatty materials of latent fingermarks that can be utilized for dating methodologies and visualization techniques. Previous studies have suggested these compounds undergo degradation in fingermarks as a function of time (days) and light at ambient temperature. However, studies assessing how their composition changes at low and high temperatures over short periods of time (hours) have not been published previously. Here, we performed quantitative analysis of cholesterol and squalene in natural fingermark residue using PVDF membrane, after exposure to a range of temperatures (-20 to 100°C) for 4 and 8 h. We found that levels of both fatty materials remained constant at -20 to 60°C, but both showed significant reduction at 100°C, over short exposure times. These results indicate that cholesterol and squalene are detectable at -20 to 60°C, whereas at 100°C or higher, both are lost due to rapid thermal degradation.© 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659726>Growth and Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Optimal nutrition support has been integral in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) since the disease was initially described. Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative  balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and  expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex  intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and microbiota composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

In recent years, lignin has attracted renewed interest as a feedstock for bio-based chemicals via catalytic and biological approaches and has emerged as a target for genetic engineering to improve lignocellulose digestibility by altering its composition. In lignin biosynthesis and microbial conversion, small phenolic lignin precursors or degradation products cross membrane bilayers through an unidentified translocation mechanism prior to incorporation into lignin polymers (synthesis) or catabolism (bioconversion), with both passive and transporter-assisted mechanisms postulated. To test the passive permeation potential of these phenolics, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for 69 monomeric and dimeric lignin-related phenolics with 3 model membranes to determine the membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients for each compound. The results support an accessible passive permeation mechanism for most compounds, including monolignols, dimeric phenolics, and the flavonoid, tricin. Computed lignin partition coefficients are consistent with concentration enrichment near lipid carbonyl groups, and permeability coefficients are sufficient to keep pace with cellular metabolism. Interactions between methoxy and hydroxy groups are found to reduce membrane partitioning and improve permeability. Only carboxylate-modified or glycosylated lignin phenolics are predicted to require transporters for membrane translocation. Overall, the results suggest that most lignin-related compounds can passively traverse plant and microbial membranes on timescales commensurate with required biological activities, with any potential transport regulation mechanism in lignin synthesis, catabolism, or bioconversion requiring compound functionalization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661246>Single-Molecule Analysis and Engineering of DNA Motors.</a></h2><p>Molecular motors are diverse enzymes that transduce chemical  into mechanical work and, in doing so, perform critical cellular functions such as DNA replication and transcription, DNA supercoiling, intracellular transport, and ATP synthesis. Single-molecule techniques have been extensively used to identify structural intermediates in the reaction cycles of molecular motors and to understand how substeps in  consumption drive transitions between the intermediates. Here, we review a broad spectrum of single-molecule tools and techniques such as optical and magnetic tweezers, atomic force microscopy (AFM), single-molecule fluorescence resonance  transfer (smFRET), nanopore tweezers, and hybrid techniques that increase the number of observables. These methods enable the manipulation of individual biomolecules via the application of forces and torques and the observation of dynamic conformational changes in single motor complexes. We also review how these techniques have been applied to study various motors such as helicases, DNA and RNA polymerases, topoisomerases, nucleosome remodelers, and motors involved in the condensation, segregation, and digestion of DNA. In-depth analysis of mechanochemical coupling in molecular motors has made the development of artificially engineered motors possible. We review techniques such as mutagenesis, chemical modifications, and optogenetics that have been used to re-engineer existing molecular motors to have, for instance, altered speed, processivity, or functionality.

To characterize as-yet-unknown pathophysiologies of schizophrenia, we undertook proteomics analysis of the brain in these strains, and detected elevated levels of Mpst, a hydrogen sulfide (H S)/polysulfide-producing enzyme, and greater sulfide deposition in C3H than B6 mice. Mpst-deficient mice exhibited improved PPI with reduced storage sulfide levels, while Mpst-transgenic (Tg) mice showed deteriorated PPI, suggesting that "sulfide stress" may be linked to PPI impairment. Analysis of human samples demonstrated that the H S/polysulfides production system is upregulated in schizophrenia. Mechanistically, the Mpst-Tg brain revealed dampened  metabolism, while maternal immune activation model mice showed upregulation of genes for H S/polysulfides production along with typical antioxidative genes, partly via epigenetic modifications. These results suggest that inflammatory/oxidative insults in early brain development result in upregulated H S/polysulfides production as an antioxidative response, which in turn cause deficits in bioenergetic processes. Collectively, this study presents a novel aspect of the neurodevelopmental theory for schizophrenia, unraveling a role of excess H S/polysulfides production.© 2019 The Authors.

While the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is well recognized for its peripheral effects on reproductive behavior, release of OXT from somatodendrites and axonal terminals within the central nervous system (CNS) is also implicated in the control of control of  balance. In this review we summarize historical data highlighting the effects of exogenous OXT as a short-term regulator of food intake in a context specific manner and the receptor populations that may mediate these effects. We also describe what is known about the physiological role of endogenous OXT in the control of  balance and whether serum and brain levels of OXT relate to obesity on a consistent basis across animal models and humans with obesity. We describe recent data on the effectiveness of chronic CNS administration of OXT to decrease food intake and weight gain or to elicit weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) and genetically obese mice and rats. Of clinical importance is the finding that both chronic central and peripheral OXT treatment evoke weight loss in obese animal models with impaired leptin signaling at doses that are not associated with visceral illness, tachyphylaxis, or adverse cardiovascular effects. Moreover, these results have been largely recapitulated following chronic subcutaneous or intranasal treatment in DIO nonhuman primates (rhesus monkeys) and obese humans, respectively. We also identify plausible mechanisms that contribute to the effects of OXT on body weight and glucose homeostasis in rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. We conclude by describing ongoing challenges that remain in order for OXT-based therapeutics to be used as a long-term strategy to treat obesity in humans.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659295>Kinetic pathways of crystallization at the nanoscale.</a></h2><p>Nucleation and growth are universally important in systems from the atomic to the micrometre scale as they dictate structural and functional attributes of crystals. However, at the nanoscale, the pathways towards crystallization have been largely unexplored owing to the challenge of resolving the motion of individual building blocks in a liquid medium. Here we address this gap by directly imaging the full transition of dispersed gold nanoprisms to a superlattice at the single-particle level. We utilize liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy at low dose rates to control nanoparticle interactions without affecting their motions. Combining particle tracking with Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal that positional ordering of the superlattice emerges from orientational disorder. This method allows us to measure parameters such as line tension and phase coordinates, charting the nonclassical nucleation pathway involving a dense, amorphous intermediate.

Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a rapidly switchable mechanism that protects plants from photodamage caused by high light exposure by dissipating the excess absorbed  as heat. It is triggered by the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane and requires the protein PsbS and the xanthophyll zeaxanthin. However, the site and mechanism of the quencher(s) remain unknown. Here, we constructed a mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that lacks light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), the main antenna complex of plants, to verify its contribution to NPQ. The mutant plant has normally stacked thylakoid membranes, displays no upregulation of other LHCs but shows a relative decrease in Photosystem I (PSI), which compensates for the decrease of the PSII antenna. The mutant plant exhibits a reduction in NPQ of about 60% and the remaining NPQ resembles that of mutant plants lacking chlorophyll (Chl) b, which lack all PSII peripheral antenna complexes. We thus report that PsbS-dependent NPQ occurs mainly in LHCII, but there is an additional quenching site in the PSII core.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658610>Synthesis and Density Functional Theory Studies of Azirinyl and Oxiranyl Functionalized Isoindigo and (3,3')-3,3'-(ethane-1,2-diylidene)bis(indolin-2-one) Derivatives.</a></h2><p>The design and synthesis of functionalized isoindigo compounds by reaction of isoindigo with ()-glycidyl tosylate, epibromohydrin, 2-(bromomethyl)-1-(arylsulfonyl)aziridine, and 2-(bromomethyl)-1-(alkylsulfonyl)aziridine in the presence of MeONa proceed under mild conditions in moderate yields.

For the zwitterionic system, we were able to simulate the longer tail absorption in the near UV (250-350 nm), supporting the experimental results in terms of excitation spectra. We analyzed the optical excitations responsible for the low- absorption and found a large role played by charge-transfer states around the termini. These charge-transfer excitations are very sensitive to the conformation of the peptide and in realistic fibrils may involve inter and intra chain charge reorganization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657872>Relatively rare root endophytic bacteria drive plant resource allocation patterns and tissue nutrient concentration in unpredictable ways.</a></h2><p>Plant endophytic bacterial strains can influence plant traits such as leaf area and root length. Yet, the influence of more complex bacterial communities in regulating overall plant phenotype is less explored. Here, in two complementary experiments, we tested whether we can predict plant phenotype response to changes in microbial community composition.In the first study, we inoculated a single genotype of Populus deltoides with individual root endophytic bacteria and measured plant phenotype. Next, data from this single inoculation were used to predict phenotypic traits after mixed three-strain community inoculations, which we tested in the second experiment.By itself, each bacterial endophyte significantly but weakly altered plant phenotype relative to noninoculated plants. In a mixture, bacterial strain Burkholderia BT03, constituted at least 98% of community relative abundance. Yet, plant resource allocation and tissue nutrient concentrations were disproportionately influenced by Pseudomonas sp. GM17, GM30, and GM41. We found a 10% increase in leaf mass fraction and an 11% decrease in root mass fraction when replacing Pseudomonas GM17 with GM41 in communities containing both Pseudomonas GM30 and Burkholderia BT03.Our results indicate that interactions among endophytic bacteria may drive plant phenotype over the contribution of each strain individually. Additionally, we have shown that low-abundance strains contribute to plant phenotype challenging the assumption that the dominant strains will drive plant function.© 2019 Botanical Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657443>Macroorganisation and flexibility of thylakoid membranes.</a></h2><p>The light reactions of photosynthesis are hosted and regulated by the chloroplast thylakoid membrane (TM) - the central structural component of the photosynthetic apparatus of plants and algae. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional arrangement of the lipid-protein assemblies, aka macroorganisation, and its dynamic responses to the fluctuating physiological environment, aka flexibility, are the subject of this review. An emphasis is given on the information obtainable by spectroscopic approaches, especially circular dichroism (CD). We briefly summarise the current knowledge of the composition and three-dimensional architecture of the granal TMs in plants and the supramolecular organisation of Photosystem II and light-harvesting complex II therein. We next acquaint the non-specialist reader with the fundamentals of CD spectroscopy, recent advances such as anisotropic CD, and applications for studying the structure and macroorganisation of photosynthetic complexes and membranes. Special attention is given to the structural and functional flexibility of light-harvesting complex II in vitro as revealed by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. We give an account of the dynamic changes in membrane macroorganisation associated with the light-adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus and the regulation of the excitation  flow by state transitions and non-photochemical quenching.© 2019 The Author(s).

Gossypol, a natural polyphenolic compound, has been studied as a monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma. The combination of gossypol and temozolomide has been shown to inhibit glioblastoma, but it is not clear yet whether gossypol alone can suppress temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma. We find that gossypol suppresses the growth of temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma cells in both tumor sphere and adherent culture conditions, with tumor spheres showing the greatest sensitivity. Molecular docking and binding  calculations show that gossypol has a similar affinity to the Bcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family of proteins and several dehydrogenases. Gossypol reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels before cell death, which suggests that gossypol inhibits several dehydrogenases in the cell's metabolic pathway. Treatment with a Bcl2 inhibitor does not fully explain the effect of gossypol on glioblastoma. Overall, this study demonstrates that gossypol can suppress temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma and will be helpful for the refinement of gossypol treatments by elucidating some of the molecular mechanisms of gossypol in glioblastoma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661443>Adsorption of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol onto granular activated carbon in water: isotherms, thermodynamics, kinetics, and influencing factors.</a></h2><p>Adsorption was found to be an acceptable treatment option to remove geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB). It is meaningful to investigate the adsorption capacity of granular activated carbon (GAC) for the two algal odorants in water, and the influences of natural organic material (NOM) and particle size. The adsorption process was studied with the four isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and modified Freundlich), four kinetic models (pseudo ﬁrst-order, pseudo second-order, Elovich, and intra-particle), and thermodynamics. The results showed that the adsorption of both compounds could be best described by the modified Freundlich isotherm and pseudo second-order model, and the obtained thermodynamic parameters (changes in heat of adsorption, entropy, and Gibbs free ) revealed that the adsorption was endothermic and spontaneous. Downsizing the particle size of GAC was effective for improving the adsorption capacity and rate. The concentrations of the two odorants could be reduced from 500 ng L to less than 10 ng L with the presence of NOM (<20 mg L total organic carbon, TOC).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660991>The effects of a caffeine-like supplement, TeaCrine®, on muscular strength, endurance and power performance in resistance-trained men.</a></h2><p>TeaCrine® is the synthetic version to naturally occurring theacrine (1, 3, 7, 9-tetramethyluric acid) found in the leaves of Camellia kucha tea plants.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of TeaCrine®, a caffeine-like compound, on maximal muscular strength, endurance, and power performance in resistance-trained men.Twelve resistance-trained men participated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over designed study. Each participant performed one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press, 1RM squat, bench press repetitions to failure (RTF) at 70% 1RM, squat RTF at 70% 1RM, and 2-km rowing time trial 90 min after consumption of: (1) Caffeine 300 mg (CAFF300); (2) TeaCrine® 300 mg (TEA300); (3) TeaCrine® + Caffeine (COMBO; 150 mg/150 mg); (4) Placebo 300 mg (PLA). Power and velocity were measured using a TENDO Power Analyzer. Visual analogue scales for , focus, motivation to exercise, and fatigue were administered at baseline and 90 min post-treatment ingestion (pre-workout). Rating of perceived exertion was assessed after bench press RTF and squat RTF.There were no differences between groups for 1RM, RTF, and power in the bench press and squat exercises.

The custom-designed monolayer electrolyte consists of cobalt crown ether phthalocyanine and lithium ions, which are positioned by field-effect at either the surface of the WSe channel or an h-BN capping layer to achieve '1' or '0', respectively. Bistability in the monolayer electrolyte memory is significantly improved by the h-BN cap, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing enhanced trapping of Li near h-BN due to a ~1.34 eV increase in the absolute value of the adsorption  compared to vacuum. The threshold voltage shift between the two states corresponds to a change in charge density of ~ 2.5 × 10 cm, and an  ratio exceeding 10 at a back gate voltage of 0 V. The  ratio remains stable after 1000 cycles and the retention time for each state exceeds 6 hours (max measured). When the write time approaches 1 ms, the on/off ratio remains > 10, showing that monolayer electrolyte-gated, 2D non-volatile FET can respond on timescales similar to existing flash memory. The data suggest that faster switching times and lower switching voltages could be feasible by top gating.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661537>Synthesis of a 3D free standing crystalline NiSe matrix for electrochemical  storage applications.</a></h2><p>The electrochemical performance for  storage of three-dimensional (3D) self-supported heterogeneous NiSex cubic-orthorhombic nanocrystals grown by a facile one-step chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach on Ni foam substrates has been explored. NiSex shows a high specific capacitance of 1333 F g-1 with ultra-high  (105 W h kg-1) and power (54 kW kg-1) densities. Furthermore, by integrating the as-grown NiSex as the anode and reduced graphene oxide as the cathode, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) prototype with a coin cell configuration has been fabricated. The device shows better capacitance (40 F g-1) with high  (22 W h kg-1) and power (5.8 kW kg-1) densities and robust cycling durability (∼88% capacitance retention after 10 000 repeated cycles). For practical reliability of the as-fabricated HSC, a red LED has been illuminated by connecting it with two charged coin cells.

Most of these oscillations are theoretically and fundamentally exploited but how to mimic the  convolution of biological systems remains elusive. Here we develop a chemomechanical  transducer (CoMET) based on gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and thermo-/pH-responsive polymers, which transforms the trapped chemical  into a tangible mechanical oscillation probed by extinction spectra. Our results show that the mechanical movement of Au NPs characterized by the chemoplasmonic oscillation follows exactly the pH oscillation and can be tuned by changing the temperature and the injection rate of the reductants. It is revealed that the  input of the redox potentials which later converts to the collective (dis-)aggregation of Au NPs is the main driving force of the chemoplasmonic oscillation. The  efficiency (∼34%) and force generation (∼28 pN) of this CoMET outperforms many biochemomechanical systems, which offers an alternative means to power the nanomechanics and nanomachines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661279>Progressive Hydrophobicity of Fluorobenzenes.</a></h2><p>The potential of mean force for the dimers of fluorobenzenes sample both π-stacked and T-shaped structures for partially fluorinated benzenes viz., 1,4-difluorobenzene, 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene and 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene, and sample only the T-shaped structures for benzene and hexafluorobenzene. While, the free  for the dimerization in water is very weakly dependent on number of fluorine atoms, the formation of π-stacked structures is entropy driven and the T-shaped structures appear due to an enthalpic minimum. Interestingly, the solvation behaviour suggests that the accumulation of water around the contact and solvent-separated pairs decreases with increase in number of fluorine atoms, which signifies progressive hydrophobicity of fluorobenzenes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659527>Auger electrons for cancer therapy - a review.</a></h2><p>Auger electrons (AEs) are very low  electrons that are emitted by radionuclides that decay by electron capture (e.g. In, Ga, Tc, Pt, I and I). This  is deposited over nanometre-micrometre distances, resulting in high linear  transfer (LET) that is potent for causing lethal damage in cancer cells. Thus, AE-emitting radiotherapeutic agents have great potential for treatment of cancer. In this review, we describe the radiobiological properties of AEs, their radiation dosimetry, radiolabelling methods, and preclinical and clinical studies that have been performed to investigate AEs for cancer treatment.AEs are most lethal to cancer cells when emitted near the cell nucleus and especially when incorporated into DNA (e.g. I-IUdR). AEs cause DNA damage both directly and indirectly via water radiolysis. AEs can also kill targeted cancer cells by damaging the cell membrane, and kill non-targeted cells through a cross-dose or bystander effect. The radiation dosimetry of AEs considers both organ doses and cellular doses. The Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) schema may be applied. Radiolabelling methods for complexing AE-emitters to biomolecules (antibodies and peptides) and nanoparticles include radioiodination (I and I) or radiometal chelation (In, Ga, Tc). Cancer cells exposed in vitro to AE-emitting radiotherapeutic agents exhibit decreased clonogenic survival correlated at least in part with unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) detected by immunofluorescence for γH2AX, and chromosomal aberrations. Preclinical studies of AE-emitting radiotherapeutic agents have shown strong tumour growth inhibition in vivo in tumour xenograft mouse models. Minimal normal tissue toxicity was found due to the restricted toxicity of AEs mostly on tumour cells targeted by the radiotherapeutic agents. Clinical studies of AEs for cancer treatment have been limited but some encouraging results were obtained in early studies using In-DTPA-octreotide and I-IUdR, in which tumour remissions were achieved in several patients at administered amounts that caused low normal tissue toxicity, as well as promising improvements in the survival of glioblastoma patients with I-mAb 425, with minimal normal tissue toxicity.Proof-of-principle for AE radiotherapy of cancer has been shown preclinically, and clinically in a limited number of studies. The recent introduction of many biologically-targeted therapies for cancer creates new opportunities to design novel AE-emitting agents for cancer treatment. Pierre Auger did not conceive of the application of AEs for targeted cancer treatment, but this is a tremendously exciting future that we and many other scientists in this field envision.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660128>Diet-induced DNA methylation within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus and dysregulated leptin and insulin signaling in the pathophysiology of obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity rates continue to rise in an unprecedented manner in what could be the most rapid population-scale shift in human phenotype ever to occur. Increased consumption of unhealthy, calorie-dense foods, coupled with sedentary lifestyles, is the main factor contributing to a positive  balance and the development of obesity. Leptin and insulin are key hormones implicated in pathogenesis of this disorder and are crucial for controlling whole-body  homeostasis. Their respective function is mediated by the counterbalance of anorexigenic and orexigenic neurons located within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Dysregulation of leptin and insulin signaling pathways within this brain region may contribute not only to the development of obesity, but also systemically affect the peripheral organs, thereby manifesting as metabolic diseases. Although the exact mechanisms detailing how these hypothalamic nuclei contribute to disease pathology are still unclear, increasing evidence suggests that altered DNA methylation may be involved. This review evaluates animal studies that have demonstrated diet-induced DNA methylation changes in genes that regulate  homeostasis within the arcuate nucleus, and elucidates possible mechanisms causing hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance leading to the development of obesity and metabolic diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Laboratory based studies investigating the mechanisms of thermoregulation in marine ectotherms, however, rarely consider key temporal elements of thermal exposure, such as the rate at which temperature changes. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile seahorses, Hippocampus erectus, from a tropical coastal lagoon in Yucatan, Mexico, would exhibit variations in physiological and behavioural descriptors of thermoregulation when submitted to contrasting regimes during 30 days: temperature constant at 25 °C (C 25); gradually increasing 1 °C every 5 days from 25 to 30 °C (GI 25-30); and constant at 30 °C (C 30). Immediately after exposure, critical maximum temperature, thermal preference, oxygen consumption, partial  balance, growth rate and survival of seahorses were measured. Seahorses exposed to GI 25-30 showed a significantly higher critical thermal maxima (37.8 ± 0.9 °C), preference (28.7 ± 0.4 °C), growth (1.10 ± 0.49%) and survival (97.6%) than those exposed to C 30 (36.5 ± 1, 29.4 ± 0.3 °C, 0.48 ± 0.32%, 73.8%, respectively). Both high temperature regimes induced metabolic depression, but ramping resulted in a greater amount of  assimilated (278.9 ± 175.4 J g day) and higher  efficiency for growth (89.8%) than constant exposure to 30 °C (115.4 ± 63.4 J g day, 65.3%, respectively). Gradually increasing temperature allowed physiological mechanisms of thermal adjustment to take place, reflecting the capacity of juvenile H. erectus to respond to environmental change. Despite its advantage, this capacity is limited in time, since the cumulative effect of thermal exposure affected metabolic performance, eventually compromising survival. The study of seahorse response to thermal variations in the context of ocean warming needs to consider the temporal elements of thermal exposure to foresee its vulnerability under future scenarios.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Specific  distribution of radionuclides, which are bound to the cell, is the microdosimetric quantity essential in the process of radionuclide selection for patient tumour treatment. The aim of this paper is to establish an applicable method to determine microdosimetric quantities for various radionuclides. The established method is based on knowledge of microdosimetric quantities of monoenergetic electrons. In this paper these quantities are determined for the single-cell model for a range of electron energies up to [Formula: see text], using the Monte Carlo transport code PENELOPE. The results show that using monoenergetic specific energies, reconstruction of the specific  of beta-emitting radionuclides can be successfully done with very high accuracy.

The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibilities of waste Monascus fermentation broth medium (MFBM) toward heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides-enriched lutein. The results indicated that C. protothecoides subjected to MFBM batch feeding achieved 7.1 g/L biomass and 7.27 mg/g lutein. The resulting lutein productivity (7.34 mg/L/day) represented 1.54-fold more than that of frequently used Basal medium. Concurrently, the effective metabolism and absorption of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in MFBM by C. subellipsoidea cultivation make it easily complied with the permissible dischargeable limits for fermentation broth. When response to fed-batch culture mode, the biomass and lutein productivity peaked 20.4 g/L and 9.11 mg/L/day with concentrated MFBM feeding. Transcriptomics data hinted that MFBM feeding manipulated lutein biosynthesis key checkpoints (e.g., lycopene β-cyclase and lycopene ε-cyclase) while accelerated  pathways (e.g., glycolysis and TCA cycle) to contribute such high lutein productivity in C. protothecoides. These encouraging findings not only provided indications in applying nutrient-rich fermentation broth for affordable microalgae cultivation but also presented possibilities in linking algal high value-added products like lutein with high-efficient biological nutrition removal from industrial fermentation processing.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659623>Carotenoid dark state to chlorophyll  transfer in isolated light-harvesting complexes CP24 and CP29.</a></h2><p>We present a comparison of the  transfer between carotenoid dark states and chlorophylls for the minor complexes CP24 and CP29. To elucidate the potential involvement of certain carotenoid-chlorophyll coupling sites in fluorescence quenching of distinct complexes, varying carotenoid compositions and mutants lacking chlorophylls at specific binding sites were examined.  transfers between carotenoid dark states and chlorophylls were compared using the coupling parameter, [Formula: see text], which is calculated from the chlorophyll fluorescence observed after preferential carotenoid two-photon excitation. In CP24, artificial reconstitution with zeaxanthin leads to a significant reduction in the chlorophyll fluorescence quantum yield, [Formula: see text], and a considerable increase in [Formula: see text]. Similar effects of zeaxanthin were also observed in certain samples of CP29. In CP29, also the replacement of violaxanthin by the sole presence of lutein results in a significant quenching and increased [Formula: see text]. In contrast, the replacement of violaxanthin by lutein in CP24 is not significantly increasing [Formula: see text]. In general, these findings provide evidence that modification of the electronic coupling between carotenoid dark states and chlorophylls by changing carotenoids at distinct sites can significantly influence the quenching of these minor proteins, particularly when zeaxanthin or lutein is used. The absence of Chl612 in CP24 and of Chl612 or Chl603 in CP29 has a considerably smaller effect on [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] than the influence of some carotenoids reported above. However, in CP29 our results indicate slightly dequenching and decreased [Formula: see text] when these chlorophylls are absent. This might indicate that both, Chl612 and Chl603 are involved in carotenoid-dependent quenching in isolated CP29.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658307>Light-activated inorganic CsPbBrI perovskite for room-temperature self-powered chemical sensing.</a></h2><p>Halide perovskite materials are excellent light harvesters that have generated enormous interest for photovoltaic technology and an increasing number of other optoelectronic applications.

Here, we present some insights on the use of CsPbBr2I (CPBI) perovskites for self-powered room-temperature sensing of several environmentally and medically relevant compounds demonstrating rapid detection of down to concentrations of 1 ppm. Notably, the photocurrent of these self-powered CPBI-based devices increases under exposure to both reducing (e.g. acetone, propane) and oxidizing (e.g. NO2, O2) gas molecules and decreases rapidly upon reverting to an inert atmosphere. In situ photoluminescence (PL) analysis of the CPBI during exposure to oxidizing molecules reveals a strongly increased PL intensity and longer lifetime indicating a prevalent role of CPBI trap states in the sensing mechanism.

Previous studies have focused on improving capacity and  consumption through material (e.g., ion-selective membranes [IEMs], charged carbon) and operational modifications, but there has been no analysis which directly links lab-scale experimental performance to capital and operating costs of full-scale water production. In this study, we developed a parameterized process model and technoeconomic analysis framework to project capital and operating costs at the million-gallon-per-day scale based on reported material and operational characteristics for constant current CDI with and without low ($20 m-2) and high cost ($100 m-2) IEMs. Using this framework, we conducted global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for water price across the reported CDI design space. Our results show that the operating constraints of brackish water desalination lead to capital costs 2-14 times greater than operating costs (particularly for MCDI). While MCDI outperforms CDI, IEM prices dictate the threshold at which MCDI is more cost-effective. The high relative capital costs highlight the importance of achieving system lifetimes at two years or beyond. Lastly, we set performance and areal cost benchmarks for material-based CDI performance and lifetime improvements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658649>Control of Arms of Au Stars Size and its Dependent Cytotoxicity and Photosensitizer Effects in Photothermal Anticancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>Gold nanostars (AuS NPs) are a very attractive nanomaterial, which is characterized by high effective transduction of the electromagnetic radiation into heat . Therefore, AuS NPs can be used as photosensitizers in photothermal therapy (PTT). However, understanding the photothermal conversion efficiency in nanostars is very important to select the most appropriate shape and size of AuS NPs. Therefore, in this article, the synthesis of AuS NPs with different lengths of star arms for potential application in PTT was investigated. Moreover, the formation mechanism of these AuS NPs depending on the reducer concentration is proposed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with selected area diffraction (SEAD) and X-ray diffraction (X-Ray) showed that all the obtained AuS NPs are crystalline and have cores with similar values of the diagonal (parameter ), from 140 nm to 146 nm. However, the widths of the star arm edges (parameter ) and the lengths of the arms (parameter ) vary between 3.75 nm and 193 nm for AuS1 NPs to 6.25 nm and 356 nm for AuS4 NPs. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra revealed that, with increasing edge widths and lengths of the star arms, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak is shifted to the higher wavelengths, from 640 nm for AuS1 NPs to 770 nm for AuS4 NPs. Moreover, the increase of temperature in the AuS NPs solutions as well as the values of calculated photothermal efficiency grew with the elongation of the star arms. The potential application of AuS NPs in the PTT showed that the highest decrease of viability, around 75%, of cells cultured with AuS NPs and irradiated by lasers was noticed for AuS4 NPs with the longest arms, while the smallest changes were visible for gold nanostars with the shortest arms. The present study shows that photothermal properties of AuS NPs depend on edge widths and lengths of the star arms and the values of photothermal efficiency are higher with the increase of the arm lengths, which is correlated with the reducer concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661235>Superior Thermal Stability of High  Density and Power Density in Domain Engineered Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-NaTaO3 Relaxor Ferroelectrics.</a></h2><p>Thermal-stable dielectric capacitors with high  density and power density have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this work, (1-x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xNaTaO3 ((1-x)BNT-xNT, x=0~0.30) lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramics are developed for capacitor applications. The x=0.20 ceramic exhibits superior thermal stability of discharged  density (WD) with a variation of less than 10% in an ultra-wide temperature range of -50~300 °C, showing a significant advantage compared with previously reported ceramic systems. The WD reaches 4.21 J/cm3 under 38 kV/mm at room temperature. Besides, a record high of power density (PD~89.5 MW/cm3) in BNT-based ceramics is also achieved in x=0.20 ceramic with an excellent temperature insensitivity within 25~160 oC. The x=0.20 ceramic is indicated to be an ergodic relaxor ferroelectric with coexisted R3c nanodomains and P4bm polar nanoregions at room temperature, greatly contributing to inducing large maximum polarization, maintaining low remnant polarization, and thus achieving high WD and PD. Furthermore, the diffuse phase transition from R3c to P4bm phase on heating is considered to be responsible for the superior thermal stability of the high WD and PD. These results imply the large potential of the 0.80BNT-0.20NT ceramic in temperature-stable dielectric capacitor applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660103>Changes in Pupil Area during Low- Femtosecond Laser-assisted Cataract Surgery.</a></h2><p>To study the potential changes in pupil area within low- femtosecond-laser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS).A retrospective assessment of the pupil size was performed in the eyes undergoing FLACS using the Ziemer LDV Z8.

Subgroups were built with reference to age and preoperative pupil area (smaller than or equal to the median versus larger than the median).The mean  SD axial length, anterior chamber depth, white-to-white distance and lens thickness were 24.01  1.47, 3.23  0.4, 11.97  0.49, and 4.59  0.41 mm, respectively. The mean  SD pupil area was 39.33  7.1 mm  preoperatively and 39.3  6.75 mm  after laser pretreatment. The mean  SD change in pupil area was -0.03  2.12 mm  . There were no statistically significant changes between preoperative and post-laser pupil areas ( = 0.93, 95% CI: -0.71 to 0.65). Comparisons within subgroups also did not detect pupil area reduction.This study did not detect statistically significant changes in pupil area after laser pretreatment using low- FLACS. This observation is in contrast to previous studies using other laser platforms.Copyright © 2019 Mirshahi and Ponto.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660739>Identification of the Band Gap  of 2D (OA)(MA)PbI Perovskite with up to 10 Layers.</a></h2><p>2D perovskites are attracting broad attention for their stability and wavelength tunability. However, random crystallization of sample preparation makes it difficult to obtain 2D perovskite with pure structure, especially when number of layers is large. Herein, we prepared 2D perovskite (OA)(MA)PbI with different layers (n = 1 ~ 10). For the first time, we experimentally identified the E of 2D perovskite (OA)(MA)PbI with layers up to 10 by investigating specific pieces of crystal with pure emission spectra using fluorescence microscopy. Intriguingly, relationship between E and n perfectly fits an exponential function rather than the pure quantum confinement effect in good agreement with the theoretical calculation based on first principle. Our results suggest that the band gap of 2D perovskite is determined not only by quantum confinement effect, other factors including chemical components also give significant contribution.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661625>Ultrathin Chromia on a Hexagonally-Ordered d Ferromagnet: Evidence of Interfacial Exchange Bias at the CrO/TiO Interface.</a></h2><p>Heterostructures consisting of 10 Å thick chromia films and 50 Å thick titania films display significant exchange bias at and above room temperature. Chromia films ~10 Å thick were deposited by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of Cr at room temperature in ultrahigh vacuum on 50 Å thick TiO2-x(111) films (x < 0.3), also deposited epitaxially by MBE on Al2O3(0001). Cr deposition yields increased Ti(III) formation in the titania substrate and the formation of a Cr2O3 overlayer, without Cr/Ti interfacial mixing, as determined by in situ photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron  loss spectroscopy (EELS). In situ low  electron diffraction (LEED) and XPS data indicate that the chromia overlayer is hexagonally ordered, and ~10 Å thick. Longitudinal and polar Magneto-optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements at 285 K - 315 K provide evidence of strong exchange bias between the boundary layer magnetization of chromia and the ferromagnetic substrate. These data demonstrate the robust room temperature interaction of the boundary layer magnetization of a multiferroic antiferromagnet with a d0 ferromagnetic substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660249>Promotion and tenure policies for team science at colleges/schools of medicine.</a></h2><p>Advancing understanding of human health promotion and disease prevention and treatment often requires teamwork. To evaluate academic medical institutions' support for team science in the context of researchers' career development, we measured the value placed on team science and specificity of guidance provided for documenting team science contributions in the promotion and tenure (P&T) documents of Colleges/Schools of Medicine (CoMs) in the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences' Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program.We reviewed complete P&T documents from 57 of 63 CTSA CoMs to identify career paths defined by three dimensions: academic rank (associate versus full professor), tenure eligibility (tenure track versus not), and role (research, clinical, education, and administrative), and we rated team science value and documentation guidance for each path. Multilevel models were estimated to compare team science value and documentation guidance as a function of the three career path dimensions while accounting for the clustered data ( = 357 career paths within 57 CoMs).Team science value was greater for associate than full professors, non-tenure-eligible versus tenure-eligible positions, and roles prioritizing clinical, education, and administrative responsibilities versus those prioritizing research. Guidance for documenting team science achievements was more explicit for roles that prioritized research.Although P&T policies at most CTSA institutions express value for team science, inconsistent within-institutional patterns of recognition and reward across career paths may have implications for researchers' involvement in team science. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and for P&T policies that promote team science.© The Association for Clinical and Translational Science 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658932>Metabolisable  of grass and red clover silages fed to sheep at maintenance level.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effect of forage type (grass or red clover) and harvesting time (primary growth or regrowth) of silage on  and N utilisation by sheep fed at maintenance level. Specifically, the assumption of constant loss of  of digestible organic matter from  losses in urine and CH4 applied in evaluation of silage metabolisable  (ME) was investigated. Urinary excretion of high- phenolic compounds related to solubilisation of lignin was assumed to affect urinary  (UE) losses from sheep fed highly digestible grass silage (GS). A total of 25 primary growth and regrowth silages of timothy (Phleum pratense) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) grass mixtures and red clover (Trifolium pratense) samples collected in digestibility trials with sheep, including faecal and urine samples, were used for  and N determinations. Urinary concentration of monophenolic compounds and CH4 emissions in vitro were also analysed. Daily faecal N output, CH4 yield (MJ/kg DM intake), proportion of CH4  in digestible  (DE) and proportion of UE in DE were greater (P ≤ 0.03) in sheep fed red clover silage (RCS) than GS. Furthermore, less (P = 0.01)  was lost as UE of DE in sheep fed primary growth GS compared with the other treatments. The relationship between UE and silage N intake or urinary N output for both silage types (i.e. grass v. red clover) was strong, but the fit of the regressions was better for GS than RCS. The CH4/DE ratio decreased (P < 0.05) and the UE/DE ratio increased (P < 0.05) with increasing organic matter digestibility in RCS. These relationships were not significant (P < 0.05) for the GS diets. The regression coefficient was higher (P < 0.05) for GS than RCS when regressing ME concentration on digestible organic matter. The results of this study imply that ME/DE ratio is not constant across first-cut GS of different maturities. The ME production response may be smaller from highly digestible first-cut GS but could not be clearly related to urinary excretion of monophenols derived from solubilisation of lignin. Furthermore,  lost in urine was not clearly defined for RCS and was much more predictable for GS from silage N concentration.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657433>A pre-solution mixing precursor method for improving the crystallization quality of perovskite films and electroluminescence performance of perovskite light-emitting diodes.</a></h2><p>Quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) perovskites are one kind of efficient luminescent material with fast  transfer and radiative decay of excitons due to the  cascade formed by the mixed perovskite phase. However, the existence of monolayer or bilayer nanosheets in the Q-2D perovskite film results in poor charge transport, high trap density and rough film surface because of the high ratio of ligands, which leads to poor performance of Q-2D perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Herein, we proposed a new strategy of a pre-solution mixing (PSM) precursor to inhibit the formation of ultrathin perovskite nanosheets, which significantly enhanced the charge carrier mobility, reduced the concentration of defects and improved the film morphology. The PeLEDs based on the PSM precursor achieved the maximum luminescence of 7832.1 cd m-2 (∼218% enhancement) and the peak current efficiency of 6.0 cd A-1 (∼131% enhancement). By introducing mixed cations in the PeLED, the maximum brightness of 14 211.0 cd m-2 and current efficiency of 14.6 cd A-1 were realized, demonstrating the generality of our PSM method for the preparation of high performance PeLEDs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659185>Artificial spinning of natural silk threads.</a></h2><p>Silk producing arthropods spin solid fibres from an aqueous protein feedstock apparently relying on the complex structure of the silk protein and its controlled aggregation by shear forces, alongside biochemical changes. This flow-induced phase-transition of the stored native silk molecules is irreversible, environmentally sound and remarkably  efficient. The process seemingly relies on a self-assembling, fibrillation process. Here we test this hypothesis by biomimetically spinning a native-based silk feedstock, extracted by custom processes, into silk fibres that equal their natural models' mechanical properties. Importantly, these filaments, which featured cross-section morphologies ranged from large crescent-like to small ribbon-like shapes, also had the slender cross-sectional areas of native fibres and their hierarchical nanofibrillar structures. The modulation of the post-draw conditions directly affected mechanical properties, correlated with the extent of fibre crystallinity, i.e. degree of molecular order. We believe our study contributes significantly to the understanding and development of artificial silks by demonstrating successful biomimetic spinning relies on appropriately designed feedstock properties.

Both base pairs have two bound anionic states. The dipole-bound state is stable even at the neutral geometry, but the valence-bound state is only adiabatically bound. The initial electron attachment results in the formation of a dipole-bound state that acts as a doorway to the valence-bound anionic state. The adiabatic potential  surface of ground and first excited state of the anion shows an avoided crossing indicating mixing of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. We have calculated the coupling strength between the valence and dipole-bound state by fitting a simple diabatic model potential to a cut through the two adiabatic surfaces of the anions obtained from the EOM-CC calculations. The transfer of the electron from the initial dipole-bound to final valence-bound state has been found to happen at an ultrafast timescale.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657792>Training Dogs for Awake, Unrestrained Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.</a></h2><p>We present a canine functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) training protocol that can be done in a cost-effective manner, with high- dogs, for acquisition of functional and structural data. This method of training dogs for awake, unrestrained fMRI employs a generalization procedure of stationing in several dissimilar locations to facilitate transfer of the stationing behavior to the real MRI scan environment; it does so without the need for extensive training time in the MRI scan environment, which can be expensive. Further, this method splits the training of a stationing (i.e., chin rest) behavior from desensitization to the MRI environment (i.e., 100+ decibel scan audio), the latter accomplished during dedicated Auditory Exposure conditioning sessions. The complete training and testing protocol required 14 hours and resulted in immediate transfer to novel locations.

To address this issue, polymer composites with high thermal conductivity (TC) and low dielectric property are urgently needed. In this work, we fabricated perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) composite with high anisotropic TC and low dielectric constant by aligning boron nitride nanosheets (BNNs) via hot pressing. We characterized the thermal stability, microstructure, in-plane and through-plane TCs, heat dissipation capability, and dielectric property of the composites. The results indicate that the BNNs-PFA composites possessed good thermal stability. When the BNNs content was higher than 10 wt %, the BNNs were well layer aligned in the PFA matrix, and the composites showed obvious anisotropic TC. The in-plane TC and through-plane TCs of 30 wt % BNNs-PFA composite were 4.65 and 1.94 W m K, respectively. By using the composite in thermal management of high-power LED, we found that alignment of BNNs in composite significantly improves the heat dissipation capability of composite. In addition, the composites exhibited a low dielectric property. This study shows that hot pressing is a facile and low-cost method to fabricate bulk composite with anisotropic TC, which has wide applications in electronic packaging.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659234>Anion transport as a target of adaption to perchlorate in sulfate-reducing communities.</a></h2><p>Inhibitors can be used to control the functionality of microbial communities by targeting specific metabolisms. The targeted inhibition of dissimilatory sulfate reduction limits the generation of toxic and corrosive hydrogen sulfide across several industrial systems. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) are specifically inhibited by sulfate analogs, such as perchlorate. Previously, we showed pure culture SRM adaptation to perchlorate stress through mutation of the sulfate adenylyltransferase, a central enzyme in the sulfate reduction pathway. Here, we explored adaptation to perchlorate across unconstrained SRM on a community scale. We followed natural and bio-augmented sulfidogenic communities through serial transfers in increasing concentrations of perchlorate. Our results demonstrated that perchlorate stress altered community structure by initially selecting for innately more resistant strains. Isolation, whole-genome sequencing, and molecular biology techniques allowed us to define subsequent genetic mechanisms of adaptation that arose across the dominant adapting SRM. Changes in the regulation of divalent anion:sodium symporter family transporters led to increased intracellular sulfate to perchlorate ratios, allowing SRM to escape the effects of competitive inhibition. Thus, in contrast to pure-culture results, SRM in communities cope with perchlorate stress via changes in anion transport and its regulation. This highlights the value of probing evolutionary questions in an ecological framework, bridging the gap between ecology, evolution, genomics, and physiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660489>Type 1 cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy accelerates heart failure with co-existing mitral valve prolapse: a case report.</a></h2><p>Free fatty acid is a major  source in the healthy heart and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) partially regulates the rate of myocardial fatty acid uptake. Here, we report a case of CD36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy with a unique pathophysiology. Heart failure was accelerated by co-existing mitral valve prolapse (MVP) without a distinct phenotype of hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy.A middle-aged man was aware of dyspnoea and hospitalized for heart failure with MVP. Cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency was found based on the absence of myocardial l-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) uptake by myocardial scintigraphy. Type I CD36 deficiency was further diagnosed by the lack of CD36 in both platelets and monocytes by flow cytometry. Left ventricular muscle was obtained intraoperatively, and a histological examination reflected compensative hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes with myofibrillar loss and reactive fibrosis. The microvascular structure around the cardiomyocytes was highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for CD31, while CD36 expression was absent. He had an operation of mitral valve replacement and improved heart failure.Cluster of differentiation 36 deficiency potentially mediates various pathological conditions in the heart. Incidental CD36 deficiency-related cardiomyopathy may accelerate heart failure in the presence of co-existing heart diseases. BMIPP scintigraphy might be helpful for predicting CD36 deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

Epitopes centering GSTA sequence are also predicted by NetMHC programs to bind to MHC molecules. Detecting MUC1 glycopeptide epitopes remains a challenge since antigenic epitopes are often shorter than 10 amino acids.In this study, we used pronase from Streptomyces griseus, which has no amino acid sequence preference for enzymatic cleavage sites, to digest synthetic glycopeptides RPAPGST (Tn)APPAHG and RPAPGS (Tn)TAPPAHG, and analyzed the digests by LC-MS using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and higher- collisional dissociation (HCD) methods with Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid Mass Spectrometer.We found that short glycopeptides containing 8 to 11 amino acids could be efficiently generated by pronase digestion. Such glycopeptides of minimal epitope lengths were clearly distinguished by characteristic MS/MS ion patterns and elution profiles of liquid chromatography. A glycopeptide library was generated which may serve as standards for measuring neoantigen epitopes centering GSTA sequence.Our data established the LC-MS/MS identities of a clinically-relevant MUC1 glycopeptide neoantigen epitope centering GSTA motif.

To assess differences in light filtration over a range of microhabitats, spectra were recorded under canopies of desert plants, tropical plants, and under unfiltered skylight. Spectra were then integrated with absorptivity curves of desert reptiles to determine if differences in light quality among microhabitat types changed integrated mean absorptance. Finally, we used the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) as a case study to investigate the effects of filtered microhabitats on paint choice for physical operative temperature models and determined the magnitude of error that could result from discrepancies between paint and animal absorptance. We found that light  was partitioned similarly among microhabitats with like canopy types and that most variation was explained by differences in transmittance between the visible and near infrared wavelengths. Mean absorptance for reptiles was similar among microhabitats with the greatest differences observed between animals in unfiltered skylight and under tropical canopies. In most microhabitats paint and tortoise absorptances differed, but operative temperatures were nearly identical within microhabitats no matter the absorptance used in the model. The findings of this study support the use of a single mean absorptance in modeling operative temperature for reptiles in a variety of habitats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Oil paints containing zinc white are known to be prone to the formation of zinc carboxylates which can cause protrusions and mechanical failure. In this paper, it is demonstrated how a multispectral synchrotron-based deep-UV photoluminescence micro-imaging technique can be used to show the distribution of zinc soaps at the submicron scale, and how this information is used to further the understanding of zinc white degradation processes in oil paint. The technique is based on the luminescence of zinc soaps in the near-UV (~3.65 eV) upon excitation in the deep-UV (4.51 eV); transitions that are argued to subsequently involve ligand-to-metal and metal-to-ligand charge transfer with intermediate structural reconfiguration. Since the primary emission peak lies at a higher  than the bandgap of ZnO (3.3 eV), the signal can easily be isolated from the pigment's very intense band gap and trap state emission, by employing a multispectral acquisition approach. Moreover, analysis at such short wavelengths, in combination with a UV-transparent optical set-up, allows for a lateral resolution on the order of 200 nm to be obtained. The unprecedented capabilities of the micro-imaging technique are illustrated by showing its application to the study of a historical cross-section from an early 20th century painting by Piet Mondrian. Revealing the submicron distribution of crystalline zinc soaps in this cross-section provides new insights that suggest that micro-fissures, the starting points of paint delamination, are the result of an overall expansion of a heavily saponified zinc white layer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659354>pH-Dependent photoluminescence "switch-on" nanosensors composed of silver nanoparticles and nitrogen and sulphur co-doped carbon dots for discriminative detection of biothiols.</a></h2><p>Very close structure and property similarities among biothiols, such as glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), and homocysteine (Hcy), present a major challenge to achieve their discriminative detection. In this contribution, a nanomaterial surface  transfer (NSET) system was established to discriminate GSH from Cys and Hcy with the photoluminescence (PL) "switch-on" response. The nanosensor was constructed using nitrogen and sulphur co-doped carbon dots (N,S-CDs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through assembling an  transfer-based quenching system, featuring the pH-promoted distinct PL "switch-on" response. Under neutral conditions, only Cys and Hcy can encapsulate AgNPs, leaving little chance for N,S-CD binding on the surface of AgNPs, which can lead to PL signal recovery, and the total quantity of Cys and Hcy can be determined. However, at pH 3.0 all three kinds of biothiols can lead to the PL signal recovery and the total quantity of GSH, Cys, and Hcy can be determined, due to the similar slopes and intercepts of their calibration curves. Thus, the concentration of GSH could be further calculated and the strategy was successfully applied for the detection of GSH in human serum, demonstrating its potential in bioanalysis and significance in addressing biological and medicinal requirements.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657423>Inkjet-printed aligned quantum rod enhancement films for their application in liquid crystal displays.</a></h2><p>Semiconductor quantum rods (QRs) show a polarized emission, which opens up the possibility of the enhancement of both brightness and color for liquid crystal displays (LCD) in the form of quantum rod enhancement films (QREFs) for LCD backlights. However, the QR alignment over a large area, suitable for displays, is a challenge. Inkjet printing of QREFs, introduced here, allows fabrication of well-aligned, uniform QREFs on photoaligned substrates using optimized QR inks. We observed that the ink composition and printing conditions affect the QR alignment quality significantly. A relative humidity of 50% with an exposure  of 1 J cm-2 for the photoalignment process provided optimal conditions for QREFs. We have successfully shown a good QR alignment for 2.5-inch films and were able to align QRs in multiple layers. Thus, fabricated QREFs show a polarization ratio of 7.2 : 1 for the emitted light. These QREFs were combined with a blue LED and deployed as a backlight unit for an LCD which shows a brightness of ∼250 nits with an optical efficiency of ∼8%, reaching an NTSC of 109% in a CIE1976 color space. Thus, these printed QREFs, over a large area, provide an unprecedented increase of 77% in the optical efficiency of the LCDs and simultaneously offer better color performance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659355>Important features of the potential  surface of the methylamine plus O(D) reaction.</a></h2><p>This research presents an ab initio characterization of the potential  surface for the methylamine plus 1D oxygen atom reaction, which may be relevant to interstellar chemistry.

T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with  metabolism and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and tyrosine 632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and tyrosine 632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal fat in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659545>Expression dynamics of autophagy-related genes in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus during embryonic development and under increasing larval starvation.</a></h2><p>Rhipicephalus microplus is a hematophagous ectoparasite that significantly affects parasitized cattle. As a one-host tick its entire life cycle consists of free-living and parasitic forms. Its extraordinary ability to survive during prolonged off-host periods has been related to the process of cytoplasmic degradation called autophagy. In order to deepen our understanding of this process during R. microplus non-parasitic stages, we determined the expression dynamics of a set of five autophagy-related genes (ATG genes) during embryonic development and over an increasing larval starvation period of 50 days. We found two apparent successive waves of ATG genes transcriptional activation, which paralleled key embryonic changes such as cellularization and organogenesis, as well as nutrient utilization. Moreover, during increasing larval starvation, ATG genes were up-regulated cyclically every 10-15 days.

Ectotherms, since unable to regulate their body temperature internally, use behavioural thermoregulation to maintain their body temperature within a range that maximizes performance. According to the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation, investment into thermoregulation is dictated by the trade-off between the costs and benefits of thermoregulating. The thermal quality of the environment is a major cost of thermoregulation because it directly affects the amount of time and  that must be invested by an individual to achieve and maintain an optimal body temperature. Thus, in habitats of poor thermal quality, lizards should thermoregulate less. Using Urosaurus ornatus living at 10 sites each straddling two adjacent habitats (wash and upland), we tested the hypothesis that investment in thermoregulation is dependent on the thermal quality of the habitat. We found that the wash habitat had higher thermal quality indicated by a longer duration when optimal body temperatures could be reached. Lizards had more accurate body temperatures in the upland despite its poorer thermal quality. These results suggest that discrepancies in thermal quality between adjacent habitats affect investment in thermoregulation by lizards, but in a direction opposite to the main prediction of the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Exploring simple doping methods will benefit parameter optimization and promote the application of this technique.A previously built miniature ion trap mass spectrometer was used to study dopant-assisted vacuum photoionization. The sampling system of this device was modified to provide three inlets for the simultaneous introduction of analytes, dopants, and auxiliary air. Then, dopant solution was directly injected into the ion trap chamber through a self-aspirating capillary inlet and rapidly evaporated without heating. Different dopant solutions were prepared and switched during the experiments.When analyzing some aniline compounds, the signals of all analytes improved by more than 10 times after the injection of 2% anisole solution as a dopant. In addition, anisole can provide more than 3 times higher analyte signals than those provided by the other three dopants. On the basis of the ionization  selectivity of dopant-assisted PI, some isomers in the MS analysis were distinguished by using different additives.In general, liquid doping is feasible and as effective as other traditional methods, and using proper dopants with high PI efficiency or feeding more dopants contributes to the ionization of analytes. The proposed method also offers several unique merits, such as simple operation, low consumption, and smooth switching with minimal residue.This article is protected by copyright.

The monodispersed microspheres with their sizes over ten microns were fabricated from an isosorbide-based azo compound (IAC-4) by microfluidics. Under irradiation with linearly polarized light, the ten-micron-scale microspheres were transformed into three-dimensional (3D) asymmetric particles through directional mass transfer. Microscopic observations and optics simulation were employed to investigate the morphology transformations. The results show that the penetration depth of light at different wavelengths plays an extremely important role to affect the asymmetric deformation behavior of the IAC-4 microspheres, which determines deformation region, deformation degree and final shapes of the particles. The light intensity (50-200 mW/cm2) is a less important factor, while the deformation rate of the light-penetrated part linearly increases with the intensity. When the light intensity varies in this range, the deformation degree and the final asymmetric morphology are determined by exposure  (light intensity ∗ irradiation time). The IAC-4 microspheres with different sizes show distinct morphology transformation behavior and the deformed particles possess different shapes, caused by the variation of volume fraction of the light-penetrated part in the microspheres. The increase in the ratio of the light-penetrated part to the total volume of the microspheres results in larger scale deformations. Based on the above understanding, asymmetric particles with various morphologies could be fabricated through a precisely controllable way. The asymmetric particles loaded on various surfaces show ability to render remarkable wetting anisotropy of water droplets on the substrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658712>Effect of Different Raw Material Property for the Fabrication on Al/CNT Nanocomposite Using a Ball Mill with a Discrete Element Method (DEM) Simulation.</a></h2><p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have received interest as an attractive reinforcing agent metal matrix composites regarded as an increase to mechanical properties of the final product. Aluminum/carbon nanotubes (Al/CNTs) nanocomposites were observed with different raw material at the optimized experimental condition. In this study, Al-based CNTs composites were three different samples, including un-milled Al, un-milled Al with CNTs, and milled Al with CNTs nanocomposites in the presence of additional CNTs with various experimental conditions while using a traditional ball mill (TBM). The particle morphology and CNT dispersions of milled composites were respectively analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and the mechanical properties of the fabricated composites were tested. In each sample, CNTs were well dispersed on the surface of Al powder at different experimental conditions for milling in a TBM. The Al/CNTs nanocomposites were processed by compacting, sintering and rolling process. The Vickers hardness was used to characterize the mechanical properties. The hardness of Al/CNTs nanocomposites that were fabricated with milled Al with CNT was higher than the reached to in the nanocomposites prepared with the use of un-milled Al with CNT nanocomposites. Therefore, the discrete element method (DEM) simulation was used to complete quantitative analysis. The flow pattern, impact force, and  at various experimental conditions are considered.

However, rate capabilities in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) usually fall off rapidly with increasing electrode thickness due to hindered ionic transport kinetics, which is especially the issue for conversion-based electroactive materials. To alleviate the transport constrains, rational design of 3D porous electrodes with aligned channels is critically needed. Herein, magnetite (Fe3O4) with high theoretical capacity is employed as a model material, and with the assistance of micrometer-sized GO sheets, aligned Fe3O4/GO (AGF) electrodes with well-defined ionic transport channels are formed through a facile ice-templating method. The as-fabricated AGF electrodes exhibit excellent rate capacity compared with conventional slurry-casted electrodes, with an areal capacity of ~3.6 mAh∙cm-2 under 10 mA∙cm-2.

To uncover the genetic background of the ability of microaerobic toluene degradation in Z. oleivorans, the whole-genome sequence of the type strain Buc was revealed. Metatranscriptomic sequence reads, originated from a previous SIP study on microaerobic toluene degradation, were mapped on the genome. The genome (5.68 Mb) had a mean G + C content of 62.5%, 5005 protein coding gene sequences and 80 RNA genes. Annotation predicted that 66 genes were involved in the metabolism of aromatic compounds. Genome analysis revealed the presence of a cluster with genes coding for a multicomponent phenol-hydroxylase system and a complete catechol meta-cleavage pathway. Another cluster flanked by mobile-element protein coding genes coded a partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway including a subfamily I.2.C-type extradiol dioxygenase. Analysis of metatranscriptomic data of a microaerobic toluene-degrading enrichment, containing Z .  oleivorans as an active-toluene degrader revealed that a toluene dioxygenase-like enzyme was responsible for the ring-hydroxylation, while enzymes of the partial catechol meta-cleavage pathway coding cluster were responsible for further degradation of the aromatic ring under microaerobic conditions.

We start by deriving the regularized crack surface to overcome complexities inherent in sharp crack discontinuities, thereby relaxing the acute crack surface topology into a diffusive one. In fact, the regularized crack surface possesses the property of Gamma-Convergence, i.e. the sharp crack topology is restored with a vanishing length-scale parameter. Next, we deal with the continuous formulation of the variational principle for the multi-field problem manifested through the deformation map and the crack phase-field at finite strains which leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the coupled problem. In particular, the coupled balance equations derived render the evolution of the crack phase-field and the balance of linear momentum. As an important aspect of the continuum formulation we consider an invariant-based anisotropic constitutive model which is additively decomposed into an isotropic part for the ground matrix and an exponential anisotropic part for the two families of collagen fibers embedded in the ground matrix. In addition we propose a novel -based anisotropic failure criterion which regulates the evolution of the crack phase-field. The coupled problem is solved using a one-pass operator-splitting algorithm composed of a mechanical predictor step (solved for the frozen crack phase-field parameter) and a crack evolution step (solved for the frozen deformation map); a history field governed by the failure criterion is successively updated. Subsequently, a conventional Galerkin procedure leads to the weak forms of the governing differential equations for the physical problem. Accordingly, we provide the discrete residual vectors and a corresponding linearization yields the element matrices for the two sub-problems. Finally, we demonstrate the numerical performance of the crack phase-field model by simulating uniaxial extension and simple shear fracture tests performed on specimens obtained from a human aneurysmatic thoracic aorta. Model parameters are obtained by fitting the set of novel experimental data to the predicted model response; the finite element results agree favorably with the experimental findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660716>Confinement-Induced Giant Spin-Orbit-Coupled Magnetic Moment of Co Nanoclusters in TiO2 Films.</a></h2><p>High magnetization materials are in great demand for the fabrication of advanced multifunctional magnetic devices. Notwithstanding this demand, the development of new materials with these attributes has been relatively slow. In this work, we propose a new strategy to achieve high magnetic moments above room temperature. Our materials engineering approach invoked the embedding of magnetic nanoclusters in an oxide matrix. By precisely controlling pulsed laser deposition parameters, Co nanoclusters are formed in a 5 at.% Co-TiO2 film. The presence of these nanoclusters was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy,  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure. The film exhibits a very high saturation magnetization of 99 emu/cm3. Detailed studies using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism confirm that Co has an enhanced magnetic moment of 3.5 B/atom, whilst the Ti and O also contribute to the magnetic moments. First principles calculations supported our hypothesis that the metallic Co nanoclusters surrounded by a TiO2 matrix can exhibit both large spin and orbital moments. Moreover, a quantum confinement effect results in a high Curie temperature for the embedded Co nanoclusters. These findings reveal that 1-2 nm nanoclusters that are quantum confined can exhibit very large magnetic moments above room temperature, representing a promising advance for the design of new high magnetization materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661597>In Silico and In Vitro Studies of Two Non-Imidazole Multiple Targeting Agents at Histamine H Receptors and Cholinesterase Enzymes.</a></h2><p>Recently, multi-target directed ligands have been of research interest for multifactorial disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since H receptors (H Rs) and cholinesterases are involved in pathophysiology of AD, identification of dual acting compounds capable of improving cholinergic neurotransmission is of importance in AD pharmacotherapy. In the present study, H R antagonistic activity combined with anti-cholinesterase properties of two previously computationally identified lead compounds i.e. compound 3 (6-chloro-N-methyl-N-[3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-1H-indole-2-carboxamide) and compound 4 (7-chloro-N-[(1-methylpiperidin-3-yl)methyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxamide) were tested. Moreover, molecular docking and binding free  calculations were conducted for binding mode and affinity prediction of studied ligands towards cholinesterases. Biological evaluations revealed inhibitory activity of ligands in nanomolar (compound 3: H R EC = 0.73 nM; compound 4: H R EC = 31 nM) and micromolar values (compound 3: AChE IC = 9.09 µM, BuChE IC = 21.1 µM; compound 4: AChE IC = 8.40 µM, BuChE IC = 4.93 µM) for H R antagonism and cholinesterase inhibition, respectively. Binding free energies yielded good consistency with cholinesterase inhibitory profiles. The results of this study can be used for lead optimization where dual inhibitory activity on H R and cholinesterases, is needed. Such ligands can exert their biological activity in a synergistic manner resulting in higher potency and efficacy.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657757>Effect of surface modification on the dynamic heat and mass transfer of wool fabrics.</a></h2><p>Surface functionalization of fibers is widely used to grant performance or functions to textiles. Modified textile surface, with different morphology and wettability together with different thermal conductivity, has a profound effect on the wellbeing of wearer, because the thermal and moisture transfer of the surface-modified textiles in dynamic moving conditions is totally different to unmodified ones. To benefit the design of performance/functional textiles with enhanced wellbeing of wearer, it is important to understand the dynamic thermal and mass transfer of textiles before and after surface modification. Using wool as a sample fiber, this work reveals the effect of typical surface modification on the dynamic thermal and moisture transfer of wool fabrics. It has been found that the surface characters of wool fiber change after surface modification with etched and peeled off scales, enhanced water absorbing capacity and wettability. The surface temperature of modified wool fabrics was lower than pristine wool fabrics when attaching to a rotating hotplate with a temperature of 35 °C, resulting in a lower  consumption of the hotplate and enhanced warmth retention rate. Modified wool fabrics took longer time to accomplish the dynamic moisture transfer process with a longer stage three in the transfer cycle. This work will provide insights on how the surface of fiber affects the dynamic thermal and moisture transfer of textiles, which will further benefit the development of functional/performance clothing with its comfort well maintained.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Lithium metal, as the "Holy Grail" electrode for next-generation rechargeable batteries, is being revisited to meet the booming demand for high  density electrodes due to its ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity and negative redox potential. Nevertheless, typical issues like notorious dendrite growth still hamper the bulk application of Li metal anodes. Dendrite growth renders increased surface area of the lithium metal, causing persistent depletion of the electrolyte and active materials, facilitating catastrophic failure of the battery, and even inducing fatal safety hazards. The consequences become more serious during operation at high current densities and over long cycling life. Therefore, it is urgent to suppress and even eliminate dendrite formation during the Li plating/stripping process. This Account highlights several innovative strategies for dendrite suppression, dendrite regulation, and dendrite elimination from the perspective of interface  and bulk stresses. First, we review the fundamental mechanism of dendrite formation and growth in Li metal anodes. We show that the dendrite morphology could be substantially ameliorated, in theory, by homogenizing the electric field distribution, lowering the Li ion concentration gradient, and facilitating mechanical blocking. Next, we address the problem of dendrite suppression by applying two-dimensional (2D) materials to Li metal systems and preventing dendrite penetration through stress release and mechanical blocking. Graphene with a high specific area and vermiculite sheets (VSs) with a large physical rigidity were demonstrated to be efficacious in reinforcing Li anodes and polymer electrolytes separately. However, Li dendrite growth is a continuous process and remains inevitable with increasing current density and cycling life. Instead of suppressing dendrite growth, we focus on how to regulate homogeneous Li dendrite formation and growth. Dendrite regulation means to allow dendrite growth but take steps to transform it into Li with a smooth morphology. We introduce two main strategies to regulate Li growth: (i) guiding Li nucleation and (ii) controlling the Li growth pathways and directions. These processes greatly rely on the interface  between the substrate and Li atoms. Elimination of the dendrites, which is the most formidable challenge for dendrite control, can also be achieved by dynamically engineering the force, such as deflecting the electric field by Lorentz force in a magnetic field, enhancing the integrated yield stress by the design of bulk nanostructured materials, and reducing the lateral Li diffusion barrier by a biomimetic co-deposition process. Solutions to the challenges of dendrite control in Li metal anodes can provide safe next-generation rechargeable lithium metal batteries that have a long cycling life. We also hope that our strategies presented in this Account can offer promise for other metal batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658882>Impact of peripheral mutations on the access channels of human cytochrome P450 1A2.</a></h2><p>As an important member of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, human CYP1A2 is associated with the metabolism of caffeine and melatonin and the activation of precarcinogens. Besides, this CYP protein also involves in the metabolism of 5-10% clinical medicines. Some peripheral mutations in CYP1A2 (P42R, I386F, R431W, and R456H) significantly decrease the enzyme activities, resulting in a vital reduction in substrate metabolism. To explore the effects of these peripheral mutations, we constructed a membrane-binding model for the full-length human CYP1A2 and studied their dynamic behaviors on lipid membranes. Free  calculations indicate that the peripheral mutations do not influence substrate binding. P42R is located in the N-terminal anchor, and its positive charged sidechain is adverse to membrane binding. I386F enhances the van der Waals contacts of the water channel bottleneck and R456H breaks the hydrogen bonding interactions that function to position the BC loop, both of which result in a significant inhibition on the water channel. R431W causes a sidechain conformational rearrangement for aromatic residues around the substrate channel, making it in a closed state in most cases. Our computational simulations demonstrate that pi-pi stacking interactions are essential for substrate binding and channel opening. It is hoped that these findings may be of general relevance to the mutation-induced activity changes for CYP proteins, providing useful information for understanding the CYP-mediated drug metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658855>Ripk3 mediates cardiomyocyte necrosis through targeting mitochondria and the JNK-Bnip3 pathway under hypoxia-reoxygenation injury.</a></h2><p> Cardiomyocyte necrosis following myocardial infarction drastically the progression of heart failure.  In the current study, we explored the upstream mediator for cardiomyocytes necrosis induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) injury with a focus on mitochondrial function and JNK-Bnip3 pathway.  Cell necrosis was determined via MTT assay, TUNEL staining and PI staining. siRNA transfection was performed to inhibit Ripk3 activation in response to HR injury. Pathway blocker was applied to prevent JNK activation.  Ripk3 was rapidly increased in HR-treated cardiomyocytes and correlated with the necrosis of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, silencing of Ripk3 attenuated HR-mediated cardiomyocytes necrosis. At the molecular levels, Ripk3 deletion sustained mitochondrial bioenergetics and stabilized mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Besides, Ripk3 deletion also reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress and inhibited mPTP opening. To the end, we found Ripk3 activation was along with JNK pathway activation and Bnip3 upregulation. Interestingly, blockade of JNK pathway abolished the harmful effects of HR injury on mitochondrial function,  metabolism and redox balance. Moreover, overexpression of Bnip3 abrogated the protection action played by Ripk3 deletion on cardiomyocytes survival.  Taken together, these data may identify Ripk3 upregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and JNK-Bnip3 axis activation as the novel mechanisms underlying cardiomyocytes necrosis achieved by HR injury. Thereby, approaches targeted to the Ripk3-JNK-Bnip3-mitochondria cascade have the potential to ameliorate the progression of HR-related cardiomyocytes necrosis in the clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657570>Peptoid helix displaying flavone and porphyrin: Synthesis and intramolecular  transfer.</a></h2><p>Natural light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) absorb a broad spectrum of sunlight using a collection of photosynthetic pigments whose spatial arrangement is controlled by a protein matrix and exhibit efficient  transfer. We constructed a novel light-harvesting protein mimic, which absorbs light in the UV to visible region (280-700 nm) by displaying flavone and porphyrin on a peptoid helix. First, an efficient synthesis of 4'-derivatized 7-methoxyflavone (7-MF, 3 and 4) was developed. The flavone-porphyrin-peptoid conjugate (FPPC) was then prepared via Miyaura borylation on a resin-bound peptoid followed by Suzuki coupling between the peptoid and pigment. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the FPPC underwent helix-to-loop conversion of the peptoid scaffold upon changing the solvent conditions. A distinct intramolecular  transfer was observed from 7-MF to porphyrin with greater efficiency in the helix than that in the loop conformation of the peptoid, while no clear evidence of  transfer was obtained for unstructured FPPC. We thus demonstrate the value of the helical peptoid, which provided a controlled orientation for 7-MF and porphyrin and modulated the  transfer efficiency via conformational switching.

This structural transition, observed at 43 and 45 GPa in SrVOH and SrVOH, respectively, relieves almost all of the accumulated strain on the infinite V-O-V ladders, such that the V-O bond lengths are almost identical at 0 and 50 GPa but are substantially compressed at intermediate pressures. The resistances of both materials with 1-dimensional VO ladders decrease with increasing pressure, but unlike SrVOH that contains 2-dimensional VO sheets, they remain insulating even at the highest accessible pressures. The reduction in dimensionality from planar to linear VO networks reduces the dispersion of the V-O π bands that define the band gap and leads to insulating behavior at all measured pressures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661571>High  visible light at ambient doses and intensities induces oxidative stress of skin - Protective effects of the antioxidant and Nrf2 inducer Licochalcone A in vitro and in vivo.</a></h2><p>Solar radiation causes skin damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The combination of magnetic fields with clinical proton beam lines poses several challenges for dosimetry, treatment planning and dose delivery. Proton beams are deflected by magnetic fields causing considerable changes in beam trajectories and also a retraction of the Bragg peak positions. A proper prediction and compensation of these effects is essential to ensure accurate dose calculations. This work aims to develop and benchmark a Monte Carlo (MC) beam model for dose calculation of MRPT for static magnetic fields up to 1T.Proton beam interactions with magnetic fields were simulated using the GATE/Geant4 toolkit. The transport of charged particle in custom 3D magnetic field maps was implemented for the first time in GATE. Validation experiments were done using a horizontal proton pencil beam scanning system with energies between 62.4 - 252.7 MeV and a large gap dipole magnet (B = 0-1T), positioned at the isocenter and creating magnetic fields transverse to the beam direction. Dose was measured with Gafchromic EBT3 films within a homogeneous PMMA phantom without and with bone and tissue equivalent material slab inserts. Linear  transfer (LET) quenching of EBT3 films was corrected using a linear model on dose averaged LET method to ensure a realistic dosimetric comparison between simulations and experiments. Planar dose distributions were measured with the films in two different configurations: parallel and transverse to the beam direction using single  fields and spread out Bragg peaks. The MC model was benchmarked against lateral deflections and spot sizes in air of single beams measured with a Lynx PT detector, as well as dose distributions using EBT3 films. Experimental and calculated dose distributions were compared to test the accuracy of the model.Measured proton beam deflections in air at distances of 465, 665 and 1155 mm behind the isocenter after passing the magnetic field region, agreed with MC predicted values within 4 mm. Differences between calculated and measured beam Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) were lower than 2 mm. For the homogeneous phantom, measured and simulated in-depth dose profiles showed range and average dose differences below 0.2 mm and 1.2%, respectively. Simulated central beam positions and widths differed less than 1 mm to the measurements with films. For both heterogenous phantoms, differences within 1 mm between measured and simulated central beam positions and widths were obtained, confirming a good agreement of the MC model.A GATE/Geant4 beam model for protons interacting with magnetic fields up to 1T was developed and benchmarked to experimental data. For the first time, the GATE/Geant4 model was successfully validated not only for single  beams, but for SOBP, in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. EBT3 film dosimetry demonstrated to be a powerful dosimetric tool, once the film response function is LET corrected, for measurements in-line and transverse to the beam direction in magnetic fields.

Ionic conductor liquids employed in electrostatic atomization have a low dielectric constant, which causes almost all of the potential drop across the double layer to occur inside the compact layer. In the previous article of this group (Sankarn, A., et al.  , , 1375-1384), it was shown that faradaic reactions in the kinetics-limited regime are responsible for liquid electrification in electrostatic atomization. Here, we apply the Frumkin slow discharge theory to calculate the electric potential at the interface of the compact and diffuse layers. The electric potential value at the interface of the compact and diffuse layers is required in computational models accounting for the discharge of counterions due to faradaic reactions when solving the ionic transport equations. The activation  of the electron transfer reaction is calculated through the Marcus theory. Knowing the counterion flux value at the electrode surface from the concurrent experimental measurements, the ionic concentration and net charge distribution across the polarized diffuse layer are also found from the numerical simulations. Considering canola oil to be the ionic conductor liquid, two different examples are used to demonstrate the application of this approach to calculate the electric potential at the interface of compact and diffuse layers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658455>Mild stimulation improves neuronal survival in an in-vitro model of the ischemic penumbra.</a></h2><p>Objective- In the core of a brain infarct, characterized by severely reduced blood supply, loss of neuronal function is rapidly followed by neuronal death. In peripheral areas of the infarct, the penumbra, damage is initially reversible, and neuronal activity is typically reduced due to ischemia-induced synaptic failure. There is limited understanding of factors governing neuronal recovery or the transition to irreversible damage. Neuronal activity has been shown to be crucial for survival. Consequently, hypoxia induced neuronal inactivity may contribute to cell death, and activation of penumbral neurons possibly improves survival. Adversely, activation increases ATP demand, and a balance should be found between the available  and sufficient activity. Approach- We monitored activity and viability of neurons in an in vitro model of the penumbra, consisting of (rat) neuronal networks on micro electrode arrays (MEAs) under controlled hypoxic conditions. We tested effects of optogenetic and electrical activation during hypoxia. Main results- Mild stimulation yielded significantly better recovery of activity immediately after re-oxygenation, compared with no stimulation, and a 60-70% higher survival rate after 5 days. Stronger stimulation was not associated with better recovery than no stimulation, suggesting that beneficial effects depend on a delicate balance between sufficient activity and available . Significance- We show that mild activation during hypoxia/ ischemia is beneficial for cell survival in an in vitro model of the penumbra. This finding opposes the current common belief that suppression of neuronal activity is the cornerstone of neuroprotection during cerebral ischemia, and may open new possibilities for the treatment of secondary brain damage after stroke.Creative Commons Attribution license.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657766>The origin, significance and plasticity of the thermoeffector thresholds: Extrapolation between humans and laboratory rodents.</a></h2><p>In this review, there is an overarching emphasis on the extrapolation of knowledge from one physiological regulator to another, with a particular emphasis on autonomic thermoregulation in humans and rodents. Through mammalian phylogenetics, one finds evidence for the gradual acquisition of an ability to maintain whole-body thermal stability, with discrete autonomic mechanisms arising for the generation, retention and dissipation of thermal . The sequential attainment of those thermoeffectors, over aeons, makes it unlikely that they are controlled by a common central processor, so the presence of a single activation switch is perhaps inconceivable. Instead, effector activation is associated with the arrival at lower and upper critical (threshold) body temperatures, with regions between those points defining zones of mammalian thermoneutrality. As thermal  content deviates from thermoneutrality, there is a progression from purely passive (physical) heat exchanges through to autonomic (thermoeffector) recruitment. That activation is morphologically dependent, with an obligatory greater basal metabolic heat production evident in smaller individuals within both hypo- and normothermic states. Indeed, a first-principles, morphological case is presented for the existence of an effector recruitment cascade, with human observations providing the empirical support. That sequential activation is consistent with the presence of multiple central controllers, and both animal and human experiments supporting that possibility are reviewed. Finally, the case is presented that mammals possess multiple thermoreceptive fields, thermoeffectors with discrete neural pathways and several central, but independent, controllers of thermoeffector function. Those concepts are summarised in updated conceptual and neuronal models for human thermoregulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The similar chemical and electrochemical properties of sodium and lithium make sodium an easy substitute for lithium in lithium-ion batteries. However, the main issues of limited cycle life, low  density, and poor power density hamper the commercialization process. In the last few years, the development of electrode materials for SIBs has been dedicated to improving sodium storage capacities, high  density, and long cycle life. The insertion type spinel Li Ti O (LTO) possesses "zero-strain" behavior that offers the best cycle life performance among all reported oxide-based anodes, displaying a capacity of 155 mAh g via a three-phase separation mechanism, and competing for future topmost high  anode for SIBs. Recent reports offer improvement of overall electrode performance through carbon coating, doping, composites with metal oxides, and surface modification techniques, etc. Further, LTO anode with its structure and properties for SIBs is described and effective methods to improve the LTO performance are discussed in both half-cell and practical configuration, i.e., full-cell, along with future perspectives and solutions to promote its use.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Jung doesn't much appreciate the law of noncontradiction, which is a cornerstone of classical logic, and he doesn't refrain from using openly ambiguous theoretical terms. It will be pointed out that not only specific archetypes, but the notion of archetype itself, as well as other of Jung's theoretical notions (, including libidinal , polarity, integration, wholeness, instinct, symbol, and so on), are consciously ambiguous and thus potentially contradictory. It is shown that this kind of dialectic research strategy and related contradiction-tolerant and ambiguity-tolerant methods connect his work to Post-Kantian German Idealism, Schelling's and Schopenhauer's philosophy in particular. However, it was Hegel who, in his Science of Logic, presented a systematic overview of such dialectic principles of reasoning, which were, in the 19 century, widely applied by German philosophers, theologians, and other scholars. Unfortunately, Jung decided not to study Hegel, but, instead, wrote derogatorily of his work. It will be argued that a Jungian who wants to be conscious of her own argumentation strategies and methods of concept formation should study Hegel's complex and sophisticated dialectical logic. In addition, it is suggested that Jungian depth psychology might help us to amend the phenomenological deficits of Hegel's system by providing it with a primal experiential source. This is needed because Hegel's Geist, due to its intellectual emphasis, is a self-conscious conceptual totality which advances progressively from stage to stage by guiding itself with the help of dialectical reason (Vernunft). It will be shown that if enriched with a proper kind of experiential givenness, which includes the Jungian unconsciousness (with libidinal , instincts, and archetypes), Hegelian metaphysics would be able to embrace a seriously aconceptual or preconceptual dimension. Aconceptual experience, which is, for Jung, mainly the instinctual layer of archetypes, remains essentially inaccessible, not only for normal scientific concepts, but for the concepts of any form of dialectics as well.© 2019, The Society of Analytical Psychology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657821>Nanoscale morphology, tribology and electrical properties of polyaniline/graphene oxide/LAPONITE® composites investigated using atomic force microscopy.</a></h2><p>Polyaniline composites with graphene and graphene oxide have received broad interest for applications in charge separation and storage in electrical devices.

The feather shaft is an important connective unit, made of a lightweight material, which also contributes to aiding flight. The shaft can withstand loads from different directions and has outstanding compression resistance. In this study, the microstructure and composition of the A. fabalis feather shaft were observed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and its compression resistance was studied by compression testing. The results indicated that the mechanical property of the shaft is related to its microstructure. Compression testing verified that the primary feathers had the strongest mechanical properties, followed by the secondaries, and finally the alulae. Under the same conditions, the specific  absorption of the three feather types was 5.96, 5.02, and 3.17 J/g, respectively. With increasing moisture content, the rachis was softened and the  absorption was reduced. At low moisture content, the specific  absorption of the primaries was reduced to 1.03 J/g, that of the secondaries was reduced to 1.72 J/g, and that of the alulae to 0.39 J/g. The feather shafts have the advantage of light weight while maintaining the required mechanical properties. These results provide a theoretical and experimental basis for crashworthiness in bionic designs based on the requirements of light weight.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649410>Numerical aspects of anisotropic failure in soft biological tissues favor -based criteria: A rate-dependent anisotropic crack phase-field model.</a></h2><p>A deeper understanding to predict fracture in soft biological tissues is of crucial importance to better guide and improve medical monitoring, planning of surgical interventions and risk assessment of diseases such as aortic dissection, aneurysms, atherosclerosis and tears in tendons and ligaments. In our previous contribution (Gültekin et al., 2016) we have addressed the rupture of aortic tissue by applying a holistic geometrical approach to fracture, namely the crack phase-field approach emanating from variational fracture mechanics and gradient damage theories. In the present study, the crack phase-field model is extended to capture anisotropic fracture using an anisotropic volume-specific crack surface function. In addition, the model is equipped with a rate-dependent formulation of the phase-field evolution. The continuum framework captures anisotropy, is thermodynamically consistent and based on finite strains. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equations are solved by an operator-splitting algorithm on the temporal side which is ensued by a Galerkin-type weak formulation on the spatial side. On the constitutive level, an invariant-based anisotropic material model accommodates the nonlinear elastic response of both the ground matrix and the collagenous components. Subsequently, the basis of extant anisotropic failure criteria are presented with an emphasis on -based, Tsai-Wu, Hill, and principal stress criteria. The predictions of the various failure criteria on the crack initiation, and the related crack propagation are studied using representative numerical examples, i.e. a homogeneous problem subjected to uniaxial and planar biaxial deformations is established to demonstrate the corresponding failure surfaces whereas uniaxial extension and peel tests of an anisotropic (hypothetical) tissue deal with the crack propagation with reference to the mentioned failure criteria. Results favor the -based criterion as a better candidate to reflect a stable and physically meaningful crack growth, particularly in complex three-dimensional geometries with a highly anisotropic texture at finite strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657410>Thermal conductivity suppression in GaAs-AlAs core-shell nanowire arrays.</a></h2><p>Semiconductor nanowire heterostructures have been shown to provide appealing properties for optoelectronics and solid-state  harvesting by thermoelectrics. Among these nanoarchitectures, coaxial core-shell nanowires have been of primary interest due to their electrical functionality, as well as intriguing phonon localization effects in the surface-dominated regime predicted via atomic simulations. However, experimental studies on the thermophysical properties of III-V semiconductor core-shell nanowires remain scarce regardless of the ubiquitous nature of these compounds in solid-state applications. Here, we present thermal conductivity measurements of the arrays of GaAs nanowires coated with AlAs shells. We unveil a strong suppression in thermal transport facilitated by the AlAs shells, up to ∼60%, producing a non-monotonous dependence of thermal conductivity on the shell thickness. Such translation of the novel heat transport phenomena to macroscopic nanowire arrays paves the way for rational thermal design in nanoscale applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657438>The role of ligand-gated conformational changes in enzyme catalysis.</a></h2><p>Structural and biochemical studies on diverse enzymes have highlighted the importance of ligand-gated conformational changes in enzyme catalysis, where the intrinsic binding  of the common phosphoryl group of their substrates is used to drive energetically unfavorable conformational changes in catalytic loops, from inactive open to catalytically competent closed conformations. However, computational studies have historically been unable to capture the activating role of these conformational changes. Here, we discuss recent experimental and computational studies, which can remarkably pinpoint the role of ligand-gated conformational changes in enzyme catalysis, even when not modeling the loop dynamics explicitly. Finally, through our joint analyses of these data, we demonstrate how the synergy between theory and experiment is crucial for furthering our understanding of enzyme catalysis.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657411>Free volume, gas permeation, and proton conductivity in MIL-101-SOH/Nafion composite membranes.</a></h2><p>A series of MIL-101-SO3H/Nafion composite membranes was synthesized. They show an improved proton conductivity, due to the abundance of SO3H groups, which fosters proton conduction by binding the water molecules and enabling a larger number of conducting sites. Gas (including water vapor, hydrogen, and oxygen) permeability, crystallinity, and free volumes of the MIL-101-SO3H/Nafion composite membranes were investigated, as well as their correlation. By increasing the MIL-101-SO3H content, the gas permeability of the membranes significantly decreases, since the crystalline region is larger and the water-bearing MIL-101-SO3H particles are efficient barriers for the gas molecules. The gas permeation in the composite membranes is a very complex process and the results indicate no simple linear relation between the gas permeability and the free volume size (VFV), or between the gas permeability and the crystallinity. Moreover, it is very interesting to observe that the influence of VFV on the gas permeability is closely related to the size of the particular gas molecules: the larger the size of the gas molecules, the larger the free volume needed to achieve their rapid diffusion in the membrane. The results suggest the presence of a threshold value for VFV, which depends on the size of the gas molecules: when VFV is lower than this value, the gas molecules cannot easily jump through neighboring free volumes to a neighboring site, and, as a result, the permeability drops quickly.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660726>Poly (vinylene carbonate)-Based Composite Polymer Electrolyte with Enhanced Interfacial Stability to Realize High Performance Room-Temperature Solid-State Sodium Batteries.</a></h2><p>Polymer electrolytes are considered as promising candidates to power a multitude of high safety level and high  density solid-state batteries. However, commercial applications of polymer electrolyte-based solid-state batteries are still significantly limited by the low room-temperature ionic conductivity, poor mechanical properties as well as weak interfacial stability between electrode and electrolyte, especially for room-temperature solid-state batteries. In this study, a novel poly (vinylene carbonate)-based composite polymer electrolyte (PVC-CPE) prepared by a facile in situ solidification method, is reported for the first time to realize high performances of solid-state sodium batteries at room temperature. This in situ solidified PVC-CPE possesses superior room-temperature ionic conductivity (0.12 mS cm-1), high Na+ transference number (t_(〖Na〗^+ )= 0.60), wide electrochemical window (up to 5.3 V, vs. Na+/Na) and enhanced electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability. Notably, the composite cathode NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (c-NFM) is designed through in situ growth of polymer electrolyte inside the electrode to decrease interfacial resistance and facilitate effective ion transport in electrode/electrolyte interfaces. It is demonstrated that the solid-state c-NFM/PVC-CPE/Na battery assembled by one-step in situ solidification method exhibits remarkably enhanced cell performances at room temperature compared with a reference NFM/PVC-CPE/Na assembled through a conventional ex situ method. The battery delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 104.2 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of about 86.8% after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, and superior rate performance with discharge specific capacity of 80.2 mAh g-1 at 1 C. This study suggests that PVC-CPE is a very promising electrolyte for solid-state sodium batteries. This work also provides a new strategy for design of high performance polymer electrolytes for other solid-state rechargeable batteries to realize high safety and considerable electrochemical performance at room temperature.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657820>Path integral methods for reaction rates in complex systems.</a></h2><p>We shall use this introduction to the Faraday Discussion on quantum effects in complex systems to review the recent progress that has been made in using imaginary time path integral methods to calculate chemical reaction rates. As a result of this progress, it is now routinely possible to calculate accurate rate constants including quantum mechanical zero point  and tunnelling effects for arbitrarily complex (anharmonic and multi-dimensional) systems. This is true in the adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer) limit, in the non-adiabatic (Fermi Golden Rule) limit, and everywhere between these two limits in the normal Marcus regime.

Renewable  such as wind and solar sources are intermittent, therefore,  storage devices become more and more important to store  for use when no wind or no light. Supercapacitors play a key role in  storage, mainly due to their high power density and long cycling life.

Metal elements with proper electronegativity scale have the potential to transfer electron for  storage. Suitable positive and negative electrodes matching can enhance many properties of supercapacitors, which may overcome many related obstacles.

The isotope holmium-166 is attractive as it emits high- beta radiation which can be used for a therapeutic effect and gamma radiation which can be used for nuclear imaging purposes. Furthermore, holmium-165 can be visualized by MRI because of its paramagnetic properties and by CT because of its high density. Since holmium-165 has a natural abundance of 100%, the only by-product is metastable holmium-166 and no costly chemical purification steps are necessary for production of nuclear reactor derived holmium-166. Several compounds labelled with holmium-166 are now used in patients, such Ho-labelled microspheres for liver malignancies, Ho-labelled chitosan for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and [Ho]Ho DOTMP for bone metastases. The outcomes in patients are very promising, making this isotope more and more interesting for applications in interventional oncology. Both drugs as well as medical devices labelled with radioactive holmium are used for internal radiotherapy. One of the treatment possibilities is direct intratumoural treatment, in which the radioactive compound is injected with a needle directly into the tumour. Numerous other applications have been developed, like patches for treatment of skin cancer and holmium labelled antibodies and peptides. The second major application that is currently clinically applied is selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT, also called radioembolization), a novel treatment option for liver malignancies.

In past several decades, much effort has been put into studying the molecular structure of electrolytes composed of organic carbonates. However, other solvents with similar properties but better thermal stabilities, such as tertiary amides, have not received the same level of scrutiny. In this work, solutions of lithium salts in ureas, tertiary amides with structure RR'N-CO-NR''R''', with different sizes and connectivity are studied. Ureas present an interesting case study because unlike organic carbonates the amide bond is planar and has restricted conformational change. In addition, ureas cannot bind the lithium ion through their nitrogen atoms. By using steady-state and time-resolved infrared spectroscopies and ab-initio computational methods, detailed descriptions of the changes to the lithium ion solvation structure as a result of the urea structure were derived for three ureas bearing a strong resemblance to commonly used organic carbonates. These results show that the solvation shell of ureas has a tetrahedral structure similar to other organic solvents. Although the structure of the amide bonds in these ureas is similar to that of carbonate molecules, the atomic connectivity differs. In addition, the dynamics of the cation solvation shell formed by ureas shows a picosecond motion, which is attributed to deformation of the tetrahedral structure. Our investigations also indicate that the deformation dynamics is controlled directly by the size of the urea due to the rigidity of the amide bond in these molecules. Overall, this work shows that ureas share similarity with their organic carbonate analogues, but the rigid amide structure provides an easier framework for interpreting the vibrational observations in terms of the solvent molecular structure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658287>Heads or tails? Differential translational regulation in cercarial heads and tails of schistosome worms.</a></h2><p>Schistosomes are obligate helminths responsible for over 218 million cases of human schistosomiasis in 78 countries around the world. Infection occurs when free-swimming cercariae penetrate human skin and initiate developmental progression into parasitic obligate worms that consume red blood cells. Transcriptomic studies of infectious cercariae reveal abundant mRNAs associated with  metabolism and host invasion. However, the cercaria is mostly transcriptionally quiescent, suggesting that most mRNAs are primed prior to cercarial escape from the snail host. The use of transcriptomics to understand protein expression presumes that transcription and translation are functionally coupled and the cercarial stage has categorically been treated as a single unit for -omic analysis. Per contra, the relationship between transcription and translation in infectious cercariae has not been described. To understand the correlation between transcription and translation in cercariae, we separately measured nascent translation levels in cercarial heads, cercarial tails and in the developing schistosomula, the next stage of its life cycle. The loss of the cercarial tail is essential for the transformation from a cercaria to a schistosomulum. We observed that translation was initially limited and the translation rate accelerated during the first 72-hours after tail loss. When we tested nascent translation in cercarial heads, cercarial tails, whole cercariae, and 4-hour schistosomula, we found that translation is significantly upregulated in the cercarial tail when compared to the cercarial head and that translation was undetectable in heads using immunofluorescent image quantification (p = .0005). These data represent a major shift in how we understand the cercarial stage. The cercarial head is mostly transcriptionally and translationally quiescent while being sufficient for progression into a schistosomulum. In addition, transcription and translation are not linked in Schistosoma mansoni cercaria. Thus, our current conceptual approach of treating the cercaria as a single functional unit for -omic studies may be insufficient to understand cercarial development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657407>Simulation of tuning graphene plasmonic behaviors by ferroelectric domains for self-driven infrared photodetector applications.</a></h2><p>We demonstrate a tunable longwave infrared photodetector with ultra-high sensitivity based on graphene surface plasmon polaritons controlled by ferroelectric domains. The simulated results show that the photodetector shows a tunable absorption peak, modulated by periodically polarized ferroelectric domains at the nanoscale, with an ultra-high responsivity up to 7.62 × 106 A W-1 and a detectivity of ∼6.24 × 1013 Jones (Jones = cm Hz1/2 W-1) in the wavelengths ranging from 5 to 20 μm at room temperature. The potential mechanism for the prominent performances of the proposed photodetector can be attributed to the highly confined graphene surface plasmons excited by the local electrical field across the interface of the graphene and ferroelectric layer resonant to the incident wavelength, which could be easily controlled by the features of the ferroelectric domains. Compared with the silicon-based graphene plasmonic photodetector using a complex process of micro-nano fabrication, the proposed photodetector provides the advantages of a more convenient and controllable technique without the need for patterning graphene, and lower  consumption due to the non-volatile properties of the ferroelectrics without an additional contact electrode.

Filamentous bacterial cells could represent a possible strategy to increase PHA yield, since more abundant PHA inclusions can be stored in elongated than in rod-shaped cells. At first, we determined the optimal batch culture conditions to induce filamentation in Pseudomonas mediterranea CFBP-5447T, using glutamine, glycerol, glucose, and sodium octanoate, as the sole carbon source, at low- (100 rpm) or high- (250 rpm) shaking speeds. Successively, a fermentative process was set up using glutamine in a co-metabolic strategy with glycerol, and the PHAs production was compared in rod-shaped and filamentous cells. High glutamine concentrations (from 28 to 56 mM) were able to induce alone filamentation, whereas at lower glutamine concentrations (5-10 mM), the shaking speeds became critical to allow or not filamentous phenotype. PHA granule production was higher in filamentous than in rod-shaped cells, when glycerol (46.6 mM) was added to glutamine (5 mM) in co-metabolism, and fermentation was performed at a low-shaking speed. After extraction and precipitation, PHA yield was about two times higher in filamentous than that rod-shaped cells. Our results provide new insights into filament-inducing conditions and indicate a potential use of filamentous P. mediterranea CFBP-5447T cells to increase PHA yield. These findings could have great advantages in PHAs recovering during downstream processes, since the harvesting of elongated cells is much less time-consuming and  expensive than required with rod-shaped cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660296>Scanned Proton Beam Performance and Calibration of the Shanghai Advanced Proton Therapy Facility.</a></h2><p>The Shanghai Advanced Proton Therapy facility (SAPT) is a hospital-based facility that began construction in December of 2014 with commissioning of the first scanned proton beam line starting in October of 2017.

Moreover, nuclear magnetic resonance or Förster resonance  transfer can measure structural dynamics. Here, we propose to add optical second-harmonic generation (SHG), which is a nonlinear optical scattering process sensitive to molecular structures in illuminated materials, to the tool-kit of structural analysis methodologies. SHG can be expected to probe the structural changes of proteins in the physiological condition, and thus link protein structure and biological function. We demonstrate that a conformational change as well as its dynamics in protein macromolecular assemblies can be detected by means of SHG polarization measurement. To prove the capability of SHG polarization measurement with regard to protein structure analysis, we developed an SHG polarization microscope to analyze microtubules in solution. The difference in conformation between microtubules with different binding molecules was successfully observed as polarization dependence of SHG intensity. We also succeeded in capturing the temporal variation of structure in a photo-switchable protein crystal in both activation and inactivation processes.

Here, we demonstrate a solar-heating siphon-capillary oil skimmer (S-SOS) that harvests solar , gravitational potential  and solid surface  to enable efficient oil spill recovery in a self-pumping manner. The S-SOS is assembled by an inverted U-shape porous architecture combining solar-heating, siphon and capillary effects, and works without any external power and manual interventions. Importantly, solid surface  is used by capillary adsorption to enable the self-starting behaviour, gravitational potential  is utilized by siphon transport to drive the oil flow, and solar  is harvested by solar-thermal conversion to facilitate the transport speed. In the proof-of-concept work, an all-carbon hierarchical architecture (VG/GF) is fabricated by growing vertically-oriented graphene nanosheets (VGs) on a monolith of graphite felt (GF) via a plasma-enhanced method to serve as the U-shape architecture. Consequently, an oil-recovery rate of 35.2 L m-2 h-1 is obtained at ambient condition. When exposed to a normal solar irradiation, the oil-recovery rate dramatically increases to 123.3 L m-2 h-1. Meanwhile, the solar-thermal  efficiency is calculated to be 75.3%. Moreover, the S-SOS system presents excellent stability without obvious performance-degradation over 60 hours. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the enhanced siphon action, capillary action, photonic absorption and interfacial heating in the plasma-made graphene nanostructures. Multiple merits make the current S-SOS design and the VG/GF nanostructures promising for efficient oil recovery and transport of  stored in chemical bonds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658292>Thermogravimetric analysis of the co-combustion of coal and polyvinyl chloride.</a></h2><p>Coal gangue has the shortcomings of low calorific value and refractory burnout, while polyvinyl chloride has the advantages of a long combustion process and high calorific value. In order to make up for these shortcomings of coal gangue, the possibility of a treatment method based on co-combustion of coal gangue with polyvinyl chloride, which can be centrally recovered from municipal solid waste, is proposed. In order to analyze the combustion effect of a mixture of these two substances, experimental samples were prepared by mixing these two substances in three different ratios, and they were tested by thermogravimetric analysis. The experimental results were compared, analyzed and evaluated. The effects of the proportion of polyvinyl chloride in the mixture on the temperature parameters, activation , and interaction during co-combustion were analyzed. In order to analyze the interaction during co-combustion of the two, a coupling analysis method for mixed combustion is presented, and the effectiveness of this method is verified by comparing with the correlation analysis results of co-combustion. The results show that co-combustion can mitigate the ignition difficulty and burnout of coal gangue. When the proportion of polyvinyl chloride in the mixture was increased from 20% to 80%, the maximum weightlessness rate of the first stage rapidly increased from 4.5%/min to 15.6%/min; however, that of the second stage slowly increased from 3.7%/min to 4.2%/min. A 20% proportion of polyvinyl chloride showed the most significant promotion of co-combustion, with a maximum coupling coefficient of 0.00318, which was 1.11 and 1.35 times greater than that of 50% and 80% proportions, respectively. Co-combustion can reduce the activation  of coal gangue during the initial and end stages. Therefore, co-combustion is helpful to improve the problems of low calorific value and refractory burnout of coal gangue.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659198>Arctic seabirds and shrinking sea ice: egg analyses reveal the importance of ice-derived resources.</a></h2><p>In the Arctic, sea-ice plays a central role in the functioning of marine food webs and its rapid shrinking has large effects on the biota. It is thus crucial to assess the importance of sea-ice and ice-derived resources to Arctic marine species. Here, we used a multi-biomarker approach combining Highly Branched Isoprenoids (HBIs) with δC and δN to evaluate how much Arctic seabirds rely on sea-ice derived resources during the pre-laying period, and if changes in sea-ice extent and duration affect their investment in reproduction. Eggs of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) and northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) were collected in the Canadian Arctic during four years of highly contrasting ice conditions, and analysed for HBIs, isotopic (carbon and nitrogen) and energetic composition. Murres heavily relied on ice-associated prey, and sea-ice was beneficial for this species which produced larger and more -dense eggs during icier years. In contrast, fulmars did not exhibit any clear association with sympagic communities and were not impacted by changes in sea ice. Murres, like other species more constrained in their response to sea-ice variations, therefore appear more sensitive to changes and may become the losers of future climate shifts in the Arctic, unlike more resilient species such as fulmars.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657572>Formation of CH4 Hydrate in a Mesoporous Metal-organic framework MIL-101: Mechanistic Insights from Microsecond Molecular Dynamics Simulations.</a></h2><p>The formation of CH4 hydrate in a mesoporous metal-organic framework MIL-101 is investigated by microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. CH4 hydrate is observed to form preferentially in the outer space of MIL-101 cavities rather than inside the cavities; only when the hydrate formation is nearly complete in the outer space, can stable hydrate form in MIL-101 cavities. The underlying reason is revealed to be the easy dissociation of small hydrate clusters formed in the nanospace of the cavities, due to the diffusion of CH4 molecules out of the cavities into the outer space. Compared with dry MIL-101, CH4 storage capacity of H2O-saturated MIL-101 is drastically reduced as the cavities are occupied by H2O. When oversaturated with H2O, however, extra H2O molecules in the outer space of the cavities can form considerable CH4 hydrate, significantly promoting CH4 storage capacity. This study provides important mechanistic insights into the formation mechanism and process of CH4 hydrate in MIL-101, and would facilitate the design of emerging materials for  storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658682>Biomimetic Hydroxyapatite on Graphene Supports for Biomedical Applications: A Review.</a></h2><p>Hydroxyapatite (HA) has been widely used in fields of materials science, tissue engineering, biomedicine,  and environmental science, and analytical science due to its simple preparation, low-cost, and high biocompatibility. To overcome the weak mechanical properties of pure HA, various reinforcing materials were incorporated with HA to form high-performance composite materials. Due to the unique structural, biological, electrical, mechanical, thermal, and optical properties, graphene has exhibited great potentials for supporting the biomimetic synthesis of HA. In this review, we present recent advance in the biomimetic synthesis of HA on graphene supports for biomedical applications.

The addition of BFO nanostructures greatly enhanced the crystallinity, grain size and film uniformity of MAPbI.

Its biological conversion into a stable form can be obtained through urea hydrolysis, subsequent nitrification, and organics removal, to recover a nitrate-enriched stream, free of oxygen demand. In this study, the utilization of a microbial community for urine nitrification was optimized with the focus for space application. To assess the role of selected parameters that can impact ureolysis in urine, the activity of six ureolytic heterotrophs ( and ) was tested at different salinities, urea, and amino acid concentrations. The interaction of the ureolytic heterotrophs with a nitrifying consortium ( ATCC 19718 and  ATCC 25931) was also tested. Lastly, microgravity was simulated in a clinostat utilizing hardware for in-flight experiments with active microbial cultures. The results indicate salt inhibition of the ureolysis at 30 mS cm, while amino acid nitrogen inhibits ureolysis in a strain-dependent manner. The combination of the nitrifiers with  and  resulted in a complete halt of the urea hydrolysis process, while in the case of  incomplete nitrification was observed, and nitrite was not oxidized further to nitrate. Nitrate production was confirmed in all the other communities; however, the other heterotrophic strains most likely induced oxygen competition in the test setup, and nitrite accumulation was observed. Samples exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity through clinorotation behaved similarly to the static controls. Overall, nitrate production from urea was successfully demonstrated with synthetic microbial communities under terrestrial and simulated space gravity conditions, corroborating the application of this process in space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661239>High Ion Transport within Freeze-Casted Gel Film for High-Rate Integrated Flexible Supercapacitors.</a></h2><p>Gel electrolytes are important components in flexible solid-state supercapacitors. An urgent need exists for gel electrolytes that can store abundant electrolyte ion and provide high ionic conductivity, with performance characteristics similar to liquid electrolyte, enabling high power capability for devices. Herein, we have reported a general and scalable strategy toward various high performance gel electrolytes including the first freeze of chemical cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) followed by infusing with different electrolytes (acid, neutral, alkaline). The engineering not only endow robust electrolytes ion retention ability, outstanding ion migration rate, but also strengthen the mechanical properties for gel electrolytes. As a proof of application, we demonstrate that an all-in-one supercapacitor with H2SO4 gel electrolyte can deliver excellent rate capability (58.2 % retention under the 50-fold increase in current densities), high areal capacitance (644.4 mF cm-2), long operating lifetime (63.6% retention after 50,000 cycles), representing the best performance among the previously reported all-in-one devices.

The controlled release of FGF4, a novel neuroprotective factor, from a versatile Laponite hydrogel to the injured site was a promising strategy to promote axon regeneration and motor functional recovery after SCI.  Characterization of Laponite, Laponite/Heparin (Lap/Hep) and Laponite/Heparin loaded with FGF4 (Lap/Hep@FGF4) hydrogels were measured by rheometer. Multiple comprehensive evaluations were used to detect motor functional recovery and the axonal rehabilitation after Lap/Hep@FGF4 treatment  (SCI rat model). Moreover, microtubule dynamic and  transportation, which regulated axonal regeneration was evaluated by Lap/Hep@FGF4 gel  (primary neuron).  FGF4 released from Lap/Hep gel locally achieves strong protection and regeneration after SCI. The Lap/Hep@FGF4 group revealed remarkable motor functional recovery and axonal regrowth after SCI through suppressing inflammatory reaction, increasing remyelination and reducing glial/fibrotic scars. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of axonal rehabilitation were demonstrated via enhancing microtubule stability and regulating mitochondrial localization after Lap/Hep@FGF4 treatment.  This promising sustained release system provides a synergistic effective approach to enhance recovery after SCI underlying a novel mechanism of axonal rehabilitation, and shows a translational prospect for the clinical treatment of SCI.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658730>Enhanced Two-Photon Fluorescence and Fluorescence Imaging of Novel Probe for Calcium Ion by Self-Assembly with Conjugated Polymer.</a></h2><p>The calcium ion (Ca) isa highly versatile intracellular signal messenger regulating many different cellular functions. It is important to design probes with good fluorescence and two-photon (TP) active cross-sections (Φ) to explore the concentration distribution of Ca. In this manuscript, a novel TP fluorescence calcium probe (BAPTAVP) with positive charges, based on the classical Ca indicator of BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane--tetra acetic acid), and a conjugated polymer (PCBMB) with negative charges were designed and synthesized. The results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and the zeta potential (ZP) showed that nanoparticles were obtained by the self-assembly of PCBMB and BAPTAVP. Moreover, the fluorescence properties of BAPTAVP were effectively improved by fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET) with PCBMB and attenuating the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) after the addition of Ca. The quantum yield and Φ of PCBMB-BAPTAVP increased by about four and six times in comparison to those of BAPTAVP, respectively. The TP fluorescence imaging experiments indicated that the PCBMB-BAPTAVP system could effectively detect Ca in living cells with high sensitivity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657417>Electronic modulation of composite electrocatalysts derived from layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide nanosheets for boosted overall water splitting.</a></h2><p>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe and Mn co-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays (FM-NS NSAs) as well as layered NiFeMn triple hydroxide (NiFeMn-LTH)/FM-NS hybrid NSAs (HNSAs) via an easily controllable sulfidation method with NiFeMn-LTH NSAs as the precursor, which can be employed as coupled oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes to achieve boosted overall water splitting performance. It is discovered that the incorporation of the dual Fe and Mn cations can simultaneously modulate the morphology and optimize the electron density of the obtained catalysts. As a result, the full sulfidation product of FM-NS NSAs display a much-enhanced activity for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with an overpotential of 188 mV. The NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSAs obtained from partial sulfidation demonstrate an enhanced HER activity with a lower overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The FM-NS NSA anode and the NiFeMn-LTH/FM-NS HNSA cathode were coupled in an alkaline medium for overall water splitting and exhibited a much lower cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-2, superior to most of the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

To investigate these energetic trade-offs, we compared the body mass of male and female pond bats (Myotis dasycneme) through the summer season, characterized the known hibernacula in terms of male or female bias, and subsequently compared their population trend during two study periods, between 1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Towards the end of summer, males began losing weight whilst females were simultaneously accumulating fat, suggesting that males were pre-occupied with mating. We also found evidence for a recent adaptation to this energetic trade-off, males have colonised winter roosts in formerly unoccupied areas, which has consequently led to a change in the migration patterns for the male population of this species. As male bats do not assist in raising offspring, males have ample time to restore their  balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the summer range not only decreases  cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating season of the individual male. Our findings have important conservation implications, as male and female biased hibernation assemblages may differ critically in terms of microclimate preferences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660734>Bulk/Surface Defects Engineered TiO2 Nanotube Photonic Crystals Coupled with Plasmonic Gold Nanoparticles for Effective in vivo Near-Infrared Light Photoelectrochemical Detection.</a></h2><p>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technique are of fundamental and practical importance, and has been widely used for solar  conversion and experimental protection. Besides these important applications, an emerging and fast developing PEC application of PEC bioanalysis is receiving more attention both from academic and clinic communities. However, the typical PEC biosensing is still limited under illumination of ultraviolet and visible (UV/Vis) light, which hampers its in vivo detection in deep tissues. Ex-panding the optical absorption wavelength of photoelectrodes from UV/Vis light region into near infrared (NIR) light region is highly desirable due to its deep tissue penetrability and minimal invasiveness for organisms, but the exploration of facile strategy to implement efficient NIR absorption with biocompatible materials is still a big challenge. Herein, under guidance of theorical calculations, we propose a strategy through modulation of bulk/surface defects and decoration of Au nanoparticles on TiO2 nano-tube photonic crystals to implement efficient NIR response, and thus successfully realize sensitive and selective PEC detection of antibiotics in real bio- and experimental- samples under NIR illumination, in addition, we first implement the in vivo PEC detec-tion under illumination of NIR light. We have faith in that this new NIR photoelectric responsive strategy will provide a broad idea and platform for detection of life-related biomolecules in deep tissues or even in vivo for real-time measurement and shed light on the intrinsic connections between biomarkers and clinical diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661238>Inhibition of Crystallization of Poly(ethylene oxide) by Ionic Liquid: Insight into Plasticizing Mechanism and Application for Solid-State Sodium Ion Batteries.</a></h2><p>All-solid-state sodium ion batteries (ASIBs) possess enhanced safety and desired cycling life compared with conventional liquid sodium batteries, showing great potential in large-scale  storage system. And polymer electrolytes based on poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) have been extensively studied for ASIBs due to its superior flexibility and processability. Nevertheless, PEO-based electrolyte without any modification can hardly meet the requirement of ASIBs at room temperature. In the past decade, unremitting efforts have been attached to inhibiting crystallization of PEO, especially via ionic liquid plasticizing. However, the plasticizing mechanism is not clear. Here, we incorporated Pyr13FSI into PEO-NaClO4 electrolyte to investigate the plasticizing effect by infrared spectrum characterizations and DFT calculations. The results indicate that FSI- anions tend to adhere to PEO backbone, generating enhanced coordination ability and more coordination site. Solid-state sodium ion batteries using PEO-NaClO4-40wt% Pyr13FSI as polymer electrolyte exhibit good cycling and rate performance.

While FCDI holds promise for continuous operation, there are very few investigations in regard to the regeneration/reuse of flowable electrodes and the separation of brine from electrodes with these operations prerequisites for real non-intermittent water desalination. In this study, we propose a novel module design to achieve these critical steps involving integration of an FCDI cell and a ceramic microfiltration (MF) contactor. Our investigations reveal that the brine discharge rate is the dominant factor for stable and efficient operation of the integrated module. Results obtained show that the integrated FCDI/MF system can be used to successfully separate brackish water (of salinities 1, 2 and 5 g L-1) into both a potable stream (<0.5 g L-1) and a brine stream (concentrated 2-20 times) in a continuous manner with extremely high water recovery rates (up to 97%) and reasonable  consumption. Another notable characteristic of the integrated system is the high thermodynamic  efficiency (~30%) with such efficiencies 4-5 times larger than those of conventional CDI units and comparable to RO plants achieving similar separations. In brief, the results of studies described here indicate that continuous and efficient operation of FCDI is a real possibility and pave the way for scale-up of this emerging technology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659028>Tuning friction to a superlubric state via in-plane straining.</a></h2><p>Controlling, and in many cases minimizing, friction is a goal that has long been pursued in history. From the classic Amontons-Coulomb law to the recent nanoscale experiments, the steady-state friction is found to be an inherent property of a sliding interface, which typically cannot be altered on demand. In this work, we show that the friction on a graphene sheet can be tuned reversibly by simple mechanical straining. In particular, by applying a tensile strain (up to 0.60%), we are able to achieve a superlubric state (coefficient of friction nearly 0.001) on a suspended graphene. Our atomistic simulations together with atomically resolved friction images reveal that the in-plane strain effectively modulates the flexibility of graphene. Consequently, the local pinning capability of the contact interface is changed, resulting in the unusual strain-dependent frictional behavior. This work demonstrates that the deformability of atomic-scale structures can provide an additional channel of regulating the friction of contact interfaces involving configurationally flexible materials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657818>Stabilization of a 4.5 V Cr/Cr redox reaction in NASICON-type NaCr(PO) by Ti substitution.</a></h2><p>The development of high-voltage cathode materials composed of abundant metals for rechargeable batteries is a crucial task to realize higher  density in large-scale electrical  storage systems.

The expression of NPY receptors (YR/YR) specific to baroreflex afferents impacts on the sexually dimorphic neural control of circulation. This study was designed to investigate the expression profiles of NPY receptors in the nodose ganglion (NG) and nucleus tractus solitary (NTS) under hypertensive conditions. To this end, rats with hypertension induced by N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) or high fructose drinking (HFD), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were used to explore the effects/mechanisms of NPY on BP using functional, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. The data showed that BP was elevated along with baroreceptor sensitivity dysfunction in model rats; YR was up- or down-regulated in the NG or NTS of male and female HFD/L-NAME groups, while YR was only down-regulated in the HFD groups as well as in the NG of the male L-NAME group. In SHRs, YR and YR were both down-regulated in the NTS, and not in the NG. In addition to NPY-mediated  homeostasis, leptin-melanocortin activation may be essential for metabolic disturbance-related hypertension. We found that leptin and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) receptors were aberrantly down-regulated in HFD rats. In addition, α-MSH concentrations were reduced and NPY concentrations were elevated in the serum and NTS at 60 and 90 min after acute leptin infusion. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the decay time-constant and area under the curve of excitatory post-synaptic currents were decreased by YR activation in A-types, whereas, both were increased by YR activation in Ah- or C-types. These results demonstrate that sex- and afferent-specific NPY receptor expression in the baroreflex afferent pathway is likely to be a novel target for the clinical management of metabolism-related and essential hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657398>Correction: Limestone calcination under calcium-looping conditions for CO capture and thermochemical  storage in the presence of HO: an in situ XRD analysis.</a></h2><p>Correction for 'Limestone calcination under calcium-looping conditions for CO2 capture and thermochemical  storage in the presence of H2O: an in situ XRD analysis' by Jose Manuel Valverde et al., Phys.

Firstly, the mean-square displacement (MSD) is investigated under various system parameters of active force Fa, probe size σa, polymer volume fraction φ and polymer chain length N. A very novel transition between superdiffusion and subdiffusion is observed with varying Fa and φ, owing to the activity and crowding competition effect. The two anomalous diffusion regimes are identified in the parameter space diagram. The increment of the MSD under activity is examined on intermediate time scales, which manifests a power law relation with the particle's dynamical persistence length L, i.e., ΔMSD = 2Lm, where the exponent m decreases with φ. Secondly, we explicitly evaluate the long-time diffusion coefficients D0a in a pure solvent and Da in polymer solutions. The dependence of relative diffusivity Da/D0a on volume fraction φ reproduces the well-known Phillies' equation exp(-κφμ). The fitting parameters show μ ≃ 1, but κ apparently increases with activity. More importantly, our simulation justifies a multi-length scaling relation in a very similar form to that for passive probes, depending on simple structural parameters of the probe-polymer system. With the aid of an activation  model, we find a counterintuitive activity-crowding coupling effect: activity enhances the effective viscosity experienced by the probe and thus strengthens the crowding-induced slowing of diffusion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661401>Improved safety checklist analysis approach using intelligent video surveillance in the construction industry - a case study.</a></h2><p>The construction industry is extremely high-risk, and safety checklist analysis (SCA) is a widely used approach for safety assessment.

Featuring unique physical microenvironment, the tumor microenvironment (TME) provides a new research direction for designing more efficient and safer treatment paradigm. In this study, we fabricated a polydopamine (PDA)-based TME-responsive nanosystem, which successfully integrate glucose degradation, Fenton reaction and photothermal therapy for efficient cancer therapy. Through a convenient hydrothermal method, Fe2+ doped Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA nanoparticle was successfully fabricated, which shows excellent photothermal effect and interesting reactivity for Fenton reaction. Instead of introducing of toxic anticancer agents, natural glucose oxidase (GOD) was grafted on the Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA, forming a cascade catalytic nanomedicine for specific response to the glucose in TME. The GOD grafted on the Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA-GOD is ought to catalyze rich glucose in TME into gluconic acid and H2O2. The concomitant generation of H2O2 can enhance the efficiency of sequential Fenton reaction, producing abundant hydroxyl radicals (OH) for cancer therapy. Besides, the extra consumption of intratumoral glucose also could inhibit tumor growth by reducing the  supply. Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor studies of such TME-based Fe(Ⅱ)-PDA-GOD nanosystems displayed a favorable synergistic potency of glucose degradation, Fenton reaction and photothermal therapy against tumor growth. Our design expands the biological application of multifunctional PDA, while provides novel strategies toward effective anti-tumor treatment with minimal side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660051>Measurement of percentage dose at the surface for a 6 MV photon beam.</a></h2><p>To evaluate if a radiochromic film (RF) Gafchromic EBT3 is suitable for surface dose measurements of radiotherapy treatments performed with a 6 MV linear accelerator. Two aspects of RF were analyzed, beam  dependence and surface dose determination.The measurements done at the surface or near the radiation source are done without charged electronic equilibrium and also have contribution of electron contamination. The detectors used for these measurements should not alter the dose to the target. To counteract these dosimetric problems it is proposed to do the measurements with radiochromic films which are thin detectors and have tissue equivalent properties.The measurements were done using a Novalis linear accelerator (LINAC) with nominal  of 6 MV. To determine the surface dose, the total scatter factors (TSF) of three different field sizes were measured in a water phantom at 5 cm depth.  dependence of EBT3 was studied at three different depths, using a solid water phantom. The surface measurements were done with the RF for the same field sizes of the TSF measurements. The value of the percentage depth dose was calculated normalizing the doses measured in the RF with the LINAC output, at 5 cm depth, and the TSF.The radiochromic films showed almost  independence, the differences between the curves are 1.7% and 1.8% for the 1.5 cm and 10 cm depth, respectively. The percentage depth doses values at the surface measured for the 10 cm × 10 cm, 5 cm × 5 cm and 1 cm × 1 cm were 26.1 ± 1.3%, 21.3 ± 2.4% and 20.2 ± 2.6%, respectively.The RF-EBT3 seems to be a detector suitable for measurements of the dose at the surface. This suggests that RF-EBT3 films might be good candidates as detectors for in vivo dosimetry.© 2019 Greater Poland Cancer Centre. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Protein phosphorylation carries out an important regulatory function in plant defense responses, while the global phosphoproteome changes in rice response to SA-mediated defense response has not been reported. In this study, a comparative phosphoproteomic profiling was conducted by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, with two near-isogenic rice cultivars after SA treatment.Thirty-seven phosphoprotein spots were differentially expressed after SA treatment, twenty-nine of which were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, belonging to nine functional categories. Phosphoproteins involved in photosynthesis, antioxidative enzymes, molecular chaperones were similarly expressed in the two cultivars, suggesting SA might alleviate decreases in plant photosynthesis, regulate the antioxidant defense activities, thus improving basal resistance response in both cultivars. Meanwhile, phosphoproteins related to defense, carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and degradation were differentially expressed, suggesting phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may coordinate complex cellular activities in the two cultivars. Furthermore, the phosphorylation sites of four identified phosphoproteins were verified by NanoLC-MS/MS, and phosphorylated regulation of three enzymes (cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, phosphoglycerate mutase and ascorbate peroxidase) was validated by activity determination.Our study suggested that phosphorylation regulation mediated by SA may contribute to the different resistance response of the two cultivars. To our knowledge, this is the first report to measure rice phosphoproteomic changes in response to SA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of SA-induced rice defense.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657945>Leadless cardiac pacing systems: current status and future prospects.</a></h2><p>: Permanent transvenous pacemaker therapy is an essential management option in patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, but harbors a concomitant risk of serious complications. As most complications are lead- or pocket-related, intracardiac leadless pacemaker therapy has the potential to positively impact patient outcome. Since the first leadless pacemaker implant in 2012, many studies have been conducted to evaluate effectiveness, safety and applicability of this novel pacing approach. : This review will cover the current status of leadless pacemaker technology. Available safety and efficacy outcomes, current area of indication, and end-of-life management will be evaluated. Furthermore, future perspectives for clinical practice and new pacing modalities are discussed. : The first-generation leadless pacemakers are a promising innovation that provide safe and efficient single-chamber pacing therapy without the use of transvenous pacemaker leads. Yet, broad implementation of this technology is hampered by limitations of the current leadless devices, such as end-of-life management and its single-chamber pacing indication. Further innovations such as leadless dual-chamber pacing therapy, leadless cardiac synchronization therapy, -harvesting leadless pacemakers, communicating leadless pacemakers with subcutaneous implantable cardiac defibrillators, and minimally-invasive completely extracardiac pacemakers are currently being developed that have the potential to become major game changers in pacing therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658653>Ultra-High Refractive Index Sensing Structure Based on a Metal-Insulator-Metal Waveguide-Coupled T-Shape Cavity with Metal Nanorod Defects.</a></h2><p>An ultra-high plasmonic refractive index sensing structure composed of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide coupled to a T-shape cavity and several metal nanorod defects is proposed and investigated by using finite element method. The designed plasmonic MIM waveguide can constitute a cavity resonance zone and the metal nanorod defects can effectively trap the light in the T-shape cavity. The results reveal that both the size of defects in wider rectangular cavity and the length of narrower rectangular cavity are primary factors increasing the sensitivity performance. The sensitivity can achieve as high as 8280 nm/RIU (RIU denotes the refractive index unit), which is the highest sensitivity reported in plasmonic MIM waveguide-based sensors to our knowledge. In addition, the proposed structure can also serve as a temperature sensor with temperature sensitivity as high as 3.30 nm/°C.

Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to use a novel solid oat-based food (crisps) and oat-based beverage stimulus sweetened with sucralose to assess changes in taste perception after sleep curtailment. Forty-one participants recorded a habitual and curtailed night of sleep using a single-channel electroencephalograph. The next morning, overall sweetness, flavor, and texture liking responses to - and nutrient-matched oat products across five concentrations of sweetness were measured. Overall ( = 0.047) and flavor ( = 0.017) liking slopes across measured concentrations were steeper after curtailment, suggesting that sweeter versions of the oat products were liked more after sleep curtailment. Additionally, a hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify sweet likers and non-likers. While the effect of sleep curtailment on sweet liking did not differ between sweet liking classification categories, sleep curtailment resulted in decreased texture liking in the solid oat crisps for sweet non-likers ( < 0.001), but not in the oat beverage. These findings illustrate the varied effects of sleep on hedonic response in complex food matrices and possible mechanisms by which insufficient sleep can lead to sensory-moderated increases in  intake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657548>In Silico Design of Novel Mutant Anti-MUC1 Aptamers for Targeted Cancer Therapy.</a></h2><p>The transmembrane glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1) is an attractive tumor marker for cancer therapy and diagnosis. The nine amino acid extracellular epitope APDTRPAPG of this protein is selectively recognized by the S2.2 single-stranded DNA anti-MUC1 aptamer, which has emerged as a promising template for designing novel targeting agents for MUC1-directed therapy. In this work, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, MM/GBSA binding free  calculations, and conformational analysis were employed to propose a novel prospective anti-MUC1 aptamer with increased affinity towards the MUC1 epitope resulting from the double mutation of the T11 and T12 residues with PSU and U nucleosides, respectively. The double mutant aptamer exhibits a tight interaction with the MUC1 epitope and adopts a groove conformation that structurally favors the intermolecular contact with the epitope through the intermediate T11-A18 region leaving the 3´and 5´ends free for further chemical conjugation with a nanocarrier or pharmaceutical. These results are valuable to gain understanding about the molecular features governing aptamer-epitope interactions and constitute a first key step for the design of novel aptamer-based nanocarriers for MUC1-targeted cancer therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658684>Satellite Edge Computing for the Internet of Things in Aerospace.</a></h2><p>As one of the information industry's future development directions, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used. In order to reduce the pressure on the network caused by the long distance between the processing platform and the terminal, edge computing provides a new paradigm for IoT applications. In many scenarios, the IoT devices are distributed in remote areas or extreme terrain and cannot be accessed directly through the terrestrial network, and data transmission can only be achieved via satellite. However, traditional satellites are highly customized, and on-board resources are designed for specific applications rather than universal computing. Therefore, we propose to transform the traditional satellite into a space edge computing node. It can dynamically load software in orbit, flexibly share on-board resources, and provide services coordinated with the cloud. The corresponding hardware structure and software architecture of the satellite is presented. Through the modeling analysis and simulation experiments of the application scenarios, the results show that the space edge computing system takes less time and consumes less  than the traditional satellite constellation. The quality of service is mainly related to the number of satellites, satellite performance, and task offloading strategy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657936>Janus Nanoparticles Enable Entropy-Driven Mixing of Bi-component Hydrogels.</a></h2><p>Mixing incompatible polymers in water to form homogeneous hydrogels possessing both hydrophilic and lipophilic components is challenging due to high enthalpic penalty and negligible entropic gain in total Gibbs free . Here we performed dissipative particle dynamics simulations and machine learning to uncover the influence of Janus nanoparticles on immiscible polymer mixtures with high water content and to predict the phase behavior of bi-component hydrogels. An intriguing transition from kinetically arrested demixing to spontaneous mixing was observed with increasing particle concentration and decreasing particle size. The analysis reveals that the mixing is driven by a significant entropic gain of small nanoparticles being well dispersed in aqueous solvent of high-volume fraction. This finding highlights an entropy-driven mixing mechanism for nanocomposite bi-component hydrogels. Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to establish a microstructure phase diagram with respect to particle concentration and radius, in which homogeneous, percolated, clustered, and separated phases, as well as corresponding phase boundaries, were clearly identified.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660744>On Excitation  Transfer within the Baseplate BChl -CsmA Complex of .</a></h2><p>Recently, a hybrid approach combining solid-state NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy showed that the baseplate in the green sulfur bacterium  ()  is a 2D lattice of BChl -CsmA dimers [Nielsen, J.

However, their combined effects on key species have rarely been studied. The Mediterranean Sea is a hotspot of both ocean warming and bioinvasions, where their impact can be tested together. In recent years, the population of a key herbivore, the European purple sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus), has virtually collapsed along the Israeli Mediterranean coast (south-eastern Levant). Here, we used field and lab experiments to test two complementary hypotheses that may explain the urchin population collapse: (a) resource competition that may lead to competitive exclusion by invasive grazers (two Red Sea rabbitfishes); and (b) reduced performance due to ocean warming. An inclusion-exclusion in-situ caging experiment revealed a strong negative impact of fish grazing on algal cover and on the urchin's gut content and gonado-somatic index (GSI). Laboratory experiments revealed a considerable negative impact of both elevated temperature and food deficiency on sea urchin respiration and GSI, and consequently on its  budget and reproductive potential and, potentially, fitness. Such reduced reproductive capacity must have greatly lowered the sea urchin's population viability, contributing (and possibly even leading) to its collapse in the south-eastern Levant in the past two decades. Urchin population declines are expected to spread to the west and north of the Mediterranean Sea following further warming and rabbitfish expansion. This study is the first to demonstrate the potential additive effects of ocean warming and implied competitive exclusion by an invader on a native species at its warm biogeographic distribution edge.© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659477>Sensitivity thresholds of groundwater parameters for detecting CO leakage at a geologic carbon sequestration site.</a></h2><p>Geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) projects in the USA are required to monitor groundwater quality for geochemical changes above the injection area that may be a result of CO or brine leakage from the storage reservoir. Should CO migrate into the groundwater around the compliance wells monitoring the shallower hydrologic units, each compliance parameter could react differently depending on its sensitivity to CO. Statistically determined limits (SDLs) for detection of CO leakage into groundwater were calculated using background water quality data from the Illinois Basin Decatur Project (IBDP) sequestration site and prediction and tolerance intervals for specific compliance parameters. If the parameter concentrations varied outside of these ranges during the injection and post injection periods of a GCS project, then additional actions would be required to determine the reason for the changes in groundwater concentrations. Geochemical modeling can simulate the amount of CO needed to alter water quality parameters a statistically significant amount. This information can then inform GCS operators and regulators as to which compliance parameters are relevant (sensitive) to CO leakage for a given setting.

A general and facile synthesis has been developed to prepare nanostructured conducting polymer films without the need for using templates. This simple approach employs hyperbranched polymers as additives to tune the morphology of conducting polymer films into a continuous nanofibril network. Nanostructured conducting polymer films with improved crystallinity exhibit good charge carrier transport and stable nanofibril network, without sacrificing either property upon removing residual additives. Polymer field-effect transistor sensors have been used to demonstrate the benefits of the large surface area provided by the nanofibril network.

On the basis of the infrared spectra and density functional theory calculations, the SO ligand is bound to the metal center in a side-on fashion, and both complexes possess closed shell singlet ground states. The experimental S-O stretching frequencies of OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO) are much lower than those of SO but close to that of singlet SO, indicating that the SO ligand should be considered as SO. This is consistent with the rather long S-O bond length in comparison to that of the ONbF(η-SO) and OTaF(η-SO) complexes with SO ligand. Bonding analysis results reveal that the π* (3π) orbitals of the triplet SO molecule are both doubly occupied in OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO) due to the two-electron transfer from metal to SO. End-on isomers with M-OS or M-SO geometries were also predicted to be stable, but all of them are higher in  than the side-on complexes, and the calculated frequencies are inconsistent with the experimental values. Comparisons in bond lengths, vibrational frequencies, and natural charges between the OMF(η-SO) and OMF(η-O) complexes (M = Mo, W, Nb, Ta) further confirm the peroxo-like character of the SO ligand in OMoF(η-SO) and OWF(η-SO).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659932>Assessment of a residual municipal solid waste landfill for prospective 'landfill mining'.</a></h2><p>Landfill mining is a prospective tool for the recycling of valuable materials (waste-to-material) and secondary fuel (waste-to-) from old, therefore more or less stabilised municipal solid waste landfills.

In order to design new devices at the nanoscale, it is important to understand and be able to control material properties, which may differ significantly from their bulk counterparts. Here, we demonstrate very large tunability of phonon-photon interactions in Si nanowire cavities by engineering the cavity mode at the emission wavelength. Raman scattering measurements performed to quantify these interactions reveal that the anti-Stokes to Stokes scattering ratio can vary from 0.035 to 0.405 in Si nanowires compared to a value of 0.1 for bulk Si, demonstrating tunability by over an order of magnitude. Moreover, a ratio of 0.85 was attained at a temperature of 580K, which is the highest value ever reported for Si. Cavity modes that can be easily changed by changing the nanowire diameter, cavity geometry or excitation wavelength provides efficient ways of tuning these interactions.

G/Sb exhibits higher Young's modulus (armchair: 145.20, zigzag: 144.36 N m) and improved electrical conductivity (bandgap of 0.03 eV) compared with those of antimonene. Li favors incorporating into the interlayer region of G/Sb rather than the outside surfaces of graphene and antimonene of G/Sb heterostructure, which is caused by the synergistic effect. The in-plane lattice constants of G/Sb heterostructure expand only around 4.5%, and the interlayer distance of G/Sb increases slightly (0.22 Å) at the case of fully lithiation, which indicates that the capping of graphene on antimonene can effectively suppress the volumetric expansion during the charging process. Additionally, the hybrid G/Sb heterostructure has little influence on the migration behaviors of Li on the outside of graphene and Sb surfaces compared with their free-standing monolayers. However, the migration  barrier for Li diffusion in the interlayer region (about 0.59 eV) is significantly affected by the geometry structure, which can be reduced to 0.34 eV simply by increasing the interlayer distance. The higher theoretical specific capacity (369.03 mAh g vs 208 mAh g for antimonene monolayer) and suitable open circuit voltage (from 0.11 V to 0.89 V) of G/Sb heterostructure are beneficial for anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. The above results reveal that G/Sb heterostructure may be an ideal candidate of anode for high recycling-rate and portable lithium-ion batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657539>Combined tribological and bactericidal effect of nanodiamonds as potential lubricant for artificial joints.</a></h2><p>The artificial joints, e.g., knee and hip implants, are widely used for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases and trauma. Current most common material choice for clinically used implants is the combination of polymer-on-metal structures. Unfortunately, these joints often suffer from high friction and wear, leading to associated inflammation and infection and ultimate failure of the artificial joints. Here, we propose an alternative solution to this tribologically-induced failure of the joint materials. We demonstrate that friction and wear behavior of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium tribopair, used to mimic the artificial joint interface, can be improved by introducing nanodiamond (ND) particles in the sliding contact. Characterization of the wear track using  dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the tribofilm formed from embedded NDs during sliding significantly suppressed the wear of the UHMWPE surface. In addition to the improved lubrication characteristics, NDs exhibit high biocompatibility with the bone cells and promising antibacterial properties against S. aureus, the most common strain associated with artificial joint infection. These results indicate that NDs can be used as a promising nontoxic human-body lubricant with anti-wear and antibacterial features, thus demonstrating their great potential to treat artificial joint complications through intra-articular injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659528>Production and characterization of no-carrier-added Tb as an alternative to the clinically-applied Lu for radionuclide therapy.</a></h2><p>Tb is an interesting radionuclide for cancer treatment, showing similar decay characteristics and chemical behavior to clinically-employed Lu. The therapeutic effect of Tb, however, may be enhanced due to the co-emission of a larger number of conversion and Auger electrons as compared to Lu. The aim of this study was to produce Tb from enriched Gd targets in quantity and quality sufficient for first application in patients.No-carrier-added Tb was produced by neutron irradiation of enriched Gd targets at nuclear research reactors. The Tb purification method was developed with the use of cation exchange (Sykam resin) and extraction chromatography (LN3 resin), respectively. The resultant product (TbCl) was characterized and the Tb purity compared with commercial LuCl. The purity of the final product (TbCl) was analyzed by means of γ-ray spectrometry (radionuclidic purity) and radio TLC (radiochemical purity). The radiolabeling yield of Tb-DOTA was assessed over a two-week period post processing in order to observe the quality change of the obtained Tb towards future clinical application. To understand how the possible drug products (peptides radiolabeled with Tb) vary with time, stability of the clinically-applied somatostatin analogue DOTATOC, radiolabeled with Tb, was investigated over a 24-h period. The radiolytic stability experiments were compared to those performed with Lu-DOTATOC in order to investigate the possible influence of conversion and Auger electrons of Tb on peptide disintegration.Irradiations of enriched Gd targets yielded 6-20 GBq Tb. The final product was obtained at an activity concentration of 11-21 MBq/μL with ≥99% radionuclidic and radiochemical purity. The DOTA chelator was radiolabeled with Tb or Lu at the molar activity deemed useful for clinical application, even at the two-week time point after end of chemical separation. DOTATOC, radiolabeled with either Tb or Lu, was stable over 24 h in the presence of a stabilizer.In this study, it was shown that Tb can be produced in high activities using different irradiation facilities. The developed method for Tb separation from the target material yielded TbCl in quality suitable for high-specific radiolabeling, relevant for future clinical application.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659712>Using Chou's General Pseudo Amino Acid Composition to Classify Laccases from Bacterial and Fungal Sources via Chou's Five-Step Rule.</a></h2><p>Laccases are a group of enzymes with a critical activity in the degradation process of both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. These enzymes present in a diverse array of species, including fungi and bacteria. Since this enzyme is in the market for different usages from industry to medicine, having a better knowledge of its structures and properties from diverse sources will be useful to select the most appropriate candidate for different purposes. In the current study, sequence- and structure-based characteristics of these enzymes from fungi and bacteria, including pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), physicochemical characteristics, and their secondary structures, are being compared and classified. Autodock 4 software was used for docking analysis between these laccases and some phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The results indicated that features including molecular weight, aliphatic, extinction coefficient, and random coil percentage of these protein groups present high degrees of diversity in most cases. Categorization of these enzymes by the notion of PseAAC, showed over 96% accuracy. The binding free  between fungal laccases and their substrates showed to be considerably higher than those of bacterial ones. According to the outcomes of the current study, data mining methods by using different machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks, could provide valuable information for a fair comparison between fungal and bacterial laccases. These results also suggested an association between efficacy and physicochemical features of laccase enzymes from different sources.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659855>The 1D WO3 nanorods/2D WO3-x nanoflakes homojunction structure for enhanced charge separation and transfer towards efficient photelctrochemical performance.</a></h2><p>Designing and fabricating of photoelectrodes with low carrier recombination, high carrier transfer as well as high light capture capability is of great significance for achieving effective photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, in this work, 2D non-stoichiometric WO 3-x nanoflakes (NFs) vertically grown on the 1D WO 3 nanorods (NRs) with high temperature annealing (HTA) via hydrothermal method for the first time. In this 1D HTA-WO 3 /2D WO 3-x photoanode, the 2D WO 3-x NFs with active areas can maximize light harvesting, and the unique 1D/2D homojunction structure can improve the carrier separation efficiency, at the same time, the 1D WO 3 NRs with high aspect ratio are more beneficial to charge transfer after high temperature annealing. As expected, the obtained 1D HTA-WO 3 /2D WO 3-x photoanode yields enhanced photocurrent density of 0.98 mA/cm 2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is about 3.16 times compared to pristine WO 3 (P-WO 3 ). The improvement could be attribute to the synergistic effect of high temperature annealing and homojunction structure in the 1D HTA-WO 3 /2D WO 3-x photoanode, which can effectively improve the carrier separation and transfer. Furthermore, this work may provide a promising strategy for the design and fabrication of semiconductor-based photoelectrodes.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, the Lewis acidic yttria hollow spheres (YHS) are rationally designed as both sulfur immobilizer and catalyst of polysulfides conversion for the application of advanced Li-S batteries. It has been found that the Lewis acidic yttria can effectively capture the Lewis basic polysulfides and thus mitigate the shuttle effect of polysulfides; besides, yttria shows the enhanced catalytic activity for the kinetics of inter-conversion reaction from polysulfides to Li2S. As a result, either as a sulfur host or as the separator coating, yttria can play an important role in realizing high initial discharge capacity and good capacity retention for Li-S batteries. Especially, the Li-S battery with YHS@C/S cathode and YHS/CNT-0.6 modified separator (2.1 mg cm-2 sulfur loading) shows a high specific capacity of 912.5 mAh g-1 at 0.5C. After 200 cycles, the capacity of the Li-S battery can keep as high as 842.3 mAh g-1, and the capacity fading rate is only 0.038% per cycle. When the sulfur areal loading is increased to 4.24 mg cm-2, it can still maintain a considerable areal capacity of 3.79 mAh cm-2. Therefore, the strategy of the synergy effect for polysulfides confinement and catalytic conversion reaction can provide a significant exploration for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661104>Infrared photodissociation spectroscopy of di-manganese oxide cluster cations.</a></h2><p>Infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to elucidate the geometric structure of a series of di-manganese oxide clusters Mn2Ox+ (x = 4-7). The theoretical exploration predicts that all investigated clusters contain a rhombus-like Mn2O2 core with up to four, terminally bound, oxygen atoms. The short Mn-O bond length of the terminal oxygen atoms of ≤1.58 Å indicates triple bond character instead of oxyl radical formation. However, the IR-MPD spectra reveal that higher  isomers with up to two O2 molecules η2-coordinated to the cluster core can be kinetically trapped under the given experimental conditions. In these complexes, all O2 units are activated to superoxide species. In addition, the sequential increase of the oxygen content in the cluster allows for a controlled increase of the positive charge localized on the Mn atoms reaching a maximum for Mn2O7+.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659317>Uncoupling of PARP1 trapping and inhibition using selective PARP1 degradation.</a></h2><p>PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) are known to kill tumor cells via two mechanisms (PARP1 catalytic inhibition and PARP1 trapping). The relative contribution of these two pathways in mediating the cytotoxicity of PARPi, however, is not well understood. Here we designed a series of small molecule PARP degraders. Treatment with one such compound iRucaparib-AP6 results in highly efficient and specific PARP1 degradation. iRucaparib-AP6 blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 in vitro, and PARP1-mediated poly-ADP-ribosylation signaling in intact cells. This strategy mimics PARP1 genetic depletion, which enables the pharmacological decoupling of PARP1 inhibition from PARP1 trapping. Finally, by depleting PARP1, iRucaparib-AP6 protects muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes from DNA-damage-induced  crisis and cell death. In summary, these compounds represent 'non-trapping' PARP1 degraders that block both the catalytic activity and scaffolding effects of PARP1, providing an ideal approach for the amelioration of the various pathological conditions caused by PARP1 hyperactivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661677>Functionalized single-walled carbon-nanotube-blended P3HT-based high performance memory behavior thin-film transistors devices.</a></h2><p>We report on the fabrication and transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) blended with P3HT (poly 3-hexyl thiophene-2, 5-diyl). The composite is used as a hybrid organic active channel transistor. The performances of the fabricated devices were investigated as a function of the SWCNTs loads in the composite, and their response evaluated under white light illumination. Our results show that for SWCNT loads ≤ 1.5 wt. %, all the devices behave as p-type transistors, exhibiting excellent performance, with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 104 and a maximum on-state current (Ion) exceeding 80 μA. Moreover, compared with pristine transistors with a P3HT channel, the Hall mobility of these hybrid TFTs was found to increase by more than one order of magnitude, i.e. increasing from 0.062 to 1.54 cm2/V.s. Finally, under light illumination, the transfer characteristics (i.e. IDS as a function of VGS) were found to systematically undergo a typical shift together with a fully-reversible memory behavior.

Treatment may benefit from effective mTORC1 inhibition, which can be achieved by preventing arginine from disrupting the cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1 (CASTOR1)-GTPase-activating proteins toward RAGS subcomplex 2 (GATOR2) complex through binding with CASTOR1. An attractive idea is to determine analogues of arginine that are as competent as arginine in binding with CASTOR1, but without disrupting the CASTOR1-GATOR2 interaction.Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for binding of arginine analogues with CASTOR1 and binding free , hydrogen bond formation, and root mean squared deviation and root mean square fluctuation kinetics were then calculated.The binding free  calculations revealed that N-acetyl-arginine, citrulline, and norarginine have sufficient binding affinity with CASTOR1 to compete with arginine. The hydrogen bond analysis revealed that norarginine, N-acetyl-arginine and D-arginine have proficient H-bonds that can facilitate their entering the narrow binding pocket.Norarginine and N-acetyl-arginine are the top drug candidates for mTORC1 inhibition, with N-acetyl-arginine being the best choice.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Impaired INSR activities lead to insulin resistance, the key factor in the pathology of metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mainstream opinion is that insulin resistance begins at a post-receptor level. The role of INSR activities and trafficking in insulin resistance pathogenesis has been largely ignored. Ligand-activated INSR is internalized and trafficked to early endosome (EE), where INSR is dephosphorylated and sorted. INSR can be subsequently conducted to lysosome for degradation or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The metabolic fate of INSR in cellular events implies the profound influence of INSR on insulin signaling pathways. Disruption of INSR-coupled activities has been identified in a wide range of insulin resistance-related diseases such as T2DM. Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in INSR trafficking may lead to severe insulin resistance. However, there is very little understanding of how altered INSR activities undermine complex signaling pathways to the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. Here, we focus this review on summarizing previous findings on the molecular pathways of INSR trafficking in normal and diseased states. Through this review, we provide insights into the mechanistic role of INSR intracellular processes and activities in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661517>'Fat's chances': Loci for phenotypic dispersion in plasma leptin in mouse models of diabetes mellitus.</a></h2><p>Leptin, a critical mediator of feeding, metabolism and diabetes, is expressed on an incidental basis according to satiety. The genetic regulation of leptin should similarly be episodic.Data from three mouse cohorts hosted by the Jackson Laboratory- 402 (174F, 228M) F2 Dilute Brown non-Agouti (DBA/2)×DU6i intercrosses, 142 Non Obese Diabetic (NOD/ShiLtJ×(NOD/ShiLtJ×129S1/SvImJ.H2g7) N2 backcross females, and 204 male Nonobese Nondiabetic (NON)×New Zealand Obese (NZO/HlLtJ) reciprocal backcrosses-were used to test for loci associated with absolute residuals in plasma leptin and arcsin-transformed percent fat ('phenotypic dispersion'; PDpLep and PDAFP). Individual data from 1,780 mice from 43 inbred strains was also used to estimate genetic variances and covariances for dispersion in each trait.Several loci for PDpLep were detected, including possibly syntenic Chr 17 loci, but there was only a single position on Chr 6 for PDAFP. Coding SNP in genes linked to the consensus Chr 17 PDpLep locus occurred in immunological and cancer genes, genes linked to diabetes and  regulation, post-transcriptional processors and vomeronasal variants. There was evidence of intersexual differences in the genetic architecture of PDpLep. PDpLep had moderate heritability [Formula: see text] and PDAFP low heritability [Formula: see text]; dispersion in these traits was highly genetically correlated r = 0.8).Greater genetic variance for dispersion in plasma leptin, a physiological trait, may reflect its more ephemeral nature compared to body fat, an accrued progressive character. Genetic effects on incidental phenotypes such as leptin might be effectively characterized with randomization-detection methodologies in addition to classical approaches, helping identify incipient or borderline cases or providing new therapeutic targets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657884>Ultrafast Condensation of Carbon Nitride on Electrodes with Exceptional Boosted Both Photocurrent and Electrochemiluminescence.</a></h2><p>Semiconducting polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has drawn wide attention ranging from photocatalysis to more recent biosensing due to unique defects-tolerated optoelectronic properties, being metal-free, cheap and highly stable. However, as the core of electrical-optical interconversion, the preparation of CN photoelectrode is still challenging. Here, we report the growth of CN on electrodes simply by microwave-assisted condensation in seconds. The ultrafast heating not only addressed the thermodynamic contradiction of precursor volatilization during polymerization but also led to strongly adhesive CN layer on electrodes with gradient carbon-rich texture, making the electron-hole separation and mobility greatly accelerated.

Herein we propose a strategy to suppress the sponge-like Li deposition, by plating Li metal on aluminum nitride (AlN) modified substrates. For a practical Li deposition of 4 mAh cm-2 on a AlN modified copper (Cu) electrode, the roughness and thickness of the as-deposited Li layer are only ~10% and ~50% of those for the Li layer deposited on bare Cu. Only based on the compacted Li deposition layer without any other protective remedies, the AlN modified Cu electrode could provide a Li cycling life of 5 times longer than that on bare Cu, and an AlN modified carbon felt was proved as an efficient interlayer to boost the cycling stability of Li||LiFePO4 batteries.

Here, we report the NOx adsorption properties in a family of rare earth (RE) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials. Fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship of NOx adsorption in the RE-DOBDC materials platform was sought via a combined experimental and molecular modeling study. No structural change was noted following humid NOx exposure. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicated that H2O has a stronger affinity to bind with the metal center than NO2, while NO2 preferentially binds with the DOBDC ligands. Further modeling results indicate no change in binding  across the RE elements investigated. Also, stabilization of the NO2 and H2O molecules following adsorption was noted, predicted to be due to hydrogen bonding between the framework ligands and the molecules and nanoconfinement within the MOF structure. This interaction also caused distinct changes in emission spectra, identified experimentally. Calculations indicated that this is due to the adsorption of NO2 molecules onto the DOBDC ligand altering the electronic transitions and the resulting photoluminescent properties, a feature that has potential applications in future sensing technologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661264>Second-order perturbation theory with spin-symmetry projected Hartree-Fock.</a></h2><p>We propose two different schemes for second-order perturbation theory with spin-projected Hartree-Fock. Both schemes employ the same  for the first-order wave function, which is a linear combination of spin-projected configurations. The first approach is based on the normal-ordered projected Hamiltonian, which is partitioned into the Fock-like component and the rest two-particle-like contribution. In the second scheme, the generalized Fock operator is used to construct a spin-free zeroth-order Hamiltonian. To avoid the intruder state problem, we adopt the level-shift techniques frequently used in other multi-reference perturbation theories. We describe both real and imaginary shift schemes and compare their performances by using small systems. Our results clearly show the superiority of the second perturbation scheme with an imaginary shift to other proposed approaches in various aspects, giving accurate potential  curves, spectroscopic constants, and singlet-triplet splitting energies. We also apply these methods to transition metal complexes for computing spin gaps as well as the potential  curve of the chromium dimer.</p></html>
