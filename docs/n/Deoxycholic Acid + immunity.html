Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the first-line therapy for the treatment of PBC patients. This is effective in majority of patients; however, up to 20 percent of patients have an incomplete response to UDCA therapy and have a reduced prognosis as compared to healthy individuals. Obeticholic  (OCA) has been recently registered as second-line therapy for patients with incomplete response to UDCA, with plans to demonstrate the long-term clinical efficacy. Areas covered: Recent evolution in our understanding of disease mechanisms is leading to the advent of new and re-purposed therapeutic agents targeting key processes in the etiopathogenesis. Several therapeutic targets have been proposed which can be categorized into three compartments: immune, biliary and fibrosis. In this review we describe the main biological mechanisms underpinning disease development and progression in PBC and the new targeted therapies on the horizon. Expert commentary: Testing new drugs towards hard clinical endpoints is challenging in PBC due to its low prevalence and the slow progression of the disease. Novel promising biomarkers are under study and should be evaluated as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27007849>NOD1 and NOD2 signalling links ER stress with inflammation.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major contributor to inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn disease and type 2 diabetes. ER stress induces the unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. Inflammation is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear which PRRs have a major role in inducing inflammation during ER stress. Here we show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are important mediators of ER-stress-induced inflammation in mouse and human cells. The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion. Inflammation and IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor. The association of NOD1 and NOD2 with pro-inflammatory responses induced by the IRE1α/TRAF2 signalling pathway provides a novel link between innate  and ER-stress-induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28539642>Combinatory Evaluation of Transcriptome and Metabolome Profiles of Low Temperature-induced Resistant Ascites Syndrome in Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>To select metabolic biomarkers and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with resistant-ascites syndrome (resistant-AS), we used innovative techniques such as metabolomics and transcriptomics to comparatively examine resistant-AS chickens and AS controls. Metabolomic evaluation of chicken serum using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadruple time-of-flight high-sensitivity mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/HSMS) showed significantly altered lysoPC(18:1), PE(18:3/16:0), PC(20:1/18:3), DG(24:1/22:6/0:0), PS(18:2/18:0), PI(16:0/16:0), PS(18:0/18:1), PS(14:1/14:0), dihydroxyacetone, ursodeoxycholic , tryptophan, L-valine, cycloserine, hypoxanthine, and 4-O-Methylmelleolide concentrations on day 21 and LysoPC(18:0), LysoPE(20:1/0:0), LysoPC(16:0), LysoPE(16:0/0:0), hypoxanthine, dihydroxyacetone, 4-O-Methylmelleolide, LysoPC(18:2), and PC(14:1/22:1) concentrations on day 35, between the susceptible and resistant groups. Compared to the susceptible group, transcriptomic analysis of liver samples using RNA-seq revealed 413 DEGs on day 21 and 214 DEGs on day 35 in the resistant group. Additional evaluations using gene ontology (GO) indicate that significant enrichment occurred in the oxygen transportation, defensive reactions, and protein modifications of the decreased DEGs as well as in the cell morphological formation, neural development, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling of the increased DEGs on day 21. Oxygen transportation was also significantly enriched for downregulated DEGs on day 35. The combinatory evaluation of the metabolome and the transcriptome suggests the possible involvement of glycerophospholipid metabolism in the development of resistant-AS in broilers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28067240>CD8 T cells stimulate Na-Cl co-transporter NCC in distal convoluted tubules leading to salt-sensitive hypertension.</a></h2><p>Recent studies suggest a role for T lymphocytes in hypertension. However, whether T cells contribute to renal sodium retention and salt-sensitive hypertension is unknown. Here we demonstrate that T cells infiltrate into the kidney of salt-sensitive hypertensive animals. In particular, CD8 T cells directly contact the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in the kidneys of DOCA-salt mice and CD8 T cell-injected mice, leading to up-regulation of the Na-Cl co-transporter NCC, p-NCC and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Co-culture with CD8 T cells upregulates NCC in mouse DCT cells via ROS-induced activation of Src kinase, up-regulation of the K channel Kir4.1, and stimulation of the Cl channel ClC-K. The last event increases chloride efflux, leading to compensatory chloride influx via NCC activation at the cost of increasing sodium retention. Collectively, these findings provide a mechanism for adaptive  involvement in the kidney defect in sodium handling and the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25819054>[Histoplasmosis: the multiple sides of an uncommon disease].</a></h2><p>Disseminated histoplasmosis is an invasive fungal infection documented in patients with impaired cellular  coming from endemic areas (America, Asia, Africa).

The function of IL-33 in the esophageal mucosa has not been previously described. Accordingly, we examined the expression of IL-33 and its role in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis (RE).IL-33 in the esophageal mucosa of RE patients and in an in vitro stratified normal esophageal squamous epithelial model was examined at the messenger RNA and protein levels. The correlation of the level of IL-33 and IL-8 or IL-6 was examined. Cell layers were stimulated with bile acids and cytokines. IL-33 was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Pharmacological inhibitors and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) siRNA were used.IL-33 was significantly upregulated in RE patients, and was located in the nuclei of basal and suprabasal layers. Upregulated IL-33 messenger RNA expression was correlated with IL-8 and IL-6 expression. In vitro, IL-33 was upregulated in the nuclei of basal and suprabasal layers by interferon-γ (IFNγ), and the upregulation was aggravated by the combination of  (DCA) and IFNγ. IL-33 knockdown dampened IFNγ- and DCA-induced IL-8 and IL-6 production. IFNγ-induced IL-33 was inhibited by a Janus kinase inhibitor, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, and STAT1 siRNA.Nuclear IL-33 is upregulated in erosive mucosa of RE patients and is correlated with IL-8 and IL-6 levels. The normal esophageal epithelial model enables us to show for the first time that epithelial-cell-derived nuclear but not exogenous IL-33 is located upstream of the production of inflammatory cytokines and can aggravate the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27638774>Production of monoclonal antibodies against the ORF3 protein of rat hepatitis E virus (HEV) and demonstration of the incorporation of the ORF3 protein into enveloped rat HEV particles.</a></h2><p>Eight murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15-amino- portion of the ORF3 protein of rat hepatitis E virus (ratHEV) were produced and characterized. Immunofluorescence assays using the anti-ratHEV ORF3 MAbs revealed the accumulation of ORF3 protein in the cytoplasm of PLC/PRF/5 cells transfected with ORF3-expressing plasmids or inoculated with cell-culture-generated ratHEV strains. Anti-ORF3 MAbs could capture ratHEV particles in culture supernatant and serum following treatment with 0.5 % deoxycholate, but not those without prior detergent treatment or fecal ratHEV particles. Following treatment with 0.5 % deoxycholate and 0.5 % trypsin, the buoyant density of ratHEV particles in culture supernatant with ORF3 protein on the surface shifted from 1.15 g/cm to 1.26 g/cm in a sucrose gradient; the resulting particles were capturable by an anti-ORF2 MAb but not by an anti-ORF3 MAb. This indicates that the ORF3 protein (at least its C-terminal portion) is incorporated into the enveloped ratHEV virions released from infected cells but that it is not found in the virions in the feces, supporting the hypothesis that the ratHEV ORF3 protein is associated with the egress of virions from infected cells, similar to human HEV, despite the fact that the ratHEV ORF3 protein lacks a PSAP amino  motif.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31297533>Deciphering the mechanism for induction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and its role in aging and cancer development.</a></h2><p>Cellular senescence is an irreversible form of cell cycle arrest that can be induced by persistent DNA damage, and is well known to function as an important tumor suppression mechanism. Cellular senescence is detected in aged organisms; thus, it is also recognized as a hallmark of organismal aging. Unlike apoptotic cells, senescent cells can survive for long periods of time. Recently, it has been shown that the late stage of senescent cells are capable of expressing a variety of secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and proteases, and this condition is now known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These secreted factors are involved in myriad of physiological functions including tissue repair and clearance of damaged cells. Alternatively, these factors may promote detrimental effects, such as chronic inflammation or cancer progression, should the SASP phenotype persist. Recent scientific advances have indicated that innate immune responses, particularly involving the cGAS-STING pathway, trigger SASP induction. Therefore, developing a strategy to regulate SASP may provide scientific insights for the management of age-associated diseases and the implementation of healthy aging in the future.© The Author(s) 2019.

Rat feces were collected from 2 to 4 weeks following exposure and were assessed for gut-microbiota-dependent metabolites. Gut-microbiota-related organic acids were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure, AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with an over 70% reduction in the high-dose group (75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs, but no significant time effect was found. When compared with the control, oral exposure to middle-dose AFB1 (25 μg/kg) resulted in remarkable elevations of fecal cholic  (2.18-fold), linoleic  (cis-9, cis-12-18:2) (11.3-fold), pentadecanoic  (15: 0) (3.68-fold), pyruvic  (4.56-fold), and 3-phenyllactic  (3.74-fold), but  level was reduced by 41% in the low-dose group (5 μg/kg). These results demonstrated the disruptions of several important gut-microbiota metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of SCFAs, pyruvic  related pathways, metabolisms of amino acids, bile acids and long-chain fatty acids, which may further affect host digestive efficiency, energy supply, intestinal , production of neurotransmitters, and enterohepatic cross-talk. Our study suggests that the impairment of gut-microbiota-dependent metabolism may contribute to pathological mechanisms of AFB1-induced adverse health effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529417>Evidence for the association between IgG-antimitochondrial antibody and biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic  treatment in primary biliary cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) is considered the serological hallmark of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), while data regarding the profile of AMA during ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) treatment are scarce. Here, we assessed the influence of UDCA treatment on titers of AMA and factors relevant to its production.Serum IgA-AMA, IgM-AMA, IgG-AMA, B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF), and the frequency of circulating plasmablasts were detected in PBC patients, including those who received UDCA therapy for 24 weeks, healthy controls, chronic hepatitis B patients, and autoimmune hepatitis patients. Consecutive liver sections from controls and PBC patients were stained by immunohistochemistry for detection of intrahepatic CD38 , IgA , IgM , and IgG cells.Significant decrease in titers of IgG-AMA was found only confined to PBC patients with biochemical response to UDCA treatment (P = 0.005), and similar pattern was also observed at week 24 in quantifying circulating plasmablasts (P = 0.025) and serum BAFF (P = 0.013). Notably, positive correlation between serum BAFF levels and titers of IgG-AMA, and the frequency of circulating plasmablasts were observed in PBC patients (r = 0.464, P = 0.034 and r = 0.700, P < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, in situ staining revealed significant accumulation of CD38 and IgG cells within the portal tracts of PBC liver.Decreased titers of serum IgG-AMA are associated with biochemical response to UDCA treatment, implicating the potentiality of this hallmark in therapeutic response evaluation and the beneficial effect of UDCA on humoral  in PBC patients.© 2016 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29720090>Sulphite oxidase (SO) - a mitochondrial autoantigen as target for humoral and cellular immune reactions in primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>In a recent study we had evidence that sulphite oxidase (SO) may be a relevant autoantigen in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Aim of the present study was, therefore, to analyse humoral and cellular immune-reactivity towards SO in these patients in more detail.Sera from 53 patients with PSC (30 untreated and 23 treated with ursodeoxycholic  [UDCA] at time of analysis), from 422 patients with different hepatic and non-hepatic disorders, and from 50 healthy individuals were tested by ELISA for antibodies against full-length-SO (SO-fl) and its three major domains expressed in E.coli (SO-I, SO-II, SO-III). For epitope-mapping, 29 overlapping peptides were used. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from 33 PSC-patients and analysed for SO-induced proliferation, production of cytokines, and expression of the activation marker cluster of differentiation (CD) 69.43% of the 30 untreated and 26% of the 23 treated PSC-patients had IgG anti-SO-antibodies predominantly reacting with SO-fl, SO-I and SO-II. Antibody-reactivity decreased after UDCA-treatment. Prevalence and reactivity of anti-SO-antibodies were significantly higher in PSC than in patients with other hepatic and non-hepatic disorders. Epitope mapping revealed no distinct immuno-dominant regions within SO. Incubation of PBMC from PSC-patients (but not from controls) with SO-antigens revealed an activation of B-cells and a T-helper cell type-2 reaction pattern (production of interleukin [IL]-13, IL-10).PSC-patients show humoral and cellular immune response towards SO. Antibodies may be predominantly directed against conformational epitopes. SO enhances in vitro especially T-helper cell type-2 immune-reactions, which may be pro-fibrotic. SO is a detoxifying enzyme present also in bacteria; further studies analysing its role in the aetiology and pathogenesis in PSC may, therefore, be important.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30337151>Altered bile  profile associates with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease-An emerging role for gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and a specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing.In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic  [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, , and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of :CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study.

Both receptors are placed at the interface of the host immune system with the intestinal microbiota and are highly represented in cells of innate  such as intestinal and liver macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer T cells. Here, we review how GPBAR1 and FXR modulate the intestinal and liver innate immune system and contribute to the maintenance of a  phenotype in entero-hepatic tissues, and how regulation of innate  might help to explain beneficial effects exerted by GPBAR1 and FXR ligands in immune and metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26469633>Immunological basis in the pathogenesis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy poses a great risk to both maternal and fetal health.

However, those functions have remained largely undefined. In this work, we used ileal explants and mouse models of bile  administration to investigate the role of bile acids in the regulation of the intestinal antimicrobial response. Mice fed on a diet supplemented with 0.1% chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) showed an upregulated expression of Paneth cell α-defensins as well as an increased synthesis of the type-C lectins Reg3b and Reg3g by the ileal epithelium. CDCA acted on several epithelial cell types, by a mechanism independent from farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and not involving STAT3 or β-catenin activation. CDCA feeding did not change the relative abundance of major commensal bacterial groups of the ileum, as shown by 16S analyses. However, administration of CDCA increased the expression of ileal  and induced a change in the composition of the mucosal immune cell repertoire, decreasing the proportion of Ly6G and CD68 cells, while increasing the relative amount of IgGκ B cells. Oral administration of CDCA to mice attenuated infections with the bile-resistant pathogens  serovar Typhimurium and , promoting lower systemic colonization and faster bacteria clearance, respectively. Our results demonstrate that bile  signaling in the ileum triggers an antimicrobial program that can be potentially used as a therapeutic option against intestinal bacterial infections.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26818726>Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome(®)): A Review of the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Clinical Experience and Future Directions.</a></h2><p>Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome(®); LAmB) is a unique lipid formulation of amphotericin B. LAmB is a standard of care for a wide range of medically important opportunistic fungal pathogens. LAmB has a significantly improved toxicity profile compared with conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate (DAmB). Despite nearly 20 years of clinical use, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this agent, which differ considerably from DAmB, remain relatively poorly understood and underutilized in the clinical setting. The molecular pharmacology, preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics, and clinical experience with LAmB for the most commonly encountered fungal pathogens are reviewed. In vitro, experimental animal models and human clinical trial data are summarized, and novel routes of administration and dosing schedules are discussed. LAmB is a formulation that results in reduced toxicity as compared with DAmB while retaining the antifungal effect of the active agent. Its long terminal half-life and retention in tissues suggest that single or intermittent dosing regimens are feasible, and these should be actively investigated in both preclinical models and in clinical trials. Significant gaps remain in knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in special populations such as neonates and children, pregnant women and obese patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27340129>Ursodeoxycholic  inhibits TNFα-induced IL-8 release from monocytes.</a></h2><p>Monocytes are critical to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as they infiltrate the mucosa and release cytokines that drive the inflammatory response. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), a naturally occurring bile  with anti-inflammatory actions, has been proposed as a potential new therapy for IBD. However, its effects on monocyte function are not yet known. Primary monocytes from healthy volunteers or cultured U937 monocytes were treated with either the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFα (5 ng/ml) or the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 μg/ml) for 24 h, in the absence or presence of UDCA (25-100 μM). IL-8 release into the supernatant was measured by ELISA. mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR and changes in cell signaling proteins were determined by Western blotting. Toxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. UDCA treatment significantly attenuated TNFα-, but not LPS-driven, release of IL-8 from both primary and cultured monocytes. UDCA inhibition of TNFα-driven responses was associated with reduced IL-8 mRNA expression. Both TNFα and LPS stimulated NFκB activation in monocytes, while IL-8 release in response to both cytokines was attenuated by an NFκB inhibitor, BMS-345541. Interestingly, UDCA inhibited TNFα-, but not LPS-stimulated, NFκB activation. Finally, TNFα, but not LPS, induced phosphorylation of TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF2), while UDCA cotreatment attenuated this response. We conclude that UDCA specifically inhibits TNFα-induced IL-8 release from monocytes by inhibiting TRAF2 activation. Since such actions would serve to dampen mucosal immune responses in vivo, our data support the therapeutic potential of UDCA for IBD.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487283>Bile acids  and ursodeoxycholic  differentially regulate human β-defensin-1 and -2 secretion by colonic epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Bile acids and epithelial-derived human β-defensins (HβDs) are known to be important factors in the regulation of colonic mucosal barrier function and inflammation. We hypothesized that bile acids regulate colonic HβD expression and aimed to test this by investigating the effects of  (DCA) and ursodeoxycholic  on the expression and release of HβD1 and HβD2 from colonic epithelial cells and mucosal tissues. DCA (10-150 µM) stimulated the release of both HβD1 and HβD2 from epithelial cell monolayers and human colonic mucosal tissue  In contrast, ursodeoxycholic  (50-200 µM) inhibited both basal and DCA-induced defensin release. Effects of DCA were mimicked by the Takeda GPCR 5 agonist, INT-777 (50 μM), but not by the farnesoid X receptor agonist, GW4064 (10 μM). INT-777 also stimulated colonic HβD1 and HβD2 release from wild-type, but not Takeda GPCR 5, mice. DCA stimulated phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, an effect that was attenuated by ursodeoxycholic , whereas an NF-κB inhibitor, BMS-345541 (25 μM), inhibited DCA-induced HβD2, but not HβD1, release.

Since intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is characterized by hyperpermeability, bacterial translocation and inflammation, we aimed to investigate, for the first time, if the FXR-agonist obeticholic  (OCA) could attenuate intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury.In a validated rat model of intestinal IRI (laparotomy + temporary mesenteric artery clamping), 3 conditions were tested (n = 16/group): laparotomy only (sham group); ischemia 60min+ reperfusion 60min + vehicle pretreatment (IR group); ischemia 60min + reperfusion 60min + OCA pretreatment (IR+OCA group). Vehicle or OCA (INT-747, 2*30mg/kg) was administered by gavage 24h and 4h prior to IRI. The following end-points were analyzed: 7-day survival; biomarkers of enterocyte viability (L-lactate, I-FABP); histology (morphologic injury to villi/crypts and villus length); intestinal permeability (Ussing chamber); endotoxin translocation (Lipopolysaccharide assay); cytokines (IL-6, IL-1-β, TNFα, IFN-γ IL-10, IL-13); apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3); and autophagy (LC3, p62).It was found that intestinal IRI was associated with high mortality (90%); loss of intestinal integrity (structurally and functionally); increased endotoxin translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production; and inhibition of autophagy. Conversely, OCA-pretreatment improved 7-day survival up to 50% which was associated with prevention of epithelial injury, preserved intestinal architecture and permeability. Additionally, FXR-agonism led to decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release and alleviated autophagy inhibition.Pretreatment with OCA, an FXR-agonist, improves survival in a rodent model of intestinal IRI, preserves the gut barrier function and suppresses inflammation. These results turn FXR into a promising target for various conditions associated with intestinal ischemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25463533>24-nor-ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates inflammatory response and liver fibrosis in a murine model of hepatic schistosomiasis.</a></h2><p>Intrahepatic granuloma formation and fibrosis characterize the pathological features of Schistosoma mansoni infection. Based on previously observed substantial anti-fibrotic effects of 24-nor-ursodeoxycholic  (norUDCA) in Abcb4/Mdr2(-/-) mice with cholestatic liver injury and biliary fibrosis, we hypothesized that norUDCA improves -driven liver fibrosis in S. mansoni infection.Adult NMRI mice were infected with 50 S. mansoni cercariae and after 12 weeks received either norUDCA- or ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA)-enriched diet (0.5% wt/wt) for 4 weeks. Bile  effects on liver histology, serum biochemistry, key regulatory cytokines, hepatic hydroxyproline content as well as granuloma formation were compared to naive mice and infected controls. In addition, effects of norUDCA on primary T-cell activation/proliferation and maturation of the antigen-presenting-cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) were determined in vitro.UDCA as well as norUDCA attenuated the inflammatory response in livers of S. mansoni infected mice, but exclusively norUDCA changed cellular composition and reduced size of hepatic granulomas as well as TH2-mediated hepatic fibrosis in vivo. Moreover, norUDCA affected surface expression level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II of macrophages and dendritic cells as well as activation/proliferation of T-lymphocytes in vitro, whereas UDCA had no effect.This study demonstrates pronounced anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of norUDCA compared to UDCA in S. mansoni induced liver injury, and indicates that norUDCA directly represses antigen presentation of antigen presenting cells and subsequent T-cell activation in vitro. Therefore, norUDCA represents a promising drug for the treatment of this important cause of liver fibrosis.Copyright © 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ursodeoxycholic  (13-16 mg/kg/d) has, however, clear favorable effects that not only improve biochemical cholestasis, but also delay histological progression. Long-term treatment with ursodeoxycholic  is associated with excellent transplant-free survival in cases showing a biochemical response at 1 year. Data on the effects of obeticholic  and fibrates are encouraging. Moreover, recent pilot studies evaluating several biological agents targeting  such as different monoclonal antibodies and other drugs that modulate cholestasis are under investigation, although with limited results at present.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28202625>Gut Microbiota Promotes Obesity-Associated Liver Cancer through PGE-Mediated Suppression of Antitumor .</a></h2><p>Obesity increases the risk of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which obesity promotes HCC development are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota may influence liver diseases by transferring its metabolites and components. Here, we show that the hepatic translocation of obesity-induced lipoteichoic  (LTA), a Gram-positive gut microbial component, promotes HCC development by creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor  through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in obesity-associated HCC. The gut microbiota-driven COX2 pathway produced the lipid mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor , suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic NASH-associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113042>pH-Responsive Micelle-Based Cytoplasmic Delivery System for Induction of Cellular .</a></h2><p>(1) Background: Cytoplasmic delivery of antigens is crucial for the induction of cellular , which is an important immune response for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. To date, fusogenic protein-incorporated liposomes and pH-responsive polymer-modified liposomes have been used to achieve cytoplasmic delivery of antigen via membrane rupture or fusion with endosomes. However, a more versatile cytoplasmic delivery system is desired for practical use. For this study, we developed pH-responsive micelles composed of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and  and investigated their cytoplasmic delivery performance and -inducing capability. (2) Methods: Interaction of micelles with fluorescence dye-loaded liposomes, intracellular distribution of micelles, and antigenic proteins were observed. Finally, antigen-specific cellular immune response was evaluated in vivo using ELIspot assay. (3) Results: Micelles induced leakage of contents from liposomes via lipid mixing at low pH. Micelles were taken up by dendritic cells mainly via macropinocytosis and delivered ovalbumin (OVA) into the cytosol. After intradermal injection of micelles and OVA, OVA-specific cellular  was induced in the spleen. (4) Conclusions: pH-responsive micelles composed of DLPC and  are promising as enhancers of cytosol delivery of antigens and the induction capability of cellular  for the treatment of cancer immunotherapy and infectious diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26811456>Obeticholic , a synthetic bile  agonist of the farnesoid X receptor, attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are ligands for the nuclear hormone receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The bile -FXR interaction regulates bile  synthesis, transport, and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, bile -FXR regulation has been reported to play an integral role in both hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that FXR knockout mice had more disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Obeticholic  (6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic , 6-ECDCA), a synthetic FXR agonist, is an orally available drug that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. When we treated mice exhibiting established EAE with 6-ECDCA, or the natural FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), clinical disease was ameliorated by (i) suppressing lymphocyte activation and proinflammatory cytokine production; (ii) reducing CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cell populations and their expression of negative checkpoint regulators programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); (iii) increasing CD8(+) T cells and PD1, PDl-1, and BTLA expression; and (iv) reducing VLA-4 expression in both the T- and B-cell populations. Moreover, adoptive transfer of 6-ECDCA- or CDCA-treated donor cells failed to transfer disease in naive recipients. Thus, we show that FXR functions as a negative regulator in neuroinflammation and we highlight that FXR agonists represent a potential previously unidentified therapy for MS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26349818>Toxicity of Amphotericin B Deoxycholate-Based Induction Therapy in Patients with HIV-Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis.</a></h2><p>Amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd) is the recommended induction treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Its use is hampered by toxicities that include electrolyte abnormalities, nephrotoxicity, and anemia. Protocols to minimize toxicity are applied inconsistently. In a clinical trial cohort of AmBd-based CM induction treatment, a standardized protocol of preemptive hydration and electrolyte supplementation was applied. Changes in blood counts, electrolyte levels, and creatinine levels over 14 days were analyzed in relation to the AmBd dose, treatment duration (short course of 5 to 7 days or standard course of 14 days), addition of flucytosine (5FC), and outcome. In the 368 patients studied, the hemoglobin levels dropped by a mean of 1.5 g/dl (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.9 g/dl) following 7 days of AmBd and by a mean of 2.3 g/dl (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.6 g/dl) after 14 days. Serum creatinine levels increased by 37 μmol/liter (95% CI, 30 to 45 μmol/liter) by day 7 and by 49 μmol/liter (95% CI, 35 to 64μmol/liter) by day 14 of AmBd treatment. Overall, 33% of patients developed grade III/IV anemia, 5.6% developed grade III hypokalemia, 9.5% had creatinine levels that exceeded 220 μmol, and 6% discontinued AmBd prematurely. The addition of 5FC was associated with a slight increase in anemia but not neutropenia. Laboratory abnormalities stabilized or reversed during the second week in patients on short-course induction. Grade III/IV anemia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.3; P = 0.028) and nephrotoxicity (aOR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 11; P = 0.001) were risk factors for 10-week mortality. In summary, routine intravenous saline hydration and preemptive electrolyte replacement during AmBd-based induction regimens for HIV-associated CM minimized the incidence of hypokalemia and nephrotoxicity. Anemia remained a concerning adverse effect. The addition of flucytosine was not associated with increased neutropenia. Shorter AmBd courses were less toxic, with rapid reversibility.Copyright © 2015 Bicanic et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27430717>Clonal Characteristics of Circulating B Lymphocyte Repertoire in Primary Biliary Cholangitis.</a></h2><p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by elevated serum anti-mitochondrial Ab and lymphocyte-mediated bile duct damage. This study was designed to reveal the clonal characteristics of B lymphocyte repertoire in patients with PBC to facilitate better understanding of its pathogenesis and better management of these patients. Using high-throughput sequencing of Ig genes, we analyzed the repertoire of circulating B lymphocytes in 43 patients with PBC, and 34 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, PBC patients showed 1) a gain of 14 new clones and a loss of 8 clones; 2) a significant clonal expansion and increased relative IgM abundance, which corresponded with the elevated serum IgM level; 3) a significant reduction of clonal diversity and somatic hypermutations in class-switched sequences, which suggested a general immunocompromised status; 4) the reduction of clonal diversity and enhancement of clonal expansion were more obvious at the cirrhotic stage; and 5) treatment with ursodeoxycholic  could increase the clonal diversity and reduce clonal expansion of the IgM repertoire, with no obvious effect on the somatic hypermutation level. Our data suggest that PBC is a complex autoimmune disease process with evidence of B lymphocyte clonal gains and losses, Ag-dependent ogligoclonal expansion, and a generally compromised immune reserve. This new insight into the pathogenesis of PBC opens up the prospect of studying disease-relevant B cells to better diagnose and treat this devastating disease.Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924062>Chenodeoxycholic  activates NLRP3 inflammasome and contributes to cholestatic liver fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids in the liver contributes to cholestatic liver injury. Inflammation induced by excessive bile acids is believed to play a crucial role, however, the mechanisms of bile acids triggered inflammatory response remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the effect of NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating liver inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we for the first time showed that chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), the major hydrophobic primary bile  involved in cholestatic liver injury, could dose-dependently induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine-IL-1β in macrophages by promoting ROS production and K+ efflux. Mechanistically, CDCA triggered ROS formation in part through TGR5/EGFR downstream signaling, including protein kinase B, extracellular regulated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways. Meanwhile, CDCA also induced ATP release from macrophages which subsequently causes K+ efflux via P2X7 receptor. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with caspase-1 inhibitor dramatically decreased mature IL-1β level of liver tissue and ameliorated liver fibrosis in bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model. In conclusion, excessive CDCA may represent an endogenous danger signal to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate liver inflammation during cholestasis. Our finding offers a mechanistic basis to ameliorate cholestatic liver fibrosis by targeting inflammasome activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27416761>Ursodeoxycholic  impairs atherogenesis and promotes plaque regression by cholesterol crystal dissolution in mice.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven primarily by a continuous retention of cholesterol within the subendothelial space where it precipitates to form cholesterol crystals (CC). These CC trigger a complex inflammatory response through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and promote lesion development. Here we examined whether increasing cholesterol solubility with ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) affects vascular CC formation and ultimately atherosclerotic lesion development. UDCA mediated intracellular CC dissolution in macrophages and reduced IL-1β production. In ApoE(-/-) mice, UDCA treatment not only impaired atherosclerotic plaque development but also mediated regression of established vascular lesions. Importantly, mice treated with UDCA had decreased CC-depositions in atherosclerotic plaques compared to controls. Together, our data demonstrate that UDCA impaired CC and NLRP3 dependent inflammation by increasing cholesterol solubility and diminished atherosclerosis in mice.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Phagocytic dysfunction results in photoreceptor cell death. Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), an endogenous bile , is known to show neuroprotective effects in stroke, neurological diseases, and retinal degeneration models. In this study, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on retinal phagocytosis.We used pHrodo-succinimidyl ester (SE), a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, to label the POS for monitoring phagocytosis. After ingestion, the intensity of pHrodo fluorescence increases because of the pH changes inside the liposome. An RPE cell line, ARPE-19, and primary human RPE cells were used to investigate the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced disruption of phagocytosis in the pH-sensitive fluorescence POS phagocytosis assay. Additionally, we examined whether TUDCA could promote phagocytic function.The intensity of pHrodo light emission increased in a time-dependent manner. Tauroursodeoxycholic  enhanced phagocytosis of POS and protected against H2O2-induced phagocytic dysfunction. It also promoted phagocytic function via activation of Mer tyrosine kinase receptor (MerTK), which is known to have a key role in the physiological renewal of POS.These results suggest that TUDCA activates MerTK, which is important for phagocytosis of POS. Tauroursodeoxycholic  may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of retinal diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29429758>The immunobiology of mucosal-associated invariant T cell (MAIT) function in primary biliary cholangitis: Regulation by cholic -induced Interleukin-7.</a></h2><p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are novel innate-like T cells constituting a significant proportion of circulating and hepatic T cells. Herein, we extensively examine the phenotypical and functional alterations of MAIT cells and their regulation in a cohort of 56 patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) and 53 healthy controls (HC). Additionally alterations of MAIT cells were assessed before and after UDCA treatment. Finally the localization of MAIT cell in liver was examined using specific tetramer staining and the underlying mechanisms of these alterations in PBC were explored. Our data demonstrated that the frequency and number of circulating MAIT cells were decreased, whereas hepatic MAIT cells were increased in PBC compared to HC. Moreover, circulating MAIT cells were more activated in PBC than HC, reflected by elevated expression levels of granzyme B. Six months of UDCA treatment significantly attenuated the circulating MAIT cells differences in PBC. Of note, the expression levels of IL-7 were significantly increased in both plasma and liver from PBC as compared to HC, which promoted the production of inflammatory cytokines and granzyme B by inducing signal transduction and activation of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation in MAIT cells. Finally, cholic , one of the major bile acids in liver, upregulated IL-7 expression in hepatocyte cell line L02 by inducing Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) binding to the IL-7 promoter. Hence MAIT cells are activated and enriched in the liver of PBC. Cholic -induced IL-7 production in hepatocytes plays a critical role in regulating MAIT cell function, highlighting that hepatocytes may bridge cholangiocyte injury and innate  through a bile  signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Bile  dysregulation leads to intestinal dysbiosis, that allows enterogenous pathogenic bacteria, including Gram‑negative bacteria and their products lipopolysaccharide (LPS), into the liver via the portal vein, triggering inflammation in the liver. The inflammasome serves as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects pathogens or danger signals and mediates innate  in the liver or gut. Specifically, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains‑containing protein (NLRP)6 inflammasome maintains intestinal microbial balance, by promoting interleukin (IL)‑18‑dependent antimicrobial peptide synthesis and mucus secretion from goblet cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome, in contrast, primarily induces IL‑1β and aggravates inflammatory liver injury. Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome affects the epithelial integrity of cholangiocytes by inducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. In addition, bile acids, including  and chenodeoxycholic , are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages; however, bile acids have the potential to exert the opposite role by interacting with the membrane‑bound Takeda G‑protein receptor 5 or by activating nuclear farnesoid‑X receptor. Therefore, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammasome, involved in the gut‑liver axis, may provide important insights into the identification of a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of liver and gut diseases. The present review discusses the roles of the inflammasome in the gut‑liver axis, and the emerging associations between the inflammasome and the intestinal microbiota or the bile acids in the gut‑liver axis.</p></html>
