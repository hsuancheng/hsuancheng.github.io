The phenotypes were obtained by calculating the differences of annual changes in waist minus hip circumference. The difference was displayed for all cohorts. The highest 10% of this difference were defined as WG whereas the lowest 10% were defined as HG. A total of 121 concordant metabolite measurements were conducted using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® kits in EPIC and KORA. Sex-specific associations with metabolite concentration as independent and phenotype as the dependent variable adjusted for confounders were calculated. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing.Across studies both sexes gained on average more waist than hip circumference. We could identify 12 metabolites as being associated with the WG (n = 8) or HG (n = 4) in men, but none were significant after correction for multiple testing; 45 metabolites were associated with the WG (n = 41) or HG (n = 4) in women. For WG, n = 21 metabolites remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Respective odds ratios (OR) ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 for tryptophan, the diacyl- (PC) C32:3, C36:0, C38:0, C38:1, C42:, C42:5, the acyl-alkyl-PCs C32:, C34:0, C36:0, C36:1, C36:, C38:0, C38:, C40:1, C40:, C40:5, C40:6, 42:, C42:3 and -PC C17:0.Both weight-gaining men and women showed a clear tendency to gain more abdominal than peripheral fat. Gain of abdominal fat seems to be related to an initial metabolic state reflected by low concentrations of specific metabolites, at least in women. Thus, higher levels of specific PCs may play a protective role in gaining waist circumference.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599289>Altered triglyceride and phospholipid metabolism predates the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in obese pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with  and long-term health risks, is usually diagnosed at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. An understanding of lipid metabolism in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered lipid metabolism at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15- weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The lipid, sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and  (38:5). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:, 42:3), - (16:0, :1),  (35:, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:5, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant. We concluded that both lipid and triglyceride metabolism were altered at least 10 weeks before diagnosis of GDM. Further investigation is required to determine the functional consequences of these differences and the mechanisms by which they arise.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29718662>High Spatial Resolution Imaging of Mouse Pancreatic Islets Using Nanospray Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Nanospray Desorption Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nano-DESI MSI) enables ambient imaging of biological samples with high sensitivity and minimal sample pretreatment. Recently, we developed an approach for constant-distance mode MSI using shear force microscopy to precisely control the distance between the sample and the nano-DESI probe. Herein, we demonstrate the power of this approach for robust imaging of pancreatic islets with high spatial resolution of ∼11 μm. Pancreatic islets are difficult to characterize using traditional mass spectrometry approaches due to their small size (∼100 μm) and molecular heterogeneity. Nano-DESI MSI was used to examine the spatial localization of several lipid classes including  (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) along with fatty acids and their metabolites (e.g., prostaglandins) in the individual islets and surrounding tissue. Several lipids were found to be substantially enhanced in the islets indicating these lipids may be involved in insulin secretion. Remarkably different distributions were observed for several pairs of  PC (LPC) and PC species differing only by one double bond, such as LPC :1 vs LPC :0, PC 32:1 vs PC 32:0, and PC 34: vs PC 34:1. These findings indicate that minor variations in the fatty acid chain length and saturation have a pronounced effect on the localization of PC and LPC species in pancreatic islets. Interestingly, oxidized PC species observed experimentally were found to be specifically localized to pancreatic islets. These PCs are potential biomarkers for reactive oxygen species in the islets, which could be harmful to pancreatic beta cells. The experimental approach presented in this study will provide valuable information on the heterogeneity of individual pancreatic islets, which is difficult to assess using bulk characterization techniques.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h"<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25790721>Identification of  markers in coronary artery disease using an untargeted LC-MS based metabolomic approach.</a></h2><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD), a complex  disorder, is one of the largest causes of death worldwide. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of this  disease. The gene-environment interaction could lead to modulation of various   resulting in altered levels of various metabolites. Thus, identifying metabolites could aid in deciphering  that could be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. With the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry based methodologies, it is now possible to screen thousands of metabolites in a single snapshot thus, allowing the identification of potential disease metabolite markers. In this work, using an untargeted metabolomic approach, we attempted to identify metabolites that have altered levels in CAD patients. Using reverse phase and HILIC based chromatography followed by mass spectrometry we identified a total of 32 metabolites ( fold; p<0.05) in plasma whose levels were significantly altered in CAD samples. Further, we have validated the discriminative ability of these metabolites in an independent set of CAD and control samples using multivariate PLS-DA analysis. Interestingly,  PC (:0), Cortisol,  PC (P-17:0), and glycerophosphocholine were among the top discriminators for CAD which implies involvement of  pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Herein, we report that an unbiased metabolomic study has the potential to identify newer markers which are involved in several important biological  like lipid ,  pathway etc. which in turn are implicated in CAD. These markers could be of potential clinical importance for screening subjects at risk of CAD. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, using unbiased lipidomic approaches and direct biochemical assessments, we profiled Land's cycle lipid remodeling in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and temporal-parietal-entorhinal cortices of human amyloid beta precursor protein (ΑβPP) over-expressing mice. We identified a cortex-specific hypo- signature at symptomatic onset and a cortex-specific hyper- signature of Land's cycle glycerophosphocholine remodeling over the course of progressive behavioral decline. When N5 TgCRND8 and ΑβPP  /PSI mice first exhibited deficits in the Morris Water Maze, levels of -, LPC(:0/0:0), LPC(16:0/0:0), LPC(24:6/0:0), LPC(25:6/0:0), the -platelet-activating factor (PAF), LPC(O-:0/0:0), and the PAF, PC(O-22:6/:0), declined as a result of reduced calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A α (cPLA α) activity in all cortices but not hippocampus. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, an environmental risk factor that triggers earlier learning memory impairment in ΑβPP  /PSI mice, elicited these same  changes in younger animals. Thus, this lipidomic signature of phenoconversion appears age-independent. By contrast, in symptomatic N5 TgCRND8 mice, cPLA α activity progressively increased; overall - (LPC) and LPC(O) and PC(O-:1/:0) levels progressively rose. Enhanced cPLA α activity was only detected in transgenic mice; however, age-dependent increases in the PAF acetylhydrolase 1b α to α expression ratio, evident in both transgenic and non-transgenic mice, reduced PAF hydrolysis thereby contributing to PAF accumulation. Taken together, these data identify distinct age-independent and age-dependent disruptions in Land's cycle  linked to symptomatic onset and progressive behavioral decline in animals with pre-existing Αβ pathology.

The aim of the study was to use of untargeted metabolomics to identify and validate changes in the blood metabolites profile, occurring as a result of HF-REF development. The analyses were performed first in the derivation set (36 chronic HF-REF patients and 19 controls without the disease) and repeated in validation cohort (31 chronic HF-REF patients and 20 controls). Independent analyses of both sets revealed statistically significant decline in intensities of  (PC): 34:4 and 36:5, lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC): 14:0, 15:0, :0, :, 20:3, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (-PE): :1 and : in chronic HF-REF patients. More symptomatic patients and those with ischaemic etiology of HF-REF presented greater deficit in phospholipids (PLs) intensities. The decrease of identified PLs intensities (as compared to controls) correlated with decreased serum cholesterol level, impaired renal function, reduced exercise capacity, enhanced ventilatory response and  parameters associated with altered fatty acids oxidation. In multiple regression analysis PLs deficit was significantly associated with age, carnitines serum intensity, renal function, uric acid, cholesterol level. In conclusion, HF-REF is associated with significant disturbances in phospholipids . Greater reduction in serum intensities of particular identified PLs is associated with older age, worse clinical condition, impaired oxidative muscle  and enhanced catabolic status.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is characterized by myocardium ischemia as a result of nutrients depletion and hypoxia. The cell can respond to this injury by autophagy or apoptosis, which determines the evolution and possible recovery of the myocardium infarction. Lipids play an important role in cardiovascular disease. However reports stating lipidome variations in cardiovascular disease are scarce and the role that lipids play in this pathological condition is not completely understood. The aim of this work was to identify changes in lipid profile of a myoblast H9c2 cell line under starvation and ischemia, to better understand and recognize new biomarkers for myocardial infarction. Lipidomic profile was evaluated by HILIC-LC-MS and GC-MS. Cardiac cells showed alterations in  PC (34:1) and PC (36:), lysophosphatidylcholines  PC(16:0), lysoPC(:1) and lysoPC(:0), phosphatidylethanolamine PE (34:1), phosphatidylserine PS (36:1), phosphatidylinositol PI (36:), PI (38:3) and PI (38:5), sphingomyelin SM (34:1) and cardiolipins CL(68:4), CL(72:5) and CL(74:7) in ischemia and/or starvation, in comparison with control. Specific differences observed only in starvation were decrease of SM (34:1) and FA (20:4), and increase of PS (36:1). Differences observed only in ischemia were decrease of PC (36:),  PC (16:0) and FA (:1) and simultaneous increase of FA (16:0), and FA (:0). Interestingly, PC (34:1) increased in ischemia and decreased in starvation. In conclusion, our work suggests that lipids are potential markers for evaluation of cell fate, either cell death or recovery, which will be useful to improve diagnosis and prognostic of cardiovascular diseases.

We addressed the potency of model bile, bile salts and  (PC)-cholesterol (CH) liposomes to reconstitute fat absorption in permanently bile-diverted (BD) rats.The plasma appearance of 13C-labeled palmitic acid (13C-16:0) and linoleic acid (13C-:) was determined after their enteral administration to BD or to control rats with an intact enterohepatic circulation (EHC) (13C-16:0 and 13C-: dissolved in 25% olive oil-75% medium chain triacylglycerol oil mixture). BD rats were intraduodenally infused with buffer, model bile [consisting of 60 mM taurocholate (TC), 8 mM PC and 1 mM CH], buffer with TC, buffer with PC and CH liposomes, or buffer with -PC and CH.Plasma concentrations of 13C-16:0 and 13C-: were consistently three- to eightfold higher in control rats than those in buffer-infused BD rats (P < 0.01). ID administration of either model bile or TC to BD rats restored plasma appearance of 13C-fatty acids at least to concentrations observed in control rats. Administration of PC + CH liposomes to BD rats partially reconstituted the plasma appearance of 13C-16:0, but did not affect that of 13C-:. Compared with control rats, the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma 13C-16:0 concentrations was 13.0 +/- 6.9% in buffer-infused rats and 40.9 +/- 3.1% in liposome-infused rats (P < 0.005).Enteral administration of PC + CH liposomes to BD rats partially corrects the absorption of palmitic acid.

For this purpose, reconstituted discoidal HDLs (rHDLs) that contained free cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and either 1-palmitoyl--oleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl--linoleoylphosphatidylcholine, or 1-palmitoyl--arachidonylphosphatidylcholine were incubated with EL- and control (LacZ)-conditioned media. Gas chromatography analysis of the reaction mixtures revealed that both the sn-1 (16:0) and sn- (:1, :, and 20:4) FAs were liberated by EL. The higher rate of sn-1 FA cleavage compared with sn- FA release generated corresponding sn- acyl -species as determined by MS analysis. EL failed to release sn- FA from rHDLs containing 1-O-1'-hexadecenyl--arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine, whose sn-1 position contained a nonhydrolyzable alkyl ether linkage. The lack of phospholipase A() activity of EL and its ability to liberate [(14)C]FA from [(14)C]lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC) led us to conclude that EL-mediated deacylation of  (PC) is initiated at the sn-1 position, followed by the release of the remaining FA from the -PC intermediate. Thin-layer chromatography analysis of cellular lipids obtained from EL-overexpressing cells revealed a pronounced accumulation of [(14)C]phospholipid and [(14)C]triglyceride upon incubation with 1-palmitoyl--[1-(14)C]linoleoyl-PC-labeled HDL(3), indicating the ability of EL to supply cells with unsaturated FAs.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9546668>Biosynthesis of C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids in microsomal membrane preparations from the filamentous fungus Mucor circinelloides.</a></h2><p>The biosynthesis of C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been studied in the fungus Mucor circinelloides. Microsomal membrane preparations contained delta9, delta12 and delta6 desaturase activities. The delta9 desaturase exhibited characteristics similar to those of the animal and yeast delta9 desaturases in being membrane bound and utilising stearoyl-CoA as substrate. Cytochrome b5 (a soluble form lacking the 20-amino-acid hydrophobic C-terminus) stimulated desaturation and was identified as a major cytochrome component of the membranes. A high ferricyanide reductase activity (indicative of NADH:cytochrome b5 reductase activity) coupled to inhibition by cyanide further supported the similarity with the mammalian and yeast enzymes. Time-course studies with radiolabelled oleoyl-CoA showed that the oleate [:1(9)] was transferred to position sn- of  (PtdCho) and was desaturated to linoleoyl-PtdCho. Removal of the excess oleoyl-CoA from the membranes prior to addition of reductant confirmed that oleoyl-PtdCho is a substrate for the delta12 desaturase. The entry of oleate at this position of the phospholipid was facilitated by the activity of -PtdCho:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (LPCAT), which readily transferred oleate from oleoyl-CoA to -PtdCho. Desaturation of oleate at the sn-1 position of PtdCho was also demonstrated after the entry of oleate in to the phospholipid by the enzymes of the Kennedy pathway. Thus oleate at sn-1 and sn- positions served as substrate for the delta12 desaturase and is consistent with observations in oil seed tissues. LPCAT activity was substantially higher than that observed with lysophosphatidylethanolamine:acyl-CoA acyltransferase (LPEAT) indicating that oleate is less effectively channelled to phosphatidylethanolamine for linoleate synthesis. No desaturation on phosphatidylinositol could be demonstrated. Delta6 desaturase utilised linoleate at the sn- position of exogenously supplied PtdCho presented to the membranes in the presence of reductant. Thus, the entry of substrates into PtdCho via LPCAT and the synthesis of linoleate [:(9,12)] and gamma-linolenate [:3(6,9,12)] on this phospholipid is similar to that reported for oil seed membranes.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15980250>Dietary ganglioside and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids increase ganglioside GD3 content and alter the phospholipid profile in neonatal rat retina.</a></h2><p>During early development, the ganglioside composition of the retina changes significantly, in that GD3 becomes the primary ganglioside in the mammalian retina. Because gangliosides play an important role in neuronal cell differentiation and proliferation, this change in ganglioside profile may indicate retinal maturation. Dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs) such as 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 improve visual acuity in infants. Dietary LCPs stimulate neonatal retinal development by altering membrane phospholipids, which in turn affect cell signaling . It is unknown whether dietary ganglioside and LCPs affect the  of phospholipids and gangliosides during retinal development.Male Sprague-Dawley rats ( days old) were fed semipurified diets consisting of 20% fat (control diet) for  weeks containing either 0.1% ganglioside enriched in GD3 (GG diet) or 1% 20:4n-6 and 0.5% 22:6n-3 (LCP diet) in the control diet. The profile of ganglioside and phospholipid was measured.The GG diet increased the ganglioside content by 39% in the retina, with a relative increase in GD3 (by 13%). Dietary LCPs significantly increased the relative levels of GD3 (by 19%, P < 0.01). Total phospholipid was decreased by the LCP-supplemented diet (by 28%).  and phosphatidylserine increased with concomitant decreases in phosphatidylinositol and -phosphatidylethanolamine when animals were fed either the LCP or the GG diet.Animals fed dietary ganglioside increased in total retinal ganglioside and GD3 content during retinal development, with a concomitant alteration of phospholipid . Feeding animals dietary LCPs also affected ganglioside  in the developing retina, suggesting a new mechanism by which these dietary lipids may promote maturation of photoreceptor cells.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1847132>Membrane interactions of amphiphilic polypeptides mastoparan, melittin, polymyxin B, and cardiotoxin.

Mastoparan (wasp venom toxin), melittin (bee venom toxin), cardiotoxin (cobra venom toxin), and polymyxin B (antibacterial antibiotic) inhibited protein kinase C stimulated by phosphatidylserine bilayer or arachidonate monomer and blocked binding of [3H] phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to protein kinase C in the presence of phosphatidylserine bilayer, with IC50 values (concentrations causing 50% inhibition) of 1-8 microM. Mastoparan and polymyxin B were much less inhibitory (IC50, 10-20 microM), whereas melittin and cardiotoxin were similarly inhibitory (IC50, 1-4 microM), when protein kinase C was activated instead by synaptosomal membrane. Kinetic analysis indicate that mastoparan inhibited protein kinase C, assayed using phosphatidylserine or synaptosomal membrane as the phospholipid cofactor, competitively with the phospholipid cofactor, in a mixed manner with CaCl2 or diacylglycerol, noncompetitively with histone, and uncompetitively with ATP, with apparent Ki values of 1.6-.7 microM. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase in the membrane by these polypeptides had relative potencies different from those for their inhibition of protein kinase C activated by the same membrane preparation; mastoparan and melittin inhibited the two activities with comparable potencies, but polymyxin B and cardiotoxin were far less effective in inhibiting Na,K-ATPase. The same relative inhibitory potencies of the polypeptides (melittin greater than mastoparan greater than polymyxin B) for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase were also noted for their inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, 86Rb uptake (Na+ pump) by HL60 cells and the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of the leukemia cells. These findings were consistent with discrete interactions of the polypeptides with functionally distinct sites on the membrane, leading to differential inhibition of biological activities associated with the membrane.

The purified enzyme was composed of single polypeptide chain and molecular mass of 37 kDa was estimated for the protein by SDS-PAGE. The isoelectric point was determined about pH 4.6 and the protein was highly resistant to various kinds of proteolytic enzymes. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed both diacyl and monoacyl phospholipids showing that this enzyme was classified to phospholipase B (phospholipase A1/lysophospholipase). This phospholipase B had acidic pH optima and hydrolyzed both neutral phospholipids such as  (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG).

After the initial decrease, there was a slight recovery. The biphasic type of change was thought to be due to active reacylation of the  phospholipids. This biphasic change, however, was not observed with ethanolamine phosphoglycerides which indicated a steady decrease in the polyunsaturated acyl group content with time of ischemic treatment. The increased hydrolysis of polyunsaturated acyl groups in brain membrane phosphoglycerides due to the ischemic and hypoxic treatments seemed to correlate well with the implication of phospholipase A() involvement in eliciting the increase in free fatty acids during brain stimulation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25790721>Identification of  markers in coronary artery disease using an untargeted LC-MS based metabolomic approach.</a></h2><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD), a complex  disorder, is one of the largest causes of death worldwide. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of this  disease. The gene-environment interaction could lead to modulation of various   resulting in altered levels of various metabolites. Thus, identifying metabolites could aid in deciphering  that could be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. With the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry based methodologies, it is now possible to screen thousands of metabolites in a single snapshot thus, allowing the identification of potential disease metabolite markers. In this work, using an untargeted metabolomic approach, we attempted to identify metabolites that have altered levels in CAD patients. Using reverse phase and HILIC based chromatography followed by mass spectrometry we identified a total of 32 metabolites ( fold; p<0.05) in plasma whose levels were significantly altered in CAD samples. Further, we have validated the discriminative ability of these metabolites in an independent set of CAD and control samples using multivariate PLS-DA analysis. Interestingly,  PC (:0), Cortisol,  PC (P-17:0), and glycerophosphocholine were among the top discriminators for CAD which implies involvement of  pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Herein, we report that an unbiased metabolomic study has the potential to identify newer markers which are involved in several important biological  like lipid ,  pathway etc. which in turn are implicated in CAD. These markers could be of potential clinical importance for screening subjects at risk of CAD. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that both calcium loading and - (LPC) addition induce a strong increase in red cell-red cell adhesive energy, whereas -phosphatidylserine (LPS), added in the same amount as LPC, does not. Red cell morphological studies show differences in the shape change efficiency of LPS, LPC and calcium loading. However, it was further demonstrated that shape change is not directly responsible for the observed adhesive energy increase, since neuraminidase or trypsin treatment abolish this increase, even though the shape changes induced by alteration of phospholipid organization are not affected. The latter experiment strongly suggests that the red cell adhesive energy increase results from an alteration of the glycocalyx structure, which could be in turn a consequence of the shape change.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27322650>Specific  Markers Are Associated with Future Waist-Gaining Phenotype in Women.</a></h2><p>Our study aims to identify  markers associated with either a gain in abdominal (measured by waist circumference) or peripheral (measured by hip circumference) body fat mass.Data of 4 126 weight-gaining adults (-75 years) from three population-based, prospective German cohort studies (EPIC, KORA, DEGS) were analysed regarding a waist-gaining (WG) or hip-gaining phenotype (HG). The phenotypes were obtained by calculating the differences of annual changes in waist minus hip circumference. The difference was displayed for all cohorts. The highest 10% of this difference were defined as WG whereas the lowest 10% were defined as HG. A total of 121 concordant metabolite measurements were conducted using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® kits in EPIC and KORA. Sex-specific associations with metabolite concentration as independent and phenotype as the dependent variable adjusted for confounders were calculated. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing.Across studies both sexes gained on average more waist than hip circumference. We could identify 12 metabolites as being associated with the WG (n = 8) or HG (n = 4) in men, but none were significant after correction for multiple testing; 45 metabolites were associated with the WG (n = 41) or HG (n = 4) in women. For WG, n = 21 metabolites remained significant after correction for multiple testing.

Gain of abdominal fat seems to be related to an initial  state reflected by low concentrations of specific metabolites, at least in women.

The serum, applied to a step gradient (total volume 12.8 ml), was spun for 48 hr at 38,000 rpm at 10 degrees C and, in each of the fractions, apolipoproteins B and A-I were quantified by the respective radioimmunoassays. The markers for lipid distribution used were [4-(14)C]cholesterol and [U-(14)C]lecithin, each incubated with an aliquot of serum at 20 degrees C for 75 min prior to ultracentrifugation. In control sera, three main fractions, very low density (VLDL), low density (LDL), and high density (HDL) lipoproteins were clearly separated from a bottom fraction. Their flotational, electrophoretic, and chemical properties were in good agreement with those reported for the corresponding lipoproteins separated by conventional ultracentrifugation. Both apo B and apo A-I were fully recovered. Essentially all of the apo B was found in VLDL (9.3 +/- 3.5%) and LDL (87 +/- 4.6%); of the apo A-I, 81.0 +/- 5.7% was in HDL and the remainder (17.0 +/- 5.8%) was in the bottom fraction. The peak activities of [(14)C]cholesterol coincided with the peak of apo B in both LDL and VLDL, and with the peak of apo A-I in HDL. The results with the radiolabeled cholesterol were in good agreement with those obtained by chemical analyses. Carbon 14-labeled lecithin, although fully recovered, was not an accurate marker of phospholipid distribution because, under our experimental conditions, a significant amount of the lecithin was converted into its  derivative. The mechanism of the conversion was not established; it appeared to be unrelated to the activities of either lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase or a Ca(+)-dependent phospholipase. Besides its validity in the study of control sera, our method also proved successful in the separation of the serum lipoproteins of the few patients with dyslipoproteinemia (abetalipoproteinemia and familial hypercholesterolemia) who were examined. However, the applicability of the method to all dyslipoproteinemias was not assessed. Taken together, the results indicate that the single-spin method could be useful in clinical studies as a complement to other established techniques.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375771>Top-down lipidomic analysis of human lipoproteins by chip-type asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>This study demonstrates the potential utility of on-line chip-type asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (cAF4) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS) for the top-down lipidomic analysis of human lipoproteins. Utilizing a cAF4, which is a miniaturized AF4 channel operated with a micro flow rate regime, enabled high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) to be separated by hydrodynamic diameter in an aqueous solution with the simultaneous desalting of lipoproteins. On-line desalting was found to enhance the ionization of lipoproteinic lipid molecules during the feeding of cAF4 effluent to ESI-MS when compared to the direct infusion of lipoproteins to MS. An evaluation of top-down lipidomic analysis was performed to test the efficiency of in-source fragmentation during cAF4-ESI-MS in the dissociation of lipoprotein particles into individual lipid molecules. This study demonstrates the structural identification of the following lipid classes:  (PCs), cholesteryl esters (CEs), and regioisomers of triacylglycerols (TAGs) having an identical mass but different acyl chains and dimeric forms of TAGs in the positive ion mode, and phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), phosphatidic acids (PAs), phosphatidyinositols (PIs), and their  species in the negative ion mode. The developed method was applied to plasma samples from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) for the separation of HDL and LDL and for the simultaneous analysis of lipoproteinic lipids, resulting in the identification of 11 PCs, 9 PGs, 4 PAs,  PIs,  PEs,  TAGs, and 6 CEs.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The acyl transferase system in dog lung microsomes was studied by determining the reactivities of various acyl CoA derivatives with 1---acyl- and 1-acyl---. The 16:0 derivative had equal reactivity for both the 1- and - positions. The :0 derivative also exhibited marked reactivity toward both positions, although the specific activity of the enzyme when palmitoyl CoA was used was approximately twice that compared to when stearoyl CoA was used. The 16:1 derivative showed approximately the same reactivity toward the 1- position as did 16:0 but both 16:1 and :1 were more active with the - position. These results suggest that acyl transferases may be important in the lung to insure that sufficient amounts of dipalmitoyl  will always be present for use in pulmonary surfactant biosynthesis. It is also conceivable that the acyl transferase system described acts on 1- and --palmitoyl  (produced by phospholipase hydrolysis of dipalmitoyl ) in order to produce  species needed for cellular purposes other than surfactant function.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078067>Carriage of the V279F homozygous genotype, a rare allele, within the gene encoding Lp-PLA2 leads to changes in circulating intermediate metabolites in individuals without  syndrome.</a></h2><p>Identifying differences in plasma  profiling between Lp-PLA2 279VV and 279FF in individuals without  syndrome (MetS) can be used to elucidate the roles of novel Lp-PLA2 activities in normal physiological processes.Non-MetS individuals with 279FF (n=36) and age-, sex- and BMI-matched VV subjects (n=36) were included in this analysis.The FF subjects exhibited no appreciable enzyme activity. No significant differences were observed between the VV and FF subjects in the serum lipid profiles or hs-CRP, plasma ox-LDL, MDA or urinary 8-epi-PGF2α levels.

We have now defined the nature of the phospholipase activity produced by a clinical isolate of C. neoformans var. neoformans, under native conditions, by 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of radiolabelled substrates. Glycerophosphocholine was identified by NMR spectroscopy as the sole phospholipid degradation product of the reaction between substrate  (PC) and cryptococcal culture supernatants indicating the presence of phospholipase B (PLB). No lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC) or products indicative of phospholipase C, phospholipase D, or other lipase activity were identified. Use of PC and -PC containing radiolabelled acyl chains and separation of products by TLC confirmed the PLB and lysophospholipase (LPL) activities. Lysophospholipase transacylase (LPTA) activity was identified by the formation of radioactive PC from -PC. Extracellular enzyme production was maximal after 6 to 10 h in fresh medium. Assay conditions were optimized for pH, linearity with time, enzyme concentration, and saturation by substrates to allow comparison with phospholipases from other organisms. LPL activity was 10- to 20-fold greater than PLB activity, with mean (+/- standard deviation) specific activities of 34.9 +/- 7.9 and 3. +/- 0. micromol of substrate hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein, respectively. The response of PLB to increasing substrate concentrations was bimodal, whereas inhibition of LPL and LPTA activities occurred at concentrations of substrate -PC greater than 200 microM. Enzyme activities were stable at acid pH (3.8), with pH optima of 3.5 to 4.5. Activities were unchanged in the presence of exogenous serine protease inhibitors, divalent cations, and EDTA.

There is increasing evidence that oxidative modification of LDL is important for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the LDL-associated platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) seems to play a key role in LDL oxidation by hydrolysing the oxidized phospholipids of  (PC) and producing lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC). We measured the total serum and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels of PAF-AH activity and studied the distribution of PAF-AH activity among three LDL subfractions isolated by gradient ultracentrifugation in 15 patients with heterozygous FH and 13 normolipidaemic control subjects. We also determined the -PC production in each LDL subfraction during Cu2(+)-induced oxidation in vitro. The total serum PAF-AH activity in heterozygous FH patients was significantly higher than in control subjects, whereas the HDL-associated PAF-AH activity, expressed as a percentage of total serum PAF-AH activity, was significantly lower in the FH patients than in control subjects (13.9 +/- 6.6% vs. 30.6 +/- 4.4%, P < 0.001). Among the LDL subfractions, the PAF-AH activity in both normolipidaemic control subjects and FH patients, expressed as nmol mg-1 protein min-1, was significantly higher in the LDL3 subfraction (33.1 +/- 4.8 and 53.4 +/- 11.5 respectively) than in the LDL2 (.6 +/- 5.3 and 26.8 +/- 10.4 respectively, P < 0.0001 for both comparisons) and LDL1 subfractions (5.1 +/- 1.5 and 7.8 +/- .6, respectively, P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Additionally, the enzyme activity in each LDL subfraction of the heterozygous FH patients was significantly higher than in control subjects (P < 0.02 for LDL1, P < 0.03 for LDL2 and P < 0.0001 for LDL3). No difference was observed in the susceptibility to oxidation of each LDL subfraction among the heterozygous FH patients and the normolipidaemic control subjects. During oxidation, the PAF-AH activity decreased, whereas the -PC levels significantly increased in all subfractions of both groups. The -PC/sphingomyelin molar ratio in each LDL subfraction of the FH patients 3 h after the onset of the oxidation was significantly higher than in control subjects [0.38 +/- 0.05 and 0.27 +/- 0.04, respectively, for LDL1 (P < 0.006), 0.47 +/- 0.08 and 0.39 +/- 0.03, respectively, for LDL2 (P < 0.04), 0.55 +/- 0.11 and 0.42 +/- 0.06, respectively, for LDL3 (P < 0.02)]. Our results show that heterozygous FH patients exhibit higher PAF-AH activity than control subjects in all LDL subfractions, resulting in higher -PC production during oxidation, which confers on these subfractions higher biological potency. This phenomenon, in combination with the diminished anti-atherogenic and antioxidant capability of HDL in these patients due to the relatively low HDL-cholesterol levels compared with LDL-cholesterol levels and, consequently, the relatively low HDL-associated PAF-AH activity, could contribute to the higher atherogenicity and incidence of coronary artery disease observed in FH patients.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585650>ACYL-LIPID DESATURASE2 is required for chilling and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid desaturation of membrane lipids is a strategy for plants to survive chilling or freezing temperature. To further characterize enzymes involved in this stress response pathway, ACYL-LIPID DESATURASE2 (ADS2; Enzyme Commission 1.14.99) was studied using genetic, cell, and biochemical approaches. ads2 mutant plants appear similar to the wild type under standard growth conditions but display a dwarf and sterile phenotype when grown at 6°C and also show increased sensitivity to freezing temperature. Fatty acid composition analysis demonstrated that ads2 mutant plants at 6°C have reduced levels of 16:1, 16:, 16:3, and :3 and higher levels of 16:0 and :0 fatty acids compared with the wild type. Lipid profiling revealed that 34C species of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG) content in ads2 mutants were lower and phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, , -, and phosphatidylserine were higher than the wild type. Subcellular localization of C- and N-terminal enhanced fluorescence fusion proteins indicated that ADS2 localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum, although signal was also confirmed in Golgi and plastids. A double mutation with a putative plastid ADS3 paralog exacerbates the growth defects of ads2 mutant plants under low temperature. These observations suggest that ADS2 encodes a 16:0 desaturase of MGDG and PG.

The 3H was associated mainly with  (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) at the -position while 14C was found at the 1-position. When the double-labeled cells were incubated with bradykinin or ionophore A23187, a significant release of 3H into the medium was observed, while the 14C release was small. Approximately 90% of the 3H released was arachidonic acid. Small amounts of the released 3H were no longer associated with stearic acid; it was converted mainly into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). When stimulated by either bradykinin or ionophore, a significant 3H loss was observed in cellular PC while there were no significant 3H changes in other phospholipids, triacylglycerols (TGs), or diacylglycerols (DGs). Although 14C of cellular lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC) was not increased significantly, the 3H seemed to be released from the -position of PC by the action of phospholipase A2. There was no significant change in the breakdown of PC between palmitoyl-arachidonyl (16:0/20:4) and stearoyl-arachidonyl (:0/20:4) species. Both A23187 and bradykinin may activate phospholipase A2, releasing arachidonic acid equally from the -position of PCs having either palmitic acid or stearic acid at the 1-position.

Subsequently, the hydrolyzed mixture was injected directly into the HPLC system for PtdCh assay.The present method permitted PtdCh assay within 5 min in one chromatographic run. Recovery of an authentic PtdCh sample was 99% (n = 10). The within-run coefficients of variation for choline derived from PtdCh in the same tissue samples were 0.6% (n = 10) and 1.3% (n = 30). Under the present method, the lowest and highest PtdCh values in tissue samples were about  micromol/g (eye ball) and 29 micromol/g (spinal cord), respectively. Methoxamine significantly decreased PtdCh levels and increased free choline levels in mouse artery and submandibular gland.Under the present sample processing procedure, the choline values originating from -PtdCh and sphingomyelin were much less than those originating from PtdCh hydrolysis. Thus, it was possible to inject the hydrolyzed mixture directly into the HPLC system for PtdCh assay.

In this study, the modulation of arachidonate release by exogenous -PC in rat heart myoblastic H9c2 cells was examined. Incubation of H9c2 cells with -PC resulted in an enhanced release of arachidonate in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. -PC species containing palmitoyl (C(16:0)) or stearoyl (C(:0)) groups evoked the highest amount of arachidonate release, while other lysophospholipid species were relatively ineffective. Cells treated with phospholipase A() inhibitors resulted in the attenuation of the enhanced arachidonate release in the presence of -PC. -PC caused the translocation of phospholipase A() from the cytosol to the membrane fraction and induced an increase in Ca2+ flux from the medium into the cells. Nimodipine, a specific Ca(+)-channel blocker, partially attenuated the -PC-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+. Concurrent with Ca2+ influx, -PC caused an enhancement of protein kinase C activity. The -PC-induced arachidonate release was attenuated when cells were pre-incubated with specific protein kinase C and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors.

The distribution of label among the palmitic acid-containing species of PtdCho and PtdEtn formed by both transacylation activities was determined.

Whereas the loss of PC following oxidation was similar in the deficient and normal plasmas, the formation of -PC was significantly lower, and the accumulation of OXPC was higher in the deficient plasma. Isolated LDL from the PAF-AH-deficient subjects was more susceptible to oxidation, and stimulated adhesion molecule synthesis in endothelial cells, more than the normal LDL. Oxidation of 16:0-[1-14C]-: PC, equilibrated with plasma PC, resulted in the accumulation of labeled short- and long-chain OXPCs, in addition to the labeled aqueous products. The formation of the aqueous products decreased by 80%, and the accumulation of short-chain OXPC increased by 110% in the deficient plasma, compared to the normal plasma, showing that PAF-AH is predominantly involved in the hydrolysis of the truncated OXPCs. Labeled sn--acyl group from the long-chain OXPC was not only hydrolyzed to free fatty acid, but was preferentially transferred to diacylglycerol, in both the normal and deficient plasmas. In contrast, the acyl group from unoxidized PC was transferred only to cholesterol, showing that the specificity of LCAT is altered by OXPC.

At the same concentration, -PAF also inhibited CBF, 9.5 +/- 0.1 (n = 197, p < 0.001) but not LPC, 10.5 +/- 0. (n = 127). WEB 2086 inhibited -PAF and C16/ PAF-induced CBF decrease. Preincubation (20 min) with ketotifen but not with pyribenzamine (1 microM) also suppressed the CBF inhibitory effect of PAF and -PAF. Incubation of [3H]PAF with tracheal rings from 10 min to 6h resulted in its partial  (25%) into [3H]-PAF and a compound with a short retention time (10 min). [3H]-PAF incubated for 3h with tracheal rings was partially metabolized (10%) into [3H]PAF and a compound with a short retention time. The PAF-induced decrease of CBF is congruent with its influence on pulmonary clearance, possibly via a specific receptor, since WEB 2086 abolished the effect of PAF. The inhibition of the PAF-induced CBF decrease by ketotifen may contribute to the therapeutic properties of this antiallergic drug.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3102603>Regulation of arachidonic acid  in resident and BCG-activated alveolar macrophages: role of (bis)phosphatidic acid.</a></h2><p>To dissect mechanisms of arachidonic acid (20:4)  in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), two distinct cell populations were investigated, resident and BCG-activated rabbit alveolar macrophages. After purified resident PAM were labeled overnight with [3H]20:4, radioactivity was localized primarily within (bis)phosphatidic acid (L(bis)PA) (13.1% +/- 1.7), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (22.8% +/- 0.8), and  (PC) (26.7% +/- 1.7), with lesser amounts recovered in phosphatidylserine plus phosphatidylinositol (PS/PI) (9. +/- 0.8%). By contrast, analysis of the phospholipid classes from prelabeled BCG-activated PAM revealed that the amount of [3H]20:4 contained in L(bis)PA was profoundly decreased (4.7% +/- 0.4), p less than 0.003), whereas [3H]20:4 contained within other BCG phospholipids remained unchanged. Moreover, L(bis)PA, which composed .6% +/- 1. of the total phospholipid phosphorus of resident PAM, was reduced to 4.1% +/- 0.1 in BCG-activated macrophages (p less than 0.01). Phospholipase A2 from snake venom or from pancreas failed to release 20:4 from L(bis)PA, and lipase (phospholipase A1) from Rhizopus delmar liberated no more than one-third of this arachidonate. These results suggest that much of the arachidonate is not mobilized by classical phospholipases A1 and A2. When [3H]20:4-labeled PAM were stimulated with 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a loss of [3H]20:4 was observed from L(bis)PA, PE, PC, and PS/PI, with a concomitant increase in the synthesis of Hete and leukotriene C4. BCG-activated PAM exposed to either TPA or 3.8 microM calcium ionophore A23187 liberated [3H]20:4 solely from PE and PC, with diminished 20:4 oxidative . Analysis of the specific radioactivities of phospholipids obtained from resident PAM prelabeled with [3H]20:4 or [32P]i demonstrated that the specific activity of [32P]L(bis)PA was negligible, whereas that of [3H]20:4 was quite high. In addition, L(bis)PA deacylation induced by TPA in resident PAM was always accompanied by a corresponding loss of [3H]20:4 from phosphatidylinositol (PI), suggesting that  of this novel phospholipid proceeded by a deacylation-reacylation reaction rather than by de novo synthesis. BCG-activated PAM, which exhibited depressed eicosanoid formation, consistently failed to deacylate [3H]20:4 from L(bis)PA or PI. These studies demonstrate that, unlike 20:4 derived from PE and PC by BCG-activated PAM, L(bis)PA may indeed provide a novel source of 20:4 that is tightly coupled to the lipoxygenase pathway.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9169616>Delayed oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated diacyl phospholipids in the presence of plasmalogen phospholipids in vitro.</a></h2><p>The oxidative degradation of plasmalogen (alkenylacyl) phospholipids was analysed in the absence and the presence of polyunsaturated ester phospholipids by 1H-NMR and by chemical determination. Brain lysoplasmenylethanolamine (-P-PE), brain P-PE and erythrocyte P-PE, containing an increasing number of intrachain double bonds at sn2, were oxidized with ,'-azobis-(-amidinopropane hydrochloride) (AAPH;  or 10 mM) in Triton X-100 micelles (detergent/phospholipid 1:5, mol/mol). The formation of two peroxyl radicals was accompanied by the degradation of approx. one molecule of brain -P-PE. On oxidation of brain P-PE or erythrocyte P-PE (320 nmol) with  mM AAPH, the (alpha-vinyl) methine 1H signal of the enol ether decreased more rapidly than the methine proton peak of intrachain double bonds. The rate of enol ether degradation increased in the order: erythrocyte P-PE>brain P-PE>brain -P-PE. The disappearance of the polyunsaturated ester phospholipids 1-palmitoyl--arachidonoyl  (16:0/20:4-PC) and 1-palmitoyl--linoleoyl  (16:0/:-PC) (100 nmol), as induced by 10 mM AAPH, was nearly completely inhibited by the plasmalogens (25 nmol) in the first 30 and 60 min of incubation respectively, and was delayed at later time points. Plasmalogens and vitamin E (4-25 nmol) mitigated the decreases in 16:0/[3H]20:4-PC (100 nmol) induced by  mM AAPH in a similar manner. The initial rate of degradation of intrachain double bonds of 16:0/20:4-PC and 16:0/:-PC (320 nmol;  mM AAPH) was decreased by 59% and 81% respectively in the presence of 80 nmol of brain -P-PE. In conclusion, plasmalogens markedly delay the oxidative degradation of intrachain double bonds under in vitro conditions. Interactions of enol ether double bonds with initiating peroxyl radicals as well as with products generated by prior oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids are proposed to be responsible for this capacity of plasmalogens. Furthermore, the products of enol ether oxidation apparently do not propagate the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16286468>Effects of stable suppression of Group VIA phospholipase A2 expression on phospholipid content and composition, insulin secretion, and proliferation of INS-1 insulinoma cells.</a></h2><p>Studies involving pharmacologic inhibition or transient reduction of Group VIA phospholipase A2 (iPLA2beta) expression have suggested that it is a housekeeping enzyme that regulates cell -lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels, rates of arachidonate incorporation into phospholipids, and degradation of excess  (PC). In insulin-secreting islet beta-cells and some other cells, in contrast, iPLA2beta signaling functions have been proposed. Using retroviral vectors, we prepared clonal INS-1 beta-cell lines in which iPLA2beta expression is stably suppressed by small interfering RNA. Two such iPLA2beta knockdown (iPLA2beta-KD) cell lines express less than 20% of the iPLA2beta of control INS-1 cell lines. The iPLA2beta-KD INS-1 cells exhibit impaired insulin secretory responses and reduced proliferation rates. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses of PC and LPC species that accumulate in INS-1 cells cultured with arachidonic acid suggest that :0/20:4-glycerophosphocholine (GPC) synthesis involves sn- remodeling to yield 16:0/20:4-GPC and then sn-1 remodeling via a 1-/20:4-GPC intermediate. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses also indicate that the PC and LPC content and composition of iPLA2beta-KD and control INS-1 cells are nearly identical, as are the rates of arachidonate incorporation into PC and the composition and remodeling of other phospholipid classes. These findings indicate that iPLA2beta plays signaling or effector roles in beta-cell secretion and proliferation but that stable suppression of its expression does not affect beta-cell GPC lipid content or composition even under conditions in which LPC is being actively consumed by conversion to PC. This calls into question the generality of proposed housekeeping functions for iPLA2beta in PC homeostasis and remodeling.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3029085>The final step in the de novo biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor. Properties of a unique CDP-choline:1-alkyl--acetyl-sn-glycerol choline-phosphotransferase in microsomes from the renal inner medulla of rats.</a></h2><p>Final steps in the synthesis of platelet activating factor (PAF) occur via two enzymatic reactions: the acetylation of 1-alkyl---sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by a specific acetyltransferase or the transfer of the phosphocholine base group from CDP-choline to 1-alkyl--acetyl-sn-glycerol by a dithiothreitol (DTT)-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase. Our studies demonstrate that rat kidney inner medulla microsomes synthesize PAF primarily via the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase since the specific activity of this enzyme is greater than 100-fold higher than the acetyltransferase. The two cholinephosphotransferases that catalyze the biosynthesis of  and PAF have similar Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirements and are inhibited by Ca2+. Also topographic experiments indicated that both activities are located on the cytoplasmic face of microsomal vesicles. PAF synthesis was slightly stimulated by 10 mM DTT, whereas the enzymatic synthesis of  was inhibited greater than 95% under the same conditions. The concept of two separate enzymes for PAF and  synthesis is further substantiated by the differences in the two microsomal cholinephosphotransferase activities with respect to pH optima, substrate specificities, and their sensitivities to temperature, deoxycholate, or ethanol. Study of the substrate specificities of the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase showed that the enzyme prefers a lipid substrate with 16:0 or :1 sn-1-alkyl chains. Short chain esters at the sn- position (acetate or propionate) are utilized by the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase, but analogs with acetamide or methoxy substituents at the sn- position are not substrates. Also, CDP-choline is the preferred water-soluble substrate when compared to CDP-ethanolamine. Utilization of endogenous neutral lipids as a substrate by the DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase demonstrated that sufficient levels of alkylacetylglycerols are normally present in rat kidney microsomes to permit the synthesis of physiological quantities of PAF. These data suggest the renal DTT-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase could be a potentially important enzyme in the regulation of systemic blood pressure.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164830>Choline and polyunsaturated fatty acids in preterm infants' maternal milk.</a></h2><p>Choline, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (ARA) are essential to fetal development, particularly of the brain. These components are actively enriched in the fetus. Deprivation from placental supply may therefore result in impaired accretion in preterm infants.To determine choline, choline metabolites, DHA, and ARA in human breast milk (BM) of preterm infants compared to BM of term born infants.We collected expressed BM samples from 34 mothers (N\xa0=\xa0353; postnatal day 6-85), who had delivered 35 preterm infants undergoing neonatal intensive care (postmenstrual age 30\xa0weeks, range 25.4-32.0), and from mothers after term delivery (N\xa0=\xa09; postnatal day 6-118). Target metabolites were analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography and reported as medians and 25th/75th percentiles.In BM, choline was mainly present in the form of phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine, followed by free choline, , sphingomyelin, and -. In preterm infants' BM total choline ranged from 61 to 360\xa0mg/L (median: 158\xa0mg/L) and was decreased compared to term infants' BM (range 142-343\xa0mg/L; median: 258\xa0mg/L; p\xa0<\xa00.01). ARA and DHA comprised 0.81 (range: 0.46-1.60) and 0.43 (0.15-.42)\xa0% of total preterm BM lipids, whereas term BM values were 0.68 (0.52-0.88) and 0.35 (0.-0.75)\xa0%, respectively. Concentrations of all target parameters decreased after birth, and frequently 150\xa0ml/kg/d BM did not meet the estimated fetal accretion rates.Following preterm delivery, BM choline concentrations are lower, whereas ARA and DHA levels are comparable versus term delivery. Based on these findings we suggest a combined supplementation of preterm infants' BM with choline, ARA and DHA combined to improve the nutritional status of preterm infants.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Incorporation into PC was greatly enhanced when incubation was carried out in presence of lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC). In all experiments, in the presence of NADH and O2, with and without added -PC, the initial rate of formation of [14C]linoleoyl-PC was much greater than that of [14C]linoleoyl-CoA ( [14C]:-CoA). These results suggest that the actual substrate for the delta 12-desaturase is the oleoyl-PC, although some desaturation of :1-CoA cannot be eliminated.

The mutants were isolated using a single round of selection to ensure that resistance was due to a single gene defect. These mutants, RAW.R1 and RAW.R23, are approximately 20 times more resistant to ET--OMe (ID50 = 15-17 microM) than the parent strain (ID50 = 0.7-1.0 microM). Resistance to ET--OMe was due to a 90-95% reduction in the ability to take up and accumulate this compound. The uptake of other choline glycerophospholipids (e.g., platelet activating factor and 1-acyl---sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was also severely affected. This defect was not limited to choline glycerophospholipids; the uptake of an ethanolamine glycerophospholipid (1-alkyl---sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) was reduced by 80%. The uptake of palmitic acid, an amphipathic molecule bearing no phosphate-containing head group, was unaffected in the mutants. There was little  of ET--OMe by either the wild-type or mutant cells. Binding of ET--OMe appeared to be normal in the mutants, but internalization of pre-bound ET--OMe was reduced. Uptake of non-lipid ligands such as horseradish peroxidase, lucifer yellow, and transferrin was normal in the mutants demonstrating that fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis is functional. The ability to generate mutants displaying a lesion that affects the uptake of both choline and ethanolamine phospholipids demonstrates that these species are internalized by RAW cells through one common primary route or through  that share a common factor. These mutants, and this approach to their isolation, offer a system with which to study and define the mechanisms of glycerophospholipid uptake into macrophages as well as other cell types.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24969426>Characterization of complex lipid mixtures in contaminant exposed JEG-3 cells using liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to develop a method based on ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) for lipid profiling in human placental choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cells.

Direct molecular analysis of tissue using mass spectrometry (MS) is a subject of much interest in the field of metabolomics. Most notably, imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) allows visualization of molecular distributions on the tissue surface. To understand lipid dynamics during ischemic injury, we performed IMS analysis on rat brain tissue sections with focal cerebral ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and brain sections were prepared. IMS analyses were conducted using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) in positive ion mode. To determine the molecular structures, the detected ions were subjected to tandem MS. The intensity counts of the ion signals of m/z 798.5 and m/z 760.5 that are revealed to be a , PC (16:0/:1) are reduced in the area of focal cerebral ischemia as compared to the normal cerebral area. In contrast, the signal of m/z 496.3, identified as a -, LPC (16:0), was clearly increased in the area of focal cerebral ischemia. In IMS analyses, changes of PC (16:0/:1) and LPC (16:0) are observed beyond the border of the injured area. Together with previous reports--that PCs are hydrolyzed by phospholipase A() (PLA()) and produce LPCs,--our present results suggest that LPC (16:0) is generated during the injury process after cerebral ischemia, presumably via PLA() activation, and that PC (16:0/:1) is one of its precursor molecules.2010 IBRO.

An understanding of lipid  in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered lipid  at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15- weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The lipid, sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and  (38:5).

Here, using unbiased lipidomic approaches and direct biochemical assessments, we profiled Land's cycle lipid remodeling in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and temporal-parietal-entorhinal cortices of human amyloid beta precursor protein (ΑβPP) over-expressing mice. We identified a cortex-specific hypo- signature at symptomatic onset and a cortex-specific hyper- signature of Land's cycle glycerophosphocholine remodeling over the course of progressive behavioral decline. When N5 TgCRND8 and ΑβPP  /PSI mice first exhibited deficits in the Morris Water Maze, levels of -, LPC(:0/0:0), LPC(16:0/0:0), LPC(24:6/0:0), LPC(25:6/0:0), the -platelet-activating factor (PAF), LPC(O-:0/0:0), and the PAF, PC(O-22:6/:0), declined as a result of reduced calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A α (cPLA α) activity in all cortices but not hippocampus. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, an environmental risk factor that triggers earlier learning memory impairment in ΑβPP  /PSI mice, elicited these same  changes in younger animals. Thus, this lipidomic signature of phenoconversion appears age-independent. By contrast, in symptomatic N5 TgCRND8 mice, cPLA α activity progressively increased; overall - (LPC) and LPC(O) and PC(O-:1/:0) levels progressively rose. Enhanced cPLA α activity was only detected in transgenic mice; however, age-dependent increases in the PAF acetylhydrolase 1b α to α expression ratio, evident in both transgenic and non-transgenic mice, reduced PAF hydrolysis thereby contributing to PAF accumulation.

In cultured rat GEC, C5b-9 stimulates a phosphoinositide-directed phospholipase (PL) C and products of PLC downregulate C5b-9-mediated GEC injury. We now report that C5b-9-induced hydrolysis of  (PC) provides an additional source of 1,-diacylglycerol (DAG). PC was labeled in intact GEC by brief incubation with 1-O-[alkyl-3H]--PC. Assembly of C5b-9 stimulated an increase in PC-derived [3H]DAG (173 +/- % control), which was reduced in GEC depleted of protein kinase C (PKC) by prolonged preincubation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Similar to C5b-9, [3H]DAG was released from PC after brief incubation of GEC with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 plus PMA. The increases in [3H]DAG induced by C5b-9 and A23187 plus PMA were paralleled by increases in DAG mass. C5b-9 also increased [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA; 182 +/- 37% control), but there was no significant interconversion of DAG and PA. Thus DAG probably originated via PLC. PC-directed PLC activity was also studied in GEC homogenates by release of [14C]DAG from exogenous 1-palmitoyl--[arachidonoyl-14C]PC. PLC activity was present at physiological Ca2+ concentration (200-1,200 nM), and PMA stimulated PLC activity in cell homogenates (in presence of ATP). These results demonstrate directly that PMA stimulates release of DAG from PC and are in keeping with the effect of PMA in [3H]-PC-labeled GEC. Thus GEC contain a PC-directed PLC, whose activity is physiologically regulated and is present at nanomolar Ca2+ concentration. C5b-9 stimulates PC-directed PLC, leading to production of DAG.

Among these, 4-hydroxynon--enal and analogous gamma-hydroxyalkenal  (PCs) have attracted attention because these oxidatively truncated lipids are biologically active and have been implicated in diseases. A previous study showed that hydroxydienes, generated by allylic oxygenation of linoleic acid, are unreactive toward oxidative fragmentation. We now show that, in the presence of hydroperoxides, hydroxydienes fragment as readily as the corresponding hydroperoxydienes, generating gamma-hydroxyalkenals. In a physiomimetic model study, myeloperoxidase-promoted free radical-induced fragmentation of either hydroperoxy- or hydroxyoctecadienoate esters of --PC in small unilamellar vesicles produced the 9-hydroxy-12-oxododec-10-enoic acid (HODA) ester HODA-PC. Therefore, hydroxydienes, that are generally more abundant in vivo than hydroperoxydienes, are plausible intermediates in the production of oxidatively truncated lipids in vivo where a constant flux of radicals and hydroperoxides is present. Our findings also show that the formation of dioxetane intermediates through peroxyradical cyclization is not required to achieve oxidative fragmentation of PUFAs.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148485>Specificity of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A() toward oxidized phosphatidylserines: liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry characterization of products and computer modeling of interactions.</a></h2><p>Ca(+)-independent lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A() (Lp-PLA()) is a member of the phospholipase A() superfamily with a distinguishing characteristic of high specificity for oxidatively modified sn- fatty acid residues in phospholipids that has been especially well characterized for peroxidized species of  (PC). The ability of Lp-PLA() to hydrolyze peroxidized species of phosphatidylserine (PS), acting as a recognition signal for clearance of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes, as well as the products of the reaction has not been investigated. We performed liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based structural characterization of oxygenated, hydrolyzed molecular species of PS-containing linoleic acid in either the sn- position (C(:0)/C(:)) or in both sn-1 and sn- positions (C(:)/C(:)), formed in the cytochrome c- and H()O()-driven enzymatic oxidation reaction. Cytochrome c has been chosen as a catalyst of peroxidation reactions because of its likely involvement in PS oxidation in apoptotic cells. We found that Lp-PLA() catalyzed the hydrolysis of both nontruncated and truncated (oxidatively fragmented) species of oxidized PS species, albeit with different efficiencies, and performed detailed characterization of the major reaction products: oxygenated derivatives of linoleic acid as well as nonoxygenated and oxygenated species of -PS. Among linoleic acid products, derivatives oxygenated at the C(9) position, including 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), a potent ligand of G protein-coupled receptor G2A, were the most abundant. Computer modeling of interactions of Lp-PLA() with different PS-oxidized species indicated that they are able to bind in the proximity (<5 Å) of Ser273 and His351 of the catalytic triad. For 9-hydroxy and 9-hydroperoxy derivatives of oxidized PS, the sn- ester bond was positioned very close (<3 Å) to the Ser273 residue, a nucleophile directly attacking the sn- bond, thus favoring the hydrolysis reaction. We suggest that oxidatively modified free fatty acids and -PS species generated by Lp-PLA() may represent important signals facilitating and regulating the execution of apoptotic and phagocytosis programs essential for the control of inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764940>The Rickettsia prowazekii ExoU homologue possesses phospholipase A1 (PLA1), PLA2, and -PLA2 activities and can function in the absence of any eukaryotic cofactors in vitro.</a></h2><p>Here we have characterized the Rickettsia prowazekii RP534 protein, a homologue of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoU phospholipase A (PLA) secreted cytotoxin. Our studies showed that purified recombinant RP534 PLA possessed the predicted PLA() and -PLA() activities based on what has been published for P. aeruginosa ExoU. RP534 also displayed PLA(1) activity under the conditions tested, whereas ExoU did not. In addition, recombinant RP534 displayed a basal PLA activity that could hydrolyze  in the absence of any eukaryotic cofactors. Interestingly, the addition of bovine liver superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), a known activator of P. aeruginosa ExoU, resulted in an increased rate of RP534-catalyzed phospholipid hydrolysis, indicating that mechanisms of activation of the ExoU family of PLAs may be evolutionarily conserved. The mechanism of SOD1-dependent stimulation of RP534 was further examined using active site mutants and a fluorogenic phospholipid substrate whose hydrolysis by RP534 over a short time course is measureable only in the presence of SOD1. These studies suggest a mechanism by which SOD1 stimulates RP534 activity once it has bound to the substrate. We also show that antibody raised against RP534 was useful for immunoprecipitating active RP534 from R. prowazekii lysed cell extracts, thus verifying that this protein is expressed and active in rickettsiae isolated from embryonated hen egg yolk sacs.Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

Unlike conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, ALP acts at the cell-membrane level. We have reported previously that ALP is internalized, and interferes with  (PC) biosynthesis de novo, which appeared to be essential for survival in lymphoma cells [Van der Luit, Budde, Ruurs, Verheij and Van Blitterswijk (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 39541-39547]. Here, we report that, in HeLa cells, ALP accumulates in lipid rafts, and that internalization is inhibited by low temperature, monensin, disruption of lipid rafts and expression of a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin bearing a replacement of Lys44 with alanine (K44A). Thus ALP is internalized via raft- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis. Dynamin-K44A alleviated the ALP-induced inhibition of PC synthesis and rescued the cells from apoptosis induction. Additional cell rescue was attained by exogenous lysoPC, which after internalization serves as an alternative substrate for PC synthesis (through acylation). Unlike ALP, and despite the high structural similarity to ALP, lysoPC uptake did not occur via lipid rafts and did not depend on functional dynamin, indicating no involvement of endocytosis. Albumin back-extraction experiments suggested that (radiolabelled) lysoPC undergoes transbilayer movement (flipping). We conclude that ALP is internalized by endocytosis via lipid rafts to cause apoptosis, while exogenous cell-rescuing lysoPC traverses the plasma membrane outside rafts by flipping. Additionally, our data imply the importance of ether bonds in -phospholipids, such as in ALP, for partitioning in lipid rafts.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9250703>Stimulation of  turnover by beta-phorbol ester and diacylglycerol in the primordial human placenta: the suggested role of phospholipase D activation.</a></h2><p>The effects of 4beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and 1,-(sn)-dioctanoylglycerol (DOCG) on the  (PC) turnover (defined as degradation to diacylglycerol followed by PC resynthesis) and on the activity of PC-specific phospholipase D were investigated in placental mince incubated with various radiolabelled precursors in vitro. Experiments with [32P]phosphate indicated that 1 microM PMA and 125-250 microM DOCG were the lowest concentrations that led to maximal and selective stimulation of PC labelling. Moreover, PMA and DOCG acted along different time courses: PMA enhanced labelling after 60 min incubation, with a lag period of at least 30 min, whereas DOCG stimulated PC labelling after only 30 min with no further increase in the next 30 min. The following findings suggest that increased labelling of PC with [32P]phosphate in PMA-treated tissue reflects an increased rate of PC turnover: (1) the effects of PMA and DOCG were additive and PMA did not have any effect on the labelling of PC(DOCG) indicating that it stimulated PC labelling even if it did not activate CTP:choline cytidylyl transferase, the regulatory enzyme of PC synthesis de novo; () PMA did not increase the labelling of PC from [3H]glycerol or [3H]glucose ruling out a PMA-promoted availability of glycolytic and/or lipolytic intermediates for PC formation; and (3) the PMA effect was attended by an increased labelling of phosphatidic acid whereas there was no change in the labelling of -PC, indicating the activation of phospholipase D. Experiments in which the transphosphatidylation reaction between [3H]myristic acid-labelled PC and ethanol was used to estimate phospholipase D activity showed .4-fold and 1.4-1.8-fold activations by PMA and DOCG, respectively, with no additivity noted. These results suggest that PMA stimulates PC turnover in the early human placenta via the activation of phospholipase D. Rapid  conversion decreases the capacity of DOCG to accelerate PC-turnover and to activate phospholipase D. The early DOCG-induced stimulation of PC labelling with [32P]phosphate is attributed mainly to its known activating effect on CTP: choline cytidylyl transferase.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29571133>LC-MS-based serum fingerprinting reveals significant dysregulation of phospholipids in chronic heart failure.</a></h2><p>Cardiac and extracardiac lipid  is known to be significantly altered in the course of the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), however the precise mechanisms are not fully elucidated. The aim of the study was to use of untargeted metabolomics to identify and validate changes in the blood metabolites profile, occurring as a result of HF-REF development. The analyses were performed first in the derivation set (36 chronic HF-REF patients and 19 controls without the disease) and repeated in validation cohort (31 chronic HF-REF patients and 20 controls). Independent analyses of both sets revealed statistically significant decline in intensities of  (PC): 34:4 and 36:5, lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC): 14:0, 15:0, :0, :, 20:3, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (-PE): :1 and : in chronic HF-REF patients. More symptomatic patients and those with ischaemic etiology of HF-REF presented greater deficit in phospholipids (PLs) intensities. The decrease of identified PLs intensities (as compared to controls) correlated with decreased serum cholesterol level, impaired renal function, reduced exercise capacity, enhanced ventilatory response and  parameters associated with altered fatty acids oxidation. In multiple regression analysis PLs deficit was significantly associated with age, carnitines serum intensity, renal function, uric acid, cholesterol level. In conclusion, HF-REF is associated with significant disturbances in phospholipids . Greater reduction in serum intensities of particular identified PLs is associated with older age, worse clinical condition, impaired oxidative muscle  and enhanced catabolic status.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Neutrophils isolated from males who were fed fish oil supplement (EPA; .8 g/day) for 5 wk contained large quantities of eicosapentaenoate in  (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine and less in phosphatidylinositol. The ratio arachidonate/eicosapentaenoate in PC and phosphatidylethanolamine decreased from greater than 10 before the enriched diet to approximately 3 after the diet. The putative precursor of PAF, 1-O-alkyl--acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-alkyl--acyl-GPC) contained the bulk of eicosapentaenoate in PC subclasses with smaller quantities found in 1-acyl and 1-alk-1'-enyl linked species. Ionophore A23187-stimulated neutrophils produced similar quantities of PAF before and after enriched diet. Neutrophils during normal diet acylated 1-O-alkyl---GPC only with arachidonate whereas neutrophils from individuals on enriched diet transferred both arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate into exogenously-provided 1-O-alkyl---GPC. This allowed for the labeling of neutrophils with 1-O-[3H]-alkyl--arachidonoyl-GPC (before diet) as well as neutrophils with 1-O-[3H]-alkyl--eicosapentaenoyl-GPC and 1-O-[3H]-alkyl--arachidonoyl-GPC (after diet). Neutrophils after diet converted similar quantities of these labeled precursors to labeled PAF upon stimulation as those before the diet. Analysis of the nature of the long chain acyl residue remaining in the sn- position of 1-alkyl--acyl-GPC after cell stimulation indicated that arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate were both released from 1-O-alkyl--acyl-GPC at comparable rates. Finally, in vitro supplementation of murine mast cells (PT-) with arachidonic acid or EPA caused a marked increase in the amount of PAF produced by the cell without having any effect on histamine release. Data from these experiments suggest that EPA is incorporated into a PAF precursor pool. However, this appears not to inhibit PAF production because phospholipase A2 can use eicosapentaenoate- as well as arachidonate-containing phospholipids in the initial step of PAF biosynthesis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/638160>Phospholipid-deacylating enzymes of rat stomach mucosa.</a></h2><p>1. Rat stomach mucosa exhibited three distinguishable phospholipid-deacylating enzyme activities: lysophospholipase, phospholipase A1 and phospholipase A2. . The lysophospholipase hydrolyzed 1-palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine to free fatty acid and glycerophosphorylcholine. This enzyme had an optimum pH of 8.0, was heat labile, did not require Ca2+ for maximum activity and was not inhibited by bile salts or buffers of high ionic strength. 3. Phospholipase A2 and phospholipase A1 deacylated dipalmitoyl phophatidylcholine to the corresponding  compound and free fatty acid. The specific activity of phospholipase A2 was --4-fold higher than that of phospholipase A1 under all the conditions tested. Both activities were enhanced 4--7.5-fold in the presence of bile salts at alkaline pH and 11--fold at acidic pH. 4. In the absence of bile salts, phospholipase A1 exhibited pH optima at 6.5 and 9.5 and phospholipase A2 at pH 6.5, 8.0 and 9.5. The pH optima for phospholipase A1 were shifted to pH 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0 in presence of sodium taurocholate; the activity was detected only at a single pH of 9.5 in the presence of sodium deoxycholate and at pH 10.0 in the presence of sodium glycocholate. Phospholipase A2 optimum activity was displayed at pH 3.0, 6.0 and 8.0 in presence of taurocholage, pH 7.5 and 9.0, in presence of glycocholate and only at pH 9.0 in presence of deoxycholate. 5. Ca2+ was essential for optimum activity of phospholipases A1 and A2. But phospholipase A1 lost complete activity in presence of 0.5 mM ethyleneglycolbis-(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) at pH 6.0, whereas phospholipase A2 lost only 50%. 6. Phospholipases A1 and A2 retained about 50% of their activities by heating at 75 degrees for 10 min.

The novel aspects of this work reside in the fact that a TWIMS arrangement was used to obtain a high level structural information including location of fatty acyl substituents and double bonds for PCs in plasma, and the presence of alkali metal adduct ions such as [M\u2009+\u2009Li](+) was not required to obtain double bond positions. Elemental compositions for fragment ions were confirmed by accurate mass measurements. A very specific first generation fragment ion m/z 577 (M-phosphoryl choline) from the PC [16:0/:1 (9Z)] was produced, which by further CID generated acylium ions containing either the fatty acyl 16:0 (C(15)H(31)CO(+), m/z 239) or :1 (9Z) (C(17)H(33)CO(+), m/z 265) substituent.

It is characterized by myocardium ischemia as a result of nutrients depletion and hypoxia. The cell can respond to this injury by autophagy or apoptosis, which determines the evolution and possible recovery of the myocardium infarction. Lipids play an important role in cardiovascular disease. However reports stating lipidome variations in cardiovascular disease are scarce and the role that lipids play in this pathological condition is not completely understood. The aim of this work was to identify changes in lipid profile of a myoblast H9c2 cell line under starvation and ischemia, to better understand and recognize new biomarkers for myocardial infarction. Lipidomic profile was evaluated by HILIC-LC-MS and GC-MS. Cardiac cells showed alterations in  PC (34:1) and PC (36:), lysophosphatidylcholines  PC(16:0), lysoPC(:1) and lysoPC(:0), phosphatidylethanolamine PE (34:1), phosphatidylserine PS (36:1), phosphatidylinositol PI (36:), PI (38:3) and PI (38:5), sphingomyelin SM (34:1) and cardiolipins CL(68:4), CL(72:5) and CL(74:7) in ischemia and/or starvation, in comparison with control. Specific differences observed only in starvation were decrease of SM (34:1) and FA (20:4), and increase of PS (36:1). Differences observed only in ischemia were decrease of PC (36:),  PC (16:0) and FA (:1) and simultaneous increase of FA (16:0), and FA (:0). Interestingly, PC (34:1) increased in ischemia and decreased in starvation. In conclusion, our work suggests that lipids are potential markers for evaluation of cell fate, either cell death or recovery, which will be useful to improve diagnosis and prognostic of cardiovascular diseases.

Information on the molecular weight of the intact phospholipid species, the class to which it belongs, the molecular mass of the fatty acid substituents and their regioisomerism, is easily revealed by MS/MS. Throughout our investigations the R2COO- ions were more abundant than the R1COO- ions, and this observation is used for regioisomeric assignment of the two fatty acids. However, for phospholipid species containing an unsaturated fatty acid, information on the position of the double bond is not achieved in this way. By converting the olefinic sites to their 1,-dihydroxylated derivatives, information on the position of the hydroxyl groups (and hence of the double bond) is obtained by performing a second MS/MS experiment. Thus, a complete structural characterization of intact  and phosphatidylethanolamine species is obtained by performing these two MS/MS experiments. In order to ensure structural distinction of isobaric species, a number of phosphatidylethanolamine and  species were synthesized from - and analyzed by the present method.

To assess at which step the paf-acether biosynthetic pathway was impaired, the content in phospholipid paf-acether precursors was evaluated. The alkyl-acyl-glycerophosphocholine content was comparable in R-M phi (50.4 +/- .6 nmol/mg protein) and activated-M phi (40.0 +/- 6.5 to 63.9 +/- 7.7 nmol/mg protein), as well as the  paf-acether content (0.85 +/- 0. nmol/mg protein for R-M phi vs 0.63 +/- 0.16 to 1.23 +/- 0.21 nmol/mg protein for activated macrophages). The nonlimiting rate of the phospholipid substrate was strengthened by experiments showing that incubation of the various populations with  paf-acether did not yield increased amounts of paf-acether. Similarly, incubation of R-M phi or St-M phi with sodium acetate increased paf-acether production to the same extent in both populations, ruling out the acetate substrate deficiency as the cause of the impaired production. The level of acetyltransferase activity, the enzyme that transfers an acetate moiety of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) onto  paf-acether, was very low in thioglycolate (TG)-elicited M phi but high in R-M phi and activated ones. In all cases, it was increased by two to three times upon zymosan challenge. This suggested that increased paf-acether catabolism and not impaired anabolism could be responsible for the marked reduced formation noted in activated macrophages. The addition of acetyl-CoA (200 microM) to the various macrophage monolayers restored paf-acether formation by activated cells to R-M phi values but with delayed kinetics as compared with paf-acether formation induced by zymosan. The enhancing effect of acetyl-CoA on paf-acether production was inhibited upon oleyl-CoA addition, suggesting that acetyl-CoA may increase paf-acether production by preventing the reacylation of  paf-acether resulting from paf-acether degradation. In conclusion, the paf-acether output in some inflammatory macrophages may be regulated by the level of acetyltransferase activity, because it is observed in TG-M phi. However, we present the first evidence for another mechanism of regulation, most probably related to the deacylation/reacylation of paf-acether precursors and metabolites.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p></html>"><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599289>Altered triglyceride and phospholipid metabolism predates the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in obese pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with  and long-term health risks, is usually diagnosed at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. An understanding of lipid metabolism in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered lipid metabolism at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15- weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The lipid, sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and  (38:5). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:, 42:3), - (16:0, :1),  (35:, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:5, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant. We concluded that both lipid and triglyceride metabolism were altered at least 10 weeks before diagnosis of GDM.
