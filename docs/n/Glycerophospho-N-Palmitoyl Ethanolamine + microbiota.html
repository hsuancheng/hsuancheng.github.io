Stress has been identified as part of the factors causing an outbreak of infections in the aquaculture industry. The most studied neuroendocrine hormonal family from a microbial endocrinology perspective is the catecholamine comprising of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. It is of importance that catecholamine affects the growth and virulence of bacteria. The influence of stress on bacterial infections is attributed to the ability of catecholamines to suppress the immune system as the mode of action for increased bacterial growth. Catecholamines have increased the growth of bacteria, virulence-associated factors, adhesions, and biofilm formation and consequently influence the outcome of infections by these bacteria in many hosts. The siderophores and the ferric iron transport system plays a vital role in the mechanism by which catecholamines stimulates growth and exposure of genes to stress hormones enhances the expression of genes involved in bacterial virulence. In recent years, it has been discovered that intestinal microflora takes part in bidirectional communication between the gut and brain. The rapidly growing field of microbiome research, understanding the communities of bacteria living within our bodies and the genes they contain is yielding new perspectives. This review reveals catecholamines effects on the growth and virulence of bacteria and the latest trends in microbial endocrinology.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Our aim was to examine the prognostic value of systemic choline and betaine levels in stable cardiac patients.We examined the relationship between fasting plasma choline and betaine levels and risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE = death, myocardial infraction, stroke) in relation to TMAO over 3 years of follow-up in 3903 sequential stable subjects undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography. In our study cohort, median (IQR) TMAO, choline, and betaine levels were 3.7 (2.4-6.2)μM, 9.8 (7.9-12.2)μM, and 41.1 (32.5-52.1)μM, respectively. Modest but statistically significant correlations were noted between TMAO and choline (r = 0.33, P < 0.001) and less between TMAO and betaine (r = 0.09, P < 0.001). Higher plasma choline and betaine levels were associated with a 1.9-fold and 1.4-fold increased risk of MACE, respectively (Quartiles 4 vs. 1; P < 0.01, each). Following adjustments for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, elevated choline [1.34 (1.03-1.74), P < 0.05], and betaine levels [1.33 (1.03-1.73), P < 0.05] each predicted increased MACE risk. Neither choline nor betaine predicted MACE risk when TMAO was added to the adjustment model, and choline and betaine predicted future risk for MACE only when TMAO was elevated.Elevated plasma levels of choline and betaine are each associated with incident MACE risk independent of traditional risk factors. However, high choline and betaine levels are only associated with higher risk of future MACE with concomitant increase in TMAO.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26447960>Role of Gut  in Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Many lines of research have established a relationship between the gut microbiome and patients with liver disease. For example, patients with cirrhosis have increased bacteremia, increased blood levels of lipopolysaccharide, and increased intestinal permeability. Patients with cirrhosis have bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Selective intestinal decontamination with antibiotics is beneficial for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In experimental models of chronic liver injury with fibrosis, several toll-like receptors (TLR) are required to make mice sensitive to liver fibrosis. The presumed ligand for the TLRs are bacterial products derived from the gut microbiome, and TLR knockout mice are resistant to liver inflammation and fibrosis. We and others have characterized the association between preclinical models of liver disease in mice with the microbial diversity in their gut microbiome. In each model, including intragastric alcohol, bile duct ligation, chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), administration, and genetic obesity, there is a significant change in the gut microbiome from normal control mice. However, there is not a single clear bacterial strain or pattern that distinguish mice with liver injury from controlled mice. So how can the gut  affect liver disease? We can identify at least 6 changes that would result in liver injury, inflammation, and/or fibrosis. These include: (1) changes in caloric yield of diet; (2) regulation of gut permeability to release bacterial products; (3) modulation of choline metabolism; (4) production of endogenous ethanol; (5) regulation of bile acid metabolism; and (6) regulation in lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936548>Metagenomic analysis of colorectal cancer datasets identifies cross-cohort microbial diagnostic signatures and a link with choline degradation.</a></h2><p>Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30082863>Development of a gut microbe-targeted nonlethal therapeutic to inhibit thrombosis potential.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut -derived metabolite that enhances both platelet responsiveness and in vivo thrombosis potential in animal models, and TMAO plasma levels predict incident atherothrombotic event risks in human clinical studies. TMAO is formed by gut microbe-dependent metabolism of trimethylamine (TMA) moiety-containing nutrients, which are abundant in a Western diet. Here, using a mechanism-based inhibitor approach targeting a major microbial TMA-generating enzyme pair, CutC and CutD (CutC/D), we developed inhibitors that are potent, time-dependent, and irreversible and that do not affect commensal viability. In animal models, a single oral dose of a CutC/D inhibitor significantly reduced plasma TMAO levels for up to 3 d and rescued diet-induced enhanced platelet responsiveness and thrombus formation, without observable toxicity or increased bleeding risk. The inhibitor selectively accumulated within intestinal microbes to millimolar levels, a concentration over 1-million-fold higher than needed for a therapeutic effect. These studies reveal that mechanism-based inhibition of gut microbial TMA and TMAO production reduces thrombosis potential, a critical adverse complication in heart disease. They also offer a generalizable approach for the selective nonlethal targeting of gut microbial enzymes linked to host disease limiting systemic exposure of the inhibitor in the host.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24594574>[EHEC carriage in ruminants and probiotic effects].</a></h2><p>Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are Shiga-Toxin producing E. coli (STEC) that cause human outbreaks which can lead to a severe illness such as haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS), particularly in young children. The gastrointestinal tract of cattle and other ruminants is the principal reservoir of EHEC strains and outbreaks have been associated with direct contact with the farm environment, and with the consumption of meat, dairy products, water and fruit or vegetable contaminated with ruminant manure. Several outbreaks occurred these last years in France. In Brazil, although STEC carriage in ruminants is important, human cases due to EHEC are fairly rare. In order to reduce EHEC survival in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract and thus limit contamination of food products, it is necessary to determine the mechanisms underlying EHEC persistence in this ecosystem with the aim of developing nutritional or ecological strategies. The effect of probiotics has been tested in vitro on the growth and survival of EHEC strains and in vivo on the animal carriage of these strains. Various studies have then shown that lactic bacteria or non-pathogenic E. coli strains were able to limit EHEC fecal shedding. In addition, understanding EHEC physiology in the ruminant gut is also critical for limiting EHEC shedding. We found that EHEC O157:H7 is able to use  and mucus-derived sugars as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Thus, these substrates represent an ecological niche for EHEC and their utilization confers a competitive growth advantage to these pathogens as they use them more rapidly than the bacteria belonging to the resident intestinal . Understanding EHEC metabolism and ecology in the bovine intestinal tract will allow proposing probiotic strains to compete with EHEC for nutrients and thus decrease the sanitary risk.© Société de Biologie, 2014.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172946>Postprandial gut -driven choline metabolism links dietary cues to adipose tissue dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The human body is an integrated circuit between microbial symbionts and our Homo sapien genome, which communicate bi-directionally to maintain homeostasis within the human meta-organism. There is now strong evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disorders. In fact, gut microbes represent a filter of our greatest environmental exposure - the foods we consume. It is now clear that we each experience a given meal differently, based on our unique gut microbial communities. Biologically active gut microbe-derived metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), are now uniquely recognized as contributors to obesity and related cardiometabolic disorders. However, mechanistic insights into how microbe-derived metabolites promote obesity are largely unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that the meta-organismal production of the bacterial co-metabolite TMAO is linked to suppression of beiging of white adipose tissue in mice and humans. Furthermore, the TMAO pathway is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target in obesity-associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. In this commentary we discuss recent findings linking the TMAO pathway to obesity-associated disorders, and provide additional insights into potential mechanisms driving this microbe-host interaction.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771811>Biomarker Discovery and Utility in Necrotizing Enterocolitis.</a></h2><p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of prematurity, with no current method for early diagnosis.

Although natural resistance to polymyxins is rare, the discovery of a mobilized colistin resistance gene () in gut bacteria has raised significant concern. As an intramembrane enzyme, MCR-1 catalyzes the transfer of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) to the 1 (or 4')-phosphate group of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide, thereby conferring colistin resistance. However, the structural and biochemical mechanisms used by this integral membrane enzyme remain poorly understood. Here, we report the modeled structure of the full-length MCR-1 membrane protein. Together with molecular docking, our structural and functional dissection of the complex of MCR-1 with its phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) substrate suggested the presence of a 12 residue-containing cavity for substrate entry, which is critical for both enzymatic activity and its resultant phenotypic resistance to colistin. More importantly, two periplasm-facing helices (PH2 and PH2') of the trans-membrane domain were essential for MCR-1 activity.

The objective of this study was to observe intestinal  and susceptibility to Salmonella associated with stress hormones, cortisol (CORT), and norepinephrine (NE), in piglets. At weaning, 90 piglets (15 for a Salmonella challenge) were trained to take the carrier (apple juice) orally. At 2 wk after weaning, pens of piglets were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatments: control (CNT), NE, or CORT. Blood samples were collected prior to treatment, then piglets were dosed orally with treatments twice on day 0; at 0800 and 1600 h. Control piglets were administered 6.1 mL of the carrier only, NE pigs were administered 40 mg/mL of NE-bitartrate salt dissolved in the carrier, and CORT pigs were administered 12 mg/mL of hydrocortisone acetate dissolved in the carrier. Jugular blood samples were collected prior to necropsies (n = 5/treatment) at 0800 and 1600 h on day 1, and at 0800 h on days 2, 7, and 14 after treatments were started. A subset of pigs were subjected to a 24-h Salmonella challenge. Jejunal and ileal tissues and jejunal, ileal, cecal, and rectal contents were collected and colonies were counted. Microbial data and blood samples were analyzed using mixed models with fixed effects of treatment and day. Cortisol-treated piglets exhibited a spike in plasma CORT concentrations at 0800 h day 1 (P = 0.001) accompanied by greater concentrations of cecal Escherichia coli (P < 0.05) and a shift in intestinal environment to favor coliforms on day 2 (P < 0.05). Salmonella concentrations from rectal contents tended (P = 0.07) to be suppressed by CORT. Lactic acid-producing bacteria rectal concentrations were greater (P = 0.03) in CORT pigs on 0800 h on day 1 then NE pigs and tended to be greater than CNT (P = 0.09) and were greater on day 14 for both CNT (P = 0.003) and NE (P = 0.02). Norepinephrine spiked in NE piglets at 0800 h on day 1 (P = 0.001), 1600 h day 1 (P = 0.004), through day 2 (P = 0.04). Intestinal environment of NE pigs shifted to favor ileal anaerobes (P ≤ 0.05) and facultative anaerobes (E. coli; P = 0.01) compared to CNT. However, Salmonella concentrations in rectal contents were suppressed by NE compared to CNT (P = 0.05).

We investigated the relationship among intestinal -dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine, TMAO levels, and adverse cardiovascular events in humans.We quantified plasma and urinary levels of TMAO and plasma choline and betaine levels by means of liquid chromatography and online tandem mass spectrometry after a phosphatidylcholine challenge (ingestion of two hard-boiled eggs and deuterium [d9]-labeled phosphatidylcholine) in healthy participants before and after the suppression of intestinal  with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics. We further examined the relationship between fasting plasma levels of TMAO and incident major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) during 3 years of follow-up in 4007 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography.Time-dependent increases in levels of both TMAO and its d9 isotopologue, as well as other choline metabolites, were detected after the phosphatidylcholine challenge. Plasma levels of TMAO were markedly suppressed after the administration of antibiotics and then reappeared after withdrawal of antibiotics. Increased plasma levels of TMAO were associated with an increased risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (hazard ratio for highest vs. lowest TMAO quartile, 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.96 to 3.28; P<0.001).

Recent studies have revealed the metabolic pathways responsible for bacterial TMA production, primarily the anaerobic glycyl radical-containing, choline-TMA lyase, CutC and the aerobic carnitine monooxygenase, CntA. Identification of these enzymes has enabled bioinformatics approaches to screen both human-associated bacterial isolate genomes and whole gut metagenomes to determine which bacteria are responsible for TMA formation in the human gut.

Catecholamines (CA), candidate molecules for such communication, are presumed to play an important role in the gut lumen; however, available evidence is limited because of the lack of actual data about luminal CA. This study evaluated luminal CA levels in the gastrointestinal tract and elucidated the involvement of gut  in the generation of luminal CA by comparing the findings among specific pathogen-free mice (SPF-M), germ-free mice (GF-M), and gnotobiotic mice. Substantial levels of free dopamine and norepinephrine were identified in the gut lumen of SPF-M. The free CA levels in the gut lumen were lower in GF-M than in SPF-M. The majority of CA was a biologically active, free form in SPF-M, whereas it was a biologically inactive, conjugated form in GF-M. The association of GF-M with either Clostridium species or SPF fecal flora, both of which have abundant β-glucuronidase activity, resulted in the drastic elevation of free CA. The inoculation of E. coli strain into GF-M induced a substantial amount of free CA, but the inoculation of its mutant strain deficient in the β-glucuronidase gene did not. The intraluminal administration of DA increased colonic water absorption in an in vivo ligated loop model of SPF-M, thus suggesting that luminal DA plays a role as a proabsorptive modulator of water transport in the colon.

The main carbon, nitrogen and energy sources exploited by pathogens during proliferation in, and colonization of, the gut have, however, not been identified completely. In recent years, a huge body of literature has provided evidence that most enteropathogens are equipped with a large set of specific metabolic pathways to overcome nutritional limitations in vivo, thus increasing bacterial fitness during infection. These adaptations include the degradation of myo-inositol,  cleaved from phospholipids, fucose derived from mucosal glycoconjugates, 1,2-propanediol as the fermentation product of fucose or rhamnose and several other metabolites not accessible for commensal bacteria or present in competition-free microenvironments. Interestingly, the data reviewed here point to common metabolic strategies of enteric pathogens allowing the exploitation of nutrient sources that not only are present in the gut lumen, the mucosa or epithelial cells, but also are abundant in food. An increased knowledge of the metabolic strategies developed by enteropathogens is therefore a key factor to better control foodborne diseases.© 2014 The Authors.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19591827>Gut  affects lens and retinal lipid composition.</a></h2><p>The gut  affects host lipid metabolism and is considered an environmental factor that contributes to development of obesity.

We investigated whether changes in gut -dependent metabolite of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its nutrient precursors (choline and L-carnitine) were associated with improvements in glucose metabolism and diabetes-related amino acids in a weight-loss diet intervention.We included 504 overweight and obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of four energy-reduced diets varying in macronutrient intake. The 6-month changes (Δ) in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine levels after the intervention were calculated.Greater decreases in choline and L-carnitine were significantly (p<0.05) associated with greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and insulin resistance. We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with diabetes-related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving insulin sensitivity during a weight-loss intervention for obese patients.

Characterization of nutrients that promote the carriage of these pathogens by the ruminant would help to develop ecological strategies to reduce their survival in the bovine gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we show for the first time that free  (EA) constitutes a nitrogen source for the O157:H7 EHEC strain EDL933 in the bovine intestinal content because of induction of the eut ( utilization) gene cluster. In contrast, the eut gene cluster is absent in the genome of most species constituting the mammalian gut . Furthermore, the eutB gene (encoding a subunit of the enzyme that catalyses the release of ammonia from EA) is poorly expressed in non-pathogenic E. coli. Accordingly, EA is consumed by EHEC but is poorly metabolized by endogenous  of the bovine small intestine, including commensal E. coli. Interestingly, the capacity to utilize EA as a nitrogen source confers a growth advantage to E. coli O157:H7 when the bacteria enter the stationary growth phase.

Besides endogenous biosynthesis and direct choline supplement, choline esters in the diet are another source of choline in the body. Phenolic choline esters are a group of unique dietary choline esters rich in the seeds of Brassicaceae plants, among which sinapine is a choline ester of sinapic acid abundant in rapeseed. In this study, 40 nursery pigs were fed with rapeseed-derived feed ingredients (RSF) or soybean meal for 3 weeks (20 pigs/diet). The metabolic fate of sinapine-derived choline in RSF was examined by comparing the distribution of choline and its metabolites in digesta, liver, and serum samples by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The results showed that choline was released from extensive hydrolysis of sinapine in the small intestine. However, sinapine-derived choline did not increase the levels of choline and its major metabolites, including betaine, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine, in the liver and serum. Instead, RSF feeding increased trimethylamine (TMA), the microbial metabolite of choline, in the large intestine and further increased trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO), the oxidation metabolite of TMA, in the liver and serum. Overall, these results suggested that sinapine-derived choline from rapeseed feeding had limited influences on the post-absorption choline pool as a result of its low bioavailability but may serve as a major source of TMAO through microbial metabolism in nursery pigs. Improving the bioavailability of sinapine-derived choline might have the potential to modify the nutritional values and functionalities of rapeseed meal in swine feeding.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400167>Acidic pH promotes lipopolysaccharide modification and alters colonization in a bacteria-animal mutualism.</a></h2><p>Environmental pH can be an important cue for symbiotic bacteria as they colonize their eukaryotic hosts.

The baseline choline metabolite score was associated with a 2.21-fold higher risk of CVD across extreme quartiles (95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.59; <0.001 for trend) and a 2.27-fold higher risk of stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.16; <0.001 for trend). Participants in the higher quartiles of the score who were randomly assigned to the control group had a higher risk of CVD compared with participants in the lower quartile and assigned to the Mediterranean diet groups (=0.05 for interaction). No significant associations were observed for 1-year changes in individual plasma metabolites and CVD.A metabolite score combining plasma metabolites from the choline pathway was associated with an increased risk of CVD in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk.URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com.

Elevated TMAO plasma levels were associated with increased cardiovascular risk and other diseases. Also betaine and choline itself were recently associated with increased cardiovascular risk.A newly developed LC-HRMS method was applied to measure the plasma concentrations of TMAO, betaine and choline in a cohort of 339 patients undergoing coronary angiography for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease.Betaine concentrations in males were significantly higher than in females (42.0 vs. 35.9 μmol/L; p < 0.001). Plasma concentrations of TMAO but not of betaine or choline were higher in patients with diabetes compared to euglycemic patients (2.39 vs. 0.980 μmol/L; p = 0.001) as well as in patients with metabolic syndrome as compared to patients without metabolic syndrome (2.37 vs. 1.43 μmol/L; p = 0.002). Plasma concentrations of TMAO or choline increased significantly with decreasing renal function (Spearman's rho: -0.281; p < 0.001). However, plasma levels of TMAO or betaine were associated with neither a history of myocardial infarction nor the angiographically assessed presence of coronary heart disease, nor incident cardiovascular events during 8 years of follow-up. Plasma levels of choline were significantly lower in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction as compared to those without such history (10.0 vs. 10.8 μmol/L; p = 0.045).Plasma levels of TMAO are confounded by impaired kidney function and poor metabolic control but are not associated with the history, presence or incidence of symptoms or events of coronary heart disease.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To understand the mammalian systems responses to aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1) exposure, we analyzed the AFB1-induced metabonomic changes in multiple biological matrices (plasma, urine, and liver) of rats using (1)H NMR spectroscopy together with clinical biochemistry and histopathologic assessments. We found that AFB1 exposure caused significant elevation of glucose, amino acids, and choline metabolites (choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine) in plasma but reduction of plasma lipids. AFB1 also induced elevation of liver lipids, amino acids (tyrosine, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine), choline, and nucleic acid metabolites (inosine, adenosine, and uridine) together with reduction of hepatic glycogen and glucose. AFB1 further caused decreases in urinary TCA cycle intermediates (2-oxoglutarate and citrate) and elevation of gut  cometabolites (phenylacetylglycine and hippurate). These indicated that AFB1 exposure caused hepatic steatosis accompanied with widespread metabolic changes including lipid and cell membrane metabolisms, protein biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and gut  functions. This implied that AFB1 exposure probably caused oxidative-stress-mediated impairments of mitochondria functions. These findings provide an overview of biochemical consequences of AFB1 exposure and comprehensive insights into the metabolic aspects of AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27332910>A Gut Feeling about Thrombosis.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669507>Simultaneous targeted analysis of trimethylamine-N-oxide, choline, betaine, and carnitine by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is a metabolite generated from choline, betaine and carnitine in a gut -dependent way.

Dysbiosis of the gut  associated with increased intestinal permeability facilitates the passage of endotoxins and other microbial products, including indoxyl sulfate in the circulation. Although an emerging body of evidence has suggested that indoxyl sulfate is a key substance for the development of chronic kidney disease, few studies have investigated the direct association of indoxyl sulfate with vascular function. We hypothesized that indoxyl sulfate adversely affects vascular function. Aortas isolated from male Wistar rat were examined in the presence or absence of indoxyl sulfate to assess the vascular function, including vasorelaxation and vasocontraction. Indoxyl sulfate (vs. vehicle) (1) decreased vasorelaxation induced by acetylcholine (ACh) but not by sodium nitroprusside; (2) had no significant alterations of noradrenaline-induced vasocontraction in the absence and presence of endothelium; (3) decreased adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin)-induced vasorelaxation, while such a difference was eliminated by endothelial denudation; and (4) decreased vasorelaxations induced by calcium ionophore (A23187) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 agonist (GSK1016790A). The indoxyl sulfate-induced decrease in the vasorelaxations induced by ACh and A23187 increased by cell-permeant superoxide dismutase or by organic anion transporter inhibitor. However, apocynin, an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, had no effects on vasorelaxations induced by ACh, A23187, forskolin, and GSK1016790A in the presence of indoxyl sulfate. These results suggest that indoxyl sulfate directly affects the vascular function, particularly, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and this effect may be attributable to increased oxidative stress after cell transportion via organic anion transporter, and such increased oxidative stress may not be attributable to activation of NADPH oxidase activation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26187962>Small RNA Transcriptome of the Oral Microbiome during Periodontitis Progression.</a></h2><p>The oral microbiome is one of the most complex microbial communities in the human body, and due to circumstances not completely understood, the healthy microbial community becomes dysbiotic, giving rise to periodontitis, a polymicrobial inflammatory disease. We previously reported the results of community-wide gene expression changes in the oral microbiome during periodontitis progression and identified signatures associated with increasing severity of the disease. Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) are key players in posttranscriptional regulation, especially in fast-changing environments such as the oral cavity. Here, we expanded our analysis to the study of the sRNA metatranscriptome during periodontitis progression on the same samples for which mRNA expression changes were analyzed. We observed differential expression of 12,097 sRNAs, identifying a total of 20 Rfam sRNA families as being overrepresented in progression and 23 at baseline. Gene ontology activities regulated by the differentially expressed (DE) sRNAs included amino acid metabolism,  catabolism, signal recognition particle-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, intron splicing, carbohydrate metabolism, control of plasmid copy number, and response to stress. In integrating patterns of expression of protein coding transcripts and sRNAs, we found that functional activities of genes that correlated positively with profiles of expression of DE sRNAs were involved in pathogenesis, proteolysis, ferrous iron transport, and oligopeptide transport. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the community-wide sRNA transcriptome of the oral microbiome during periodontitis progression and show that sRNAs are key regulatory elements of the dysbiotic process leading to disease.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Upon ingestion, aspartame is hydrolyzed in gut and provides its metabolite; such as essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phy) (50%), aspartic acid (40%), and methanol (10%). Altered brain neurochemical compositions [such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT)] have long been a concern and being involved in observed neurophysiological symptom (such as headaches, memory loss, mood changes, as well as depression) in aspartame consumers. Aspartames might act as chemical stressor through increasing plasma cortisol level. Aspartame consumption similarly altered gut . Taken together all this factors, we reviewed to search for convincing evidence, in what manner aspartame metabolites, stress hormones (cortisol), and gut dysbiosisis involved in altering brain neurochemical composition. We concluded that aspartame metabolite; mainly Phy and its interaction with neurotransmitter and aspartic acid by acting as excitatory neurotransmitter causes this pattern of impairments. Along with elevated cortisol and gut dysbiosis via interactions with different biogenic amine may also have additional impact to modulate neuronal signaling lead to neurobiological impairments. Hence ongoing research is instantly needed to understand the specific roles of aspartame metabolite, elevated cortisol, and gut dysbiosis with emerging neurophysiological symptom in aspartame consumers to improve healthy life in its consumers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Approach and Results- Here, we investigated the interaction between the gut  and diet on atherosclerosis by feeding germ-free or conventionally raised Apoe mice chow or Western diet alone or supplemented with choline (which is metabolized by the gut  and host enzymes to trimethylamine N-oxide) for 12 weeks. We observed smaller aortic lesions and lower plasma cholesterol levels in conventionally raised mice compared with germ-free mice on a chow diet; these differences were not observed in mice on a Western diet. Choline supplementation increased plasma trimethylamine N-oxide levels in conventionally raised mice but not in germ-free mice. However, this treatment did not affect the size of aortic lesions or plasma cholesterol levels. Gut  composition was analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. As expected, the global community structure and relative abundance of many taxa differed between mice fed chow or a Western diet. Choline supplementation had minor effects on the community structure although the relative abundance of some taxa belonging to Clostridiales was altered. Conclusions- In conclusion, the impact of the gut  on atherosclerosis is dietary dependent and is associated with plasma cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the  was required for trimethylamine N-oxide production from dietary choline, but this process could not be linked to increased atherosclerosis in this model.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25565500>Plaque burden in HIV-infected patients is associated with serum intestinal -generated trimethylamine.</a></h2><p>Some intestinal -generated metabolites of phosphatidylcholine are recognized to be proatherogenic. As the HIV population is vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and can develop intestinal dysbiosis associated with systemic inflammation, we investigated the novel relationship between -derived metabolites of phosphatidylcholine and coronary atherosclerosis in HIV.One hundred and fifty-five HIV-infected and 67 non-HIV-infected individuals without known history of cardiovascular disease were previously recruited to assess coronary plaque by computed tomography angiography. In the current study, we evaluate whether serum choline, trimethylamine (TMA), or trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels are associated with plaque features.Young, asymptomatic HIV-infected patients (age 47 ± 7 years) demonstrated significantly higher prevalence of plaque (53 vs. 35%, P = 0.01) and number of total plaque segments (1.8 ± 2.5 vs. 1.2 ± 2.2, P = 0.03) when compared with well matched noninfected individuals with similar comorbidities. TMA was significantly associated with calcium score (r = 0.22, P = 0.006), number of total (r = 0.20, P = 0.02) and calcified (r = 0.18, P = 0.03) plaque segments, and calcium plaque volume (r = 0.19, P = 0.02) and mass (r = 0.22, P = 0.009) in the HIV cohort only. In multivariate modeling among HIV-infected patients, TMA remained significantly associated with calcium score (P = 0.008), number of total (P = 0.005) and calcified (P = 0.02) plaque segments, and calcium plaque volume (P = 0.01) and mass (P = 0.007), independent of Framingham risk score. In contrast, there was no association of TMAO to coronary plaque features in either cohort.A link between TMA and atherosclerosis has not previously been established.

It has recently been found that the human β-defensin-2 can enhance the pathogenic potential of P. fluorescens. In this study, we evaluated the effect of other intestinal molecules (5HT, SP and Epi) on growth and virulence of the clinical strain P. fluorescens MFN1032. We found that P. fluorescens MFN1032 growth was not mainly affected by these factors, but several modifications in the virulence behavior of this bacterium were observed. 5HT, SP and Epi were able to modulate the motility of P. fluorescens MFN1032. 5HT and SP had an effect on pyoverdin production and IL-8 secretion, respectively. Infection of Caco-2/TC7 cells with P. fluorescens MFN1032 pretreated by SP or Epi enhanced the permeability of the monolayers and led to a partial delocalization of F-actin to the cytoplasm. These findings show that some intestinal molecules can modulate the pathogenic potential of P. fluorescens MFN1032.

Trigonelline from the plant Trigonella foenum-graecum has been reported for the treatment of CVD. Aim of the present study was to check the effect of trigonelline on the gut  based conversion of TMA to TMAO. Trigonelline was isolated from hydroalcoholic extract of seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum. The isolated trigonelline was characterized through TLC and UPLC-MS. Anaerobic microbe responsible for the metabolism of choline to TMA was isolated by culturing the human gut  in choline enriched medium. The isolated bacteria was identified at molecular level based on PCR amplification of 1500bp of 16S rRNA gene sequence. Isolated FMO was used for ex vivo conversion of TMA to TMAO. Further, we investigated the effect of trigonelline in isolated gut microbe based metabolism of choline, lipid profile and TMAO levels in mice with or without suppression of gut  with antibiotics. Liquid-liquid purification and chromatographic analysis confirmed the trigonelline purity (87.26%) and which was also confirmed by mass spectroscopy with m/z 137.4 in positive ionization mode. A total of 30 anaerobic microbes responsible for TMA production were isolated and Citrobacter freundii was the superior among others for the production of TMA. In vitro culture of C. freundii in choline enriched medium supplemented with trigonelline resulted in significantly reduction TMA and followed by TMAO production. In ex vivo, a maximum of 85.3% TMAO production was reduced by trigonelline at concentration of about 300 μg/mL. Serum level of lipids and TMAO were significantly altered in choline fed animals with or without suppression of gut  and this phenomenon was reversed upon the oral administration of trigonelline in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrates the effect of trigonelline on gut  responsible for choline metabolism and this can be used as a model for evaluation of herbal drugs and its effect in gut  prompted cardiovascular disorders.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

An alternative pathway of TMAO formation from carnitine is via the -dependent intermediate γ-butyrobetaine (γBB). Elevated TMAO levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but little is known about TMAO in obesity. Given the proposed contribution of  alterations in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of obesity, lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its -dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not  dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk.

This was an age- and sex-matched case-control study of 2694 participants: 1346 newly diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes and 1348 controls.

(1)H NMR spectroscopic profiling was used to characterize the effect of nutritional intervention on the stability of the metabolic phenotype of 7 individuals following a controlled 7 day dietary protocol. Inter-individual metabolic differences influenced proportionally more of the spectrum than dietary modulation, with certain individuals displaying a greater stability of metabolic phenotypes than others. Correlation structures between urinary metabolites were identified and used to map inter-individual pathway differences. Choline degradation was the pathway most affected by the individual, suggesting that the gut  influence host metabolic phenotypes. This influence was further emphasized by the highly correlated excretion of the microbial-mammalian co-metabolites phenylacetylglutamine, 4-cresylsulfate (r = 0.87), and indoxylsulfate (r = 0.67) across all individuals.

This finding suggests a link between the gut  and atherosclerosis. The potential impact of TMAO in chronic heart failure (HF) is unknown. We hypothesized that TMAO levels would provide prognostic information about adverse outcomes in chronic HF.Prospective, observational study including 155 consecutive patients with chronic HF. In addition, 100 patients with stable CAD without HF and 33 matched healthy individuals were included as controls. Plasma levels of TMAO and its precursors choline and betaine were measured, and associations with symptoms, aetiology and transplant-free survival in the patients with HF were explored.Plasma levels of TMAO (P = 0.01), choline (P < 0.001) and betaine (P < 0.001) were elevated in patients with chronic HF compared to control subjects, with the highest levels in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes III and IV. Furthermore, TMAO levels were highest in individuals with ischaemic HF, followed by those with stable CAD and nonischaemic HF. TMAO, but not choline or betaine, was associated with reduced transplant-free survival: approximately 50% of patients in the upper tertile of TMAO levels died or received a heart transplant during 5.2 years of follow-up (unadjusted Cox-regression: hazard ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.28-3.92, P = 0.005).TMAO levels were elevated in patients with HF and associated with NYHA class, ischaemic aetiology and adverse outcomes.

We investigated the relationship between serum concentrations of TMAO and its biomarker precursors (choline, carnitine, and betaine) and incident colorectal cancer risk in a nested case-control study of male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. We measured biomarker concentrations in baseline fasting serum samples from 644 incident colorectal cancer cases and 644 controls using LC/MS-MS. Logistic regression models estimated the ORs and 95% confidence interval (CI) for colorectal cancer by quartile (Q) of serum TMAO, choline, carnitine, and betaine concentrations. Men with higher serum choline at ATBC baseline had approximately 3-fold greater risk of developing colorectal cancer over the ensuing (median ± IQR) 14 ± 10 years (in fully adjusted models, Q4 vs. Q1, OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.24-4.61;  < 0.0001). The prognostic value of serum choline for prediction of incident colorectal cancer was similarly robust for proximal, distal, and rectal colon cancers (all  < 0.0001). The association between serum TMAO, carnitine, or betaine and colorectal cancer risk was not statistically significant ( = 0.25, 0.71, and 0.61, respectively). Higher serum choline concentration (but not TMAO, carnitine, or betaine) was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Serum choline levels showed strong prognostic value for prediction of incident colorectal cancer risk across all anatomical subsites, suggesting a role of altered choline metabolism in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268905>Discovering radical-dependent enzymes in the human gut .</a></h2><p>Human gut microbes have a tremendous impact on human health, in part due to their unique chemical capabilities.

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of commensal  on the host behaviors in a contamination-free environment, which was verified by culture-based methods.Open-field and marble-burying tests were used to analyze anxiety-like behaviors and locomotor activity in gnotobiotic BALB/c mice with a common genetic background in a sterile isolator. The monoamine levels in several regions of the brain were measured in germfree (GF) mice and commensal fecal -associated mice (EX-GF).A 24-h exposure to the environment outside the sterile isolators rendered GF mice less anxious than those not contaminated, while there was no change in the locomotion. EX-GF mice, the gnotobiotic mice with normal specific pathogen-free , were less anxious and active than GF mice using open-field and marble-burying tests. The norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin turnover rates were higher in the EX-GF mice than in the GF mice in most regions of the brain, suggesting that monoaminergic neurotransmission might increase in the EX-GF mice comparing the GF mice. Monoassociation with Brautia coccoides reduced the anxiety level, but it did not affect the locomotor activity. In contrast, colonization with Bifidobacterium infantis decreased the locomotor activity, while having little effect on the anxiety level.These results strongly support the current view that gut microorganisms modulate brain development and behavior.© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27768865>Cutting Choline with Radical Scissors.</a></h2><p>The human gut microbiome is the source of not only microbial diversity, but also of interesting chemical reactions and enzymology.

Recently, the gut  has emerged as a potential factor in the development of MS, with a number of studies having shown that patients with MS exhibit gut dysbiosis. The gut  helps the host remain healthy by regulating various functions, including food metabolism, energy homeostasis, maintenance of the intestinal barrier, inhibition of colonization by pathogenic organisms, and shaping of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Alteration of the gut , and subsequent changes in its metabolic network that perturb this homeostasis, may lead to intestinal and systemic disorders such as MS.

RNA sequencing analysis of  isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10 mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the  utilization () locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of  genes, deletion of  utilization (Δ) had no impact on  colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10 mice. However, replacement of the  wild type bacteria by a Δ mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10 mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of   utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand  gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type  cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10 mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms  gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in  monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of  genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking  enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that   metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen  toward a protective function.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687352>Non-lethal Inhibition of Gut Microbial Trimethylamine Production for the Treatment of Atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine (TMA) N-oxide (TMAO), a gut--dependent metabolite, both enhances atherosclerosis in animal models and is associated with cardiovascular risks in clinical studies. Here, we investigate the impact of targeted inhibition of the first step in TMAO generation, commensal microbial TMA production, on diet-induced atherosclerosis. A structural analog of choline, 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB), is shown to non-lethally inhibit TMA formation from cultured microbes, to inhibit distinct microbial TMA lyases, and to both inhibit TMA production from physiologic polymicrobial cultures (e.g., intestinal contents, human feces) and reduce TMAO levels in mice fed a high-choline or L-carnitine diet. DMB inhibited choline diet-enhanced endogenous macrophage foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion development in apolipoprotein e(-/-) mice without alterations in circulating cholesterol levels. The present studies suggest that targeting gut microbial production of TMA specifically and non-lethal microbial inhibitors in general may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal  of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice. Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a -dependent mechanism. The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status. Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incident major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death), but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels. Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but this did not occur if intestinal  was concurrently suppressed. In mice with an intact intestinal , dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport.

We hypothesized that a short-term, high-fat diet would increase fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of TMAO in response to a high-fat meal challenge. Following a 2-week eucaloric control diet, 10 nonobese men (18-30 years) consumed a eucaloric, high-fat diet (55% fat) for 5 days. Plasma TMAO was measured after a 12-hour fast and each hour after for 4 hours following a high-fat meal (63% fat) at baseline and after the high-fat diet using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. Fasting plasma TMAO did not increase significantly following the high-fat diet (1.83 ± 0.21 vs 1.6 ± 0.24 μmol/L). However, plasma TMAO was higher at hour 1 (2.15 ± 0.28 vs 1.7 ± 0.30 μmol/L), hour 2 (2.3 ± 0.29 vs 1.8 ± 0.32 μmol/L), hour 3 (2.4 ± 0.34 vs 1.58 ± 0.19 μmol/L), and hour 4 (2.51 ± 0.33 vs 1.5 ± 0.12 μmol/L) (all P < .05) following the high-fat diet as compared with the baseline postprandial response. In conclusion, a short-term, high-fat diet does not increase fasting plasma TMAO concentrations but appears to increase postprandial TMAO concentrations in healthy, nonobese, young men.

Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man's life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder.

The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro biotransformation of choline and carnitine using faecal starters obtained from omnivorous and vegetarian subjects and the effect of (poly)phenol-rich foods on TMA production. Choline and l-carnitine were fermented with vegetarian or omnivorous faecal slurries, alone or in combination with 10 (poly)phenol-rich food items. TMA production from carnitine, but not from choline, was significantly lower when vegetarian faecal starters were used and, among the tested food items, blonde orange juice significantly reduced TMA formation during faecal biotransformation. Consequently, the main compounds of orange juice, namely phenolic compounds, terpenes, limonoids, organic acids and sugars, were tested individually. Sugars exerted the highest inhibitory effect on TMA production. Despite some limitations deriving from the applied in vitro model, this is the first work describing a possible role of some (poly)phenol-rich dietary products on the modulation of TMA colonic production. Free sugars were the main factor responsible for TMA inhibition, suggesting a potential beneficial role of colonic fermentation of carbohydrates in reducing TMA formation from its precursor molecules.

However, the contributions of gestational and early life influences on development of NAFLD and NASH remain poorly appreciated.Two independent studies were performed to examine whether maternal over-nutrition via exposure to high fat diet (HFD) leads to exacerbated hepatic responses to post-natal HFD and methionine choline deficient (MCD) diets in the offspring. Offspring of both control diet- and HFD-fed dams were weaned onto control and HFD, creating four groups.When compared to their control diet-fed littermates, offspring of HF-dams weaned onto HFD gained greater body weight; had increased relative liver weight and showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Similarly, this group revealed significantly greater immune response and pro-fibrogenic gene expression via RNA-seq. In parallel, 7-8 week old offspring were challenged with either control or MCD diets for 3 weeks. Responses to MCD diets were also exacerbated due to maternal HFD as seen by gene expression of classical pro-fibrogenic genes.

Anaerobic microbial choline metabolism, a disease-associated metabolic pathway, exemplifies this challenge, as the specific human gut microorganisms responsible for this transformation have not yet been clearly identified. In this study, we established the link between a bacterial gene cluster, the choline utilization (cut) cluster, and anaerobic choline metabolism in human gut isolates by combining transcriptional, biochemical, bioinformatic, and cultivation-based approaches. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis and in vitro biochemical characterization of two cut gene products linked the entire cluster to growth on choline and supported a model for this pathway. Analyses of sequenced bacterial genomes revealed that the cut cluster is present in many human gut bacteria, is predictive of choline utilization in sequenced isolates, and is widely but discontinuously distributed across multiple bacterial phyla. Given that bacterial phylogeny is a poor marker for choline utilization, we were prompted to develop a degenerate PCR-based method for detecting the key functional gene choline TMA-lyase (cutC) in genomic and metagenomic DNA. Using this tool, we found that new choline-metabolizing gut isolates universally possessed cutC. We also demonstrated that this gene is widespread in stool metagenomic data sets. Overall, this work represents a crucial step toward understanding anaerobic choline metabolism in the human gut  and underscores the importance of examining this microbial community from a function-oriented perspective.Anaerobic choline utilization is a bacterial metabolic activity that occurs in the human gut and is linked to multiple diseases. While bacterial genes responsible for choline fermentation (the cut gene cluster) have been recently identified, there has been no characterization of these genes in human gut isolates and microbial communities. In this work, we use multiple approaches to demonstrate that the pathway encoded by the cut genes is present and functional in a diverse range of human gut bacteria and is also widespread in stool metagenomes. We also developed a PCR-based strategy to detect a key functional gene (cutC) involved in this pathway and applied it to characterize newly isolated choline-utilizing strains. Both our analyses of the cut gene cluster and this molecular tool will aid efforts to further understand the role of choline metabolism in the human gut  and its link to disease.Copyright © 2015 Martínez-del Campo et al.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26235933>Trimethylamine N-Oxide From Gut  in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: Focus on Diet.</a></h2><p>Low-protein diet is the recommended nutritional intervention for nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients because excess protein intake can damage kidney function and produce uremic toxins.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases worldwide; however, whether GM dysbiosis participates in the development of HF remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the specific changes in GM composition and function in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced HF in rats.The rats were divided into C (control), 4w-HF (ISO, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, intraperitoneally), and 2w-HF (ISO, 2.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, intraperitoneally) groups. The cardiac structure and function in rats were assessed, and metagenomic analyses were then performed. Compared with the healthy control group, we found that the Shannon diversity index and microbial gene count in the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups was drastically decreased. High-throughput sequencing showed that the three groups differed in intestinal bacterial community composition. Overgrowth of bacteria, such as Prevotella, was observed in the 4w-HF group, with reduced growth of bacteria, such as Roseburia, Lactobacillus, and Butyrivibrio, associated with healthy status compared with the C group on the genus level. Concomitant with the alteration of GM composition, underrepresentation of health-linked microbial function was observed in both the 4w-HF and 2w-HF groups compared with the C group.Iso-induced HF rats showed a significant decrease in the diversity and richness of the intestinal microbiome, with a downregulation of the key intestinal bacterial groups and overgrowth of bacteria considered to be involved in inflammatory responses as well as a decrease in health-linked microbial function.

In order to reveal the metabolic relationship between host and microbiome, we monitored recovery of the gut  composition and fecal profiles of mice after gentamicin and/or ceftriaxone treatments. This was performed by employing (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprint of gut . The common features of fecal metabolites postantibiotic treatment include decreased levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), amino acids and primary bile acids and increased oligosaccharides, d-pinitol, choline and secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid). This suggests suppressed bacterial fermentation, protein degradation and enhanced gut microbial modification of bile acids. Barnesiella, Prevotella, and Alistipes levels were shown to decrease as a result of the antibiotic treatment, whereas levels of Bacteroides, Enterococcus and Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis, and Mycoplasma increased after gentamicin and ceftriaxone treatment. In addition, there was a strong correlation between fecal profiles and levels of Bacteroides, Barnesiella, Alistipes and Prevotella. The integration of metabonomics and gut  profiling provides important information on the changes of gut  and their impact on fecal profiles during the recovery after antibiotic treatment. The correlation between gut  and fecal metabolites provides important information on the function of bacteria, which in turn could be important in optimizing therapeutic strategies, and developing potential -based disease preventions and therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20576921>Protective effects of Lactobacillus paracasei F19 in a rat model of oxidative and metabolic hepatic injury.</a></h2><p>The liver is susceptible to such oxidative and metabolic stresses as ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) and fatty acid accumulation. Probiotics are viable microorganisms that restore the gut  and exert a beneficial effect on the liver by inhibiting bacterial enzymes, stimulating immunity, and protecting intestinal permeability. We evaluated Lactobacillus paracasei F19 (LP-F19), for its potential protective effect, in an experimental model of I/R (30 min ischemia and 60 min reperfusion) in rats fed a standard diet or a steatogen [methionine/choline-deficient (MCD)] diet. Both groups consisted of 7 sham-operated rats, 10 rats that underwent I/R, and 10 that underwent I/R plus 8 wk of probiotic dietary supplementation. In rats fed a standard diet, I/R induced a decrease in sinusoid perfusion (P < 0.001), severe liver inflammation, and necrosis besides an increase of tissue levels of malondialdehyde (P < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1beta (P < 0.001), and IL-6 (P < 0.001) and of serum levels of transaminase (P < 0.001) and lipopolysaccharides (P < 0.001) vs. sham-operated rats. I/R also induced a decrease in Bacterioides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus spps (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) and an increase in Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) on intestinal mucosa. The severity of liver and gut  alterations induced by I/R was even greater in rats with liver inflammation and steatosis, i.e., MCD-fed animals. LP-F19 supplementation significantly reduced the harmful effects of I/R on the liver and on gut  in both groups of rats, although the effect was slightly less in MCD-fed animals. In conclusion, LP-F19 supplementation, by restoring gut , attenuated I/R-related liver injury, particularly in the absence of steatosis.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28346928>Diet and Gut  in Health and Disease.</a></h2><p>Gut  plays an important role in host health maintenance and disease pathogenesis. The development of a stable and diverse gut  is essential to various host physiologic functions such as immunoregulation, pathogen prevention, energy harvest, and metabolism. At the same time, a dysbiotic gut  associated with disease is altered in structure and function, and often characterized by a decrease in species richness and proliferation of pathogenic bacterial taxa. As a shared substrate between the host and the gut , diet significantly impacts the health and disease states of the host both directly and through gut microbial metabolite production. This is demonstrated in the examples of short-chain fatty acid and trimethylamine production via bacterial metabolism of dietary complex carbohydrates and choline, respectively. In disorders related to mucosal immune dysregulation such as inflammatory bowel disease, the dysbiotic gut  and diet contribute to its pathogenesis. Reversal of dysbiosis through fecal  transplantation and dietary interventions may thus represent important strategies to modify the gut  and its metabolite production for health maintenance as well as disease prevention and management.© 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

Findings regarding its etiology obtained using high-throughput sequencing technique suggested that dysbiosis holds a conserved metabolic signature as an emergent property. The purpose of this study was to identify robust biomarkers for periodontal inflammation severity. Furthermore, we investigated disease-associated metabolic signatures of periodontal  using a salivary metabolomics approach. Whole saliva samples were obtained from adult subjects before and after removal of supragingival plaque (debridement). Periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) was employed as an indicator of periodontal inflammatory status. Based on multivariate analyses using pre-debridement salivary metabolomics data, we found that metabolites associated with higher PISA included cadaverine and hydrocinnamate, while uric acid and  were associated with lower PISA. Next, we focused on dental plaque metabolic byproducts by selecting salivary metabolites significantly decreased following debridement. Metabolite set enrichment analysis revealed that polyamine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, butyric acid metabolism, and lysine degradation were distinctive metabolic signatures of dental plaque in the high PISA group, which may be related to the metabolic signatures of disease-associated communities.

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of TMAO and its dietary precursors, choline and betaine, in heart failure (HF).In 112 patients with chronic systolic HF with comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation, we measured plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine by mass spectrometry. Median (interquartile range) TMAO levels, choline, and betaine levels were 5.8 (3.6-12.1) μmol/L, 10.9 (8.4-14.0) μmol/L, and 43.8 (37.1-53.0) μmol/L, respectively, and were correlated with each other (all P < .0001 for both). TMAO levels were significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (9.4 [4.9-13.2] vs 4.8 [3.4-9.8] μmol/L; P = .005) and in subjects with New York Heart Association functional class III or greater (7.0 [4.7-14.8] vs 4.7 [3.4-11.3] μmol/L; P = .02). Elevated TMAO, choline, and betaine levels were each associated with higher plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels and more advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, but not systolic dysfunction or inflammatory and endothelial biomarkers. Higher choline (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.22-2.20; P = .001), betaine (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10-2.08; P = .01), and TMAO (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.10-1.96; P = .01) predicted increased risk for 5-year adverse clinical events (death/transplantation). Only higher TMAO levels predicted incident adverse clinical events independently from age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, mitral E/septal Ea, and NT-proBNP levels (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03-2.14; P = .03).Elevated plasma TMAO, choline, and betaine levels are each associated with more advanced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and portend poorer long-term adverse clinical outcomes in chronic systolic HF.

Stable-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry analyses of an independent validation cohort (N = 2,140) confirmed TML levels are independently associated with incident (3-year) major adverse cardiovascular event risks (hazards ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4) and incident (5-year) mortality risk (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0-4.2). Genome-wide association studies identified several suggestive loci for TML levels, but none reached genome-wide significance; and d9(trimethyl)-TML isotope tracer studies confirmed TML can serve as a nutrient precursor for gut -dependent generation of trimethylamine (TMA) and the atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Although TML was shown to be abundant in both plant- and animal-derived foods, mouse and human fecal cultures (omnivores and vegans) showed slow conversion of TML to TMA. Furthermore, unlike chronic dietary choline, TML supplementation in mice failed to elevate plasma TMAO or heighten thrombosis potential in vivo. Thus, TML is identified as a strong predictor of incident CVD risks in subjects and to serve as a dietary precursor for gut -dependent generation of TMAO; however, TML does not appear to be a major microbial source for TMAO generation in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28469156>Impaired renal function and dysbiosis of gut  contribute to increased trimethylamine-N-oxide in chronic kidney disease patients.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut  aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the -gut-brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of probiotics can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the -gut-brain axis.

There is emerging evidence that bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain affects behaviours including anxiety, cognition, nociception and social interaction. Coordinated locomotor behaviour is critical for the survival and propagation of animals, and is regulated by internal and external sensory inputs. However, little is known about how the gut microbiome influences host locomotion, or the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Here we report that germ-free status or antibiotic treatment results in hyperactive locomotor behaviour in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Increased walking speed and daily activity in the absence of a gut microbiome are rescued by mono-colonization with specific bacteria, including the fly commensal Lactobacillus brevis. The bacterial enzyme xylose isomerase from L. brevis recapitulates the locomotor effects of microbial colonization by modulating sugar metabolism in flies. Notably, thermogenetic activation of octopaminergic neurons or exogenous administration of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, abrogates the effects of xylose isomerase on Drosophila locomotion.

Interestingly, functional and inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases are often reported as a comorbidity in ASDs, indicating gut-brain axis as a novel emerging approach. Recently, a central role for peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α has been addressed in neurological functions, associated with the behaviour. Among endogenous lipids, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a PPAR-α agonist, has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory effects both at central and peripheral level. Based on this background, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological effects of PEA on autistic-like behaviour of BTBR T+tf/J mice and to shed light on the contributing mechanisms. Our results showed that PEA reverted the altered behavioural phenotype of BTBR mice, and this effect was contingent to PPAR-α activation. Moreover, PEA was able to restore hippocampal BDNF signalling pathway, and improve mitochondrial dysfunction, both pathological aspects, known to be consistently associated with ASDs. Furthermore, PEA reduced the overall inflammatory state of BTBR mice, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines at hippocampal, serum, and colonic level. The analysis of gut permeability and the expression of colonic tight junctions showed a reduction of leaky gut in PEA-treated BTBR mice. This finding together with PEA effect on gut  composition suggests an involvement of -gut-brain axis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated a therapeutic potential of PEA in limiting ASD symptoms, through its pleiotropic mechanism of action, supporting neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory effects, and the modulation of gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric  composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer's Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and , this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system diseases. A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut  through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut , is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain,  and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21429726>Comparison of serum metabolite compositions between obese and lean growing pigs using an NMR-based metabonomic approach.</a></h2><p>Childhood obesity has become a prevalent risk to health of children and teenagers. To develop biomarkers in serum for altered lipid metabolism, genetically obese (Ningxiang strain) and lean (Duroc×Landrace×Large Yorkshire strain) growing pigs were used as models to identify potential differences in the serum metabonome between the two strains of pigs after consuming the same diet for 46 days. At the end of the study, pigs were euthanized for analysis of the serum metabonome and determination of body composition. Obese pigs had higher fat mass (42.3±8.8% vs. 21.9±4.5%) and lower muscle mass (35.4±4.5% vs. 58.9±2.5%) than lean pigs (P<.01). Serum concentrations of insulin and glucagon were higher (P<.02) in obese than in lean pigs. With the use of an NMR-based metabonomic technology, orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis showed that serum HDL, VLDL, lipids, unsaturated lipids, glycoprotein, myo-inositol, pyruvate, threonine, tyrosine and creatine were higher in obese than in lean pigs (P<.05), while serum glucose and urea were lower in obese pigs (P<.05). In addition, changes in gut -related metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide and choline, were observed in sera of obese pigs relatively to lean pigs (P<.05). These novel findings indicate that obese pigs have distinct metabolism, including lipogenesis, lipid oxidation, energy utilization and partition, protein and amino acid metabolism, and fermentation of gastrointestinal microbes, compared with lean pigs. The obese Ningxiang pig may be a useful model for childhood obesity research.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To elucidate the roles of metabolic profiles in the status of GAgP, this study aimed to identify the differential metabolic profiles between patients with GAgP and healthy controls using an untargeted metabolomic profiling method.Serum and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from healthy controls (n = 20) and patients with GAgP (n = 20) in this cross-sectional study. The relative levels of biomarkers in the samples were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Principal components analysis and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis were used for statistical analysis. Metabolites were analysed qualitatively using the FiehnLib and NIST databases. Full-mouth probing depth and clinical attachment loss were recorded as indexes of periodontal disease.A total of 349 metabolites were qualitatively detected in the gingival crevicular fluid samples, and 200 metabolites were detected in the serum samples. Compared with healthy controls, patients with GAgP showed significant increases in serum urea and allo-inositol levels. In contrast, glutathione, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, adipic acid and 2-deoxyguanosine levels were decreased in patients with GAgP. In the gingival crevicular fluid samples, noradrenaline, uridine, α-tocopherol, dehydroascorbic acid, xanthine, galactose, glucose-1-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate levels were increased in patients with GAgP, while thymidine, glutathione and ribose-5-phosphate levels were decreased.The metabolomics analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is an effective and minimally non-invasive way to differentiate the metabolites characteristic of patients with GAgP. Both serum and gingival crevicular fluid metabolomics are significantly different between patients with GAgP and healthy controls. These metabolic profiles have great potential in detecting GAgP and helping to understand its underlying mechanisms.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. Hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD.Paediatric patients with IBD undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. Blood inflammatory markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. The serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.Serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD patients were different from healthy controls and categorized Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [UC] patients into separate groups. In serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in Crohn's disease; in UC also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. In faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in UC in contrast to low or intermediate levels in Crohn's disease. There was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline].Characterization of inflammatory pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding disease pathogenesis of paediatric IBD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Here, we assessed the impact of gut microbial choline metabolism on bacterial fitness and host biology by engineering a microbial community that lacks a single choline-utilizing enzyme. Our results indicate that choline-utilizing bacteria compete with the host for this nutrient, significantly impacting plasma and hepatic levels of methyl-donor metabolites and recapitulating biochemical signatures of choline deficiency. Mice harboring high levels of choline-consuming bacteria showed increased susceptibility to metabolic disease in the context of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, bacterially induced reduction of methyl-donor availability influenced global DNA methylation patterns in both adult mice and their offspring and engendered behavioral alterations. Our results reveal an underappreciated effect of bacterial choline metabolism on host metabolism, epigenetics, and behavior.

This gastrointestinal pathogen not only faces the hostile defenses of the host's immune system, but also faces fierce competition from the large and diverse community of  for space and nutrients. Salmonella have solved these challenges ingeniously. To jump-start growth, Salmonella steal hydrogen produced by the gastrointestinal . Type 3 effector proteins are subsequently secreted by Salmonella to trigger potent inflammatory responses, which generate the alternative terminal electron acceptors tetrathionate and nitrate. Salmonella exclusively utilize these electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration, permitting metabolic access to abundant substrates such as  to power growth blooms. Chemotaxis and flagella-mediated motility enable the identification of nutritionally beneficial niches. The resulting growth blooms also promote horizontal gene transfer amongst the resident microbes. Within the gastrointestinal tract there are opportunities for chemical signaling between host cells, the , and Salmonella. Host produced catecholamines and bacterial autoinducers form components of this chemical dialogue leading to dynamic interactions. Thus, Salmonella have developed remarkable strategies to initially shield against host defenses and to transiently compete against the intestinal  leading to successful infections.

However, the determinants of TMAO in humans require additional assessment.We examined cardiometabolic risk factors and pathways associated with TMAO concentrations in humans.A total of 283 individuals (mean ± SD age: 66.7 ± 9.0 y) were included in this observational study. Plasma concentrations of trimethylamine, TMAO, choline, lipids, phospholipids, and methyl metabolites were measured.Study participants were divided into 4 groups by median concentrations of TMAO and choline (4.36 and 9.7 μmol/L, respectively). Compared with the group with TMAO and choline concentrations that were less than the median (n = 82), the group with TMAO and choline concentrations that were at least the median (n = 83) was older and had lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, phospholipids, and methylation potential, higher creatinine, betaine, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and higher percentages of men and subjects with diabetes. The difference in plasma TMAO concentrations between men and women (7.3 ± 10.0 compared with 5.4 ± 5.6 μmol/L, respectively) was NS after adjustment for age and creatinine (P = 0.455). The TMAO:trimethylamine ratio was higher in men (P < 0.001). Diabetes was associated with significantly higher plasma TMAO concentration (8.6 ± 12.2 compared with 5.4 ± 5.2 μmol/L) even after adjustments. Sex and diabetes showed an interactive effect on trimethylamine concentrations (P = 0.010) but not on TMAO concentrations (P = 0.950). Positive determinants of TMAO in a stepwise regression model that applied to the whole group were SAH, trimethylamine, choline, and female sex, whereas plasma phosphatidylcholine was a negative determinant.High TMAO and choline concentrations are associated with an advanced cardiometabolic risk profile. Diabetes is related to higher plasma TMAO concentrations but also to alterations in interrelated pathways such as lipids, phospholipids, and methylation.

Sustained CH is catastrophic, resulting in cardiac dysfunction that eventually leads to heart failure (HF). Baoyuan decoction (BYD) is a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for supplementing and reinforcing Qi, clinically used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the therapeutic effects of BYD on CH remain unidentified. We herein investigated the effect of BYD on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced CH in rats and the underlying mechanisms by comprehensive pharmacodynamics and H NMR-based dynamic metabolomics analysis of the plasma and urine samples. Results showed that BYD treatment markedly attenuated ISO-induced CH as evidenced by decreasing the left ventricular wall thickness, pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, myocardial collagen fiber deposition and apoptosis, and plasma natriuretic peptide levels. Multivariate trajectory analysis revealed that the BYD treatment could restore the CH-disturbed plasma and urinary metabolite profiles towards the normal metabolic status featuring with a time-dependent tendency. Moreover, the key metabolic alterations in CH rats at different BYD-treated time stages involved energy metabolism, oxidative stress responses, amino acid metabolism, and gut  metabolism. Of particularly, the significant roles of BYD for treating CH lie in the improvement of cardiac energy generation and antioxidant capacity. Our investigation provides a holistic view of BYD for therapeutic intervention of CH through monitoring of the dynamic metabolic changes and the results indicate that BYD may be applied as a potential agent for treating CH.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which upon absorption by the host is converted in the liver to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Recent studies revealed that TMAO exacerbates atherosclerosis in mice and positively correlates with the severity of this disease in humans. However, which microbes contribute to TMA production in the human gut, the extent to which host factors (e.g., genotype) and diet affect TMA production and colonization of these microbes, and the effects TMA-producing microbes have on the bioavailability of dietary choline remain largely unknown. We screened a collection of 79 sequenced human intestinal isolates encompassing the major phyla found in the human gut and identified nine strains capable of producing TMA from choline in vitro. Gnotobiotic mouse studies showed that TMAO accumulates in the serum of animals colonized with TMA-producing species, but not in the serum of animals colonized with intestinal isolates that do not generate TMA from choline in vitro. Remarkably, low levels of colonization by TMA-producing bacteria significantly reduced choline levels available to the host. This effect was more pronounced as the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria increased. Our findings provide a framework for designing strategies aimed at changing the representation or activity of TMA-producing bacteria in the human gut and suggest that the TMA-producing status of the gut  should be considered when making recommendations about choline intake requirements for humans.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and increased trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels have been causally linked with CVD development. This work identifies members of the human gut  responsible for both the accumulation of trimethylamine (TMA), the precursor of the proatherogenic compound TMAO, and subsequent decreased choline bioavailability to the host.

These review also discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of diet on the gut-liver axis.The available literature has proposed mechanisms for an association between gut  and NASH, such as: modification energy homeostasis, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxemia, increased endogenous production of ethanol, and alteration in the metabolism of bile acid and choline. There is evidence to suggest that NASH patients have a higher prevalence of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and changes in the composition of the gut . However, there is still a controversy regarding the microbiome profile in this population. The abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum may be increased, decreased, or unaltered in NASH patients.

It remains unknown whether TMAO is associated with the risk of first stroke. We aimed to determine the association between serum TMAO levels and first stroke in hypertensive patients without major cardiovascular diseases and examine any possible effect modifiers. Methods- We used a nested case-control design, using data from the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial), including 622 patients with first stroke and 622 matched controls. The study was conducted from May 2008 to August 2013. The primary outcome was a first stroke. Results- After adjusting for choline, L-carnitine, and other important covariates, including baseline systolic blood pressure and time-averaged systolic blood pressure, during the treatment period, the risk of first stroke increased with each increment of TMAO level (per natural log [TMAO] increment: odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.46). Consistently, compared with participants in the lowest tertile (<1.79 μmol/L) of serum TMAO levels, a significantly higher risk of first stroke was found in those in higher TMAO tertiles (≥1.79 μmol/L; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.00-1.81) or in TMAO tertile 3 (≥3.19 μmol/L; odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-2.01). In the exploratory analysis, we observed an interaction between TMAO and folate levels (≥7.7 [median] versus <7.7 ng/mL) on first stroke ( P for interaction, 0.030). Conclusions- Higher TMAO levels were associated with increased risk of first stroke in hypertensive patients. Our finding, if further confirmed, calls for a carefully designed clinical trial to further evaluate the role of higher TMAO levels on outcomes in hypertensive patients.

The delayed gastric emptying of the WKY phenotype suggests this rat strain may be useful as a model for gastroparesis. This study reveals that the stress-prone Wistar-Kyoto rat strain has a baseline physiology of gastroparesis and rapid small intestine transit, together with metabolic changes consistent with lipid metabolism-associated dysbiosis, compared with nonstress-prone rats. This suggests that the Wistar-Kyoto rat strain may be an appropriate animal model for gastroparesis.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29463652> Utilization in Bacteria.</a></h2><p> (EA) is a valuable source of carbon and/or nitrogen for bacteria capable of its catabolism.

It has been shown in both human and animal studies that choline deficiencies contribute to diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and various neurodegenerative diseases. An adequate supply of dietary choline is important for optimum development, highlighted by the increased maternal requirements during fetal development and in breast-fed infants. We discuss recent studies investigating variants in PEMT and MTHFR1 that are associated with a variety of birth defects. In addition to genetic interactions, we discuss several recent studies that uncover changes in fetal global methylation patterns in response to maternal dietary choline intake that result in changes in gene expression in the offspring. In contrast to the developmental role of adequate choline, there is now an appreciation of the role choline has in cardiovascular disease through the gut -mediated metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide. This pathway highlights some of our understanding of how the microbiome affects nutrient processing and bioavailability. Finally, to better characterize the genetic architecture regulating choline requirements, we discuss recent results focused on identifying polymorphisms that regulate choline and its derivative products.Here we discuss recent studies that have advanced our understanding of how specific alleles in key choline metabolism genes are related to dietary choline requirements and human disease.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258058>Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli outwits hosts through sensing small molecules.</a></h2><p>Small molecules help intestinal pathogens navigate the complex human gastrointestinal tract to exploit favorable microhabitats.

Gut-liver communication and  composition have been identified as critical drivers of the NAFLD progression. Hence, it has been shown that  depletion can ameliorate high-fat diet or western-diet induced experimental Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, its functional implications in the methionine-choline dietary model, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the physiological relevance of gut  in methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet induced NASH. Experimental liver disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal  depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut  diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut  composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human NASH, nor did it augment the intestinal barrier integrity or intestinal inflammation. In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to  proficient control mice.

TMAO is formed from trimethylamine (TMA)-precursors such as choline via the combined action of the gut  and liver. We conducted a Mediterranean diet intervention that increased intakes of fiber and changed intakes of many other foods containing fat to increase the relative amount of mono-unsaturated fats in the diet. The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases and might counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of increased TMAO formation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the Mediterranean diet would reduce TMAO concentrations. Fasting TMAO concentrations were measured before and after six-months of dietary intervention in 115 healthy people at increased risk for colon cancer. No significant changes in plasma TMAO or in the ratios of TMAO to precursor compounds were found in either the Mediterranean group or the comparison group that followed a Healthy Eating diet. TMAO concentrations exhibited positive correlations with age and markers of metabolic health. TMAO concentrations were not associated with circulating cytokines, but the relative abundance of Akkermansia mucinophilia in colon biopsies was modestly and inversely correlated with baseline TMAO, choline, and betaine serum concentrations. These results suggest that broad dietary pattern intervention over six months may not be sufficient for reducing TMAO concentrations in an otherwise healthy population.

This concept is often referred to as the "fetal origins hypothesis" or "developmental origins of health and disease". Since its first proposal, epigenetics has emerged as an underlying mechanism explaining how environmental cues become gestationally "encoded". Many of the enzymes that impart and maintain epigenetic modifications are highly sensitive to nutrient availability, which can be influenced by the metabolic activities of the intestinal . Therefore, the maternal microbiome has the potential to influence epigenetics in utero and modulate offspring's long-term health trajectories. Here we summarize the current understanding of the interactions that occur between the maternal gut microbiome and the essential nutrient choline, that is not only required for fetal development and epigenetic regulation but is also a growth substrate for some microbes. Bacteria able to metabolize choline benefit from the presence of this nutrient and compete with the host for its access, which under extreme conditions may elicit signatures of choline deficiency. Another consequence of bacterial choline metabolism is the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Finally, we discuss how these different facets of microbial choline metabolism may influence infant development and health trajectories via epigenetic mechanisms and more broadly place a call to action to better understand how maternal microbial metabolism can shape their offspring's propensity to chronic disease development later in life.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24675659>Comparative genome-wide association studies in mice and humans for trimethylamine N-oxide, a proatherogenic metabolite of choline and L-carnitine.</a></h2><p>Elevated levels of plasma trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the product of gut microbiome and hepatic-mediated metabolism of dietary choline and L-carnitine, have recently been identified as a novel risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis in mice and humans. The goal of this study was to identify the genetic factors associated with plasma TMAO levels.We used comparative genome-wide association study approaches to discover loci for plasma TMAO levels in mice and humans. A genome-wide association study in the hybrid mouse diversity panel identified a locus for TMAO levels on chromosome 3 (P=2.37 × 10(-6)) that colocalized with a highly significant (P=1.07 × 10(-20)) cis-expression quantitative trait locus for solute carrier family 30 member 7. This zinc transporter could thus represent 1 positional candidate gene responsible for the association signal at this locus in mice. A genome-wide association study for plasma TMAO levels in 1973 humans identified 2 loci with suggestive evidence of association (P=3.0 × 10(-7)) on chromosomes 1q23.3 and 2p12. However, genotyping of the lead variants at these loci in 1892 additional subjects failed to replicate their association with plasma TMAO levels.The results of these limited observational studies indicate that, at least in humans, genes play a marginal role in determining TMAO levels and that any genetic effects are relatively weak and complex.

In Leishmania parasites, PC synthesis can occur via the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway, the N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or the remodeling of exogenous phospholipids. To investigate the role of de novo PC synthesis in Leishmania major, we focused on the cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase (CPCT) which catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline, a key intermediate in the choline branch of the Kennedy pathway.

To understand the systems responses to localized inflammation, we analyzed the dynamic metabolic changes in rat plasma and urine associated with the carrageenan-induced self-limiting pleurisy using NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with multivariate data analysis. Fatty acids in plasma were also analyzed using GC-FID/MS with the data from clinical chemistry and histopathology as complementary information. We found that in the acute phase of inflammation rats with pleurisy had significantly lower levels in serum albumin, fatty acids, and lipoproteins but higher globulin level and larger quantity of pleural exudate than controls. The carrageenan-induced inflammation was accompanied by significant metabolic alterations involving TCA cycle, glycolysis, biosyntheses of acute phase proteins, and metabolisms of amino acids, fatty acids, ketone bodies, and choline in acute phase. The resolution process of pleurisy was heterogeneous, and two subgroups were observed for the inflammatory rats at day-6 post treatment with different metabolic features together with the quantity of pleural exudate and weights of thymus and spleen. The metabolic differences between these subgroups were reflected in the levels of albumin and acute-phase proteins, the degree of returning to normality for multiple metabolic pathways including glycolysis, TCA cycle, gut  functions, and metabolisms of lipids, choline and vitamin B3. These findings provided some essential details for the dynamic metabolic changes associated with the carrageenan-induced self-limiting inflammation and demonstrated the combined NMR and GC-FID/MS analysis as a powerful approach for understanding biochemical aspects of inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271725>The contributory role of gut  in cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Our group recently discovered that certain dietary nutrients possessing a trimethylamine (TMA) moiety, namely choline/phosphatidylcholine and L-carnitine, participate in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease. A meta-organismal pathway was elucidated involving gut -dependent formation of TMA and host hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3-dependent (FMO3-dependent) formation of TMA-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite shown to be both mechanistically linked to atherosclerosis and whose levels are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks.

(EA) is a major component of mammalian and bacterial membranes and is used by pathogens as a carbon and/or nitrogen source in the gastrointestinal tract. The deadly human pathogen enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC) uses EA in the intestine as a nitrogen source as a competitive advantage for colonization over the microbial flora. Here we show that EA is not only important for nitrogen metabolism but that it is also used as a signaling molecule in cell-to-cell signaling to activate virulence gene expression in EHEC. EA in concentrations that cannot promote growth as a nitrogen source can activate expression of EHEC's repertoire of virulence genes. The EutR transcription factor, known to be the receptor of EA, is only partially responsible for this regulation, suggesting that yet another EA receptor exists. This important link of EA with metabolism, cell-to-cell signaling, and pathogenesis, highlights the fact that a fundamental means of communication within microbial communities relies on energy production and processing of metabolites. Here we show for the first time that bacterial pathogens not only exploit EA as a metabolite but also coopt EA as a signaling molecule to recognize the gastrointestinal environment and promote virulence expression.In order to successfully cause disease, a pathogen must be able to sense a host environment and modulate expression of its virulence genes as well as compete with the indigenous  for nutrients.  (EA) is present in the large intestine due to the turnover of intestinal cells. Here, we show that the human pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7, which causes bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, regulates virulence gene expression through EA metabolism and by responding to EA as a signal. These findings provide the first information directly linking EA with bacterial pathogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28510800>Structural modulation of gut  in Bama minipigs in response to treatment with a "growth-promoting agent", salbutamol.</a></h2><p>Even though salbutamol (SAL) had remarkable effects on the enhancement of growth rate and carcass composition in different livestock species such as cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry, it was banned as a growth promoter because of its adverse effects on health. However, the specific mechanism by which salbutamol enhances growth efficiency remains unknown. In this study, Bama pigs were randomly allocated to receive salbutamol (5 mg/kg) for 30 or 60 days and were compared with untreated pigs. Pigs treated with salbutamol demonstrated enhanced growth rates and carcass composition; however, they showed deterioration in blood biochemical indices and organ development. We hypothesized that salbutamol exerts its effects by modulating the composition of the gut  population. The faecal microbiome of pigs was characterized via pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The gut  population analysis showed that salbutamol caused shifts in the microbial composition of less abundant species. Redundancy analysis indicated an increase in abundance of the phylum Bacteroidetes, class Betaproteobacteria, family Christensenellaceae and genus Lactobacillus, and a decreased ratio of the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia and genera Ruminococcus, Blautia and Subdoligranulum. In conclusion, our study provided circumstantial evidence that the various effects of salbutamol are caused by gut  modulation, and several potential candidates were identified for SAL detection via the gut . Our findings provided new insights into the roles of the gut  during salbutamol treatment, and these findings will aid in the screening of alternative strategies for animal health improvement and production enhancement.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30455469>Gut bacterial phospholipase Ds support disease-associated metabolism by generating choline.</a></h2><p>The essential nutrient choline is metabolized by gut bacteria to the disease-associated metabolite trimethylamine (TMA). However, most of the choline obtained via the diet and present in the human body is incorporated into larger metabolites, including the lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC). Here, we report that many choline-utilizing gut microorganisms can hydrolyse PC using a phospholipase D (PLD) enzyme and further convert the released choline to TMA. Genetic and in vitro characterization of the PLD from Escherichia coli MS 200-1 showed this enzyme is essential for bacterial hydrolysis of PC and prefers this substrate. PLDs are also found in gut bacterial isolates that are unable to convert choline to TMA, suggesting that additional members of the gut  may influence access to this substrate. Unexpectedly, this PLD is only distantly related to characterized PLDs from pathogenic bacteria, suggesting a distinct evolutionary history. Together, these results reveal a previously underappreciated role for gut microorganisms in phospholipid metabolism and a potential target for inhibiting TMA production.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279284> Influences Human Commensal Escherichia coli Growth, Gene Expression, and Competition with Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7.</a></h2><p>A core principle of bacterial pathogenesis is that pathogens preferentially utilize metabolites that commensal bacteria do not in order to sidestep nutritional competition.

A conditionally essential nutrient is a compound usually produced in adequate amounts by endogenous synthesis but that is exogenously required under certain circumstances. Thus, arginine, glutamine, cysteine, glycine, carnitine, choline, and polyamines are conditionally essential compounds. In addition, dietary nucleotides are considered semi-essential since some rapidly growing tissues such as the gut, bone marrow, and lymphocytes, preferentially use preformed purine and pyrimidine bases for nucleic acid synthesis. This review discusses the study of conditionally essential nitrogenous nutrients of interest in clinical nutrition.

However, the possible interactive role of gut  and brain function in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia has not been studied yet.To explore this, we collected fecal samples and performed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans in 81 high risk (HR) subjects, 19 ultra-high risk (UHR) subjects and 69 health controls (HC).

The composition changes of gut  indicate the increased production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), which could activate microglia and then disrupt membrane metabolism. Furthermore, this was confirmed by an increase of choline levels, a brain imaging marker of membrane dysfunction, which is also significantly elevated in UHR subjects compared to the HR and HC groups.Both gut microbiome and imaging studies of UHR subjects suggest the membrane dysfunction in the brain and hence might support the membrane hypothesis of schizophrenia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

We aimed to comprehensively examine how changes induced by a weight-loss diet intervention in gut -related metabolites, such as trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline and l-carnitine), were associated with improvements in adiposity and regional fat deposition.This study included 510 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient intake. We examined associations of 6-month changes in blood metabolites (TMAO, choline, and l-carnitine) with improvements in body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), body fat composition, fat distribution, and resting energy expenditure (REE).Individuals with a greater reduction of choline ( < 0.0001) and l-carnitine ( < 0.01) rather than TMAO showed significant losses of BW and WC at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly predictive of decreases in body fat composition, fat distribution, and REE. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the baseline diabetes risk status, such as the presence of hyperglycemia (31% of the total participants) and fasting glucose levels, did not modify the associations. Early changes in choline and l-carnitine were significantly predictive of weight loss over 2 years ( < 0.05 for all). Individuals with increases in choline or l-carnitine were 2.35-times (95% CI 1.38, 4.00) or 1.77-times (1.06, 2.95) more likely to fail to lose weight (-5% or more loss) at 2 years.Overweight and obese individuals who showed decreases in circulating choline or l-carnitine levels achieved greater improvements of adiposity and energy metabolism by eating a low-calorie weight-loss diet, suggesting that such metabolites are predictive of individuals' response to the treatment. Further investigations are necessary to confirm our findings, particularly in a population with prediabetes that is more representative of the U.S. population with obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25550161>Transmission of atherosclerosis susceptibility with gut microbial transplantation.</a></h2><p>Recent studies indicate both clinical and mechanistic links between atherosclerotic heart disease and intestinal microbial metabolism of certain dietary nutrients producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Here we test the hypothesis that gut microbial transplantation can transmit choline diet-induced TMAO production and atherosclerosis susceptibility. First, a strong association was noted between atherosclerotic plaque and plasma TMAO levels in a mouse diversity panel (n = 22 strains, r = 0.38; p = 0.0001). An atherosclerosis-prone and high TMAO-producing strain, C57BL/6J, and an atherosclerosis-resistant and low TMAO-producing strain, NZW/LacJ, were selected as donors for cecal microbial transplantation into apolipoprotein e null mice in which resident intestinal microbes were first suppressed with antibiotics. Trimethylamine (TMA) and TMAO levels were initially higher in recipients on choline diet that received cecal microbes from C57BL/6J inbred mice; however, durability of choline diet-dependent differences in TMA/TMAO levels was not maintained to the end of the study. Mice receiving C57BL/6J cecal microbes demonstrated choline diet-dependent enhancement in atherosclerotic plaque burden as compared with recipients of NZW/LacJ microbes. Microbial DNA analyses in feces and cecum revealed transplantation of donor microbial community features into recipients with differences in taxa proportions between donor strains that were transmissible to recipients and that tended to show coincident proportions with TMAO levels. Proportions of specific taxa were also identified that correlated with plasma TMAO levels in donors and recipients and with atherosclerotic lesion area in recipients. Atherosclerosis susceptibility may be transmitted via transplantation of gut . Gut microbes may thus represent a novel therapeutic target for modulating atherosclerosis susceptibility.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: microbiota</p></html>
