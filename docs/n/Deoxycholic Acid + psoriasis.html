According to the literature, arachidonic  is released from phospholipid by phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) and is a precursor of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, leucotrienes, and thromboxanes, which are potent inflammatory mediators. PLA(2) activity has been reported to be significantly raised in the serum and skin tissue of patients with . UDCA has been reported to suppress the increased activity of group IIA PLA(2), a secretory low-molecular-weight PLA(2) (PLA(2)IIA), in HepG2 cells (a human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line) and in gallbladder and gallbladder bile samples from patients with cholesterol stones. Thus, UCDA may improve the skin lesions of patients with  by suppressing PLA(2)IIA activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28040823>Update on new drugs in dermatology.</a></h2><p>Medications in dermatology are used in a variety of different methods and dosages and for numerous different diseases entities that are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, there are medications that have only recently hit the market that require our attention, as they are either FDA approved for the intended dermatologic use or could be effective in treating conditions that previously have been poorly managed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29085206>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Evolving paradigms.</a></h2><p>In the last years new evidence has accumulated on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) challenging the paradigms that had been holding the scene over the previous 30 years. NAFLD has such an epidemic prevalence as to make it impossible to screen general population looking for NAFLD cases. Conversely, focusing on those cohorts of individuals exposed to the highest risk of NAFLD could be a more rational approach. NAFLD, which can be diagnosed with either non-invasive strategies or through liver biopsy, is a pathogenically complex and clinically heterogeneous disease. The existence of metabolic as opposed to genetic-associated disease, notably including "lean NAFLD" has recently been recognized. Moreover, NAFLD is a systemic condition, featuring metabolic, cardiovascular and (hepatic/extra-hepatic) cancer risk. Among the clinico-laboratory features of NAFLD we discuss hyperuricemia, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, gallstones,  and selected endocrine derangements. NAFLD is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome and progressive liver disease develops in T2D patients in whom the course of disease is worsened by NAFLD. Finally, lifestyle changes and drug treatment options to be implemented in the individual patient are also critically discussed. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the new concepts on clinical and pathogenic heterogeneity of NAFLD, a systemic disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis and protean clinical manifestations. It is highly prevalent in certain cohorts of individuals who are thus potentially amenable to selective screening strategies, intensive follow-up schedules for early identification of liver-related and extrahepatic complications and in whom earlier and more aggressive treatment schedules should be carried out whenever possible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21274875>Combination of retinoic  and ursodeoxycholic  attenuates liver injury in bile duct-ligated rats and human hepatic cells.</a></h2><p>Cholestasis leads to liver cell death, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure. Despite limited benefits, ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for cholestatic disorders. Retinoic  (RA) is a ligand for nuclear receptors that modulate bile salt homeostasis. RA also possesses immunomodulatory effects and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia and inflammatory disorders such as , acne, and rheumatoid arthritis. To test whether the supplementation of RA with UDCA is superior to UDCA alone for treating cholestasis, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent common bile duct ligation (BDL) for 14 days and were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), UDCA, all-trans retinoic  (atRA), or UDCA and atRA by gavage. Treatment with UDCA and atRA substantially improved animal growth rates, significantly reduced liver fibrosis and bile duct proliferation, and nearly eliminated liver necrosis after BDL. Reductions in the bile salt pool size and liver hydroxyproline content were also seen with treatment with atRA or atRA and UDCA versus PBS and UDCA. Furthermore, atRA and UDCA significantly reduced liver messenger RNA and/or protein expression of transforming growth factor β1 (Tgf-β1), collagen 1a1 (Col1A1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), cytokeratin 19, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), cytochrome P450 7A1 (Cyp7a1), tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-β1. The molecular mechanisms of this treatment were also assessed in human hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and LX-2 cells. atRA alone or in combination with UDCA greatly repressed CYP7A1 expression in human hepatocytes and significantly inhibited COL1A1, MMP2, and α-SMA expression and/or activity in primary human hepatic stellate cells and LX-2 cells. Furthermore, atRA reduced TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation in LX-2 cells.Our findings indicate that the addition of RA to UDCA reduces the bile salt pool size and liver fibrosis and might be an effective supplemental therapy with UDCA for cholestatic diseases.Copyright © 2010 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29488482>[Optimization of therapy for hepatobiliary disorders in psoriatic patients].</a></h2><p>To optimize management tactics in patients with diseases of the liver and gallbladder in the presence of progressive .The investigation enrolled 78 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and different forms of gallbladder abnormality in the presence of progressive moderate and severe . The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 1) phosphogliv; 2) ursosan with the main active ingredient ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA). A prospective follow-up study accompanied by dynamic clinical, laboratory, and instrumental monitoring was carried out for 24 weeks. Clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound studies, including liver elastography, were applied.The use of UDCA (Ursosan 15 mg/kg for 24 weeks) to treat NAFLD and gallbladder abnormality in methotrexate-treated patients with progressive moderate and severe  contributed to the normalization of hepatic steatosis index, lipid composition, and lithogenic index, to the reduction of biliary sludge, and to the stabilization of liver fibrosis. Improvement in the functional status of the liver and gallbladder has contributed to the achievement of a more complete remission of dermatosis.The effects of UDCA in the therapy of NAFLD and gallbladder abnormality in patients with progressive  were greater than those of phosphogliv.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23157607>Non-IBD immunological diseases are a risk factor for reduced survival in PSC.</a></h2><p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease. It is known to be associated with immunological diseases (IDs), such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).We evaluated the presence of IDs besides IBD and AIH in a cohort of PSC patients, and its association with clinical outcome.This is a prospective cohort study of 195 PSC patients that were evaluated over the period 1987-2010 in our tertiary care centre. The presence of ID was determined using a retrospective chart review. IDs were subclassified into autoimmune disease (AID) and immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), according to current guidelines.Twenty-seven of 195 (13.8%) PSC patients had at least one additional ID other than IBD (70%) or AIH (5%). The most frequent AIDs were autoimmune thyroiditis (2.6%) and diabetes mellitus type 1 (2.1%). The most frequent IMIDs were  (3.6%) and sarcoidosis (2.1%). After more than 20 years of follow-up, concomitant IDs represent an independent risk factor for reduced transplantation-free survival in patients with PSC (mean: 8.9 years vs. 16.3 years, P = 0.012). Further subgroup analysis revealed a significantly reduced survival especially in patients with concomitant IMID (P = 0.017).Patients with concomitant IDs, especially IMID, are a clinically important subgroup of PSC patients. This significant phenotype warrants further genetic and immunological studies.© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14705825>Combined treatment with ursodeoxycholic  and pioglitazone in a patient with  associated with type 2 diabetes and psoriasis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9747660>Taurin-conjugated ursodeoxycholic  has a reversible inhibitory effect on human keratinocyte growth.</a></h2><p>Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDC) is one of the most hydrophilic taurin conjugated bile acids. TUDC has a suppressive effect on DNA synthesis in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the growth inhibitory effect of TUDC on cultured human keratinocytes. TUDC suppressed the proliferation of keratinocytes in a dose dependent fashion, as measured by both cell counts and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake. Keratinocytes reproliferated and reached almost the same cell number as control after removal of TUDC from the medium. TUDC (1 mM) had no effect on the cell viability, as measured by the dye exclusion test. Epidermal sheets stratified in the presence of TUDC appeared thinner than those stratified without TUDC. These results suggest that TUDC has a reversible growth suppressive effect on human keratinocytes through the mechanism other than cytotoxicity and would be applicable for the treatment of hyperproliferative skin disorders such as psoriasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25747115>The overlap syndrome between primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.</a></h2><p>The overlap syndrome between primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis is an extremely rare condition that has been reported in only six published cases so far.Here we report two cases showing the clinical manifestations of both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.In one case the overlap condition was associated with psoriatric arthritis, and the patient successfully underwent dual treatment with ursodeoxycholic  and the anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha agent adalimumab. In the second case, the predominant condition was, initially, an antimitochondrial antibody-negative primary biliary cirrhosis with progressive course towards end-stage liver disease; the patient then developed either antimitochondrial antibody positivity or changes in the biliary tree compatible with primary sclerosing cholangitis.These two cases add information on a controversial issue in the literature, and indicate the importance of recognizing a possible overlap syndrome to optimize treatment.Copyright © 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.
