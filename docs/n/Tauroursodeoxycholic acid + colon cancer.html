Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type  cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378164> attenuates -associated colon cancer by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB signaling.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases is associated with an increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer. However, the mechanism of immune signaling pathways linked to -associated cancer (CAC) has not been fully elucidated.  (TUDCA) exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of TUDCA in the pathogenesis of CAC.-associated cancer was induced in mice using azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate administration, and TUDCA's effect on tumor development was evaluated. HCT 116 and COLO 205 were treated with TUDCA or vehicle and then stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Expression of interleukin (IL)-8 was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IκBα phosphorylation and degradation was evaluated by immunoblot assay. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cell viability assay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF were performed. significantly attenuated the development of CAC in mice. Exposure to TUDCA resulted in extensive epithelial apoptosis and reduced levels of phospho-IκB kinase in the colon. In HCT 116 cells stimulated with TNF-α, TUDCA significantly inhibited IL-8 and IL-1α expression and suppressed TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Furthermore, in both HCT 116 and COLO 205 cells, TUDCA reduced cell viability and downregulated the expression of bcl-xL, MCL1, c-FLIP-L, and VEGF.These results demonstrated that TUDCA suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates -associated tumorigenesis, suggesting that TUDCA could be a potential treatment for CAC.© 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p></html>
