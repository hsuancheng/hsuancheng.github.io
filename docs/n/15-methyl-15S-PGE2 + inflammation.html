It involves bronchial  followed by different degrees of airway remodeling. Environmental factors such as exhaust fumes, cigarette smoke, occupation-related agents, and infections have been associated with neutrophilic  which activates specific cellular and molecular pathways leading to neutrophilic .This review discusses the involvement of neutrophils in asthma and potentially related target therapies.Corticosteroid resistance is the hallmark of neutrophilic asthma which increases disease severity and leads to difficult-to-control asthma. Patients with neutrophil-dominant asthma are characterized by low levels of (or absence of) Th2 cytokines. Due to the shortage of effective treatments for neutrophilic asthma newer biologics are being developed that target type 2 asthma symptoms and phenotypes. Understanding different biomarkers, inflammatory pathways and treatment strategies involved in neutrophilic asthma will help decrease adverse effects related to corticosteroid insensitivity. A better understanding of neutrophilic  targets can lead to improved therapies.Further evaluation and clinical trials of emerging biologics need to be performed before bringing them into clinical practice.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular . KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular , ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and  in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

Over the course of the disease, the episodes increased in frequency and severity, with new signs and symptoms continuing to appear. Most importantly, these included skin changes, splenomegaly and transaminitis. Only partial control of the disease was achieved with anti-IL-1 therapy. Extensive investigation showed generalized  without immune deficiency, with increased levels of serum amyloid A and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, as well as an increased type I interferon score. Exome sequence analysis identified P369S and R408Q variants in the MEFV innate immunity regulator, pyrin (MEFV) gene and T260 M and T320 M variants in the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12) gene.Patients with unclassified and/or unexplained autoinflammatory syndromes present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and collectively form a substantial part of every cohort of patients with autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, it is important to acquire their full genomic profile through whole exome and/or genome sequencing and present their cases to a broader audience, to facilitate characterization of similar patients. A critical mass of well-characterized cases will lead to improved diagnosis and informed treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661484>[Pooled Human Immunoglobulin Preparations as Immunomodulating Drugs].</a></h2><p>It is time to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first successful attempt to develop and use a specific high-titer antitoxic serum for treating diphtheria, a deadly infectious disease. This was followed by major advances in passive immunotherapy 75 years ago (production of pooled human IgG for subcutaneous injection) and 50 years ago (widespread technology for producing immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration). More than 200 tons of pooled human IgG are produced per year worldwide. The preparation is used primarily for IgG substitution in patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, as well as for an immunomodulating treatment of a growing number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These preparations contain the pooled IgG antibody repertoire of a large population of healthy plasma donors. This repertoire includes antibodies that neutralize pathogens and their factors of virulence, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibodies to other foreign and own proteins, as well as to carbohydrate antigens. Naturally polyspecific antibodies that are present in all healthy individuals play an important role as a first-line defense against bacteria and viruses. After exposure to protein-modifying agents, some IgG molecules can acquire the ability to bind novel structurally unrelated antigens. This phenomenon is referred to as induced polyspecificity. The list of these protein-modifying molecules was shown to include low-pH buffers, free heme, pro-oxidative ferrous ions, reactive oxygen species, etc. Such modified antibody preparations may have a therapeutic potential, since their administration to animals with experimental sepsis or aseptic systemic response syndromes significantly improved survival rates, while the same dose of the native preparation had no effect. We also hypothesize that the aggressive protein-modifying molecules released in sites of  and tissue damage could also modify the antigen-binding behavior of surface immunoglobulin B cell receptors and the structurally related T cell receptors. This "specificity editing" of both types of receptors may play a major role in the body's defense mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661651>Comparison of Chemokine CXCL-1 and Interleukin-6 Concentrations in the Subretinal Fluid and Vitreous in Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.</a></h2><p>: Comparison of IL-6 and CXCL-1 concentrations and CXCL-1/IL-6 ratio correlations with clinical parameters (RRD extent, duration, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy - PVR-grade) between subretinal fluid (SRF) and vitreous during rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) complicated with PVR.: A total of 71 eyes of 71 patients with primary RRD possibly complicated with PVR were included; 36 eyes treated with scleral buckling and 35 eyes with pars-plana vitrectomy. Enzyme-Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay was employed for CXCL-1/IL-6 measurement (ng/ml).: Correlation analysis between mean CXCL-1/IL-6 ratio and clinical parameters revealed non-significant results. CXCL-1/IL-6 ratio was significantly elevated in phakic eye vitreous. Optimum circumstances for elevated chemokine levels during RRD were considerable extent (2-3-quadrant) and duration (29-60-day) complicated with PVR C.: SRF appears to be characterized by greater chemokine concentrations while vitreous retains several structural characteristics that may assist in investigating  and improving understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms during RRD complicated with PVR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657335>[Changes in coagulation of sepsis rats with protein-malnutrition or energy-malnutrition].</a></h2><p>To investigate the changes in coagulation of sepsis rats with protein-malnutrition or energy-malnutrition.108 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into three groups by random number table, with 36 rats in each group. The rats in normal feeding group were given a free diet (27 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder), and the rats in protein-malnutrition group were given a low protein diet (27 g/d, containing 5% protein fodder). The rats in energy-malnutrition group were given a low energy diet (9 g/d, containing 18% protein fodder). After 4 weeks of continuous feeding, 8 rats from each group were sacrificed for malnutrition evaluation. The weights of body, thymus and spleen were measured. The percentages of spleen T lymphocyte subsets and M1 macrophage were determined by flow cytometry. Plasma interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The remaining 28 rats in each group were collected for cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to reproduce the sepsis model, 20 rats of which were used for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the other 8 rats were sacrificed at 8 hours after CLP. The levels of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were determined by ELISA, and the percentage of spleen M1 macrophages was determined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expressions of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in liver tissue were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 and IL-6 in rats after CLP.(1) After 4 weeks of feeding, the rats in the normal feeding group and protein-malnutrition group gained weight, while those in the energy-malnutrition group lost 25% of their initial body weight. The weights of body, thymus and spleen in the protein-malnutrition group and the energy-malnutrition group were significantly lower than those in the normal feeding group. Compared with the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group, the percentages of spleen CD3T lymphocytes, CD4T lymphocytes, M1 macrophages and plasma IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the energy-malnutrition group [CD3T lymphocytes percentage: (52.1±3.7)% vs. (46.9±3.9)%, (44.5±2.2)%; CD4T lymphocyte percentages: (35.0±3.6)% vs. (26.3±2.2)%, (25.1±2.3)%; M1 macrophage percentages: (8.7±2.0)% vs. (3.2±1.3)%, (4.2±1.1)%; IL-6 (ng/L): 129.4±16.2 vs. 48.1±10.0, 53.0±8.3, all P < 0.05]. (2) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 7 days after CLP showed: all rats in the energy-malnutrition group died, and the 7-day cumulative survival rate was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group and the protein-malnutrition group [0% (0/20) vs. 35% (7/20), 55% (11/20), both P < 0.05]. The mortality of the normal feeding group was 65%, which was consistent with moderate CLP mortality, indicating that the CLP model was successfully prepared. After CLP, the plasma IL-6 level in the protein-malnutrition group was significantly lower than that in the normal feeding group [IL-6 (ng/L): 154.6±34.7 vs. 233.4±41.2, P < 0.05]. Compared with the normal feeding group, the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in liver and plasma IL-6 levels in the energy-malnutrition group were significantly increased [TF mRNA (2): 4.5±2.2 vs. 1.1±0.7, PAI-1 mRNA (2): 3.3±1.8 vs. 1.3±0.9, IL-6 (ng/L): 382.7±118.2 vs. 233.4±41.2, all P < 0.05], the percentage of M1 macrophages in spleen was significantly lowered [(8.9±2.4)% vs. (15.2±5.4)%, P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in plasma IL-10 level among all the groups. Correlation analysis showed that the mRNA expressions of TF and PAI-1 in the liver of rats after CLP were positively correlated with plasma IL-6 level (r = 0.644, r = 0.574, both P < 0.01).Long-term sustained stress (starvation) leads to sustained chronic inflammatory state, and stimulated the release of related inflammatory factors and activation of the coagulation system after infection.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to locate to injured tissues,  sites and tumors and are thus good candidates for carrying antitumor genes for the treatment of tumors. Treating GBM with MSCs that have been transduced with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene has brought significant advances because MSCs can exert a bystander effect on tumor cells upon treatment with the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV).In this study, we aimed to determine whether HSV-TK-expressing umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCTKs) together with prodrug GCV treatment could exert a bystander killing effect on GBM.Compared with MSCTK :U87 ratio at 1:10,1:100 and 1:100, GCV concentration at 2.5μM or 250μM， when MSCTKs were cocultured with U87 cells at a ratio of 1:1, 25 μM GCV exerted a more stable killing effect. Higher amounts of MSCTKs cocultured with U87 cells were correlated with a better bystander effect exerted by the MSCTK/GCV system. We built U87-driven subcutaneous tumor models and brain intracranial tumor models to evaluate the efficiency of the MSCTK/GCV system on subcutaneous and intracranial tumors and found that MSCTK/GCV was effective in both models. The ratio of MSCTKs and tumor cells played a critical role in this therapeutic effect, with a higher MSCTK/U87 ratio exerting a better effect.This research suggested that the MSCTK/GCV system exerts a strong bystander effect on GBM tumor cells, and this system may be a promising assistant method for GBM postoperative therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657123>Glycyrrhizin mitigates radiation-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the HMGB1/TLR4 signalling pathway.</a></h2><p>Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is the major complication of thoracic radiation therapy, and no effective treatment is available. This study explored the role of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in acute RILI and the therapeutic effect of glycyrrhizin, an inhibitor of HMGB1, on RILI. C57BL/6 mice received a 20 Gy dose of X-ray radiation to the whole thorax with or without administration of glycyrrhizin. Severe lung  was present 12 weeks after irradiation, although only a mild change was noted at 2 weeks and could be alleviated by administration of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin decreased the plasma concentrations of HMGB1 and sRAGE as well as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The expression of RAGE was decreased while that of TLR4 was significantly increased at 12 weeks, but not 2 weeks, after irradiation in mouse lung tissue. In vitro, the expression of TLR4 increased in RAW 264.7 cells after conditioning with the supernatant from the irradiated MLE-12 cells containing HMGB1 but showed no change when conditioned medium without HMGB1 was used. However, conditioned culture had no effect on RAGE expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Glycyrrhizin also inhibited the related downstream transcription factors of HMGB/TLR4, such as NF-κB, JNK and ERK1/2, in lung tissue and RAW 264.7 cells when TLR4 was activated. In conclusion, the HMGB1/TLR4 pathway mediates RILI and can be mitigated by glycyrrhizin.© 2019 The Authors.

Imaging  provides information on disease prognosis and may guide therapy, but the cellular basis of the signal remains equivocal. We evaluated leukocyte subtype specificity of characterized clinically relevant -targeted radiotracers.Leukocyte populations were purified from blood- and THP-1-derived macrophages were polarized into M1-, reparative M2a-, or M2c-macrophages. In vitro uptake assays were conducted using tracers of enhanced glucose or amino acid metabolism and molecular markers of inflammatory cells. Both F-deoxyglucose (F-FDG) and the labeled amino acid C-methionine (C-MET) displayed higher uptake in neutrophils and monocytes compared to other leukocytes (P = 0.005), and markedly higher accumulation in pro-inflammatory M1-macrophages compared to reparative M2a-macrophages (P < 0.001). Molecular tracers Ga-DOTATATE targeting the somatostatin receptor type 2 and Ga-pentixafor targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) exhibited broad uptake by leukocyte subpopulations and polarized macrophages with highest uptake in T-cells/natural killer cells and B-cells compared to neutrophils. Mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)-targeted F-flutriciclamide selectively accumulated in monocytes and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (P < 0.001). Uptake by myocytes and fibroblasts tended to be higher for metabolic radiotracers.The different in vitro cellular uptake profiles may allow isolation of distinct phases of the inflammatory pathway with specific -targeted radiotracers.

These deficits are long-lasting and no treatment options are available. A better understanding of the mechanistic basis for these cognitive deficits is needed to develop novel treatments. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels are decreased in ABI. Herein, we focus on augmentation of cAMP by PDE4 inhibitors and the potentially synergistic mechanisms in traumatic brain injury. A major acute pathophysiological event in ABI is the breakdown of the blood- brain-barrier (BBB). Intracellular cAMP pathways are involved in the subsequent emergence of edema,  and hyperexcitability. We propose that PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast can improve cognition by modulation of the activity in the cAMP-Phosphokinase A-Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC1)  pathway. In addition, PDE4 inhibitors can also directly enhance network plasticity and attenuate degenerative processes and cognitive dysfunction by increasing activity of the canonical cAMP/phosphokinase-A/cAMP Responsive Element Binding protein (cAMP/PKA/CREB) plasticity pathway. Doublecourtin and microtubule-associated protein 2 are generated following activation of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway and are decreased or even absent after injury. Both proteins are involved in neuronal plasticity and may consist of viable markers to track these processes. It is concluded that PDE4 inhibitors may consist of a novel class of drugs for the treatment of residual symptoms in ABI attenuating the pathophysiological consequences of a BBB breakdown by their anti- inflammatory actions via the cAMP/PKA/RAC1 pathway and by increasing synaptic plasticity via the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Roflumilast improves cognition in young and elderly humans and would be an excellent candidate for a proof of concept study in ABI patients.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655330>Short-term exposures to particulate matter gamma radiation activities and biomarkers of systemic  and endothelial activation in COPD patients.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that particulate matter (PM) gamma activity (gamma radiation associated with PM) is associated with systemic effects.Examine short-term relationships between ambient and indoor exposures to PM gamma activities with systemic  and endothelial activation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.In 85 COPD patients from Eastern Massachusetts, USA from 2012 to 2014, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were measured seasonally up to four times. We used US EPA RadNet data measuring ambient gamma radiation attached to PM adjusted for background radiation, and estimated in-home gamma radiation exposures using the ratio of in-home-to-ambient sulfur in PM. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to determine associations between moving averages of PM gamma activities through the week before phlebotomy with these biomarkers. We explored ambient and indoor PM, black carbon (BC), and NO as confounders.Ambient and indoor PM gamma activities measured as energy spectra classes 3 through 9 were positively associated with CRP and IL-6. For example, averaged from phlebotomy day through previous 6 days, each IQR increase in indoor PM gamma activity for each spectra class, was associated with an CRP increase ranging from 7.45% (95%CI: 2.77, 12.4) to 13.4% (95%CI: 5.82, 21.4) and for ambient exposures were associated with an increase of 8.75% (95%CI: -0.57, 18.95) to 14.8% (95%CI: 4.5, 26.0). Indoor exposures were associated with IL-6 increase of 3.56% (95%CI: 0.31, 6.91) to 6.46% (95%CI:1.33, 11.85) and ambient exposures were associated with an increase of 0.03% (95%CI: -6.37, 6.87) to 3.50% (95%CI: -3.15, 10.61). There were no positive associations with sVCAM-1.

Although many studies have reported that FM regulates intracellular calcium signaling, research on the exact type of calcium channel modulated by FM is scarce. Therefore, we hypothesized that the anti-allergic effects of FM might result from ORAI1 inhibition in T cells. We investigated whether a 70% ethanolic extract of FM (FM and its constituents inhibit ORAI1 channel activity and subsequent T cell activation. We performed conventional whole-cell patch clamp studies in hSTIM1 and hORAI1-overexpressing HEK293T cells (HEK.

FM (0.03 mg/mL) and its fractions, especially hexane fraction (FM, 0.01 mg/mL), significantly inhibited SOCE and IL-2 cytokine production in Jurkat T lymphocytes. GC/MS analysis showed linoleic acid (LA) as the major component of FM. FM at 0.01 mg/mL (equivalent to 10 M LA) inhibited not only SOCE but also IL-2 production, as well as CD3/CD28 receptor co-stimulation induced calcium signaling in Jurkat T lymphocytes.

This metabolic disease is indicated by high blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. Inflammatory response occurs as a result of immune response to high blood glucose levels as well as the presence of inflammatory mediators produced by adipocytes and macrophages in fat tissue. This low and chronic  leads to damage of the pancreatic beta cells and insufficient insulin production, which results in hyperglycemia.Hyperglycemia in diabetes is thought to cause dysfunction of the immune response, which results in failure to control the spread of invading pathogens in diabetic subjects. Therefore, diabetic subjects are known to more susceptible to infections. The increased prevalence of T2D will increase the incidence of infectious diseases and related comorbidities.This review provides an overview of the immunological aspect of T2D and the possible mechanisms that result in increased infections in diabetics.A better understanding of how immune dysfunctions occur during hyperglycemia can lead to novel treatments and preventions for infectious diseases and T2D comorbidities, thus improving the outcome of infectious disease treatment in T2D patients.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660941>CoQ10 ameliorates monosodium glutamate-induced alteration in detrusor activity and responsiveness in rats via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and channel inhibiting mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Competent detrusor muscles with coordinated contraction and relaxation are crucial for normal urinary bladder storage and emptying functions. Hence, detrusor instability, and subsequently bladder overactivity, may lead to undesirable outcomes including incontinence. Multiple mechanisms may underlie the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity including  and oxidative stress. Herein, we tested the possibility that CoQ10 may have a potential therapeutic role in detrusor overactivity.Forty adult male Wistar albino rats weighing 100-150 g were used in the present study. Rats were divided (10/group) into control (receiving vehicles), monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated (receiving 5 mg/kg MSG daily for 15 consecutive days), MSG + OO-treated (receiving concomitantly 5 mg/kg MSG and olive oil for 15 consecutive days), MSG + CoQ10-treated (receiving concomitantly 5 mg/kg MSG and 100 mg/kg CoQ10 daily for 15 consecutive days) groups.MSG resulted in significant increase in bladder weight and sensitised the bladder smooth muscles to acetylcholine. MSG has also resulted in significant increase in bladder TNF-α, IL-6, malondialdehyde, nerve growth factor and connexion 43, with significant decrease in the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. Olive oil had no effect on MSG induced alterations of different parameters.

Artemisinin is used for the treatment of fever and malaria in clinical practice. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the major active metabolite of artemisinin, plays a role in anti‑organizational fibrosis and anti‑neuronal cell death. However, whether DHA can attenuate ALI remains unclear. The current study thus examined the effects of DHA on ALI and primary macrophages. The results revealed that DHA attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced pulmonary pathological damage. DHA suppressed the LPS‑induced infiltration of inflammatory cells, the elevation of myeloperoxidase activity, oxidative stress and the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)‑1β, tumor necrosis factor‑α, and IL‑6. Furthermore, DHA reduced the LPS‑induced inflammatory response by suppressing the degradation of I‑κB and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB)/p65 in vivo and in vitro. DHA activated the nuclear factor‑erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which was suppressed by LPS treatment. The Nrf2 inhibitor, ML385, diminished the protective effects of DHA against LPS‑induced  in macrophages. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that DHA exerts therapeutic effects against LPS‑induced ALI by inhibiting the Nrf2‑mediated NF‑κB activation in macrophages. The present study also confirmed the therapeutic effects of DHA in mice with LPS‑induced ALI. Thus, these findings demonstrate that DHA exhibits anti‑inflammatory activities and may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660940>Anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of the extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents isolated from Luehea ochrophylla Mart.</a></h2><p>Stem bark of Luehea ochrophylla (L. ochrophylla) is used by the traditional Brazilian medicine for treatment of rheumatic diseases and tumors.

Histological analysis was based on scores assigned by the capacity of decreasing the lesion. To evaluate the effect EE and fractions on cell proliferation, human lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed using flow cytometry. Proliferation was measured using VPD 450 staining and the calculated proliferative index (PI). The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT colorimetric method against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HCT-116, and Vero cells. GraphPad Prism Version 5 was used for statistical analysis.HE and EE provided friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, mixture of lupeol and pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, betulinic acid, mixture of lupeol and taraxasterol, (-)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin. HE, ethyl acetate fraction (AF), betulinic acid, and β-sitosterol promoted regeneration of muscle fibers caused by muscle injury. AF significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the lymphocyte proliferation index (1.36 for cultures stimulated with PHA, 0.7 for untreated cultures and 0.12 for cultures stimulated with PHA and treated with AF 25 μg/mL and AF 50 μg/mL, respectively). β-Sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside exhibited high cytotoxic activity (IC = 1.279 μg/mL) against HCT-116 cell line.These results suggest that extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla decreases inflammatory processes generated by muscle injury. The anti-inflammatory activity may be justified by high inhibition of T cell proliferation. These extracts, fractions, and chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla may be useful as a therapeutic agent against rheumatic diseases. Moreover, chemical constituents from L. ochrophylla show potent cytotoxic activity against colon and rectal carcinomas.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661479>[Mouse Models of Sepsis and Septic Shock].</a></h2><p>An extensive network of regulation of systemic  makes development of a reproducible experimental model of sepsis a complex task. There is no single mouse model that can capture all clinical aspects of this complicated pathology.

Tristetraprolin (TTP), an mRNA binding protein, plays a role in regulating the inflammatory factors, recognizing specific sequences on the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs. TTP activity depends on its phosphorylation state: the unphosphorylated TTP degrades pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs; on the contrary, the phosphorylated TTP fails to destabilize mRNAs furthering their expression. The phospho-TTP forms a complex with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This binding could be one of the factors that promote intestinal  as a cause of disease progression.To assess if TTP phosphorylation has a role in paediatric IBD.The study was carried out on a cohort of paediatric IBD patients. For each patient enrolled, a specimen of inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa was collected. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted on macrophages differentiated from blood samples of the same patients. Macrophages from healthy donors' blood were used as controls. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting analyses were performed to observe the formation of the phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex. In the same samples TNF-α expression was also evaluated as major factor of the pro-inflammatory activity.In this work we studied indirectly the phosphorylation of TTP through the binding with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. In inflamed and non-inflamed colon mucosa of IBD paediatric patients immunoblot assay demonstrated a higher expression of the TTP in inflamed samples respect to the non-inflamed; the co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 protein showed the same trend of expression. In the  gene expression analysis higher levels of the cytokine in inflamed tissues compared to controls were evident. The same experiments were conducted on macrophages from IBD paediatric patients and healthy controls. The immunoblot results demonstrated a high expression of both TTP and co-immunoprecipitated 14-4-3 protein in IBD-derived macrophages in comparison to healthy donors. TNF-α protein levels from macrophages lysates showed the same trend of expression in favour of IBD paediatric patients compared to healthy controls.In this work, for the first time, we describe a relation between phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex and IBD. Indeed, a higher expression of TTP/14-3-3 was recorded in IBD samples in comparison to controls.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

APOL1 is expressed in renal cells, however, the pathogenic events that lead to renal cell damage and kidney disease are not fully understood. The podocyte function of APOL1-G0 versus APOL1-G2 in the setting of a known disease stressor was assessed using transgenic mouse models. Transgene expression, survival, renal pathology and function, and podocyte density were assessed in an intercross of a mouse model of HIVAN (Tg26) with two mouse models that express either APOL1-G0 or APOL1-G2 in podocytes. Mice that expressed HIV genes developed heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, and had significant losses in podocyte numbers and reductions in podocyte densities. Mice that co-expressed APOL1-G0 and HIV had preserved podocyte numbers and densities, with fewer morphologic manifestations typical of HIVAN pathology. Podocyte losses and pathology in mice co-expressing APOL1-G2 and HIV were not significantly different from mice expressing only HIV. Podocyte hypertrophy, a known compensatory event to stress, was increased in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G0, but absent in the mice co-expressing HIV and APOL1-G2. Mortality and renal function tests were not significantly different between groups. APOL1-G0 expressed in podocytes may have a protective function against podocyte loss or injury when exposed to an environmental stressor. This was absent with APOL1-G2 expression, suggesting APOL1-G2 may have lost this protective function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655109>Neutrophil-lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) Predict Severity and Prognosis of Lower Limb Arteriosclerosis Obliterans.</a></h2><p>Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are two markers of , which are associated with worse cardiovascular disease outcomes. Here we aimed to determine the association between these ratios and disease severity, and evaulate predictive validity of NLR and PLR in lower limb arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO).We evaluated 211 patients with a diagnosis of ASO from January 2016 to December 2018 at Shanghai Jiaotong University Renji hospital. NLR and PLR were accessed from routinely drawn peripheral venous blood at the ward of vascular surgery during hospitalization. the association between NLR and PLR with baseline characteristics, disease severity, one-year outcomes were determined, respectively.Both NLR and PLR showed significant values on predicting disease severity. Higher NLR(p=0.001) and PLR(p<0.001) were associated with lower ABI index and worse clinical presentation. Both NLR and PLR are positively correlated with one-year readmission rate (p<0.001, p=0.001, respectively). Both NLR and PLR also positively correlated with tissue loss rate and one-year mortality (p=0.007, p=0.034, respectively).NLR and PLR show a positive association with the severity of lower extremity PAD, both higher ratios correlate with poor prognosis, especially, the risk of one-year readmission. A higher NLR also correlates with one-year mortality.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, once in the bloodstream, a range of pathogenic bacteria are able to reach the brain and cause meningitis. Despite advances in antibacterial therapy, bacterial meningitis remains one of the most important infectious diseases worldwide. The most common causative bacteria in children and adults are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis, associated with high morbidity and mortality, while among neonates most cases of bacterial meningitis are due to group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. Here we summarize our current knowledge on the strategies used by these bacterial pathogens to survive in the bloodstream, to colonize the brain vasculature and to cross the blood-brain barrier.This article is protected by copyright.

However specific therapies are lacking that can modulate airway neutrophil function, and difficult challenges must be overcome to achieve therapeutic efficacy against pulmonary , notably drug hydrophobicity, mucociliary and macrophage-dependent clearance, and high extracellular protease burden. Here, we present a multi-stage, aerodynamically favorable delivery platform that uses extracellular proteolysis to its advantage in order to deliver nanoparticle-embedded hydrophobic drugs to neutrophils within the lower airways. Our design consists in a self-regulated nanoparticle-in-microgel system, in which microgel activation is triggered by extracellular elastase (degranulated by inflammatory neutrophils), and nanoparticles are loaded with Nexinhib20, a potent neutrophil degranulation inhibitor. Successful in vivo delivery of Nexinhib20 to the airways and into neutrophils promoted resolution of the inflammatory response by dampening neutrophil recruitment and degranulation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in both airway and systemic compartments, as well as the presence of neutrophil-derived pathological extracellular vesicles in the lung fluid. Our findings showcase a new platform that overcomes challenges in pulmonary drug delivery and allows customization to match the proteolytic footprint of given diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655733>Cytokines in heart failure.</a></h2><p>The natural history of heart failure (HF) is not linear, because changes in the heart structure and function start long before the disease becomes clinically evident. Many different cytokines originating from intracardiac tissues (cardiomyocytes, cardiac endothelial cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and cardiac infiltrated immune cells) or extracardiac tissues (adipose tissue, gut, and lymphoid organs) have been identified in HF. Because the levels of circulating cytokines correlate with the development and severity of HF, these mediators may have both pathophysiological importance, through their ability to modulate , myocyte stress/stretch, myocyte injury and apoptosis, fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and utility as clinical predictive biomarkers. A greater understanding of the mechanisms mediated by the multifaceted network of cytokines, leading to distinct HF phenotypes (HF with reduced or preserved ejection fraction), is urgently needed for the development of new treatment strategies. In this chapter, all these issues were thoroughly discussed, pointing on the practical considerations concerning the clinical use of the cytokines as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in HF.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997> triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h2><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in lipid metabolism. Our studies indicate that cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of . The -dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as  subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657332>[Effects of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats].</a></h2><p>To investigate the protective effect of carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (CORM-2) on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in rats.140 healthy male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into sham operation (Sham) group, model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, inactivated carbon monoxide release molecule-2 (iCORM) pretreatment group, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group by random number table, with 28 rats in each group. The rat sepsis model was reproduced by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The rats in the Sham group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of normal saline (NS). The rats in the CORM-2 and iCORM-2 pretreatment groups were injected intraperitoneally with 8 mg/kg CORM-2 or iCORM-2 at 1 hour before LPS injection, respectively, and those in the DMSO group were injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of DMSO, but the rats in the Sham group and the model group were not treated after injection of NS or LPS. Twenty rats were randomly selected from each group to observe 10-day survival rate. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the remaining 8 rats at 12 hours after modeling, and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) were calculated to evaluate heart function. The blood of the inferior vena cava was harvested, then serum myocardial troponin I (cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then the rats were sacrificed, and the myocardial tissues were harvested, the pathological morphology and ultrastructure of myocardium were observed.(1) Survival rates: all rats in the Sham group survived; compared with the Sham group, the survival rates of the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased at 10 days [10% (2/20), 70% (14/20), 25% (5/20), 15% (3/20) vs. 100% (20/20), all P < 0.01]. However, the 10-day survival rate in the CORM-2 pretreatment group was significantly higher than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group (all P < 0.01). (2) Cardiac function: compared with the Sham group, LVEF and LVFS in the model group, CORM-2 pretreatment group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group and DMSO control group were significantly decreased, and left ventricular dilatation was obvious, indicating myocardial dysfunction in rats. However, LVEF and LVFS in the CORM-2 pretreatment group were significantly higher than those in the model group, iCORM-2 pretreatment group, and DMSO control group [LVEF: 0.760±0.029 vs. 0.634±0.021, 0.629±0.066, 0.673±0.023; LVFS: (39.32±2.38)% vs. (29.75±1.52)%, (29.61±4.15)%, (32.43±1.66)%, all P < 0.05], and the left ventricular dilatation in the septic rats was attenuated.

However, their use in developing new therapies for sepsis has been controversial because of limitations of the models and inconsistencies with the clinical conditions. In consideration of the revised definition for clinical sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3), a Wiggers-Bernard Conference was held in Vienna in May 2017 to propose standardized guidelines on preclinical sepsis modeling. The participants conducted a literature review of 260 most highly cited scientific articles on sepsis models published between 2003 and 2012. The review showed, for example, that mice were used in 79% and euthanasia criteria were defined in 9% of the studies. PartIof this report details the recommendations for study design and humane modeling endpoints that should be addressed in sepsis models. The first recommendation is that survival follow-up should reflect the clinical time course of the infectious agent used in the sepsis model. Furthermore, it is recommended that therapeutic interventions should be initiated after the septic insult replicating clinical care. To define an unbiased and reproducible association between a new treatment and outcome, a randomization and blinding of treatments as well as inclusion of all methodological details in scientific publications is essential. In all preclinical sepsis studies, the high standards of animal welfare must be implemented. Therefore, development and validation of specific criteria for monitoring pain and distress, and euthanasia of septic animals, as well as the use of analgesics are recommended. A set of four considerations is also proposed to enhance translation potential of sepsis models. Relevant biological variables and comorbidities should be included in the study design and sepsis modeling should be extended to mammalian species other than rodents. In addition, the need for source control (in case of a defined infection focus) should be considered. These recommendations and considerations are proposed as "best practices" for animal models of sepsis that should be implemented.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658773>Virus Adaptation and Selection Following Challenge of Animals Vaccinated against Classical Swine Fever Virus.</a></h2><p>Vaccines against classical swine fever have proven very effective in protecting pigs from this deadly disease. However, little is known about how vaccination impacts the selective pressures acting on the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we use high-throughput sequencing of viral genomes to investigate evolutionary changes in virus populations following the challenge of naïve and vaccinated pigs with the highly virulent CSFV strain "Koslov". The challenge inoculum contained an ensemble of closely related viral sequences, with three major haplotypes being present, termed A, B, and C. After the challenge, the viral haplotype A was preferentially located within the tonsils of naïve animals but was highly prevalent in the sera of all vaccinated animals. We find that the viral population structure in naïve pigs after infection is very similar to that in the original inoculum. In contrast, the viral population in vaccinated pigs, which only underwent transient low-level viremia, displayed several distinct changes including the emergence of 16 unique non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detectable in the challenge inoculum. Further analysis showed a significant loss of heterogeneity and an increasing positive selection acting on the virus populations in the vaccinated pigs. We conclude that vaccination imposes a strong selective pressure on viruses that subsequently replicate within the vaccinated animal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657327>[Epidemiological comparison between the new and the old diagnostic criteria for sepsis: a retrospective cohort study based on the database of Beijing Public Health Information System].</a></h2><p>To describe and compare the epidemiology of Sepsis-1 and Sepsis-3 in Yuetan Subdistrict of Beijing, and to estimate the incidence of Sepsis-3 in China.A population-based cohort study was conducted.

Compared with the model group, the diversity of intestinal flora in the fecal microbiota transplantation group was significantly increased (species index: 510.24±58.76 vs. 282.50±47.42, Chao1 index: 852.75±25.24 vs. 705.50±46.50, both P < 0.05), the dysbiosis of intestinal flora at phylum, family, genus level induced by LPS were also significantly reversed, and with the improvement of intestinal flora, the incidence of abnormal EEG waveforms was lower in the fecal microbiota transplantation group compared with that in the model group [25.0% (3/12) vs. 80.0% (8/10), P < 0.05], and the expression of α7nAChR protein in the cerebral cortex was significantly increased (α7nAChR/β-actin: 1.56±0.05 vs. 0.82±0.07, P < 0.05), immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Iba-1 positive expression of microglia decreased significantly, and cerebral cortex TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β levels were significantly decreased [TNF-α (ng/L): 6.28±0.61 vs. 12.02±0.54, IL-6 (ng/L): 28.26±3.15 vs. 60.58±4.62, IL-1β (ng/L): 33.63±3.48 vs. 72.56±2.25, all P < 0.05].The results reveal that fecal microbiota transplantation has remarkably modulated the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota and activated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and ameliorate the brain dysfunction in septic rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659726>Growth and Nutrition in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Optimal nutrition support has been integral in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) since the disease was initially described. Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and microbiota composition, and enteric  must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. In this report, nutrition support across the age and disease spectrum is discussed, with a focus on the relationships among nutritional status, growth, and disease outcomes.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659732>Treating the Airway Consequences of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Dysfunction.</a></h2><p>In cystic fibrosis (CF), absent or dysfunctional CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) on the surface of airway epithelial cells causes abnormal mucociliary clearance, leading to chronic endobronchial infection and , in turn resulting in life-shortening progressive obstructive lung disease and structural airway damage. Fortunately, CF-specific therapies have been developed that improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations, contributing significantly to improved survival over the past 4 decades. Therapies not originally developed for CF, such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, are also widely used by people living with CF. Therapies to be reviewed in this article include mucolytics, airway surface liquid hydrators, anti-inflammatory medications, bronchodilators, inhaled and oral antibiotics, and airway clearance techniques. Determining which therapies to utilize can be challenging, as there is variable evidence for each treatment, differing national guidelines, few head-to-head studies, potential for drug-drug interactions, and synergistic toxicities, as well as issues with burden of care. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of action and available evidence, and compare national guidelines for each major medication used to treat the airway consequences of CFTR dysfunction.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659095>Factors and measures predicting external CSF drain-associated ventriculitis: A review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p>To determine the diagnostic value of clinical factors and biochemical or microbiological measures for diagnosing a drain-associated ventriculitis, we summarized the available evidence.We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of patients with external ventricular CSF drains who developed drain-associated ventriculitis by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL electronic database. We reported the occurrence of abnormal test results in patients with and without drain-associated ventriculitis. For continuous variables, we recalculated mean values presented in multiple studies.We identified 42 articles published between 1984 and 2018 including 3,035 patients with external CSF drains of whom 697 (23%) developed drain-associated bacterial ventriculitis. Indications for drain placement were subarachnoid, intraventricular or cerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhage not further specified (69%), traumatic brain injury (13%), and obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a brain tumor (10%). Fever was present in 116 of 162 patients with ventriculitis (72%) compared with 80 of 275 (29%) patients without ventriculitis. The CSF cell count was increased for 74 of 80 patients (93%) with bacterial ventriculitis and 30 of 95 patients (32%) without ventriculitis. CSF culture was positive in 125 of 156 episodes classified as ventriculitis (80%), and CSF Gram stain was positive in 44 of 81 patients (54%). In patients with ventriculitis, PCR on ribosomal RNA was positive on 54 of 78 CSF samples (69%).Clinical factors and biochemical and microbiological measures have limited diagnostic value in differentiating between ventriculitis and sterile  in patients with external CSF drains.

However, the biochemical linkage between the cysteine proteolytic activity of Makes Caterpillars Floppy-like (MCF) effector and its cellular effects remains unknown. In this study, we identify the host cell factors that activate in vivo and in vitro MCF autoprocessing as ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) and ADP-ribosylation Factor 3 (ARF3). Autoprocessing activity is enhanced when ARF1 is in its active (GTP-bound) form compared to the inactive (GDP-bound) form. Subsequent to auto-cleavage, MCF is acetylated on its exposed N-terminal glycine residue. Acetylation apparently does not dictate subcellular localization, as MCF is found localized throughout the cell. However, the cleaved form of MCF gains the ability to bind to the specialized lipid phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate enriched in Golgi and other membranes necessary for endocytic trafficking, suggesting a fraction of MCF may be subcellular localized. Traditional thin-section electron microscopy, high-resolution cryoAPEX localization, and fluorescent microscopy show that MCF causes Golgi dispersal resulting in extensive vesiculation. In addition, host mitochondria are disrupted and fragmented. Mass spectrometry analysis found no reproducible modifications of ARF1 suggesting ARF1 is not post-translationally modified by MCF. Further, catalytically active MCF does not stably associate with ARF1. Our data indicate that ARF1 is a cross-kingdom activator of MCF, but also that MCF may mediate cytotoxicity by directly targeting another yet to be identified protein. This study begins to elucidate the biochemical activity of this important domain and gives insight into how it may promote disease progression.This article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, we developed a rat model to study the direct impact of 7KCh on retina. We delivered 7KCh to the rat retina by intravitreal injection using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as a vehicle. We observed that 7KCh mainly deposited in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and induced marked photoreceptor apoptosis. Transmission electron microscope examination demonstrated cytoplasmic vacuoles in RPE cells and the microvilli detached from the outer segment after 7KCh treatment. In vitro experiments also revealed that RPE cells could take up 7KCh in culture. Moreover, 7KCh up-regulated IL-1βmRNA, TNF-αmRNA, IL-6 mRNA, and IL-1β secretion of RPE. U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, down regulated the expression of these  factors. Our findings may help elucidate the potential role of 7KCh in the pathogenesis of AMD.Copyright © 2019.

GT in primary‑cultured chondrocytes enhances expression of type II collagen, an indicator of differentiation, and cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2), which mediates inflammatory reactions. In contrast, 2DG reduces type II collagen and COX‑2 expression while driving ER‑stress‑induced unglycosylation. In the present study, it was investigated whether GT could attenuate 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress. Following treatment with GT and 2DG, chondrocytes were assessed using western blotting, RT‑PCR, immunofluorescence, and alcian blue staining. GT restored type II collagen expression that was reduced by 2DG, inhibited ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation, and induced COX‑2 expression. The expression of a glucose‑regulated protein, GRP78, which is an indicator of reduced ER‑stress, was decreased. To link the GT signaling pathway with pathways that inhibit 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress, inhibitors were treated in chondrocytes. The results revealed that, among the different signaling pathways triggered by ER‑stress, the p38 kinase pathway was involved in the inositol‑requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) downstream signaling pathway. Following inhibition of the IRE1 pathway, type II collagen expression was increased and COX‑2 expression was decreased. In addition, after examining the splicing of X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1) which is dependent on IRE1 activation induced by ER‑stress, it was revealed that GT inhibited the increase of XBP‑1s after splicing due to 2DG‑induced ER stress. GT in chondrocytes inhibited 2DG‑induced dedifferentiation and ER‑stress‑induced COX‑2 unglycosylation while regulating differentiation and  via the ER‑stress‑induced p38 kinase pathway downstream from the IRE1 pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657480>Preschool wheezing diagnosis and management - survey of physicians' and caregivers' perspective.</a></h2><p>Preschool children with wheezing disorders represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and consume disproportionately large amounts of healthcare resources .

Using inducible, stably transfected human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) capable of the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of  and , we provide evidence that deregulation of  or  expression in hESCs and their differentiated derivatives (neuroectodermal cells) results in distinct modulation of telomere homeostasis. Whereas HMGB1 enhances telomerase activity, HMGB2 acts as a negative regulator of telomerase activity in the cell. Stimulation of telomerase activity in the HMGB2-deficient cells may be related to activation of the PI3K/protein kinase B/ glycogen synthase kinase-3β/β-catenin signaling pathways by HMGB1, augmented TERT/telomerase RNA subunit transcription, and possibly also because of changes in telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) and TERRA-polyA transcription. The impact of  KD on telomerase transcriptional regulation observed in neuroectodermal cells is partially masked in hESCs by their pluripotent state. Our findings on differential roles of HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins in regulation of telomerase activity may suggest another possible outcome of HMGB1 targeting in cells, which is currently a promising approach aiming at increasing the anticancer activity of cytotoxic agents.-Kučírek, M., Bagherpoor, A.

Taking advantage of this possibility, TuMV virus-like particles (VLPs) have been genetically derivatized with a peptide from the chaperonin Hsp60, a protein described to be involved in  processes and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies against the peptide have been previously shown to have a diagnostic value in at least one autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. The functionalized Hsp60-VLPs showed their significant increase in sensing potency when compared to monoclonal antibody detection of the peptide in a conventional immunoassay. Additionally, the developed Hsp60-VLPs allowed the detection of autoantibodies against the Hsp60 peptide in an in vivo mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The detection of minute amounts of the autoantibodies allowed us to perform the analysis of their evolution during the progression of the disease. The anti-Hsp60 autoantibody levels in the sera of the inflamed mice went down during the induction phase of the disease. Increased levels of the anti-HSP60 autoantibodies were detected during the resolution phase of the disease. An extension of a previously proposed model for the involvement of Hsp60 in inflammatory processes is considered, incorporating a role for Hsp60 autoantibodies. This, and related models, can now be experimentally tested thanks to the autoantibody detection hypersensitivity provided by the functionalized VLPs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655532>IFN-? stimulated dental follicle mesenchymal stem cells regulate activated lymphocyte response in rheumatoid arthritis patients in vitro.</a></h2><p>Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. In this study, their immunosuppressive effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of RA patients were studied.Dental Follicle Stem Cells (DFSCs) were isolated from follicle tissue in the orofacial region. Characterization and multipotency analyses were performed. Lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral venous blood of RA patients (n=5) and healthy individuals (n=5). DFSCs were pre-incubated with IFN-? for 48 hr. PBMCs of RA patients and healthy individuals were separately cultured with or without DFSCs for 72 hours. After the culture period, lymphocyte proliferation and viability, the frequency of CD4+ CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells, IL-10 and TNF-? levels in the culture supernatants were measured via flow cytometry.Our results demonstrated that DFSCs suppressed proliferation of T lymphocytes by increasing the number of FoxP3 expressing CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells and suppressed lymphocyte apoptosis in RA patients.

The sepsis model was reproduced by CLP, and the cecum and perforation were not ligated in Sham group, and other operations were the same as CLP group. The mice in RAP+CLP group were intraperitoneally injected with autophagy agonist RAP 4 mg×kg×d 7 days before modeling, while the mice in Sham group and CLP group were not treated. Lung, liver, spleen and pancreas tissues were harvested for immunohistochemical staining 4 days after the operation, and the infiltration of neutrophils in various organs was observed under light microscope. Meanwhile, the expressions of immunosuppressive molecule PD-L1 and autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) in lung neutrophils were determined by immunofluorescence staining. (2) In vitro experiment: mouse bone marrow neutrophils were extracted and re-suspended to 1×10/L, and they were divided into blank control group (without any treatment), RAP control group (RAP 100 μmol/L), autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (Baf) control group (Baf 10 μmol/L), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation group (LPS 1 mg /L), RAP+LPS group, and Baf+LPS group. The latter two groups were pretreated with 100 μmol/L RAP or 10 μmol/L Baf 30 minutes before LPS stimulation, respectively. The expression of PD-L1 mRNA of neutrophils was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at 0, 4, 12 hours after LPS stimulation. At the same time, the expressions of PD-L1, LC3 and p62 at the protein level were determined by Western Blot.(1) In vivo experiment: according to immunohistochemical experiments, a large amount of infiltration of neutrophils in lung, liver, spleen and pancreas was found at 4 hours after CLP. In the immunofluorescence, with the time extension after CLP, the positive expression of LC3 in the lung tissue showed a decreased tendency, and PD-L1 expression was significantly increased. RAP pretreatment could promote the expression of LC3 and reduce the expression of PD-L1 in CLP mice. (2) In vitro experiment: in terms of mRNA levels, with the extension of LPS stimulation time, the expression of PD-L1 mRNA in mouse neutrophils was increased continuously, and peaked at 12 hours, it was significantly higher than that in the blank control group (2: 72.2±10.0 vs. 13.0±0.8, P < 0.01). Compared with LPS stimulation group, the expression of PD-L1 mRNA in RAP+LPS group was significantly down-regulated [12-hour PD-L1 mRNA (2): 47.4±7.3 vs. 72.2±10.0, P < 0.01]. In Baf+LPS group, PD-L1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated as compared with that in LPS stimulation group [12-hour PD-L1 mRNA (2): 109.1±7.4 vs. 72.2±10.0, P < 0.01]. At the protein levels, at 4 hours after LPS stimulation, the positive expressions of PD-L1, LC3 and p62 were increased significantly as compared with those in the blank control group, and PD-L1 and p62 were increased continuously with time. Compared with the LPS stimulation group, the expressions of PD-L1 and p62 in the RAP+LPS group were significantly down-regulated, while the expression of LC3 was continually increased, indicating that the level of autophagy was increased, and autophagy was circulated smoothly. On the contrary, the expressions of PD-L1, LC3 and p62 in the Baf+LPS group were significantly up-regulated, indicating that the binding of autophagy and lysosome was blocked, and autophagy was not smooth.In sepsis, the infiltration of neutrophils in all organs increased, and the expression of PD-L1 of neutrophils in lungs was increased significantly, while the expression level of autophagy was decreased. The expression of PD-L1 stimulated by LPS can be inhibited by autophagy agonists, and promoted by autophagy inhibitors. PD-L1 has a negative regulatory effect on sepsis. It can reduce the expression of PD-L1 molecule in sepsis by targeting autophagy, so as to improve sepsis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656991>Adiponectin and PPAR: a setup for intricate crosstalk between obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Adiponectin, a soluble adipocytokine, plays an important role in the functioning of adipose tissue and in the regulation of , particularly hepatic .

Thirty-five patients with 3-hour and 6-hour bundle from January to September in 2018 were served as the control group, and 67 patients who received 1-hour bundle from October 2018 to February 2019 were served as the observation group. The patients in the control group was treated with 3-hour and 6-hour bundle according to 2012 international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock; and those in the observation group were treated and nursed according to the 1-hour bundle published by Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) update 2018, and the sepsis cluster treatment medical team was established. The team members were trained in relevant knowledge and discussed the possible obstacles within the team and propose feasible measures. The implementation of the 1-hour bundle in the observation group was recorded. The general data of the patients in both groups including gender, age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), etc. were collected, and the outcome indicators (duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, 28-day mortality) were observed.In the observation group, 37 of 67 patients receiving 1-hour bundle met the target, with the overall achievement rate of 55.2% (37/67). Of the 37 eligible patients, 5 patients receiving 1-hour bundle met the target before the training of 1-hour bundle, accounting for only 33.3% (5/15) of the 15 patients who received 1-hour bundle during the same period. With the extension of training time, the achievement rate of sepsis 1-hour bundle was gradually increased [the achievement rate at 1 week and 4 weeks of training was 40.0% (4/10) and 52.4% (11/21), respectively], and increased to 81.0% (17/21) at the end of 12 weeks training. Thirty-seven patients who received 1-hour bundle and met the criteria were enrolled and compared with the control group. There was no significant difference in gender, age, or APACHE II score between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay of the observation group were significantly shortened (days: 6.15±0.49 vs. 7.24±0.53, days: 8.21±1.49 vs. 9.51±1.92), and the 28-day mortality was decreased significantly [10.8% (4/37) vs. 31.4% (11/35)], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05).Through teamwork, discussion and improvement, the achievement rate of sepsis 1-hour bundle can be significantly improved. The use of sepsis 1-hour bundle can effectively decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, and reduce the 28-day mortality.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655269>Functional characterization of galectin-3 from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and its regulatory role on monocytes/macrophages.</a></h2><p>Galectin-3 is a kind of β-galactoside-binding lectin involved in host defense against pathogen infection. However, the immune functions of fish galectin-3 remain poorly understood. In this study, the roles of a fish galectin-3 (OnGal-3) from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) on the binding activity on bacterial pathogens or PAMPs, the agglutinating activity on bacterial pathogens and the regulatory effects on monocytes/macrophages activity were investigated. After in vitro challenge of Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas hydrophila, OnGal-3 expressions were significantly up-regulated in monocytes/macrophages. In addition, recombinant OnGal-3(rOnGal-3) protein showed strong binding activity on bacterial pathogens or PAMPs. Also, rOnGal-3 agglutinated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, rOnGal-3 could induce the inflammatory factors expressions in monocytes/macrophages and enhance phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity of monocytes/macrophages. These results suggest that fish galectin-3 participates in anti-bacterial immune response through recognizing pathogens and modulating monocytes/macrophages activity.Copyright © 2019.

Inter-rater agreement of discomfort scores between endoscopist, patient and SSP was investigated using Cohen's Kappa statistic. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate the effects of patient and colonoscopy factors on comfort scores.SSPs had superior comfort score agreement with patients (0.638; 'moderate agreement') than endoscopists had with the same patients (0.526; 'weak agreement'). Male patients reported lower scores than female patients (OR 0.483, OR 0.499 [95% CI 0.344 to 0.723]; p<0.001). Endoscopists reported lower scores when there was better bowel prep (OR 0.512 [95% CI 0.279 to 0.938]; p=0.030). Agreement was worse at higher levels of discomfort.There is variability in perceived comfort levels between healthcare providers and patients during screening colonoscopy, which is greater at worse levels of discomfort.

Neonates receiving continuous infusion of dobutamine 5-20 μg kg min were included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output of right and left ventricle (RVO, LVO) were measured on echocardiography; heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral regional oxygen saturation were recorded from patient monitors.28 neonates with median (range) gestational age of 30.4 (22.7 - 41.0) weeks and birth weight (BW) of 1618 (465 - 4380) g were included. PK data was adequately described by one-compartmental linear structural model. Dobutamine clearance (CL) was described by allometric scaling on BW with sigmoidal maturation function of postmenstrual age (PMA). The final population PK model parameter mean typical value (standard error) estimates, standardised to median BW of 1618 g, were 41.2 (44.5) l h for CL and 5.29 (0.821) l for volume of distribution, which shared a common between subject variability of 29(17.2) %. The relationship between dobutamine concentration and RVO/LVEF was described by linear model, between concentration and LVO/HR/MAP/cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction by sigmoidal E model.In postnatal transitional period PK of dobutamine was described by one-compartmental linear model, CL related to BW and PMA. A concentration-response relationship with haemodynamic variables has been established.This article is protected by copyright.

Our transcriptomic  adenocarcinoma approach allows us to measure the expression dynamics and regulation of bacterial virulence and response factors in real time, and is a novel strategy for clarifying the role of  infection in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Our data show that: (i) infection alters metabolic and functional pathways in , allowing the bacterium to adapt to the host-imposed milieu; (ii) infection also stimulates the expression of genes required to help induce and promote a hypoxic and inflammatory microenvironment in the host; and (iii)  invasion occurs by a haematogenous route of infection. Our study identifies novel gene targets from  that are activated during invasion and which may aid in determining how this species invades and promotes disease within the human gastrointestinal tract. These invasion-specific genes may be useful as biomarkers for CRC progression in a host and could also assist in the development of new diagnostic tools and treatments (such as vaccines or small molecule drug targets), which will be able to combat infection and  in the host while circumventing the potential problem of  tolerization.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659597>Retrospective study of systemic immune- index in muscle invasive bladder cancer: initial results of single centre.</a></h2><p>We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the preoperative systemic immune- index (SII) in patients who underwent radical cystectomy due to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).We researched our cystectomy database between April 2006 and December 2018. Demographic data, operation and postoperative data were recorded. There were 191 MIBC patients who underwent radical cystectomy. After detailed analyses, preoperative SII was calculated by the formula as "(neutrophil) × (platelet)/(lymphocyte)". Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were examined. The prognostic value of SII was analysed with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to determine the optimum SII. Significant P was P < 0.05.The mean follow-up was 37 ± 6.7 months. The mean age of patients was 62.1 ± 9 years. The optimal cutoff value of SII was determined as 843 in ROC curve (area under the curve: 0.9; P < 0.001). The CSS and OS were significantly poor in patients with higher SII level (respectively; P < 0.001, P = 0.04). Gender, lymph node involvement, pathologic stage, grade and SII were statistically significant in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model for CSS.Preoperative elevated SII could be an independent prognostic factor in MIBC patients who underwent radical cystectomy. If SII > 843, CSS might be poor. Our results should be confirmed with randomised-controlled prospectively designed future studies with large cohorts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657237>Midlife women's health consequences associated with polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female endocrinopathies.

However, the mechanisms leading to increased platelet aggregability associated with smoking are only partially defined. A potential role has been hypothesized for immature platelets, a younger and potentially more reactive fraction, previously associated to the main determinants of coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, the aim of our study was to define the impact of smoking on the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and its relationship with prevalence and extent of coronary artery disease.We enrolled a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single center. Significant CAD was defined as at least 1 vessel stenosis >50%, while severe CAD was defined as left main and/or three-vessel disease. IPF was measured at admission by routine blood cells count (A Sysmex XE-2100).We included in our study 2553 patients, that were divided according smoking status (active smokers: 512; non-active smokers: 2041). Smokers were younger, more frequent males, with lower rate of diabetes mellitus, previous PCI, previous CABG (p<0.001, respectively) and were in treatment less often with ARB, BB, nitrates, statins, ASA, Clopidogrel, CCB, diuretics (p<0.001, respectively) as compared to non-active smokers. Higher percentage of smokers was observed in patients with higher IPF values, and at multivariate analysis active smoking resulted an independent predictor of higher IPF (adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.59[1.03-2.45] P=0.035). Among smokers, higher IPF were associated to lower ejection fraction (p=0.034), percentage of acute coronary syndrome (p=0.002) and platelet count (p<0.001) compared to ones with lower IPF. However, the IPF (according to quartiles values) were not associated to the prevalence and extent of CAD (82.5%, 80.4%, 86.1%, 80.9%, from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively,adjusted OR[95%CI]=0.98[0.79-1.23] P=0.89) and severe CAD (31%, 31.1%, 39.1%, 35.2%,from 1 to 4 quartile, respectively, adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.03[0.86-1.23] P=0.76).The present study shows an independent association between active smoking and the levels of immature platelet fraction in patients undergoing coronary angiography. However, among active smokers, IPF did not result an independent predictor of CAD or severe CAD.© 2019 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656505>Aerobic exercise modulates cytokine profile and sleep quality in elderly.</a></h2><p>Sleep disturbance is a major problem for older adults which can be exacerbated by increased  as aging is associated with increased circulating pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is a need to develop alternative medicine techniques to help improve sleep quality in the elderly.To investigate the effects of aerobic exercise training on the sleep quality and inflammatory cytokines in elderly subjects.Forty previously sedentary elderly subjects participated in this study, their age ranged from 61- 67 years. All subjects were randomly assigned to supervised aerobic exercise intervention group (group A, n=25) or control group (group B, n=25). Polysomnographic recordings for sleep quality assessment, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured before and after 6 months at the end of the study.There was a significant increase in total sleep duration, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency in group(A) after 6 months of aerobic exercise training, while, wake time after sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latency significantly reduced after 6 months of aerobic training compared with values obtained prior to aerobic exercise training. Also, the mean values of TNF- α and IL-6 decreased significantly and the mean value of IL-10 significantly increased in group (A) after the aerobic exercise training, however the results of the control group were not significant. Moreover, there were significant differences between both groups at the end of the study.Exercise training can be considered as a non-pharmacological modality for modifying sleep quality and  among elderly.© 2019 Abd El-Kader et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659144>Adipose tissue-derived Omentin-1 attenuates arterial calcification via AMPK/Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue-derived adipokines mediate various kind of crosstalk between adipose tissue and other organs and thus regulate metabolism balance,  state as well as disease progression. In particular, omentin-1, a newly found adipokine, has been reported to exhibit anti-calcification effects  and . However, little is known about the function of endogenous adipose tissue-derived omentin-1 in arterial calcification and the detailed mechanism involved. Here, we demonstrated that global omentin-1 knockout (omentin-1) resulted in more obvious arterial calcification in 5/6-nephrectomy plus high phosphate diet treated (5/6 NTP) mice while overexpression of omentin-1 attenuated attenuates osteoblastic differentiation and mineralisation of VSMCs  and 5/6 NTP-induced mice arterial calcification .

Here, we aim to analyse a panel of circulating miRNAs in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and individuals with type 1 diabetes.We adopted standardised methodologies for extracting miRNAs from small sample volumes to evaluate a profiling panel of mature miRNAs in paired plasma and laser-captured microdissected immune-infiltrated islets of recently diabetic and normoglycaemic NOD mice. Moreover, we validated the findings during disease progression and remission after anti-CD3 therapy in NOD mice, as well as in individuals with type 1 diabetes.Plasma levels of five miRNAs were downregulated in diabetic vs normoglycaemic mice. Of those, miR-409-3p was also downregulated in situ in the immune islet infiltrates of diabetic mice, suggesting an association with disease pathogenesis. Target-prediction tools linked miR-409-3p to immune- and metabolism-related signalling molecules. In situ miR-409-3p expression correlated with insulitis severity, and CD8 central memory T cells were found to be enriched in miR-409-3p. Plasma miR-409-3p levels gradually decreased during diabetes development and improved with disease remission after anti-CD3 antibody therapy. Finally, plasma miR-409-3p levels were lower in people recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes compared with a non-diabetic control group, and levels were inversely correlated with HbA levels.We propose that miR-409-3p may represent a new circulating biomarker of islet  and type 1 diabetes severity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660511>A rare case of stiff left atrial syndrome caused by both coconut left atrium and vertebral compression: a case report.</a></h2><p>Calcification of the left atrium (LA) is a rare condition and can be the result of long-standing rheumatic mitral stenosis or an unusual complication after mitral valve replacement. Cases of massive LA calcification have sometimes been referred to as those with 'coconut LA' or 'porcelain LA'.A 75-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of chest discomfort and exertional dyspnoea. Doppler echocardiography revealed the presence of elevated filling pressure with significant LA dysfunction. A cardiac catheter examination revealed a quite impressive pulmonary capillary wedge pressure waveform with a steep up-slope and prominent  wave of 43 mmHg (mean: 15 mmHg). Multidetector row computed tomography revealed that LA was sandwiched by dense calcifications along the roof and bottom of the LA, and the posterior wall was compressed by a vertebral body. Integration of these functional and anatomical findings ultimately led to the diagnosis of 'stiff LA syndrome'.She had a history of tuberculosis but no history of rheumatic fever or cardiac surgery. Thus, it appeared that the tuberculous pericarditis might have led to the calcified LA by long lasting . In this case, the LA was encased by a dense calcification and compressed by vertebral body from the posterior direction. Therefore, we speculated that the LA pressure could easily elevate even with a slight haemodynamic load in this special case, and thus eventually resulting in decompensated heart failure.© The Author(s) 2019.

There is growing evidence that in addition to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), aging critically impairs pathways determining cellular resilience to oxidative stressors. In young organisms, the evolutionarily conserved nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response pathway maintains cellular reduction-oxidation homeostasis and promotes a youthful cellular phenotype by regulating the transcription of an array of cytoprotective (antioxidant, pro-survival, anti-inflammatory and macromolecular damage repair) genes. A critical mechanism by which increased ROS production and Nrf2 dysfunction promote vascular aging and exacerbate pathogenesis of age-related vascular diseases is induction of cellular senescence, an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Senescent cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotypic alterations, contributing to impairment of angiogenic processes, chronic sterile , remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and barrier dysfunction. Herein, we review mechanisms contributing to dysregulation of Nrf2-driven cytoprotective responses in the aged vasculature and discuss the multifaceted role of Nrf2 dysfunction in the genesis of age-related pathologies affecting the circulatory system, including its role in induction of cellular senescence. Therapeutic strategies that restore Nrf2 signaling and improve vascular resilience in aging are explored to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660868>Aging progression of human gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Human gut microbiota are important for human health and have been regarded as a "forgotten organ", whose variation is closely linked with various factors, such as host genetics, diet, pathological conditions and external environment. The diversity of human gut microbiota has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut microbiota changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with  and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut microbiota along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing probiotics to maintain the gut microbiota to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656499>Association of inflammatory biomarkers with lung cancer in North Indian population.</a></h2><p>Lung cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth of the lung tissues.

The serum levels of CRP, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in lung cancer patients and healthy control groups.The levels of serum CRP, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in lung cancer patients when compared with controls(P<0.0001). The levels of these biomarkers were also significantly higher in stage iii/iv as compared to stage i/ii(P<0.001). Significant difference in the levels of these biomarkers were also found in smoker and non-smoker lung cancer patients as compared to controls(P<0.001).CRP, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 are the promising biomarkers in the identification of lung cancer patients.

Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid cell-specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous B cell malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-B cell leukemia/lymphoma.

Traditionally, the aerial parts of this plant are used to treat the cancer-related symptoms, , pain, and feverish conditions. However, the scientific evidence related to its traditional effects especially the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms needs to be illuminated.The main objectives of our study were to explore in-vitro anti-cancer properties of OEO in 2D and 3D conditions, to understand the mechanism of OEO in the induction of death in cancer cells, and to identify in-vivo anti-tumor effect of OEO and induced immunomodulatory effects.OEO was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS method. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of OEO on 4T1 cancer monolayer cells (2D culture) and spheroids (3D cultures), MTT (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used. Fluorescence staining, various flow cytometry techniques, colorimetric assay, electrophoresis, and comet assay were performed to understand the anti-cancer mechanisms of OEO and determine the death mode in treated 4T1 cells. In animal studies, mouse mammary tumor model was established, the anti-tumor effect of OEO was investigated and ultimately by using the ELISA cytokine assay, immunostimulatory of OEO was studied.According to GC/MS analysis, thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, and γ-terpinene were identified as main components of OEO. Based on MTT assay, OEO inhibited viability in 4T1 cancer cell without any significant effect on L929 normal cells in 2D, also the anti-proliferative effects of OEO on 4T1 spheroids (3D) was significant but less extent. Our results revealed that OEO induces apoptosis through ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) disruption, caspase3 activation, and DNA damage. Evaluating the effectiveness of OEO on 4T1 tumor-challenging mice and cytokine assay confirmed anti-tumor effects of OEO and development of an immune response related to Th1 expansion.These data shed light on the apoptotic mechanisms related to OEO cytotoxicity and introduced this compound as a candidate in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019.

The phenolic/flavonoid contents of ethyl acetate extract of fermented pine needle (EAE-FPN) is higher than other pine product extracts (hexane/water). The levels of antioxidant indices (TEAC, DPPH) as well as free radical scavenging activity (H O ) were significantly improved in EAE-FPN than other pine needle product extracts. The levels of ROS and various inflammatory markers (NO, PGE2, TNF-α, and IL-1β/6) were considerably abolished by EAE-FPN in a dose-dependent manner (50-200 μg/ml). Moreover, the protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit were also markedly downregulated by EAE-FPN. Collectively, EAE-FPN with phenolic/flavonoid content showed excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties via modulating NF-κB signaling pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Pine needle drink (Pinus morrisonicola Hay) has been used as a functional beverage for many years due to its various biological properties in Asia especially in Taiwan, China, and Korea. Many researchers hinted various biological activity of fermented pine needle product but none of them explored the in-depth mechanism underpinning its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell model. Hence, the current cell line study was designed to assess the underlying mechanism behind the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of Pine needles extract (both non-fermented and fermented) in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells (macrophage). The outcome of this study distinctly showed that EAE-FPN displayed potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities by regulating NF-κB signaling pathway. Therefore, pine needle could be developed into functional drink to abolish the progression of inflammatory responses in various disease condition.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661433>Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level.</a></h2><p>Nanomedicine, the offspring born from the marriage of nanotechnology and medicine, has already brought momentous advances in the fight against a plethora of unmet diseases from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative to diabetes and cancer.

GCs are also widely used in anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant drugs. GCs are synthesized by the adrenal cortex as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by intestinal epithelial cells, among other peripheral sites. GCs are one of the main therapy choices for the exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, but they are not useful to prolong remission, and development of tolerance with secondary treatment failure is frequent. Thus, GC actions at the intestinal epithelial level are of great importance, both physiologically and pharmacologically. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1) mouse model to study the effects of GCs on epithelial cells .  deletion in epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon was associated with limited colonic  at 1 wk postdeletion, involving augmented epithelial proliferation and mucus production, plus local and systemic immune/inflammatory changes. This phenotype regressed substantially, but not completely, after 2 wk. The mechanism may involve augmented inflammatory signaling by epithelial cells or defective barrier function. We conclude that the epithelial GC receptor plays a significant role in colonic homeostasis in basal conditions, but its deficiency can be compensated in the short term.

Their actual chemical compositions were ascertained by XPS which revealed a fair control of the final gel composition obtained from the initial molar ratio in the reaction solution. Zeta potential measurements confirmed the controlled charge bias on which swelling ratio was found to strongly depend, i.e., positively charged or negatively charged gels have a higher tendency to swell than poly(SA-co-TMA) made of 50 mol% of each unit. The anti-biofouling properties were also correlated to the charge bias, i.e., negatively charged and neutral gels resisted well to biofouling by fibrinogen and whole blood, and were much less cytotoxic than their positive counterparts. Applied as wound-dressing materials onto diabetic wounds, it was found that wound closure was almost reached after 21 days, regardless of the gel composition. However, histological analysis revealed that positively charged gels accelerated hemostasis, while neutral gels, much less cytotoxic, were more efficient in the following stages during which the granulation layer and dermis were fully remodelled leading to a dense fibroblast population and thick collagen with no sign of .

It is unclear how the imbalanced regulation of inflammatory mediators contributes to epilepsy. A recent research goal is to identify interconnected  pathways which may be involved in the development of epilepsy. The clinical use of available antiepileptic drugs is often restricted by their limitations, incidence of several side effects, and drug interactions. So development of new drugs, which modulate epilepsy through novel mechanisms, is necessary. Alternative therapies and diet have recently reported positive treatment outcomes in epilepsy.

In addition, neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of Vit D in clinical and preclinical studies of epilepsy were reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658258>Pgp3 seroprevalence and associations with active trachoma and ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection in Malawi: cross-sectional surveys in six evaluation units.</a></h2><p>Following one to five years of antibiotic mass drug administration (MDA) for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem, programmes must conduct impact surveys to inform decisions on whether MDA is still needed. These decisions are currently based on the prevalence of trachomatous -follicular (TF), which, after MDA, correlates poorly with prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection.Impact surveys in six evaluation units (EUs) of Malawi were used as a platform to explore associations between the prevalence of TF, ocular C. trachomatis infection and anti-Pgp3 antibodies one year after the third annual round of MDA. Participants were examined for trachoma using the World Health Organization simplified grading system. Ocular swabs and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from children aged 1-9 years. Swabs were tested for C. trachomatis DNA using GeneXpert. DBS were assayed for anti-Pgp3 antibodies using ELISA. EU-level prevalence of TF in children aged 1-9 years ranged from 4.7% (95% CI 3.4-6.3) to 7.2% (95% CI 5.8-8.9). Prevalence of C. trachomatis infection in children ranged from 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.6) to 0.7% (95% CI 0.3-1.3) while Pgp3 seroprevalence ranged from 6.9% (95% CI 5.4-8.6) to 12.0% (95% CI 10.1-14.0) and increased with age.Based on current global policy, the prevalence of TF indicates that a further year of antibiotic MDA is warranted in four of six EUs yet the very low levels of infection cast doubt on the universal applicability of TF-based cut-offs for antibiotic MDA. Pgp3 seroprevalence was similar to that reported following MDA in other settings that have reached the elimination target however the predictive value of any particular level of seropositivity with respect to risk of subsequent infection recrudescence is, as yet, unknown.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658270>Evolution of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway is associated with decreased cytolytic immune infiltration.</a></h2><p>The somatic co-evolution of tumors and the cellular immune responses that combat them drives the diversity of immune-tumor interactions. This includes tumor mutations that generate neo-antigenic epitopes that elicit cytotoxic T-cell activity and subsequent pressure to select for genetic loss of antigen presentation. Most studies have focused on how tumor missense mutations can drive tumor immunity, but frameshift mutations have the potential to create far greater antigenic diversity. However, expression of this antigenic diversity is potentially regulated by Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) and NMD has been shown to be of variable efficiency in cancers. Here we studied how mutational changes influence global NMD and cytolytic immune responses. Using TCGA datasets, we derived novel patient-level metrics of 'NMD burden' and interrogated how different mutation and most importantly NMD burdens influence cytolytic activity using machine learning models and survival outcomes. We find that NMD is a significant and independent predictor of immune cytolytic activity. Different indications exhibited varying dependence on NMD and mutation burden features. We also observed significant co-alteration of genes in the NMD pathway, with a global increase in NMD efficiency in patients with NMD co-alterations. Finally, NMD burden also stratified patient survival in multivariate regression models in subset of cancer types. Our work suggests that beyond selecting for mutations that elicit NMD in tumor suppressors, tumor evolution may react to the selective pressure generated by  to globally enhance NMD through coordinated amplification and/or mutation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659032>An antibody against HK blocks Alzheimer's disease peptide β-amyloid-induced bradykinin release in human plasma.</a></h2><p>Bradykinin is a proinflammatory factor that mediates angioedema and  in many diseases. It is a key player in some types of hereditary angioedema and is involved in septic shock, traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke, among others. Activation of the plasma contact system leads to elevated levels of plasma kallikrein, which cleaves high molecular weight kininogen (HK) to release bradykinin. Drug development for bradykinin-meditated pathologies has focused on designing inhibitors to the enzymes that cleave HK (to prevent bradykinin release) or antagonists of endothelial bradykinin receptors (to prevent downstream bradykinin action). Here we show a strategy to block bradykinin generation by using an HK antibody that binds to HK, preventing its cleavage and subsequent bradykinin release. We show that this antibody blocks dextran sodium sulfate-induced HK cleavage and bradykinin production. Moreover, while the pathogenic AD peptide β-amyloid (Aβ)42 cleaves HK and induces a dramatic increase in bradykinin production, our HK antibody blocked these events from occurring. These results may provide strategies for developing treatments for bradykinin-driven pathologies.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Brain-mediated mechanisms are involved in this endogenous anti-inflammatory effect, but nothing is known about the putative role of the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex (which has recently been described as a powerful mechanism involved in the suppression of immune response) during immune tolerance. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that endotoxin tolerance is at least in part mediated by the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex. Body core temperature (Tb) was measured in rats previously submitted to splenectomy. Immune tolerance was induced by means of five consecutive LPS (100 μg/kg) intraperitoneal injections at 24-h intervals. In sham operated rats, we observed a significant reduction of the febrile response to repeated administration of LPS, which was not altered in rats submitted to splenectomy. Moreover, plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6] and prostaglanding E (PGE) surges besides preoptic PGE levels were observed after the first LPS administration but not in tolerant animals, and this pattern was kept the same in splenectomized rats. These data are consistent with the notion that the splenic anti-inflammatory reflex does not modulate immune tolerance in rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The macrophage mediator in resolving , maresin 1 (MaR1), is a potent immunoresolvent, stimulating resolution of acute  and organ protection. Using an unbiased screening of greater than 200 GPCRs, we identified MaR1 as a stereoselective activator for human leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), expressed in phagocytes. MaR1 specificity for recombinant human LGR6 activation was established using reporter cells expressing LGR6 and functional impedance sensing. MaR1-specific binding to LGR6 was confirmed using 3H-labeled MaR1. With human and mouse phagocytes, MaR1 (0.01-10 nM) enhanced phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and phosphorylation of a panel of proteins including the ERK and cAMP response element-binding protein. These MaR1 actions were significantly amplified with LGR6 overexpression and diminished by gene silencing in phagocytes. Thus, we provide evidence for MaR1 as an endogenous activator of human LGR6 and a novel role of LGR6 in stimulating MaR1's key proresolving functions of phagocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659585>The Association of Cigarette Smoke Exposure with Lung Cellular Toxicity and Oxidative Stress: the Protective Role of Crocin.</a></h2><p>Cigarette smoke (CS) contains many free radicals and toxic chemicals. Nuclear erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcriptional regulator of several phase II antioxidant genes, including glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL). In this study, it was hypothesized that Crocin may mediate antioxidant signaling pathway to protect human lung epithelial cells against CS-mediated toxicity and oxidative stress via inducing glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and activation of Nrf2 pathway. Alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to 1, 2.5 and 5% cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) with or without Crocin (500 μM). After 48 h exposure, the cytotoxicity, oxidant/antioxidant parameters and the Nrf2 pathway modification were assayed. Treatment of A549 cells with all concentrations of CSE dose dependently decreased cell viability, antioxidant levels, GCL and Nrf2 gene expression, which was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Crocin not only restored CSE-depleted GSH levels by enhancing GCL expression via activation of Nrf2 but also quenched the CSE-generation and release of reactive oxygen species. Crocin attenuated CSE-mediated Nrf2 modifications, thereby inducing its nuclear accumulation associated with GCL gene transcription leading to enhanced GSH levels. By inducing GSH synthesis, Crocin attenuates CSE-mediated GSH depletion and protects cells against CSE-induced oxidative stress via Nrf2 pathway. These results may have implications in dietary modulation of natural antioxidants in treatment of pulmonary diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658116>Sevoflurane Promotes Bactericidal Properties of Macrophages through Enhanced Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Expression in Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Sevoflurane has antiinflammatory properties, but less is known about effects on infectious inflammationSevoflurane effects on macrophage function in  are not well understood WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In a lipopolysaccharide model of , sevoflurane increased mouse macrophage nitric oxide synthase activity and bacteria phagocytosis in vitro and in vivoThese effects were abolished by pharmacologically inhibiting nitric oxide synthase expressionIn endotoxemia in mice, sevoflurane had bactericidal effects BACKGROUND:: Sevoflurane with its antiinflammatory properties has shown to decrease mortality in animal models of sepsis. However, the underlying mechanism of its beneficial effect in this inflammatory scenario remains poorly understood. Macrophages play an important role in the early stage of sepsis as they are tasked with eliminating invading microbes and also attracting other immune cells by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Thus, the authors hypothesized that sevoflurane mitigates the proinflammatory response of macrophages, while maintaining their bactericidal properties.Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide in the presence and absence of 2% sevoflurane. Expression of cytokines and inducible NO synthase as well as uptake of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli (E. coli) were measured. The in vivo endotoxemia model consisted of an intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection after anesthesia with either ketamine and xylazine or 4% sevoflurane. Male mice (n = 6 per group) were observed for a total of 20 h. During the last 30 min fluorescently labeled E. coli were intraperitoneally injected. Peritoneal cells were extracted by peritoneal lavage and inducible NO synthase expression as well as E. coli uptake by peritoneal macrophages was determined using flow cytometry.In vitro, sevoflurane enhanced lipopolysaccharide-induced inducible NO synthase expression after 8 ;h by 466% and increased macrophage uptake of fluorescently labeled E. coli by 70% compared with vehicle-treated controls. Inhibiting inducible NO synthase expression pharmacologically abolished this increase in bacteria uptake. In vivo, inducible NO synthase expression was increased by 669% and phagocytosis of E. coli by 49% compared with the control group.Sevoflurane enhances phagocytosis of bacteria by lipopolysaccharide-challenged macrophages in vitro and in vivo via an inducible NO synthase-dependent mechanism.

The abnormal activation of TLRs contributes to the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that involves the aberrant expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the subsequent dermal γδ T cell and T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses. The inhibition of TLR-mediated  provides an important strategy to treat psoriasis. Here, we examined the preventative effects of MHP1-AcN in a mouse model of imiquimod (a TLR 7/8 agonist)-induced psoriasis. Topical imiquimod application induced psoriasis-like skin lesions on the ear and dorsal skin. Systemic administration of MHP1-AcN by daily subcutaneous injection significantly prevented the development of skin lesions, including erythema, scaling and thickening. Mice treated with MHP1-AcN showed reduced levels of skin Il6 mRNA at 32 h and reduced levels of Il23 and Il17a mRNA at d9. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-23 were reduced at 32 h, and IL-17A was reduced at d9. These results indicated that MHP1-AcN could decrease imiquimod-induced IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17A production.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which p38α in macrophages contributes to SAP. We used conditional knockout of p38α in macrophages and p38 MAPK inhibitors to understand the effects of p38α in macrophages on caerulein-induced inflammatory responses in SAP mice models.Wild-type (WT) mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, SAP group, and SAP + p38MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) group, and mice with a conditional knockout (KO) of p38α in macrophages were included in a KO + SAP group. We evaluated pancreatic pathology and ultra-structure by hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. The pulmonary wet-to-dry weight ratio was calculated. The serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were determined by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-18, MIF, and MCP-1 in pancreatic tissues were tested by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. The protein expression of p38, caspase-1, ULK1, LC3B and p62 in pancreatic tissues was examined by Western blotting.The results indicated that the severity of SAP as well as the expression of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-18 and MCP-1 were higher in the SAP group than those in the control group, but were lower in the SAP + SB203580 and KO + SAP groups as compared with the SAP group. The protein expression of p38, caspase-1, LC3B and p62 was increased in the SAP group than that in the control group, but this result was reversed in the SAP + SB203580 and KO + SAP groups as compared with the SAP group. In addition, the ULK1 level was significantly lower in the SAP group than that in the control group, but was increased in the SAP + SB203580 and KO + SAP groups as compared with the SAP group.Our findings demonstrated that, macrophage derived p38α promoted the experimental severe acute pancreatitis by regulating  and autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Vitamin D and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are environmental factors that are associated by several pathways, including changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome, with the development and course of IBD. : This review explores the interaction of vitamin D, and UVR, with the intestinal innate and adaptive immune systems, and how they may influence the gut microbiome and the subsequent development, and progression, of IBD. : Vitamin D and UVR both regulate innate and adaptive immunity through a combination of common and independent mechanisms, with the overall effect being the promotion of immune tolerance. Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal microbiome either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal  in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut microbiome.

Increased ZBP-1 expression in necroptosis-associated  correlates with activation of receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK1)/RIPK3 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Here we explored the role of ZBP-1-mediated necroptosis in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) transfected with a small interfering RNA against ZBP-1 or scrambled control RNA were administered to mice that had been depleted of alveolar macrophages (AMs). Then the animals were treated with E. coli LPS (2.0 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline by intratracheal instillation for 48 h. LPS-induced lung inflammatory injury was verified, and the mRNA and protein expression of ZBP-1, RIPK1/RIPK3 and NF-κB in AMs were then assessed by Western blot and real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In mechanistic studies in vitro, BMDM cultures were treated with different concentrations of LPS for 24 h, and the expression of ZBP-1, RIPK1/RIPK3 and NF-κB were assessed. LPS activated ZBP-1-mediated necroptosis, primarily in AMs. This activation and associated lung inflammatory injury were much weaker after AMs depletion or silencing of ZBP-1 in BMDMs, which correlated with down-regulation of RIPK1/RIPK3. These in vivo findings were confirmed in experiments with cultures of BMDMs. In conclusion, LPS induces lung  and injury by activating ZBP-1-mediated necroptosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The approach is based on the reconstruction of the phase dynamics model from observations and on a subsequent exploration of this model. For the system, driven by several inputs, we suggest a dynamical disentanglement procedure, allowing us to reconstruct the variability of the system's output that is due to a particular observed input, or, alternatively, to reconstruct the variability which is caused by all the inputs except for the observed one. We focus on the application of the method to the vagal component of the heart rate variability caused by a respiratory influence.

In the end, 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, with a total of 139 patients enrolled. The descriptive results indicated that the use of PRGF may help reduce pain and  after tooth extraction. To some extent, it is beneficial to the management of dry socket after extraction.Quality assessment indicated all the included studies were judged to be at high risk of bias with low quality.

The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress and compromised intestinal functions can contribute to multi-organ injury under heat environment. Resveratrol (RSV) has significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of RSV on intestinal function (digestion and barrier), oxidative stress and  in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg RSV/kg body weight/day prior to daily heat stress (40 °C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. The results showed that RSV reversed the increased serum cortisol level and diamine oxidase activity, the altered jejunal morphology, the decreased jejunal disaccharidase activities, the elevated malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities in the jejunum, as well as the increased jejunal mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4, cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins in heat-stressed rats, to various degrees. In conclusion, RSV could alleviate intestinal injury and dysfunctions by improving oxidative status and suppressing  in heat-stressed rats.Copyright © 2019.

This parallel-cohort, phase 1 study was conducted to investigate skin irritation potential and safety of crisaborole in healthy Japanese adults (cohort 1) and the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of crisaborole and metabolites AN7602 and AN8323 in Japanese adults with mild to moderate AD (cohort 2). In cohort 1, 20 healthy volunteers received single applications of crisaborole and vehicle simultaneously on separate locations under 48-h occlusion. In cohort 2, 12 patients with mild to moderate AD received crisaborole (n = 10) or vehicle (n = 2) twice daily for 8 days. Skin irritation and safety were assessed in cohort 1. Pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed in cohort 2. Skin irritation index (scale 0-400) was 40.0 for crisaborole and 5.0 for vehicle. No treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were reported in cohort 1. The most common TEAE in the crisaborole group in cohort 2 were application site irritation (n = 7) and application site pain (n = 4). Crisaborole was rapidly absorbed, with limited systemic exposure between days 1 and 8 that was comparable with that seen in US-based participants in previous trials.

ADHD was diagnosed with Conners' Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview (n=14) and were matched for gender and age against normal controls (n=30). Three computer-based tasks, Stroop test, Stroop Plus, and Perceptual Selectivity test were completed. Accuracy (%) and response time (ms) were measured. Generalized Estimating Equations method was used to analyse those repeated measurements data. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each test.Mean age of cases was 47.29 (SD 9.03), 9 males. Mean age of controls was 41.57 (SD 11.42), 13 males. Individuals with ADHD had significantly worse performances in both accuracy and response time in all the tests. The best discriminate ability was the Stroop test (accuracy and response time), followed by the Perceptual Selectivity test (response time). Comparisons of AUCs of the tests did not show any significant differences. Age had a significant effect on the Stroop and Stroop Plus tests but not in the Perceptual Selectivity test.Adults with ADHD have a longer response time and perform less accurately than controls.

This work aims to evaluate in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells the protective role of GPETAFLR on both oxidative and inflammatory markers known to be involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In comparison with stimulated control cells, GPETAFLR increased glutathione production and diminished the secretion and gene expression of VEFG, IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF-α, as well as reactive oxygen species, and nitrite output. Our findings reveal that GPETAFLR, a novel plant peptide, is able to protect against RPE oxidative stress and . Taken together, these results strongly support innovative nutritional strategies considering Lupinus angustifolius L. as source of proteins to prevent the onset and progression of AMD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: We reveal a novel nutraceutical impact of GPETAFLR peptide in human RPE cells to prevent oxidative and inflammatory mediators. Our results support that the intake of Lupine angustifolius L., proposed to be a reservoir of GPETAFLR, could lessen the functional decay of RPE cells, leading therefore to a slowdown of the progress of AMD during age.

The expression of RANKL in samples was tested by ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The production of RANKL in THP-1 macrophages stimulated with P. gingivalis was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Then macrophages were pre-treated with neutralizing antibodies of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) and inhibitors of TLR2, LOX-1 or Erk1/2 before P. gingivalis stimulation to evaluate the roles of TLR2, LOX-1 and Erk1/2 in RANKL production by qRT-PCR and Western blot.The protein level of RANKL was higher in PICF of peri-implantitis patients than healthy implants. We observed increased RANKL expression in P. gingivalis infected macrophages compared to controls.

Parry Romberg syndrome (PRS) is also a very rare disease, and the underlying aetiology remains unknown. We present a rare case of CAAs in a patient with PRS, and discuss possible implications regarding the primary pathophysiological cause for both of these diseases.A 48-year-old woman with a history of PRS presented with atypical and non-exertional chest pain. Initial evaluation demonstrated a rising troponin without associated electrocardiogram changes, and as such she was taken for left heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated diffuse aneurysmal and ectatic disease of multiple coronary arteries. Further evaluation with magnetic resonance angiogram and autoantibody panel did not demonstrate other vascular anomalies or rheumatologic disease, respectively. She was treated with dual anti-platelet therapy and statin, and at 1 year follow-up, she had resolution of her symptoms.It has been postulated that the underlying mechanism causing CAA is intravascular . Parry Romberg syndrome is theorized to be a neurovasculopathy, as evidenced by cases of associated intracranial aneurysms.

Inflammatory reaction plays important roles in I/R-induced intestinal damage and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) has been identified as an endogenous anti-inflammatory regulator by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Our previous research has shown that the pretreatment with inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane protects intestinal I/R injury. However, whether the protection induced by sevoflurane is mediated by inhibiting intestinal inflammatory reaction via activation of PPARγ/NF-κB pathway is underdetermined. In this study, we investigated the effects of sevoflurane on intestinal inflammatory reaction during intestinal I/R and the role of PPARγ/NF-κB pathway.Rat model of intestinal I/R was used in this study. The superior mesenteric artery was clamped for 60 min followed by 120-min reperfusion. Sevoflurane at 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration was inhaled for 30 min before ischemic insult. GW9662, a specific PPARγ antagonist, was injected intraperitoneally before sevoflurane inhalation.Intestinal I/R caused severe intestinal mucosa histopathological injury evaluated by Chiu's scoring, induced epithelial cell apoptosis evaluated by terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and activation of caspase-3, upregulated serum MOD levels, reduced protein expression of Bcl-2 and PPARγ, increased protein expression of NF-κB P65 and proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in the intestine. Sevoflurane preconditioning significantly ameliorated these changes induced by intestinal I/R. However, GW9662 partly blocked the protective effects induced by sevoflurane.Our results suggest sevoflurane-induced protection against intestinal I/R injury is partly mediated by inhibiting intestinal inflammatory reaction via activation of PPARγ/NF-κB pathway.© 2019 S.

Although excess leptin levels have been associated with vascular  and cardiovascular disease in the context of obesity, the effects of chronic leptin treatment on vascular function remain unknown in CGL. Here, we hypothesized that leptin treatment will improve endothelial function via direct vascular mechanisms. We investigated the cardiovascular consequences of leptin deficiency and supplementation in male gBscl2 ( gene-deficient) mice-a mouse model of CGL. CGL mice exhibited reduced adipose mass and leptin levels, as well as impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Blood vessels from CGL mice had increased NADPH Oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression and reactive oxygen species production, and selective Nox1 inhibition restored endothelial function. Remarkably, chronic and acute leptin supplementation restored endothelial function via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism that decreased Nox1 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Selective ablation of leptin receptors in endothelial cells promoted endothelial dysfunction, which was restored by Nox1 inhibition. Lastly, we confirmed in aortic tissue from older patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery that acute leptin can promote signaling in human blood vessels. In conclusion, in gBscl2 mice, leptin restores endothelial function via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent decreases in Nox1. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that vessels from aged patients remain leptin sensitive.

IL-6, an essential cytokine for polarization of Th0 cells into Th17 cells has been demonstrated to be crucial in the etiology of ASD in past studies both in humans and mice. Th17 cells are also believed to be central players in the pathogenesis of ASD through release of IL-17A. However, there is still insufficient data regarding identification of Th17 cells with respect to IL-6 signaling in ASD subjects. Therefore, this study explored IL-6 receptors (IL-6R/sIL-6R) and Th17 (p-STAT3/IL-17A/IL-23R) related markers comprehensively in the blood of typically-developing control (TDC, n = 35) and ASD children (n = 45). Our data show that there is enhanced sIL-6R levels in plasma and CD4+ T cells of ASD subjects as compared to TDC group. Increased sIL-6R signaling is associated with upregulated Th17 development in ASD subjects. Further, severe ASD subjects have higher  in terms of IL-6/IL-17A related signaling as compared to moderate ASD patients. Furthermore, treatment of CD4 + T cells in vitro with IL-6 leads to much greater upregulation of p-STAT3, and IL-17A in ASD subjects than similarly treated CD4+ T cells in TDC group. Antagonism of IL-6 signaling by SC144 in vitro led to blockade of IL-6 mediated effects on CD4+ T cells. These data display unequivocally that IL-6 signaling components are dysregulated which play a crucial in enhancement of Th17 development in ASD subjects.Copyright © 2018.

We followed patients for (1) mortality and (2) hepatic decompensation (HD) and analyzed associations using Cox regression, adjusted for a validated mortality risk index (VACS Index 2.0). In VACS Biomarker Cohort, we considered correlation with biomarkers of : interleukin-6, D-dimer, and soluble CD-14.Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and PLR demonstrated strong unadjusted associations with mortality ( < .0001) and HD ( < .0001) and were weakly correlated with other inflammatory biomarkers. Although NLR remained statistically independent for mortality, as did PLR for HD, the addition of NLR and PLR to the VACS Index 2.0 did not result in significant improvement in discrimination compared with VACS Index 2.0 alone for mortality (C-statistic 0.767 vs 0.758) or for HD (C-statistic 0.805 vs 0.801).Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and PLR were strongly associated with mortality and HD and weakly correlated with inflammatory biomarkers. However, most of their association was explained by VACS Index 2.0. Addition of NLR and PLR to VACS 2.0 did not substantially improve discrimination for either outcome.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659562>Clinical-grade N-(4-[F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 for PET imaging of activated T-cells in humans.</a></h2><p>Molecular imaging of immune cells might be a potential tool for response prediction, treatment evaluation and patient selection in inflammatory diseases as well as oncology. Targeting interleukin-2 (IL2) receptors on activated T-cells using positron emission tomography (PET) with N-(4-[F]fluorobenzoyl)-interleukin-2 ([F]FB-IL2) could be such a strategy. This paper describes the challenging translation of the partly manual labeling of [F]FB-IL2 for preclinical studies into an automated procedure following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), resulting in a radiopharmaceutical suitable for clinical use.The preclinical synthesis of [F]FB-IL2 was the starting point for translation to a clinical production method. To overcome several challenges, major adaptations in the production process were executed. The final analytical methods and production method were validated and documented. All data with regards to the quality and safety of the final drug product were documented in an investigational medicinal product dossier.Restrictions in the [F]FB-IL2 production were imposed by hardware configuration of the automated synthesis equipment and by use of disposable cassettes. Critical steps in the [F]FB-IL2 production comprised the purification method, stability of recombinant human IL2 and the final formulation. With the GMP compliant production method, [F]FB-IL2 could reliably be produced with consistent quality complying to all specifications.To enable the use of [F]FB-IL2 in clinical studies, a fully automated GMP compliant production process was developed. [F]FB-IL2 is now produced consistently for use in clinical studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658244>Long Noncoding RNA Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1) Regulates Proliferation, Apoptosis, and  of Chondrocytes via the miR-181a/Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase 1-Like (GPD1L) Axis.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic musculoskeletal diseases, yet to date it lacks effective therapeutic strategies. Increasing evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve pivotal roles in the occurrence and development of OA. However, the possible molecular mechanism involving lncRNAs, such as nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), in OA progression is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, NEAT1 and miR-181a expression in OA synovium tissues and normal synovium tissues were detected. Then, the effect of NEAT1 on modulating growth ability, apoptosis, and  in OA chondrocytes was investigated by a series of loss-function experiments. Next, the correlation between NEAT1, miR-181a, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like (GPD1L) was fully investigated. Finally, the downregulation of miR-181a was employed as a recovery experiment to explore the functional mechanism of NEAT1 in OA. RESULTS In the present study, we found that NEAT1 expression was downregulated in OA tissues, while miR-181a expression was prominently upregulated. Moreover, reduced expression of NEAT1 suppressed cell growth while elevating the apoptotic rate and increasing the abundance of inflammatory cytokines released in OA chondrocytes. Furthermore, we clarified that miR-181a was a direct sponge of NEAT1, and GPD1L was able to bind to miR-181a. Additionally, we found that downregulation of miR-181a was able to attenuate the effect of NEAT1 on apoptosis, inflammatory response, and proliferation in OA chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that downregulation of NEAT1 aggravated progression of OA via modulating the miR-181a/GPD1L axis, providing a novel insight into the mechanism of OA pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656730>Inhibition of respiratory syncytial virus replication and suppression of RSV-induced airway  in neonatal rats by colchicine.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the role of colchicine in the treatment of RSV infection. Treatment of BEAS-2B cells following RSV infection with colchicine caused a significant decrease in the number of viral plaques. In RSV-infected BEAS-2B cells' treatment with colchicine leads to a significant up-regulation of both IFN-1 and RIG-I genes. The levels of interleukin, NO, and MDA were suppressed in BEAS-2B cells infected with RSV by colchicine. The phosphorylation of Stat3, COX-2, and p38 was also suppressed significantly by colchicine. The phosphorylation of IkBα was promoted in RSV-infected BEAS-2B cells' oncolchicine treatment. In neonatal rats, replication of RSV was inhibited significantly by colchicine treatment which was evident by suppression of RSV-L gene expression. A significant decrease in the level of IL-6 and TNF-α was caused in neonatal rat BALF by colchicine treatment. The production of MDA, NO and MPO in the neonatal rat BALF was suppressed markedly by colchicine treatment. Treatment of the neonatal rats infected by RSV with colchicine suppressed the release of IB and COX-2 in the pulmonary epithelial cells. Colchicine treatment of the neonatal rats promoted the expression of IFN- and IFN-1. In summary, the current study showed that colchicine inhibited RSV infection in neonatal rats through regulation of anti-oxidative factor production. The expression of IFN-1 and RIG-I genes was also up-regulated in the RSV-infected alveolar epithelial cells by treatment with colchicine. Therefore, colchicine may be developed as the therapeutic agent for the treatment of RSV infection.© King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657348>[Role and mechanism of vitamin D in sepsis].</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the host's imbalance in response to infection, which is still the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. In recent years, studies have found that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is common in critically ill patients, especially sepsis. The relationship between vitamin D and sepsis has attracted more and more attention.

In this study, 40 patients of CD and 40 healthy control samples were genotyped for HLA-DQB1 and 14 patients of CD and 14 healthy control samples were genotyped for HLA-DQA1genes using the SSP-PCR technique and a commercial kit.The DQA1*05 allele had the highest frequency among the patient group (42.86%). The frequency of this allele was 28.57% in healthy controls, and there was no statistically significant difference in this case (p= 0.771).The DQB1*02 allele was the most common in patients (33.75%) followed by the DQB1*03 allele (31.25%).The difference in frequency of the HLA-DQB1*02 allele in the patient and control groups was statistically significant (P= 0.0002, OR = 4.72). The remarkable differences in the distribution of HLA-DQ2 in Iranian patients compared to controls and relative risks signified the role of these alleles in the development of CD in Iranian patients and confirmed the likelihood of using HLA-DQ typing in the substantiation of the disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657406>The role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the neuroinflammatory responses to AgSe quantum dots in microglia.</a></h2><p>Silver selenide quantum dots (Ag2Se QDs) provide bright prospects for the application of QDs in the field of biomedicine because they contain low-toxic compounds and show great advantages in the imaging of deep tissues and tiny vascular structures. However, the biosafety of these novel QDs has not been thoroughly evaluated, especially in one main target for toxicity-the central nervous system (CNS). Our previous studies have suggested severe inflammatory responses to cadmium-containing QDs in the hippocampus, which gives us a hint regarding the risk assessment of Ag2Se QDs. In this study, microglial activation followed by enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in the hippocampus of mice intravenously injected with Ag2Se QDs. When using the microglial BV2 cells to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we found that the NLRP3 inflammasome activation was involved in the IL-1β-mediated  induced by Ag2Se QDs. On the one hand, Ag2Se QD-activated NF-κB participated in the NLRP3 inflammasome priming and assembly as well as the pro-IL-1β upregulation. On the other hand, Ag2Se QD-induced ROS generation, particularly mtROS, triggered the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and resulted in active caspase-1 to process pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β release. These findings not only indicated that it is important to evaluate the biosafety of novel QDs, even those containing low-toxic compounds, but also provided an unbiased and mechanism-based risk assessment of similar nanoparticles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646279>The relationship between serum endocan levels and the presence/severity of isolated coronary artery ectasia.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum endocan levels and the presence and severity of isolated coronary artery ectasia (CAE).A total of 52 patients with CAE without obstructive coronary artery disease and 33 participants with a normal coronary artery were included in this study. The severity of CAE was graded according to Markis classification. Serum endocan levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.In multivariate regression analysis, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and endocan levels were found to be significantly associated with the presence of isolated CAE. However, there was no relationship between serum endocan levels and the severity of CAE according to Markis classification.Plasma endocan levels may reflect the presence of isolated CAE, suggesting that endocan may be involved in the pathogenesis of isolated CAE.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Accurate disease activity assessment is vital in both clinical and research settings, however, current available methods lack ability to quantify associated variation of physical activity, an important consequence of myositis.This study aims to review studies that have collected accelerometer-derived physical activity data in IIM populations, and to investigate if these studies identified associations between physical and myositis disease activity.A narrative review was conducted to identify original articles that have collected accelerometer-derived physical activity data in IIM populations. The following databases were searched from February 2000 until February 2019: Medline via PubMed, Embase via OVID and Scopus.Of the 297 publications screened, eight studies describing accelerometer use in 181 IIM cases were identified. Seven out of the eight studies investigated juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) populations and only one reported on an adult-onset population. Population sizes, disease duration, accelerometer devices used, body placement sites, and study duration varied between each study.Accelerometer-derived physical activity levels were reduced in IIM cohorts, compared to healthy controls, and studies reported improvement of physical activity levels following exercise programme interventions, thus demonstrating efficacy.Higher levels of accelerometer-derived physical activity measurements were associated with shorter JDM disease duration, current glucocorticoid use and lower serum creatine kinase. However, no clear association between muscle strength and accelerometer-derived physical activity measures was identified.The use of accelerometer-derived physical activity in IIM research is in its infancy. Whilst knowledge is currently limited to small studies, the opportunities are promising and future research in this area has the potential to improve disease activity assessment for clinical and research applications.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659629>IL-1 promotes α-epithelial Sodium Channel (α-ENaC) expression in murine lung epithelial cells: involvement of NF-κB.</a></h2><p>Intra-amniotic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) correlates with a decreased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in infants following premature birth. At birth, inadequate absorption of fluid from the fetal lung contributes to the onset RDS. Lung fluid clearance is coupled to Na transport via epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). In this study, we assessed the effects of IL-1 on the expression of ENaC, particularly the α-subunit which is critical for fetal lung fluid clearance at birth. Cultured mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cells were treated with either IL-1α or IL-1β to determine their effects on α-ENaC expression. Changes in IL-1-induced α-ENaC levels in the presence of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), cycloheximide, NF-κB inhibitor, and MAP kinase inhibitors were investigated. IL-1α and IL-1β independently induced a significant increase of α-ENaC mRNA and protein after 24 h compared to untreated cells. IL-1-dependent increases in α-ENaC protein were mitigated by IL-1ra and cycloheximide. IL-1 exposure induced NF-κB binding activity. Attenuation of IL-1-induced NF-κB activation by its inhibitor SN50 decreased α-ENaC protein abundance. Inhibition of ERK 1,2 MAPK significantly decreased both IL-1α and β-induced α-ENaC protein expression whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK only blocked IL-1β-induced α-ENaC protein levels. In contrast, IL-1-induced α-ENaC protein levels were unaffected by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor. Our results suggest that in MLE-12 cells, IL-1-induced elevation of α-ENaC is mediated via NF-κB activation and in part involves stimulation of the ERK 1,2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659946>Antineuroinflammatory therapy: potential treatment for autism spectrum disorder by inhibiting glial activation and restoring synaptic function.</a></h2><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by deficits in social interactions and perseverative and stereotypical behavior. Growing evidence points toward a critical role for synaptic dysfunction in the onset of ASD, and synaptic function is influenced by glial cells. Considering the evidence that neuroinflammation in ASD is mediated by glial cells, one hypothesis is that reactive glial cells, under inflammatory conditions, contribute to the loss of synaptic functions and trigger ASD. Ongoing pharmacological treatments for ASD, including oxytocin, vitamin D, sulforaphane, and resveratrol, are promising and are shown to lead to improvements in behavioral performance in ASD. More importantly, their pharmacological mechanisms are closely related to anti- and synaptic protection. We focus this review on the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction caused by reactive glial cells would lead to ASD, and discuss the potentials of antineuroinflammatory therapy for ASD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659017>Dendritic Cells Control Regulatory T Cell Function Required for Maintenance of Intestinal Tissue Homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) together with regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential mediators of immune homeostasis. Disruption of function or frequency of either cell type can lead to fatal autoimmunity. We previously described that mice constitutively lacking DCs (∆DC) develop autoimmunity characterized by reduced body weight, autoantibodies, and pronounced intestinal . In this study, we show that lack of DCs leads to an altered gene expression profile in peripheral but not thymic Tregs with increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The suppressive function of Tregs from ΔDC mice was impaired in T cell cocultures. In a model of transfer colitis, Tregs from ∆DC mice were only functional in the presence of DCs in recipient mice. Lack of MHC class II on DCs also resulted in upregulation of inhibitory receptors on Tregs, reduced body weight, and elevated serum IgA levels. Further analysis of the IgA response revealed an expansion of IgA germinal center B cells and plasma cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and more IgA-coated commensal bacteria in feces of ∆DC mice. Thus, we show a critical role for DCs to establish intestinal homeostasis by regulating Treg function for prevention of spontaneous .Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658321>Thymoquinone reverses nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with experimental hypothyroidism.</a></h2><p>To assess the efficacy of thymoquinone (TQ), the most active constituent in Nigella sativa, which is a medicinal plant from the Ranunculaceae family, in restoring the normal liver structure after 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism and explore the mechanism behind this.Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by injection of PTU [6 mg∕kg body weight (b.w.)] for six weeks. Twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups; the control, TQ-treated at the dose 400 mg∕kg b.w., untreated hypothyroidism and TQ-treated hypothyroid groups. Serum levels of thyroid hormones and antioxidant profile were measured. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess gene expression of catalase (CAT). Liver was histopathologically examined using routine and immunohistochemical techniques.Livers of rats with hypothyroidism displayed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the form of steatosis as well as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Moreover, there was an intralobular inflammatory reaction associated with significant (p<0.05) increases in the density of resident hepatic macrophages [cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68)+ cells], as well as in activated hepatic stellate cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) index in livers with hypothyroidism. Resolution of hypothyroid NAFLD was observed in livers after treatment with TQ. The significantly increased (p<0.05) steatosis, lobular , NAFLD activity scores, α-SMA index as well as CD68+ cells induced by hypothyroidism were corrected after TQ administration. Up-regulation of the CAT gene in livers with hypothyroidism after treatment with TQ supported our hypothesis of its antioxidant mechanistic hepatoprotective action.TQ efficiently restores the normal liver histology in hypothyroid rats with up-regulation of the antioxidant CAT gene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655201>Purinergic receptor (P2X7) activation reduces cell-cell adhesion between tubular epithelial cells of the proximal kidney.</a></h2><p>Loss of epithelial (E)-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion impairs gap junction formation and facilitates hemichannel-mediated ATP release in the diabetic kidney.

Immunoblotting confirmed changes in E-cadherin expression in human kidney cells treated with non-hydrolysable ATPγS ± the P2X7 antagonist, A438079. Atomic force microscopy based single-cell force spectroscopy quantified maximum unbinding force, tether rupture events, and work of detachment. Confocal microscopy assessed cytoskeletal reorganization. Our studies confirmed that ATPγS downregulated E-cadherin expression in proximal kidney cells, loss of which was paralleled by a reduction in intercellular ligation forces, decreased tether rupture events and cytoskeletal remodeling. Co-incubation with A438079 restored loss of adhesion, suggesting that elevated extracellular ATP mediates tubular injury through P2X7 induced loss of E-cadherin mediated adhesion.Copyright © 2019.

Considering the cross-talking between the central nervous system and the periphery, the inflammatory analytes may provide utility as biomarkers to identify AD at earlier stages.Using an advanced statistical approach, we can discriminate the interactive network of cytokines/chemokines and propose a useful tool to follow the progression and evolution of AD, also in light of sex differences.A cohort of 289 old-age subjects was screened for cytokine and chemokine profiling, measured in plasma, after a thorough clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. A custom algorithm based on Fisher linear discriminant analysis was applied to ascertain a classification signature able to discriminate HC from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.We observed that a joint expression of three proteins (a "signature" composed by IFN-α2, IL-1α, TNFα) can discriminate HC from AD with an accuracy of 65.24%. Using this signature on MCI samples, 84.93% of them were classified as "non-HC". Stratifying MCI samples by sex, we observed that 87.23% of women were classified as "non-HC", and only 57.69% of males. Indeed, in a scatter plot of IFN-α2 and IL-1α, the HC group was better separated from MCI and AD in women as compared with men.These findings suggest that AD is accompanied by a peripheral inflammatory response that can already be present in MCI subjects, thus providing a mean for detecting this at-risk status and allow an anticipated intervention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656245>[The Analgesic Effect of Aspirin on Inflammatory Pain in Rats is Affected by Pain Intensity and Administration Timing].</a></h2><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely known as painkillers. The analgesic action of NSAIDs is attributable to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis that occurs in response to blocking cyclooxygenase activity. The effective dose of NSAIDs can vary depending on pain intensity and administration timing; however, there are few studies on this. This study aimed to elucidate whether the analgesic effect of NSAIDs changes depending on the situation in which they are taken and we focused on the NSAID, aspirin (ASP). In a rat model of brewer's yeast-induced , pain caused by 20% w/v brewer's yeast-treatment was defined as "strong pain" and that caused by 2.5% w/v was defined as "weak pain." The analgesic effect of ASP (low-dose; 44 mg/kg or high-dose; 66 mg/kg) against strong pain was dose-dependent, but that against weak pain was the same. Furthermore, we defined drug administration after 3 h of brewer's yeast-treatment as "late administration" and that after 20 min as "early administration." In the case of strong pain, the analgesic effect of "late ASP administration" was dose-dependent, but that of "early ASP administration" was the same. These results suggest that low-dose NSAIDs have an analgesic effect against weak pain or when taken early.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h2><p> substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including immune suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among immune checkpoint modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell evasion from immune surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and immune suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661364>Use of MRI to Measure Bronchial  in Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659758>Anlotinib attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via the TGF-β1 signalling pathway.</a></h2><p>Anlotinib hydrochloride (AL3818) is a novel multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has the same targets as nintedanib, an effective drug has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Inflammatory cytokines in alveolar lavage fluid including IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined by ELISA. Biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured by corresponding kit. Histopathologic examination was analysed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, we investigated whether anlotinib inhibited TGFβ/Smad3 and non-Smad pathways by luciferase assay or Western blotting. We also evaluated whether anlotinib inhibited TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promoted myofibroblast apoptosis in order to explore the possible molecular mechanism.The results indicated that anlotinib treatment remarkably attenuated , oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrosis in mouse lungs. Anlotinib could inhibit the TGF-β1 signalling pathway. Additionally, anlotinib not only profoundly inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT in alveolar epithelial cells, but also simultaneously reduced the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis in fibroblasts.In summary, the results suggest that anlotinib-mediated suppression of pulmonary fibrosis is related to the inhibition of TGF-β1 signalling pathway.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655360>Increased cancer risk in polycystic ovary syndrome: An (un)sympathetic connection?</a></h2><p>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been shown to have a higher incidence of cancer.

The TNF-transgenic (TNF-Tg) murine model of RA develops both inflammatory arthritis and an ILD that mimics a cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern dominated by an interstitial accumulation of inflammatory cells with minimal-to-absent fibrosis. Given the model's potential to elucidate the genesis of inflammatory RA-ILD, we aim to achieve the following: 1) characterize the cellular accumulations in TNF-Tg lungs, and 2) assess the reversibility of inflammatory ILD following anti-TNF therapy known to resolve TNF-Tg inflammatory arthritis. TNF-Tg mice with established disease were randomized to anti-TNF or placebo therapy and evaluated with imaging, histology, and flow cytometric analyses, together with wild-type controls. Flow cytometry of TNF-Tg versus wild-type lungs revealed significant increases in activated monocytes, conventional dendritic cells, and CD21/CD23 B cells that are phenotypically distinct from the B cells in inflamed nodes, which are known to accumulate in joint-draining lymph nodes. In contrast to human RA-ILD, anti-TNF treatment significantly alleviated both joint and lung . These results identify a potential role for activated monocytes, conventional dendritic cells, and CD21/CD23 B cells in the genesis of RA-ILD, which exist in a previously unknown, reversible, prefibrotic stage of the disease.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658281>Non-invasive contrast enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging of  in autoimmune myocarditis for prediction of left ventricular fibrosis and remodeling.</a></h2><p>Myocarditis can lead to myocyte loss and myocardial fibrosis resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). Currently employed methods for assessing the risk for development of DCMP are inaccurate or rely on invasive myocardial biopsies. We hypothesized that molecular imaging of tissue  with contrast enhanced ultrasound during peak  in myocarditis could predict development of fibrosis and impaired left ventricular function.Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) was induced in Balbc mice by injection of the α-myosin heavy chain peptide. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) using microbubbles targeted to leukocytes (MBLc), to CD4+ lymphocytes (MBCD4), and to the endothelial cell adhesion molecule P-selectin (MBPSel) was performed during the expected EAM peak inflammatory activity 21 days after induction. High resolution ultrasound, invasive hemodynamic measurements and fibrosis quantification were done 63 days after EAM assessment. All tested microbubbles correlated to fibrosis (MBLc spearman r 0.28, p 0.047, MBCD4 r 0.44, p 0.01, MBPSel r 0.73, p 0.02), however, correlations were weak overall and the spread of data was considerable. Also, targeted CEU data on day 21 did not correlate to hemodynamic and functional data on day 63.Ultrasound molecular imaging using targeted microbubbles during the peak inflammatory activity of myocarditis correlates weakly with later development of fibrosis but not with hemodynamic or left ventricular functional parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657603>Interleukine 6 and C-reactive protein predict growth impairment and acute malnutrition in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p>secondary malnutrition and systemic  may impair growth and body composition in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This association has been scantily studied, particularly in pre-dialytic stages. Our aim was to correlate growth and nutritional status indicators with the serum concentration of interleukine 6 (IL-6) and ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) in children with CKD.this was a prospective cross-sectional study in 29 children and adolescents aged 3-16 years with CKD, stages 3 or 4, in two third-level general hospitals. The outcome variables were height for age, body mass index, arm anthropometric indicators, plus lean mass/fat percentage by bioelectrical impedance. The independent variables were IL-6 and CRP. This study was reviewed and approved by the Health Research and Ethics Committees of both hospitals.height for age, body mass index (BMI), subscapular skinfold, arm fat area, and lean mass had a significant negative correlation with IL-6. The height-for-age z-score had a negative correlation with CRP. IL-6 explained 15% to 35% of the variance in height for age and nutritional status indicators. CRP predicted 22% of height for age. One fifth of the patients had acute malnutrition, and one third were stunted. Muscle was the most affected compartment.IL-6 and CRP in children and adolescents with CKD in the pre-dialytic stage predicted one fifth and one third of the variance in acute and chronic malnutrition indicators. The frequency of acute malnutrition and impaired growth was clinically significant.

We included guidelines providing recommendations on general RA management spanning a range of treatments and published in English. We undertook narrative assessments due to the heterogeneity of the guidelines.We identified 529 articles; 22 met our inclusion criteria. They were primarily developed by rheumatologists with variable involvement of patient and other experts. Three dealt with early RA, one established RA and 18 all patients. Most guidelines recommend regular assessments based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology core dataset; 18 recommended the disease activity score for 28 joints. Twenty recommended targeting remission; 16 suggested low disease activity as alternative. All guidelines recommend treating active RA; 13 made recommendations for moderate disease. The 21 guidelines considering early RA all recommended starting disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) as soon as possible; methotrexate was recommended for most patients. Nineteen recommended combination DMARDs when patients failed to respond fully to monotherapy and biologics were not necessarily indicated. Twenty made recommendations about biologics invariably suggesting their use after failing conventional DMARDs, particularly methotrexate. Most did not make specific recommendations about using one class of biologics preferentially. Eight recommended tapering biologics when patients achieved sustained good responses.Five general principles transcend most guidelines: DMARDs should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis; methotrexate is the best initial treatment; disease activity should be regularly monitored; give biologics to patients with persistently active disease who have already received methotrexate; remission or low disease activity are the preferred treatment target.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658732>Efficacy of Cell-Based Therapies for Traumatic Brain Injuries.</a></h2><p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a leading cause of death and disability. Additionally, growing evidence suggests a link between TBI-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders. Treatments for TBI patients are limited, largely focused on rehabilitation therapy, and ultimately, fail to provide long-term neuroprotective or neurorestorative benefits. Because of the prevalence of TBI and lack of viable treatments, new therapies are needed which can promote neurological recovery. Cell-based treatments are a promising avenue because of their potential to provide multiple therapeutic benefits. Cell-based therapies can promote neuroprotection via modulation of  and promote neurorestoration via induction of angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Neural stem/progenitor cell transplantations have been investigated in preclinical TBI models for their ability to directly contribute to neuroregeneration, form neural-like cells, and improve recovery. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated in clinical trials through multiple different routes of administration. Intravenous administration of MSCs appears most promising, demonstrating a robust safety profile, correlation with neurological improvements, and reductions in systemic  following TBI. While still preliminary, evidence suggests cell-based therapies may become a viable treatment for TBI based on their ability to promote neuroregeneration and reduce .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655202>Nose-to-brain co-delivery of repurposed simvastatin and BDNF synergistically attenuates LPS-induced Neuroinflammation.</a></h2><p>A therapeutic strategy that can combat the multifaceted nature of neuroinflammation pathology was investigated. Thus, we fabricated PEG-PdLLA polymersomes and evaluated the efficacy in co-delivery of simvastatin (Sim, as a repurposed anti-inflammatory agent) with brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, as an exogeneous trophic factor supplementation). Using LPS model of neuroinflammation, intranasal administration of combination drug-loaded polymersomes (containing both Sim and BDNF; Sim-BDNF-Ps) markedly down-regulated brain levels of cytokines compared to free drug and single-drug-loaded polymersomes. Further, Sim-BDNF-Ps effectively replenished brain level of BDNF, that was depleted following neuroinflammation, resulting in a 2-fold BDNF increase versus untreated LPS control group. We found out that the efficiency of the combination drug-loaded polymersomes to suppress microglia activation in brain regions followed the order: frontal cortex ˃ striatum ˃ hippocampus. Our findings indicated that Sim-BDNF-Ps could effectively inhibit microglial-mediated  as well as potentially resolve the neurotoxic microenvironment that is often associated with neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2019.

Secreted factors, intercellular transfer of mitochondria and the receptor-ligand interactions have been shown as mediators of this protection. Here we report that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-long, thin membranous structures, which have been identified as a novel mode of intercellular cross-talk-are formed in the presence of stroma and mediate transfer of cellular vesicles from stroma to leukemic cells. Importantly, transmission of vesicles via TNTs from stromal cells increases resistance of leukemic cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Using correlative light-electron microscopy and electron tomography we show that stromal TNTs contain vesicles, provide membrane continuity with the cell bodies and can be open-ended. Moreover, trans-SILAC studies to reveal the non-autonomous proteome showed that specific sets of proteins are transferred together with cellular vesicles from stromal to leukemic cells, with a potential role in survival and adaptation. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for the biological role of the TNT-mediated vesicle exchange between stromal and leukemic cells, implicating the direct vesicle and protein transfer in the stroma-provided protection of leukemic cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655149>Effects of Securigera Securidaca seed extract in combination with glibenclamide on antioxidant capacity, fibroblast growth factor 21 and insulin resistance in hyperglycemic rats.</a></h2><p>Undesired effects of synthetic antidiabetic agents have made researchers to seek for safer and healthier resources.

Considering that herb-drug interactions can be a double-edged sword presenting both risks and benefits, investigation of such interactions is greatly in demand.to investigate possible beneficial effects of hydroalcoholic extract of S. Securidaca seed (HESS) on antioxidant capacity, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and insulin resistance in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, alone and in combination with glibenclamide.Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided in to eight equal groups including healthy and diabetic controls and six treated groups with a various doses of HESS alone and in combination with glibenclamide, for 35 consecutive days. Serum samples were taken and analyzed for biochemical profile, HOMA indexes, FGF21, oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory biomarkers as compared with the controls. Moreover, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of herbal extract were assessed.The herbal extract was found to be rich in flavonoid and phenolic components. Both of glibenclamide and the HESS decreased glucose and insulin resistance, as well as increased body weight and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the extract could mitigate oxidative/nitrosative stress and  dose-dependently, however, the standard drug was less effective than HESS. Induction of diabetes increased FGF21 levels and both of the treatments could reduce its contents, however, glibenclamide was more effective than HESS.The results clearly show that there is no contradiction between HESS and glibenclamide.

Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is an inhibitor of CD38. This study investigated the pathogenic role of CD38+ NK cells and the effect of C3G on RA.Rats with bovine type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were injected with C3G. RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) or mononuclear cells (MNCs) were cultured with C3G. MNCs were also cocultured with CD38+ NK cells following C3G pretreatment.C3G injection significantly alleviated CIA. C3G also significantly increased the level of interleukin (IL)-10 and the regulatory T (Treg) cell proportion, and it decreased the interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ levels and CD38+ NK cell proportion in rat peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Additionally, C3G significantly increased RASF apoptosis and decreased RASF proliferation and IL-6 production in the culture medium. Furthermore, C3G stimulated MNCs to increase IL-2 and IL-10 production and the Treg cell proportion, and it caused MNCs to decrease IL-6 and IFN-γ production and the CD38+ NK cell proportion. Although CD38+ NK cells significantly decreased the Treg cell proportion and IL-10 level in MNCs, CD38+ NK cells that had been pretreated with C3G increased the proportion of Treg cells and IL-10 levels and decreased the IL-6 and IFN-γ levels in the coculture. In CD38+ NK cells, C3G significantly increased Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) expression and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level, and it decreased natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) expression and the IFN-γ level. However, when CD38+ NK cells were treated with Sirt6 siRNA, C3G did not change the NKG2D expression, the TNF-α level sharply decreased, and the IFN-γ level increased. When MNCs were cocultured with C3G-pretreated CD38+ NK cells in the presence of TNF-α and an anti-IFN-γ antibody, the IL-10+ Treg cell proportion significantly increased. When MNCs were cocultured with C3G-pretreated CD38+ NK cells in the presence of IFN-γ and an anti-TNF-α antibody, the IL-10+ Treg cell proportion sharply decreased. When CIA rats were injected with both C3G and the Sirt6 inhibitor OSS_128167, the rats exhibited joint  and a low Treg cell proportion, but the CD38+ NK proportion was still low.C3G has therapeutic effects on CIA and RA. C3G decreased the proportion of CD38+ cells, RASF proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and it increased the Treg cell proportion. C3G also elevated Sirt6 expression to suppress NKG2D expression, increase TNF-α secretion, and decrease IFN-γ secretion in CD38+ NK cells, which stimulates MNCs to differentiate into Treg cells. This study also demonstrates that the inhibition of Treg cell differentiation in MNCs by CD38+ NK cells is a potential cause of the immune imbalance in RA and CIA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658807>Foregut Diverticula.</a></h2><p>Diverticular disease can present anywhere along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Before ESI, the following data were collected: pain intensity on visual analog scale (VAS), disability via the Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ) and LSS symptoms via the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (SSSQ), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, standard diagnostic EMG, assay of epidural lavasate (epidural saline lavage performed immediately prior to ESI) and serum cytokine biomarkers indicative of .Leg pain intensity (VAS), disability (PDQ), LS symptoms (SSSQ) and satisfaction (SSSQ satisfaction subscale) were assessed at 1 and 2 mo following ESI. Pearson correlational coefficients were calculated between independent variables and outcome measures.Serum monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) level positively correlated with improvement on 2-mo satisfaction. Abnormal EMG finding of radiculopathy positively correlated with improvement in PDQ score at 1-mo. Epidural cytokine levels were not detectable in most samples, except for scattered marginally elevated levels in a few cytokines such as MCP-1, RANTES and IL-1b.This exploratory pilot study revealed that some biomarkers and EMG findings indicative of  and nerve root injury may be predictive of improvement following ESI in patients with LSS.

Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled contemporaneously in our hospital at medical center as healthy control group. Peripheral blood was collected immediately after diagnosis in sepsis group or during physical examination in healthy control group. The expression of antibacterial peptide LL-37 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined. The differences in antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP levels between the two groups were compared. Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between antibacterial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn, and the early individually or jointly diagnostic value of each detected index for sepsis was analyzed.The levels of antimicrobial peptide LL-37, PCT and CRP in peripheral blood of sepsis group were significantly higher than those of healthy control group [LL-37 (μg/L): 1.34±0.69 vs. 0.10±0.06, PCT (μg/L): 46.67±39.51 vs. 0.03±0.02, CRP (mg/L): 129.68±49.83 vs. 3.16±2.85], with statistically significant differences (all P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the expression of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was positively correlated with PCT and CRP levels (r = 0.835, r = 0.932, both P < 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of LL-37, PCT and CRP for early diagnosis of sepsis was 0.885, 0.963 and 0.983, respectively, and the AUC of combined diagnosis of the three parameters was as high as 0.994, indicating that the value of combined diagnosis of sepsis was greater than that of single diagnosis; when the combined prediction probability of the three parameters was 0.92, the sensitivity was 97.5%, and the specificity was 95.0%.Antibacterial peptide LL-37 has certain clinical value in early diagnosis of patients with sepsis, which can be used as early routine monitoring indicators for patients with early sepsis when combined with PCT and CRP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657328>[Clinical investigation on the risk factors for prognosis in patients with septic shock].</a></h2><p>To study the risk factors of prognosis in patients with septic shock, and to provide a reliable evidence to evaluate severity.A retrospective analysis was conducted. The data of 185 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Anhui Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University from March 2016 to December 2018 were enrolled. Routine blood test, blood biochemistry, blood gas analysis, myoglobin (Myo), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), blood lactic acid (Lac), procalcitonin (PCT) and ratio of C-reactive protein and albumin (CRP/ALB) of patients on the day of septic shock diagnosis were collected. Glasgow coma scale (GCS), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) as well as the time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation were recorded. The patients were divided into death group and survival group according to whether they survived or not on 28 days. According to Myo level, the patients were divided into two groups: Myo elevation group (Myo > 98 μg/L) and Myo normal group (Myo ≤ 98 μg/L). Patients with Myo elevation were divided into survival subgroup and death subgroup according to the prognosis of 28 days. The clinical data were compared among the groups, and the influencing factors of prognosis in septic shock patients were screened by multivariate Logistic regression analysis.185 patients were all enrolled in the final analysis, there were 106 deaths and 79 survivors on 28 days, 154 patients with elevated Myo and 31 patients with normal Myo. (1) Compared with the patients with septic shock in the survival group, the death group had older patients, increased qSOFA, APACHE II, MODS scores and blood Myo, Lac, PCT levels, faster heart rate, decreased GCS score, and shorter time from hospitalization to septic shock and duration of mechanical ventilation. However, there was no significant difference in cTnI or CRP/Alb between the two groups.

The basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) has been implicated in intestinal epithelial fluid secretion. Two patients with deleterious heterozygous (NKCC1-DFX) or homozygous (Kilquist) mutations in SLC12A2 (NKCC1) suffer from gastrointestinal deficits. Due to chronic infections, the colon and the small intestine of the NKCC1-DFX patient were surgically resected.To investigate how NKCC1 affects the integrity and function of the gut epithelia, we used a mouse model recapitulating the NKCC1-DFX patient mutation. Electron microscopy and immunostaining were used to analyze the integrity of the colonic mucus layers and immune cells infiltration. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on the distal colon sections to measure bacteria translocation to the mucosa and submucosa. Citrobacter rodentium was used to measure mouse ability to clear enteric infection. Multiplex cytokine assay was used to analyze mouse inflammatory response to infection.We show that NKCC1-DFX expression causes defective goblet cells mucus granule exocytosis, leading to secretion of intact granules into the lumen of the large intestine. In addition, NKCC1-DFX colon submucosal glands secrete mucus that remained attached to the epithelium. Importantly, expression of the mutant NKCC1 or complete loss of NKCC1 function leads to aggravated inflammatory response to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Compared to wild-type, NKCC1-DFX mice showed decreased expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein involved in paracellular Na and water transport and enteric infection clearance.Our data indicate that NKCC1-DFX impairs gut barrier function by affecting mucus secretion and immune properties.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It is currently used as an anchor disease, modifying anti-rheumatic drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite the development of numerous new targeted therapies, MTX remains the backbone of RA therapy due to its potent efficacy and tolerability. There has been also a growing interest in the use of MTX in the treatment of chronic viral mediated arthritis. Many viruses-including old world alphaviruses, Parvovirus B19, hepatitis B/C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-have been associated with arthritogenic diseases and reminiscent of RA. MTX may provide benefits although with the potential risk of attenuating patients' immune surveillance capacities. In this review, we describe the emerging mechanisms of action of MTX as an anti-inflammatory drug and complementing its well-established immunomodulatory activity. The mechanisms involve adenosine signaling modulation, alteration of cytokine networks, generation of reactive oxygen species and HMGB1 alarmin suppression. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of MTX toxic effects.

Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is one of the widespread anthocyanins in plants, and cyanidin (Cy) is the aglycone of C3G that can be generated in intestine under gut microorganism metabolism. To explore the anti-inflammatory activity of single anthocyanins compound and show the potential mechanism, the protective effects of C3G and its aglycone Cy on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Caco-2 cellular monolayer  were studied. The results showed that both C3G and Cy significantly improved the clinical symptoms and relieved the histological damage in TNBS-challenged mice. The activity of myeloperoxidase and the excretion of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and interferon- were also significantly inhibited at the administration dosage of 200 mol/kg.  studies showed that when LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were pretreated with C3G and Cy, the destruction of the intestinal epithelial barrier was ameliorated due to the improvement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and Lucifer yellow flux values, while there were no significant difference between C3G and Cy groups at the same dosage. Similarly, both C3G and Cy suppressed nitric oxide production and inflammatory cytokines secretion of LPS-induced Caco-2 cells. C3G and its aglycone Cy had similar anti-inflammatory activity in both colitis mice and Caco-2 cells. The results suggest that C3G and Cy may exert anti-inflammatory effects by protecting the intestinal barrier as well as by suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Thus, C3G or Cy could be potential preventive agents or supplementary medicines for inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658594>TGF-β Signaling in Cellular Senescence and Aging-Related Pathology.</a></h2><p>Aging is broadly defined as the functional decline that occurs in all body systems. The accumulation of senescent cells is considered a hallmark of aging and thought to contribute to the aging pathologies. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a myriad of cellular processes and has important roles in embryonic development, physiological tissue homeostasis, and various pathological conditions. TGF-β exerts potent growth inhibitory activities in various cell types, and multiple growth regulatory mechanisms have reportedly been linked to the phenotypes of cellular senescence and stem cell aging in previous studies. In addition, accumulated evidence has indicated a multifaceted association between TGF-β signaling and aging-associated disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, muscle atrophy, and obesity. The findings regarding these diseases suggest that the impairment of TGF-β signaling in certain cell types and the upregulation of TGF-β ligands contribute to cell degeneration, tissue fibrosis, , decreased regeneration capacity, and metabolic malfunction. While the biological roles of TGF-β depend highly on cell types and cellular contexts, aging-associated changes are an important additional context which warrants further investigation to better understand the involvement in various diseases and develop therapeutic options. The present review summarizes the relationships between TGF-β signaling and cellular senescence, stem cell aging, and aging-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659729>Pulmonary Complications of Cystic Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by the development of progressive bronchiectasis and impaired lung function with severe airflow obstruction. CF patients suffer from shortened life expectancy, primarily driven by respiratory failure. The mechanism by which CF lung disease develops is the result of an interplay of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors including genotype, abnormalities in mucus composition and movement, chronic , and chronic airway infection. Although all CF patients are at increased risk for pulmonary complications including hemoptysis, pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure, the risk of developing these complications increases with progression of lung disease. The focus of this article is to summarize the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of these key pulmonary complications.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659503>Surgical management of growing teratoma syndrome: robotic-assisted thoracoscopic resection of mediastinal teratoma.</a></h2><p>Growing teratoma syndrome is a rare condition defined by the presence of enlarging metastatic lesions on serial imaging that arise after or during systemic chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Lesions commonly occur in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, or lung and are notoriously unresponsive to conventional chemoradiotherapy.In this study, we present a dynamic case of a 26-year-old male, who had undergone surgical resection and systemic bleomycin treatment for a metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor, and later developed recurrent masses in his posterior mediastinum seen on surveillance imaging. Tumor markers remained normal. These lesions were resected via a right robot-assisted thoracoscopic approach with the da Vinci Xi®.The operation was completed successfully with an unremarkable postoperative hospital course. The robotic-assisted right thoracoscopic approach allowed for a minimally invasive dissection with good visualization and minimal morbidity when compared to previous cases of surgically resected mediastinal teratomas. Final pathology demonstrated mature teratomatous elements within a setting of  and necrosis.Robot-assisted thoracoscopic management of metastatic mediastinal lesions in the setting of this rare condition is safe and feasible.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660355>Invasive Fungal Carotiditis: A Rare Manifestation of Cranial Invasive Fungal Disease: Case Series and Systematic Review of the Literature.</a></h2><p>Rhinosinusitis, malignant otitis externa, and skull base osteomyelitis represent a spectrum of cranial invasive fungal disease (IFD). These syndromes have distinct characteristics, yet they may progress to involve similar structures, resulting in  and invasion of the adjacent internal carotid artery (ICA). Invasive fungal carotiditis can have devastating consequences, including cerebral infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and death.We retrospectively studied all patients diagnosed with cranial IFD and carotid involvement at our institution from 2003 to 2018. We also searched Medline/PubMed for reports of  or  cranial infections with ICA involvement. All cases with mycologic evidence of cranial IFD and radiographic or pathologic evidence of ICA involvement were included.We identified 78 cases of invasive fungal carotiditis between 1958 and 2018, including 4 cases at our own institution. Forty-one were caused by  and 37 by  species. Presenting symptoms included vision changes (73%), cranial nerve palsy (69%), and headache (42%). Carotid events included occlusion, aneurysm formation, and vessel rupture. Cerebral infarcts occurred in 50% of cases. Mortality at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 2 years was 27%, 41%, and 71% respectively. The median time from symptom onset to death was 150 days for cases due to  and 51 days for cases due to  species.Invasive fungal carotiditis is a rare but morbid manifestation of cranial IFD. Early suspicion of IFD and administration of antifungal treatment, vascular imaging, and endovascular interventions should be considered to reduce the high mortality of this disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

More recently, many forms of cancer have also been linked to chronic tissue . While stromal immune cells and myofibroblasts have been recognized as major contributors of cytokines and growth factors that foster the formation of fibrotic tissue, the endothelium has traditionally been regarded as a passive player in the pathogenic process, or even as a barrier since it provides a physical divide between the circulating immune cells and the inflamed tissues. Recent findings, however, have indicated that endothelial cells in fact play a crucial role in the inflammatory response. Endothelial cells can be activated by cytokine signaling and express inflammatory markers, which can sustain or exacerbate the inflammatory process. For example, the activated endothelium can recruit and activate leukocytes, thus perpetuating tissue , while sustained stimulation of endothelial cells may lead to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition that contributes to fibrosis. Since chronic  has now been recognized as a significant contributing factor to tumorigenesis, it has also emerged that activation of endothelium also occurs in the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes recent findings characterizing the molecular and cellular changes in the vascular endothelium that contribute to tissue fibrosis, and potentially to cancer formation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657276>Integrating transcriptome-wide association study and mRNA expression profiling identified candidate genes and pathways associated with osteomyelitis.</a></h2><p>: Osteomyelitis (OM) is an acute or chronic inflammatory process, characterized by severe  and progressive bone destruction. Limited efforts have been made to explore the genetic basis of OM. : The genome-wide association study data set of OM was obtained from the UK Biobank. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of OM was conducted by the FUSION tool using the gene expression reference weights of lymphocytes and blood. The OM-associated genes identified by TWAS were subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to explore OM-related gene sets. The TWAS results of OM were finally compared with a genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of OM to detect common genes and gene sets. : TWAS of OM detected 86 genes for lymphocytes and 387 genes for blood.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has been established as an independent causal risk factor for CVD in the general population but has not been well established in the population of PHIV+.We cross-sectionally compared lipid profiles, including nonfasting Lp(a), together with total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides between 35 cART-treated PHIV+ children aged 8-18 years and 37 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. We explored associations between Lp(a) and disease- and treatment-related factors (, monocyte activation, and vascular), biomarkers, and neuroimaging outcomes using linear regression models.PHIV+ children had significantly higher levels of Lp(a) compared with controls (median, 43.6 [21.6-82.4] vs 21.8 [16.8-46.6] mg/dL;  = .033). Other lipid levels were comparable between groups. Additional assessment of apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein CIII, apolipoprotein E, and  genotype revealed no significant differences. Higher Lp(a) levels were associated with higher plasma apoB levels and with lower monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and TG levels in PHIV+ children. Lp(a) was not associated with HIV- or cART-related variables or with neuroimaging outcomes.cART-treated PHIV+ children appear to have higher levels of Lp(a) compared with ethnicity-matched controls, which may implicate higher CVD risk in this population.

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut microbiota and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut microbiota, and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with  and cancer. Alternating the consumption of some bioactive compounds, such as β-glucan and quercetin, in food can contribute to human health.

Exosomes derived from macrophages carrying microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are of great value for cancer therapy. Gremlin 1 (GREM1), a member of the antagonists of secreted bone morphogenetic protein, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple diseases or cancers. Based on the predictions of miRNA-mRNA interaction, GREM1 was found to be a target gene of miR-155-5p. Here, this study aims to explore the role of TAM-derived exosomal miR-155-5p by regulating GREM1 in intracranial aneurysm (IA). The collected results showed that GREM1 was down-regulated in IA while miR-155-5p was up-regulated in TAM-derived exosomes. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were co-cultured with TAMs or exposed to exosomes derived from TAMs transfected with either miR-155-5p mimic or miR-155-5p inhibitor for exploring their roles in proliferation and migration of SMCs in vitro. Accordingly, in vitro experiments showed that TAM-derived exosomal miR-155-5p could promote proliferation and migration of SMCs by targeting GREM1. The effects of TAM-derived exosomal miR-155-5p on IA formation and TAM activation and infiltration by regulation of GREM1 in vivo were measured in IA rats injected with exosomes or those from TAMs transfected with miR-155-5p inhibitor. In vivo experimental results consistently confirmed that TAM-derived exosomes carrying miR-155-5p promoted IA formation and TAM activation and infiltration. In conclusion, TAM-derived exosomal miR-155-5p promotes IA formation via GREM1, which points to miR-155-5p as a possible therapeutic target for IA.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657128>Increased T cell plasticity with dysregulation of T follicular helper, T peripheral helper and T regulatory cell responses in children with JIA and Down syndrome-associated arthritis.</a></h2><p>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis in children, however an aggressive, erosive arthritis of little known immunological mechanism, occurs 20-times more frequently in children with Down syndrome. This study characterises T-and B-cell polyreactivity, T follicular helper (Tfh), T peripheral helper (Tph) and T regulatory (Treg) cell responses and synovial  in Down syndrome-associated Arthritis (DA).Multiparametric flow-cytometric analysis and SPICE were utilised to examine peripheral blood B-cell populations and T-cell cytokine responses in DA, JIA, Down syndrome (Trisomy 21-T21) and healthy controls (HC). Tfh and Tph cell frequency and origin, in addition to Treg cell frequency were also evaluated. Synovial  was assessed by immunohistology.Expansion of IgM-only memory B-cells was demonstrated in DA compared to JIA (22.48 ± 3.278 vs 9.011 ± 1.317, p=0.005), paralleled by decreased frequency of transitional B-cells. T-cell responses in DA were characterised by marked functional plasticity, evident by the increased frequency of polyfunctional CD8 (p<0.05), CD161 (p<0.05) and CD8 Th cells (p<0.001), positive for TNFα,-IFNγ,-IL-17A, or-GM-CSF compared to all other groups.

Salidroside is an important active ingredient extracted from the root of the  plant, which has been reported to have antioxidative, anti-cancer, neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects. However, the effects of salidroside on vascular  have not been clarified. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of salidroside against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced vascular  in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs), a specific cell type derived from coronary micro-vessels. Over a 24-h period, salidroside did not exert any significant cytotoxicity up to a dose of 100 µM. Additionally, salidroside decreased the expression levels of the cell adhesion molecule vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in TNF-α-stimulated CMECs, thus suppressing monocyte-to-CMEC adhesion. Salidroside also decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) in TNF-α-induced CMECs, as well as suppressing TNF-α-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB activation. Since MAPKs and NF-κB both serve notable roles in regulating the expression of VCAM-1, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, the present study provided a preliminary understanding of the mechanism underlying the protective effects of salidroside. Overall, salidroside alleviated vascular  by mediating MAPK and NF-κB activation in TNF-α-induced CMECs. These results indicated that salidroside may have potential applications as a therapeutic agent against vascular  and atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019, Spandidos Publications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656949> induced PD-L1-specific T cells.</a></h2><p>PD-L1-specific T cells are a natural part of the T-cell repertoire in humans. Hence, we have previously described spontaneous CD8 and CD4 T-cell reactivity against PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with various cancers as well as in healthy donors. It is well described that the expression of the PD-L1 protein is introduced in cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. IFN-γ. In the current study, we were able to directly link  with PD-L1-specific T cells by showing that inflammatory mediators such as IFN-γ generate measurable numbers of PD-L1-specific T cells in human PBMCs as well as in  models. These PD-L1-specific T cells can vigorously modulate the cell compartments of the local environment.

We aimed to explore the relationship between  and aortic stiffness and investigate their role in the etiology of young-onset hypertension.We enrolled 16 patients diagnosed with young-onset hypertension and 16 volunteers without hypertension. The plasma levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay, respectively.

IR leads to accumulation of advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) and their receptor, RAGE. PCOS patients have increased levels of vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF), interleukin 6/8 (IL-6/8) and anti-Mϋllerian-hormone (AMH). PEDF is a secreted-glycoprotein known for its anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We aimed to elucidate the role of PEDF in the pathogenesis and treatment of PCOS. We used a prenatal PCOS mouse model and fed the female offspring a high-fat-diet, inducing metabolic PCOS (met.PCOS) characteristics. Female offspring were divided into three groups: control; met.PCOS; met.PCOS+recombinant PEDF (rPEDF). Met.PCOS mice gained more weight, had elevated serum IL-6 and higher mRNA levels of AMH, PEDF and RAGE in their granulosa-cells (GCs) than met.PCOS+rPEDF mice. An in-vitro met.PCOS model in human GCs (KGN) line was induced by prolonged incubation with insulin/AGEs, causing development of IR. Under the same conditions, we observed an elevation of VEGF, IL-6/8 mRNAs, concomitantly with an increase in PEDF mRNA, intracellular protein levels, and an elevation of PEDF receptors (PEDF-Rs) mRNA and protein. Simultaneously, a reduction in the secretion of PEDF from GCs, was measured in the medium. The addition of rPEDF (5nM) activated P38 signaling, implying that PEDF-Rs maintained functionality, and negated AGE-induced elevation of IL-6/8 and VEGF mRNAs. Decreased PEDF secretion may be a major contributor to hyper-angiogenesis and chronic , which lie at the core of PCOS pathogenesis. rPEDF treatment may restore physiological angiogenesis-inflammatory balance, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic role in PCOS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655851>Bromelain reversed electrolyte imbalance in the chronically constricted sciatic nerve of Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Derangement of electrolyte in the sensory nervous system has been attributed to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesic and allodynic symptoms in painful neuropathy. This study investigated the effect of bromelain on electrolyte imbalance in chronically constricted sciatic nerve of rats (a model of neuropathic pain). Forty Wistar rats, divided into five groups of eight animals each were used for this study. von Frey filaments, tail immersion and acetone spray tests were used to assessed allodynic and thermal hyperalgesic symptoms in the Wistar rats. Sodium ion (Na), potassium ion (K), calcium ion (Ca) and chloride ion (Cl) concentrations as well as sodium-potassium and calcium electrogenic pump (Na-K ATPase and Ca ATPase, respectively) activities were estimated using spectrophotometry techniques. Bromelain significantly (p < 0.05) reversed elevation of Na and Ca concentration compared with sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (snCCI) group (35.68 ± 1.71 vs 44.46 ± 1.24 mg/ml/mg protein and 1.06 ± 0.19 vs 6.66 ± 0.03 mg/ml/mg protein, respectively). There were also significant (p < 0.05) increases in the level of K (0.84 ± 0.02 vs 0.36 ± 0.05 mg/ml/mg protein) and Cl (18.51 ± 0.29 vs 15.82 ± 0.21 mg/ml/mg protein). Bromelain reduced the activities of Ca electrogenic pumps significantly compared with snCCI. This study therefore suggests that bromelain mitigated electrolyte imbalance in chronic constricted injury of the sciatic nerve implying that this may be an important mechanism for the anti-nociceptive effect of bromelain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657539>Combined tribological and bactericidal effect of nanodiamonds as potential lubricant for artificial joints.</a></h2><p>The artificial joints, e.g., knee and hip implants, are widely used for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases and trauma. Current most common material choice for clinically used implants is the combination of polymer-on-metal structures. Unfortunately, these joints often suffer from high friction and wear, leading to associated  and infection and ultimate failure of the artificial joints. Here, we propose an alternative solution to this tribologically-induced failure of the joint materials. We demonstrate that friction and wear behavior of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium tribopair, used to mimic the artificial joint interface, can be improved by introducing nanodiamond (ND) particles in the sliding contact. Characterization of the wear track using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the tribofilm formed from embedded NDs during sliding significantly suppressed the wear of the UHMWPE surface. In addition to the improved lubrication characteristics, NDs exhibit high biocompatibility with the bone cells and promising antibacterial properties against S. aureus, the most common strain associated with artificial joint infection. These results indicate that NDs can be used as a promising nontoxic human-body lubricant with anti-wear and antibacterial features, thus demonstrating their great potential to treat artificial joint complications through intra-articular injection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655312>Suppression of TRPM2 reduces renal fibrosis and  through blocking TGF-β1-regulated JNK activation.</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of death. Renal fibrosis and  are common pathways contributing to the development of this disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CKD are not fully understood. TRPM2 (Transient receptor potential melastatin-2) was previously identified as a potential target in various diseases due to its multiple functions. In the study, mice with unilateral urethral obstruction (UUO) were used to explore the effects of TRPM2 on renal injury. First, TRPM2 expression was up-regulated in kidney of mice after UUO. Renal histological analysis using H&E and PAS staining showed that histological changes induced by UUO were markedly alleviated in TRPM2-deficient mice. In addition, TRPM2 knockout markedly improved renal dysfunction, as evidenced by the reduced serum creatine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) expression and enhanced Nephrin levels. TRPM2 ablation significantly attenuated renal interstitial fibrosis in mice with UUO via decreasing transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression, accompanied with the reduction of fibrotic genes, such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin (FN) and Collagen 1 alpha 1 (Col1α1). Suppressing TRPM2 expression also suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory factors in UUO-triggered renal fibrosis. Further, TRPM2 deficiency inhibited IκBα/nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling in UUO-treated mice. Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling was blocked by TRPM2 knockout in UUO mice. Surprisingly, the in vitro results indicated that blocking JNK activation resulted in the suppression of TGF-β1-induced fibrosis and . Together, these findings demonstrate that the inhibition of TRPM2 might protect against renal fibrosis and  through impeding JNK activation regulated by TGF-β1.Copyright © 2019.

Therefore, targeting these processes using localized delivery of a minimally toxic drug combination may be a promising strategy. Here, we present engineering of a biocompatible self-assembled lithocholic acid-dipeptide derived hydrogel (TRI-Gel) that can maintain sustained delivery of antiproliferating doxorubicin, antiangiogenic combretastatin-A4 and anti-inflammatory dexamethasone. Application of TRI-Gel therapy to a murine tumor model promotes enhanced apoptosis with a concurrent reduction in angiogenesis and , leading to effective abrogation of tumor proliferation and increased median survival with reduced drug resistance. In-depth RNA-sequencing analysis showed that TRI-Gel therapy induced transcriptome-wide alternative splicing of many genes responsible for oncogenic transformation including sphingolipid genes. We demonstrate that TRI-Gel therapy targets the reversal of a unique intron retention event in β-glucocerebrosidase 1 (), thereby increasing the availability of functional Gba1 protein. An enhanced Gba1 activity elevates ceramide levels responsible for apoptosis and decreases glucosylceramides to overcome drug resistance. Therefore, TRI-Gel therapy provides a unique system that affects the TME via post-transcriptional modulations of sphingolipid metabolic genes, thereby opening a new and rational approach to cancer therapy.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655458>The elevated systemic cytokine levels in HIV patients are not associated with an elevated pulmonary cytokine environment.</a></h2><p>HIV-positive patients on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) are at higher risk of developing many non-AIDS related chronic diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), compared to HIV-negative individuals. While the mechanisms are not clear, a persistent pro-inflammatory state appears to be a key contributing factor. The aims of this study were to investigate whether HIV-positive patients without COPD present evidence of potentially predisposing abnormal pulmonary cytokine/chemokine environment and to explore the relationship between pulmonary and systemic cytokine levels.This study included 39 HIV-seropositive and 34 HIV-seronegative subjects without COPD. All were subjected to outpatient bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) aspiration and blood sample collection. The levels of 21 cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma and BALF using a bead-based multi-analyte assay.In plasma, HIV-infected patients showed significantly increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory (TNFα) and Th1-associated cytokines (IL-12p70) as well as several chemokines (CXCL11 and CX3CL1). However, no statistically significant differences were found in the numbers of cells, the concentrations of protein and urea as well as cytokine levels in the BALFs of HIV-positive patients when compared to controls. Correlation analysis indicated a potential modulatory effect of the BMI in HIV-seropositive individuals.While our results are consistent with the existence of a systemic pro-inflammatory state in HIV-infected patients, they did not detect significant differences in cytokine levels and other inflammatory markers in the lungs of HIV-positive individuals when compared to HIV-negative controls.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of  following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular weight (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of  in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used. Further investigation of different HA formulations and the use of HA in normal and arthritic equine joints is warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657930>CREB Signaling Mediates Dose-dependent Radiation Response in the Murine Hippocampus Two Years after Total Body Exposure.</a></h2><p>The impact of low-dose ionizing radiation (IR) on the human brain has recently attracted attention due to the increased use of IR for diagnostic purposes. The aim of this study was to investigate low-dose radiation response in hippocampus. Female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to total body irradiation with 0 (control), 0.063 Gy, 0.125 Gy or 0.5 Gy. Quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of hippocampus was performed after 24 months. CREB signaling and CREB-associated pathways were affected at all doses. The lower doses (0.063 Gy and 0.125 Gy) induced the CREB pathway, whereas the exposure to 0.5 Gy deactivated CREB. Similarly, the lowest dose (0.063 Gy) was anti-inflammatory, reducing the number of activated microglia. In contrast, induction of activated microglia and reactive astroglia was found at 0.5 Gy suggesting increased  and astrogliosis, respectively. The apoptotic markers BAX and cleaved CASP-3 and oxidative stress markers were increased only at the highest dose. Since activated CREB pathway plays a central role in learning and memory, these data suggest neuroprotection at the lowest dose (0.063 Gy) but neurodegeneration at 0.5 Gy. The response to 0.5 Gy resembles alterations found in healthy aging and thus may represent radiation-induced accelerated aging of the brain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658381>AJM300, a novel oral antagonist of α4-integrin, sustains an increase in circulating lymphocytes: a randomised controlled trial in healthy male subjects.</a></h2><p>AJM300 is an oral antagonist of α4-integrin that reduces  by blocking leukocyte trafficking. This study aimed to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AJM300 in healthy male subjects.A total of 23 subjects were randomised to receive 240 mg (n=6), 480 mg (n=5), 960 mg (n=6) of AJM300 or the corresponding placebo (n=2 per group). The study drugs were taken orally three times daily after each meal on the first day followed by a four-day washout period. Thereafter, multiple-dose administration was conducted for six consecutive days. The pharmacokinetic parameters of AJM300 and its active metabolite (HCA2969) were assessed, and total white blood cells and the differential cell count were used to determine the pharmacodynamic effects. Adverse events (AEs) were also monitored.The plasma AJM300 and HCA2969 concentration-time curves displayed a tri-phasic pattern on Day 1 (single-day administration) and Day 10 (last day of multiple dosing), whereas the concentration of HCA2969 was much higher than that of AJM300. A significant but transient increase in lymphocyte count was observed after AJM300 dosing at all dosages tested compared with the placebo. The increase was sustained over a 24-hour period only at the 960 mg dosage. In particular, a significant increase in the lymphocyte count compared to placebo (mean, 50.58%; 95% confidence intervals, 20.40-80.76) was observed at the first 960 mg dose on Day 10. Six (26.1%) subjects reported ≥1 AE, all of which were mild and resolved spontaneously.The maximal and 24-hour sustained pharmacodynamic effects were demonstrated at the 960 mg dosage after oral administration of AJM300 three times daily for six days, which was also found to be safe and well tolerated.This article is protected by copyright.

Lung microbiome research is increasing in volume and scope; however, there are no established guidelines for study design, conduct and reporting of lung microbiome studies. Standardized approaches to yield reliable and reproducible data that can be synthesized across studies, will ultimately improve the scientific rigor and impact of published work and greatly benefit microbiome research. In this review, we identify and address several key elements of microbiome research: conceptual modeling and hypothesis framing, study design, experimental methodology and pitfalls, data analysis and reporting considerations. Finally, we explore possible future directions and research opportunities. Our goal is to aid investigators who are interested in this burgeoning research area and will hopefully provide the foundation for formulating consensus approaches in lung microbiome research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660030>STW 5 is effective against nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced gastro-duodenal lesions in rats.</a></h2><p>Proton pump inhibitors are often used to prevent gastro-intestinal lesions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, they are not always effective against both gastric and duodenal lesions and their use is not devoid of side effects.To explore the mechanisms mediating the clinical efficacy of STW 5 in gastro-duodenal lesions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), exemplified here by diclofenac, in a comparison to omeprazole.Gastro-duodenal lesions were induced in rats by oral administration of diclofenac (5 mg/kg) for 6 successive days. One group was given concurrently STW 5 (5 mL/kg) while another was given omeprazole (20 mg/kg). A day later, animals were sacrificed, stomach and duodenum excised and divided into 2 segments: One for histological examination and one for measuring inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukins-1β and 10), oxidative stress enzyme (heme oxygenase-1) and apoptosis regulator (B-cell lymphoma 2).Diclofenac caused overt histological damage in both tissues, associated with parallel changes in all parameters measured. STW 5 and omeprazole effectively prevented these changes, but STW 5 superseded omeprazole in protecting against histological damage, particularly in the duodenum.The findings support the therapeutic usefulness of STW 5 and its superiority over omeprazole as adjuvant therapy to NSAIDs to protect against their possible gastro-duodenal side effects.©The Author(s) 2019.

This study aimed to investigate the potential role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced ALI.Expression of SNHG14, microRNA-34c-3p (miR-34c-3p) and Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) in LPS-exposed mouse alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and lung tissues from mice with LPS-induced ALI was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The interactions among SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1 were analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. Using gain-of-function or loss-of-function approaches, the contents of proinflammatory proteins were determined and MH-S cell viability was assessed to evaluate the in vitro functions of SNHG14, miR-34c-3p and WISP1, and wet/dry weight ratio and proinflammatory proteins in lung tissues were determined to assess their in vivo effects.SNHG14 and WISP1 expression was increased, while miR-34c-3p was decreased in ALI models. SNHG14 bound to miR-34c-3p, resulting in impaired miR-34c-3p-dependent down-regulation of WISP1. Both SNHG14 silencing and miR-34c-3p over-expression reduced the levels of proinflammatory proteins IL-18, IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 and inhibited MH-S cell viability. SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression decreased the wet/dry weight ratio in lung tissues from ALI mice. The reductions induced by SNHG14 silencing or miR-34c-3p over-expression were rescued by WISP1 over-expression.This study demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG14 silencing alleviated  in LPS-induced ALI through miR-34c-3p-mediated inhibition of WISP1. Our findings suggest that lncRNA SNHG14 may serve as a therapeutic target for ALI.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655538>The effect of N-acetylcysteine on  and oxidative stress in cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity: A rat model.</a></h2><p>Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of solid organ cancers. Besides its chemotherapeutic effectiveness, cisplatin administration was associated with numerous side effects. Of these, the most clinically significant and common effect is nephrotoxicity. Recent studies reported that oxidative stress and inflamation are probably the most important mechanisms that contribute to the nephrotoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. In the present study, the effects of NAC on cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity were investigated. Materials nad Methods: Rats were divided into four groups including eight rats: CONT, NAC-250, CP, CP+NAC. Rats in experimental groups were treated with a single dose intraperitoneally (i.p.) cisplatin (10 mg/kg body weight) and i.p. NAC (250 mg/kg body weight) for three consequitive days. Nephrotoxicity was determined by plasma BUN and creatinine levels. In tissue samples myeloperoxidase (MPO), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1), Total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were measured. Kidneys were analyzed histopathologically as well.It was revealed that cisplatin was not effective on MPO, HMGB-1 and NF-kB levels but increased TOS levels and decreased TAS levels in tissue samples, interestingly NAC elevated MPO and HMGB-1 levels significantly. Nevertheless NAC ameliorated histological and functional changes in kidney tissues.It is suggested that  has limited effect on cisplatin nephrotoxicity in this experimental design and as reflected by decreased BUN and creatinine levels NAC can be used as an additional therapeutic agent to standard cisplatin treatment protocols.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656024>Potential clinical variants detected in mitochondrial DNA D-loop hypervariable region I of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a mitochondrial disease. However, the underlying role of mitochondrial genetics has not yet been completely elucidated. Evaluation of D-loop nucleotide variations with respect to statistical significance and clinical data distribution.Genomic DNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples of patients with biopsy-proven 150 NASH as well as from 150 healthy individuals to explore the functional D-loop region responsible for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed for the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA containing the hypervariable region I, and restriction fragment length polymorphism with MnlI analysis was performed for the m.16189 T/C D-loop variant.The m.A16318C variant was detected only in patients with NASH and approached significance level. Based on clinical data, six variants associated with histological subgroups of NASH and NASH-complicated diseases were identified. In patients with NASH, the m.16129 AA genotype was associated with advanced-stage fibrosis; the m.16249 CC genotype was associated with advanced lobular  and advanced-stage histological steatosis; the m.16296 TT genotype was associated with hypothyroidism; the m.16163 GG and m.16294 TT genotypes were associated with metabolic syndrome; and the m.16256 TT+CT genotypes were associated with type II diabetes. In patients with NASH, microRNAs were estimated by targeting the significant variants identified in this study.These findings suggest that NASH may be associated with D-loop nucleotide variations and that microRNA-based in vitro and/or in vivo studies may be developed by targeting the D-loop variants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655061>Angiopoietin-Tie Signaling Pathway in Endothelial Cells: A Computational Model.</a></h2><p>The angiopoietin-Tie signaling pathway is an important vascular signaling pathway involved in angiogenesis, vascular stability, and quiescence.

An ICH rat model was established in the current study and 1 h following ICH induction, rats were treated with or without an miR-146a mimic. A total of 3 days following ICH induction, rat neurological score, brain water content and neuronal apoptosis were measured via flow cytometry. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β were detected via ELISA and certain biomarkers of oxidative stress, including malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, were also determined in current study. The expression of genes and proteins were detected in current study via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. MicroRNA.org software and a dual luciferase reporter assay were used to confirm the association between miR-146a and TRAF6. The results of the current study revealed that miR-146a was significantly downregulated in ICH rats, and its overexpression reduced neurological damage and brain edema, as evidenced by decreased neurological scores and brain water content. Results from further analyses demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-146a inhibited neuronal apoptosis, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and prevented oxidative stress in ICH rats. In addition, it was revealed that the upregulation of miR-146a repressed the TRAF6/NF-κB pathway in the brain tissue of ICH rats. TRAF6 was also determined to be a target of miR-146a. In conclusion, these data indicated that miR-146a protects against ICH by inhibiting  and oxidative stress.Copyright: © Qu et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661475>[Proinflammatory Cytokines and Skin Wound Healing in Mice].</a></h2><p>Skin wound healing is subject to an intricate regulation, involves many cell populations and molecular mediators, and is one of the key mechanisms that ensures the barrier functions of the skin and the maintenance of body homeostasis. The efficiency of this process is largely determined by the balance of proinflammatory and proregenerative signals, which are mediated by cytokines. The review summarizes the latest data on the role of proinflammatory cytokines, mainly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interferons (IFNs), in skin wound healing, including those obtained with the use of genome editing techniques and methods of reverse genetics to establish relevant animal models.

Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy. Metreleptin, the synthetic analog of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin and current therapy of choice for patients with lipodystrophy, successfully improves metabolic function. However, while leptin has been associated with hypertension, vascular diseases, and  in the context of obesity, it remains unknown whether its daily administration could further impair cardiovascular function in patients with lipodystrophy.

These measures were equivalent to those obtained after 6 days of daily dosing by tofacitinib. However, PET measures at trough plasma levels of the drug from tofacitinib administration were significantly higher than those at peak plasma drug levels and equivalent to pretreatment measures. There were insignificant changes in PET measures for the control animals. F-FDG PET can detect changes in inflammatory activity occurring in response to the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib: (a) during peak and trough plasma drug levels, that is within mere hours of treatment; and (b) over a span of days.© 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661298>Hepatic IKK epsilon expression is dispensable for high-fat feeding-induced increases in liver lipid content and alterations in glucose tolerance.</a></h2><p>There are endocrine and immunological changes that occur during onset and progression of the overweight and obese states. The inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε) was originally described as an inducible protein kinase; whole-body gene deletion or systemic pharmaceutical targeting of this kinase improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice. To investigate the primary sites of action associated with IKKε during weight gain, we describe the first mouse line with conditional elimination of IKKε in the liver (IKKε ). IKKε  mice and littermate controls gain weight, show similar changes in body composition, and do not display any improvements in insulin sensitivity or whole-body glucose tolerance. These studies were conducted using both breeder chow diets and also matched low-  high-fat diets. While glycogen accumulation in the liver is reduced in IKKε mice, lipid storage in liver is similar IKKε mice and littermate controls.

We recently demonstrated a protective role for resveratrol (RES) in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction. However, the effect of RES on cardiac fibrosis and diastolic function in this model remains unclear.Cardiac remodeling was induced in mice by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 2-4 weeks. RES was administered at dose of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. We found that RES administration at 50 mg/kg/day significantly attenuated TAC-induced adverse cardiac systolic and diastolic function, fibrosis, , and oxidative stress via inhibiting PTEN degradation and the downstream mediators. However, RES at 5 mg/kg/day had no significant effects. RES at 50 mg/kg/day also ameliorated pre-established adverse cardiac function and remodeling induced by TAC. Treatment with PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks abolished RES-mediated protective effects. Additionally, we verified the effect of RES (100 µM) on inhibition of Ang II-induced fibroblast proliferation and activation in vitro.Our findings provide new evidence that RES plays a critical role in the progression of cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction, and suggest that RES may be a promising therapeutic agent for cardiac fibrosis.

However, there have been no longitudinal studies investigating the association of serum LBP levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general populations. Methods and Results A total of 2568 community-dwelling Japanese individuals 40 years and older without prior CVD were followed for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum LBP levels were divided into quartiles (quartile 1: 2.20-9.68 μg/mL; quartile 2: 9.69-10.93 μg/mL; quartile 3: 10.94-12.40 μg/mL; quartile 4: 12.41-24.34 μg/mL). The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for the incidence of CVD were computed using a Cox proportional hazards model. During the follow-up period, 180 individuals developed CVD. The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of CVD increased significantly with higher serum LBP levels ( for trend=0.005). Individuals with higher serum LBP levels had a significantly greater risk of the development of CVD after adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (quartile 1: HR, 1.00 [reference]; quartile 2: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.60-1.78]; quartile 3: HR, 1.52 [95% CI, 0.92-2.51]; and quartile 4: HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.17-3.09];  for trend=0.01). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( for trend=0.01). However, when additional adjustment was made for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, the association was attenuated to the nonsignificant level ( for trend=0.08). Conclusions The present findings suggest that higher serum LBP levels are associated with increased risk of the development of CVD in the general Japanese population.

IL-33 is released from stressed or necrotic cells. Initially, IL-33 was described as an inducer of the humoral immune response, which activated Th2 cells and mast cells involved in modulating  and allergic reactions. In addition, IL-33 acts as a stimulator of the Th1, NK, and CD8T cells, which induce a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. It was recently discovered that this cytokine is involved in the development of cancer by performing both pro- and antitumor functions. IL-33 can directly affect tumor cells and provokes their proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Moreover, IL-33 stimulates carcinogenesis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing angiogenesis, thus contributing to the generation of immunosuppressive conditions. At the same time, IL-33 causes tumor infiltration with cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes and natural killers, which leads to cytolysis-mediated cancer cell death. This review describes the versatile role of the IL-33/ST2 cascade in the development of experimental and clinical tumors. In addition, we discuss the prospects for the application of IL-33 and ST2 as diagnostic biomarkers and targets for cancer immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659856>Clinical and laboratory predictions of myocardial  as detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with systemic sclerosis: A pilot study.</a></h2><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) has high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating cardiac fibrosis from .

The multivariate analysis revealed that every 5 years of increased age at onset and every 5-point increase in the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) at onset was significantly associated with myocardial  (odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.22-0.98; and 2.64 95% CI 1.04-6.74, respectively). Neither the SSc subset, internal organ involvement, inflammatory markers, nor cardiac and muscle enzymes were associated with myocardial  in SSc.Myocardial  is common in early-onset SSc. An increased risk of myocardial  was associated with young age and high mRSS at onset. Cardiac MRI is the suggested evaluation for high-risk SSc patients experiencing dyspnea on exertion.© 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661488>Cell generation dynamics underlying naive T-cell homeostasis in adult humans.</a></h2><p>Thymic involution and proliferation of naive T cells both contribute to shaping the naive T-cell repertoire as humans age, but a clear understanding of the roles of each throughout a human life span has been difficult to determine. By measuring nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA, we determined the turnover rates of CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell populations and defined their dynamics in healthy individuals ranging from 20 to 65 years of age. We demonstrate that naive T-cell generation decreases with age because of a combination of declining peripheral division and thymic production during adulthood. Concomitant decline in T-cell loss compensates for decreased generation rates. We investigated putative mechanisms underlying age-related changes in homeostatic regulation of CD4+ naive T-cell turnover, using mass cytometry to profile candidate signaling pathways involved in T-cell activation and proliferation relative to CD31 expression, a marker of thymic proximity for the CD4+ naive T-cell population. We show that basal nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation positively correlated with CD31 expression and thus is decreased in peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones. Functionally, we found that NF-κB signaling was essential for naive T-cell proliferation to the homeostatic growth factor interleukin (IL)-7, and reduced NF-κB phosphorylation in CD4+CD31- naive T cells is linked to reduced homeostatic proliferation potential. Our results reveal an age-related decline in naive T-cell turnover as a putative regulator of naive T-cell diversity and identify a molecular pathway that restricts proliferation of peripherally expanded naive T-cell clones that accumulate with age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658792>Wound healing effect of regenerated oxidized cellulose versus fibrin sealant patch: An in vivo study.</a></h2><p>Topical hemostatic agents are used when ligation, electrocauterization, or other conventional hemostatic methods are impractical. Because a hemostatic agent is a foreign body, it can cause foreign body reactions, , and infections that can interfere with the wound healing process. Therefore, we should select hemostatic agents after considering their effects on wound healing. Here, we compared the effects of hemostatic agents on wound healing in a rectus abdominis muscle defect in rats.Twelve Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to creation of a 6 × 6 mm defect in the rectus abdominis muscle and divided into four groups: control group; group A, Tachosil fibrin sealant patch; group B, Surgicel Fibrillar oxidized regenerated cellulose; and group C, Surgicel Snow oxidized regenerated cellulose. For the histologic analysis, biopsies were performed on the 3rd, 7th, and 27th days.The foreign body reaction was the weakest in group A and most significant in group C. The inflammatory cell infiltration was the weakest in group A and similar in groups B and C. Muscle regeneration differed among periods. The rats in group A were the most active initially, while those in group C showed prolonged activity.Tachosil and Surgicel administration increased  via foreign body reactions, but the overall wound healing process was not significantly affected. The increased  in the Surgicel groups was due to a low pH. We recommend using Tachosil, because it results in less intense foreign body reactions than Surgicel and faster wound healing due to the fibrin action.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658751> and Probiotics Interactions from a Prolongevity Perspective.</a></h2><p>Probiotics exert beneficial effects on host health through different mechanisms of action, such as production of antimicrobial substances, competition with pathogens, enhancement of host mucosal barrier integrity and immunomodulation. In the context of ageing, which is characterized by several physiological alterations leading to a low grade inflammatory status called inflammageing, evidences suggest a potential prolongevity role of probiotics. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying anti-ageing effects requires the use of simple model systems. To this respect, the nematode  represents a suitable model organism for the study of both host-microbe interactions and for ageing studies, because of conserved signaling pathways and host defense mechanisms involved in the regulation of its lifespan. Therefore, this review analyses the impact of probiotics on  age-related parameters, with particular emphasis on oxidative stress, immunity,  and protection from pathogen infections. The picture emerging from our analysis highlights that several probiotic strains are able to exert anti-ageing effects in nematodes by acting on common molecular pathways, such as insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IIS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). In this perspective,  appears to be advantageous for shedding light on key mechanisms involved in host prolongevity in response to probiotics supplementation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658432>COCCIDIOSIS IN GREEN TURTLES () IN AUSTRALIA: PATHOGENESIS, SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION, AND CLIMATE-RELATED DETERMINANTS OF DISEASE OUTBREAKS.</a></h2><p>  An epizootic of coccidiosis in free-ranging green turtles () occurred in Australia in 1991 and the parasites were thought to be . Recurring outbreaks over an increased geographic range followed. We used medical records and temporal and spatial data of turtles diagnosed with coccidiosis between 1991 and 2014 to characterize the disease and factors associated with outbreaks. Most affected animals were subadults or older. Neurologic signs with intralesional cerebral coccidia were observed. Coccidia associated with  and necrosis were predominantly found in the intestine, brain, kidney, and thyroid. Cases occurred in the spring and summer. Three major outbreaks (1991, 2002, and 2014) were concentrated in Port Stephens, New South Wales (NSW) and Moreton Bay, Queensland (QLD), but cases occurred as far south as Sydney, NSW. Coccidiosis cases were more likely during, or 1 mo prior to, El Niño-like events. Molecular characterization of the 18S rRNA locus of coccidia from tissues of 10 green turtles collected in 2002 and 2004 in Port Stevens and Sydney imply that they were -like organisms. Two sequences were identified. The genotype 3 sequence was most common (in eight of 10 turtles), with 98.8% similarity to the 18S sequence of . The Genotype 4 sequence was less common (in two of 10 turtles) with 99.7% similarity to the 18S sequence of the most common genotype (Genotype 1) detected in turtles from the 2014 Moreton Bay outbreak. Our study will help with the identification and management of future outbreaks and provide tools for identification of additional disease patterns in green turtles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655880>Amelioration of TMAO through probiotics and its potential role in atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortalities and morbidities worldwide. It is associated with hyperlipidemia and , and become chronic by triggering metabolites in different metabolic pathways. Disturbance in the human gut microbiota is now considered a critical factor in the atherosclerosis. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) attracts attention and is regarded as a vital contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. TMAO is generated from its dietary precursors choline, carnitine, and phosphatidylcholine by gut microbiota into an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenases. The present review focus on advances in TMAO preventing strategies through probiotics, including, modulation of gut microbiome, metabolomics profile, miRNA, or probiotic antagonistic abilities. Furthermore, possible recommendations based on relevant literature have been presented, which could be applied in probiotics and atherosclerosis-preventing strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660146>Fermented black radish ( L. var. ) attenuates methionine and choline deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice.</a></h2><p>As one of the wide-ranging form of chronic liver disease, there are only limited therapeutic options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We evaluated whether fermented black radish ( L. var. ; FBR) ameliorates lipid accumulation, , and hepatic fibrosis, which are characteristics of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Fermented black radish treatment reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which appeared to be associated with the downregulation of adipogenic transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and lipid accumulation-related genes including adipocyte protein-2 and fatty acid synthase. Administration of FBR to C57BL/6J mice challenged with methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet significantly attenuated the increased serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and triglyceride. In addition, treatment with FBR interestingly repressed the hepatic  induced with MCD diet, by lowering the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and suppressing the inactivation of macrophages and Kupffer cells in the liver. Fermented black radish was also shown to mitigate liver fibrosis through the inhibition of alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor beta-1, and collagen type I alpha 1 chain. Our results indicate that FBR ameliorates NAFLD and its related metabolic disease by regulating multiple pathways, suggesting that FBR may be an effective dietary supplement for ameliorating NAFLD.© 2019 The Authors.

Among the inflammatory mediators related to obesity development are the adipokines. These cytokines are released from fatty tissues and act in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner. Adipocytes influence the comorbidities of obesity such as osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA). It is still controversial as to whether OP is associated with either a low or high body mass index, but it is quite clear that the latter condition increases the risk for OA development. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAs) have the same precursors of osteoblasts, which are the primary cells involved in bone formation, and the amount of BMAs appears to be inversely related to bone mineral density. Although adipokines released by these adipocytes influence bone loss progress, their exact role remains controversial. Differently, the infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) is indicated to protect the function of joint regarding OA. However, there is relatively limited information about the secretion of adipokines and other inflammatory mediators by the IPFP. Despite some inconsistencies, nutritional interventions targeting obesity may also benefit patients with OP and OA. The association among obesity, OP, and OA is quite complex, and many factors need to be explored that are mainly related to the role of adipokines derived locally rather than from visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Also, nutritional intervention may affect fatty tissue mass and secretion of inflammatory mediators that may, at least in part, influence other tissues in the organism such as bone and articular cartilage. The aim of this review was to present the latest knowledge about the interrelationship between obesity and OA or OP and to discuss whether a dietary intervention for obesity will hold promise for patients with OA or OP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
