Blood, tissues, urine and faeces were collected after dosing to determine drug and metabolite levels using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 3. Our study demonstrated that plasma levels of madecassoside, and to a lesser extent asiaticoside, were higher after administration of ECa 233 than the corresponding values for the pure compounds. There was a bidirectional interconversion between asiaticoside and madecassoside consistent with the increased exposure of madecassoside and asiaticoside in ECa 233. 4. Both madecassoside and asiaticoside appeared to be widely distributed in several organs and metabolized extensively; following intravenous administration of either compound, approximately 80-90% of the dose was recovered as  and asiatic acid in the faeces.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22864972>Centella asiatica attenuates the neurobehavioral, neurochemical and histological changes in transient focal middle cerebral artery occlusion rats.</a></h2><p>Centella asiatica has been used as psychoactive and antioxidant herbal medicine since ancient time. The present study was design to evaluate the preventive role of ethanolic extract of C. asiatica in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Male Wistar rats were gavaged orally with C. asiatica extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight once daily) for 21 days and thereafter subjected to right MCAO for 2 h followed by 22-h reperfusion. Brain injury was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Behavioural outcomes as neurological deficit, rota rod test, and grip strength were assessed. In addition, lipid peroxidation, enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants were analyzed to assess the oxidative stress. Our results revealed that C. asiatica administration greatly improved neurobehavioral activity and diminished infarction volume along with the restored histological morphology of brain in MCAO rats. Furthermore, supplementation with this extract to MCAO group has reduced the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive species, restored glutathione content and augmented the activities of antioxidant enzymes-catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase in a dose-dependent manner in ischemic rats. The remarkable antioxidant activity of C. asiatica may be attributed to its bioactive triterpenes, asiatic acid, asiaticoside,  and madecosside and may be translated to clinical level for prevention of ischemic stroke.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22816768>Bioavailability, distribution, and antioxidative effects of selected triterpenes in mice.</a></h2><p>This study analyzed the content of eight triterpenes (oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, arjunolic acid, asiatic acid, boswellic acid, corosolic acid, , and maslinic acid) in ten vegetables and eight fruits. These compounds at 0.5% were supplied to mice for 4 or 8 weeks. The bioavailability, tissue distribution, and antioxidative protection of these triterpenes were examined. Results showed that triterpenes were detected in eight vegetables and six fruits. Basil and brown mustard contained seven test triterpenes, in the range of 14-102 mg/100 g dry weight. The level of each triterpene in plasma, brain, heart, liver, kidney, colon, and bladder increased as the feeding period was increased from 4 weeks to 8 weeks (P < 0.05). Renal homogenates from mice with triterpene intake had greater antioxidative effects against glucose-induced glutathione loss and malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione production when compared with those from control groups (P < 0.05). These data support that these triterpenes were absorbed and deposited in their intact forms, which in turn exerted in vivo antioxidative protection.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856998>An improved HPLC method for quantitative determination of six triterpenes in Centella asiatica extracts and commercial products.</a></h2><p>An improved HPLC qualitative and quantitative method of six triterpenes (asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, , terminolic acid, and asiaticoside-B) in Centella asiatica (raw plant material and preparations) is described in this paper. After 50 minutes the six active triterpenes were separated and detected in the methanolic extract at a limit of 0.01 microg/ml. The method uses a Phenomenex Aqua 5mu C18 (200 A) column as the stationary phase, a gradient mobile phase of water (0.1% TFA), acetonitrile (0.1% TFA), and methyl tert-butyl ether (0.1% TFA), and UV detection at 206 nm. The correlation coefficients for the calibration curves and the recovery rates ranged from 0.995 to 0.999 and from 98.39% to 100.02%, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative results are discussed.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10356407>Triterpenes from Centella asiatica stimulate extracellular matrix accumulation in rat experimental wounds.</a></h2><p>Titrated Extract from Centella asiatica (TECA) is a drug which has been used for many years in Europe for the treatment of wound healing defects. It is a reconstituted mixture of 3 triterpenes extracted from the plant, asiatic acid,  and asiaticoside. In this report, we studied the effects of TECA and its separated components in the wound chamber model described by Schilling et al. Stainless steel wound chambers were surgically inserted under the skin of rats and received serial injections of either TECA or its purified components. Chambers were collected at days 7, 14, 21 or 28 for biochemical analysis or histological examination. TECA-injected wound chambers were characterized by increased dry , DNA, total protein, collagen and uronic acid contents. Peptidic hydroproline was also increased, showing an increased remodeling of the collagen matrix in the wound. The 3 purified components of TECA were all able to reproduce the effects of the complete drug, with some differences depending on the product. Asiatic acid and asiaticoside were the most active of the 3 triterpenes. Asiaticoside exerted a preferential stimulation of collagen synthesis and was active at low doses only. In addition to collagen, the 3 components were also able to stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25556066>A LC-ESI-MS method for the simultaneous determination of madecassoside and its metabolite  in rat plasma: comparison pharmacokinetics in normal and collagen-induced arthritic rats.</a></h2><p>To develop a simple and highly sensitive high performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS) method for the simultaneous determination of madecassoside and its major metabolite  in rat plasma, and compare the pharmacokinetics of the two compounds in normal and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Glycyrrhetinic acid was used as the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was accomplished on an Inertsil ODS-3 column, using a gradient elution with the mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water acidified with 0.1% (V/V) formic acid. Detection was achieved by ESI-MS under the negative selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. In normal and CIA rats, madecassoside (30 mg·kg(-1)) was orally administered for 21 consecutive days from the day of arthritis onset. For madecassoside, the linear range was 10-1 000 ng·mL(-1) with the square regression coefficient (r) of 0.998 9, while for , the linear range was 10-500 ng·mL(-1) with the square regression coefficient (r) of 0.996 1. The lower limit of quantification was 10 ng·mL(-1) for both analytes. The intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 1.78% to 13.42% for madecassoside and 2.30% to 14.90% for , and the accuracy was between -0.95% and 6.30% for madecassoside and between -1.48% and 5.34% for . The average recoveries of madecassoside,  and IS from spiked plasma samples were > 81%. The developed method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of madecassoside and  in rats after an oral administration of madecassoside. During initial 7 days of dosing, the cmax and AUC of madecassoside were greatly decreased and Vd/F was markedly increased in CIA rats, and no significant difference was observed on the first day of dosing. In contrast, the T1/2, cmax and AUC of  were significantly increased, and Ke of  was greatly decreased in CIA rats compared with normal rats. Along with repeated administration of madecassoside, the differences of pharmacokinetic parameters of both madecassoside and  between CIA and normal rats gradually subsided. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of both madecassoside and  in rats were significantly altered by arthritis status, and the differences of pharmacokinetic parameters between arthritis and normal rats coincide with the severity of arthritis.Copyright © 2014 China Pharmaceutical University.
