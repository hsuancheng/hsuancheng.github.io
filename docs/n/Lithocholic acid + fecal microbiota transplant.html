<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group). Following 10 weeks of tumor growth, all animals were sacrificed to collect total white adipose tissue (WAT). Luminex assays were performed for gut hormone and inflammation marker analysis. Bile acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in feces and serum. The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels. Moreover, the TG mice displayed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-10. , deoxycholic , and ursodeoxycholic  were significantly decreased in the stool of TG mice. Significant alterations of the intestinal microbiome were found in the ileal contents of the TG.The present study provides a first glimpse that human NB in a murine model induces tumor cachexia associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory parameters, as well as changes in the intestinal microbiota. Since the intestinal microbiome is known to contribute to the host's ability to harvest energy, a favorable modulation of the intestinal microbiome in tumor patients could potentially represent a novel therapeutic target to prevent tumor-associated cachexia.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fecal microbiota transplant</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408609>-Derived Metabolic Factors Reduce Campylobacteriosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Campylobacter jejuni, a prevalent foodborne bacterial pathogen, exploits the host innate response to induce colitis. Little is known about the roles of  in C jejuni-induced intestinal inflammation. We investigated interactions between  and intestinal cells during C jejuni infection of mice.Germ-free C57BL/6 Il10 mice were colonized with conventional  and infected with a single dose of C jejuni (10 colony-forming units/mouse) via gavage. Conventional  were cultured under aerobic, microaerobic, or anaerobic conditions and orally transplanted into germ-free Il10 mice. Colon tissues were collected from mice and analyzed by histology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblotting. Fecal  and bile acids were analyzed with 16S sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, respectively.Introduction of conventional  reduced C jejuni-induced colitis in previously germ-free Il10 mice, independent of fecal load of C jejuni, accompanied by reduced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin.  transplantation and 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing experiments showed that Clostridium XI, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were enriched in fecal samples from mice colonized with  cultured in anaerobic conditions (which reduce colitis) compared with mice fed  cultured under aerobic conditions (susceptible to colitis). Oral administration to mice of -derived secondary bile  sodium deoxycholate, but not ursodeoxycholic  or , reduced C jejuni-induced colitis. Depletion of secondary bile -producing bacteria with antibiotics that kill anaerobic bacteria (clindamycin) promoted C jejuni-induced colitis in specific pathogen-free Il10 mice compared with the nonspecific antibiotic nalidixic ; colitis induction by antibiotics was associated with reduced level of luminal deoxycholate.We identified a mechanism by which the  controls susceptibility to C jejuni infection in mice, via bacteria-derived secondary bile acids.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute.
