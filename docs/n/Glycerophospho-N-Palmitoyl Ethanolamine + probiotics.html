The gastrointestinal tract of cattle and other ruminants is the principal reservoir of EHEC strains and outbreaks have been associated with direct contact with the farm environment, and with the consumption of meat, dairy products, water and fruit or vegetable contaminated with ruminant manure. Several outbreaks occurred these last years in France. In Brazil, although STEC carriage in ruminants is important, human cases due to EHEC are fairly rare. In order to reduce EHEC survival in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract and thus limit contamination of food products, it is necessary to determine the mechanisms underlying EHEC persistence in this ecosystem with the aim of developing nutritional or ecological strategies. The effect of  has been tested in vitro on the growth and survival of EHEC strains and in vivo on the animal carriage of these strains. Various studies have then shown that lactic bacteria or non-pathogenic E. coli strains were able to limit EHEC fecal shedding. In addition, understanding EHEC physiology in the ruminant gut is also critical for limiting EHEC shedding. We found that EHEC O157:H7 is able to use  and mucus-derived sugars as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Thus, these substrates represent an ecological niche for EHEC and their utilization confers a competitive growth advantage to these pathogens as they use them more rapidly than the bacteria belonging to the resident intestinal microbiota. Understanding EHEC metabolism and ecology in the bovine intestinal tract will allow proposing probiotic strains to compete with EHEC for nutrients and thus decrease the sanitary risk.© Société de Biologie, 2014.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23272193>Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) regulates IL-10 signaling in the developing murine colon through upregulation of the IL-10R2 receptor subunit.</a></h2><p>The intestinal microflora is critical for normal development, with aberrant colonization increasing the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In contrast, probiotic bacteria have been shown to decrease its incidence. Multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines have been identified as markers of intestinal inflammation, both in human patients with NEC and in models of immature intestine. Specifically, IL-10 signaling attenuates intestinal responses to gut dysbiosis, and disruption of this pathway exacerbates inflammation in murine models of NEC. However, the effects of  on IL-10 and its signaling pathway, remain poorly defined. Real-time PCR profiling revealed developmental regulation of MIP-2, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-10 and the IL-10R2 subunit of the IL-10 receptor in immature murine colon, while the expression of IL-6 and IL-18 was independent of postnatal age. Enteral administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) down-regulated the expression of TNF-α and MIP-2 and yet failed to alter IL-10 mRNA and protein expression. LGG did however induce mRNA expression of the IL-10R2 subunit of the IL-10 receptor. IL-10 receptor activation has been associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3-dependent induction of members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. In 2 week-old mice, LGG also induced STAT3 phosphorylation, increased colonic expression of SOCS-3, and attenuated colonic production of MIP-2 and TNF-α. These LGG-dependent changes in phosphoSTAT3, SOCS3, MIP-2 and TNF-α were all inhibited by antibody-mediated blockade of the IL-10 receptor. Thus LGG decreased baseline proinflammatory cytokine expression in the developing colon through upregulation of IL-10 receptor-mediated signaling, most likely due to the combined induction of phospho-STAT3 and SOCS3. Furthermore, LGG-dependent increases in IL-10R2 were associated with reductions in TNF-α, MIP-2 and disease severity in a murine model of intestinal injury in the immature colon.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18494044>Pharmacological approach to acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge regarding pharmacological prevention and treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP) based on experimental animal models and clinical trials. Somatostatin (SS) and octreotide inhibit the exocrine production of pancreatic enzymes and may be useful as prophylaxis against post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP). The protease inhibitor gabexate mesilate (GM) is used routinely as treatment to AP in some countries, but randomized clinical trials and a meta-analysis do not support this practice. Nitroglycerin (NGL) is a nitrogen oxide (NO) donor, which relaxes the sphincter of Oddi. Studies show conflicting results when applied prior to ERCP and a large multicenter randomized study is warranted. Steroids administered as prophylaxis against PEP has been validated without effect in several randomized trials. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) indomethacin and diclofenac have in randomized studies showed potential as prophylaxis against PEP. Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties but two trials testing IL-10 as prophylaxis to PEP have returned conflicting results. Antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) have a potential as rescue therapy but no clinical trials are currently being conducted. The antibiotics beta-lactams and quinolones reduce mortality when necrosis is present in pancreas and may also reduce incidence of infected necrosis. Evidence based pharmacological treatment of AP is limited and studies on the effect of potent anti-inflammatory drugs are warranted.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21475185>Cardiovascular disease: the diet-microbe morbid union.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23611612>Necrotizing enterocolitis: pathophysiology, platelet-activating factor, and .</a></h2><p>Although smaller and younger preterm neonates can now survive long term due to advances in neonatal medicine, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) continues to plague the clinicians caring for these tiny patients.

Multifactorial evidence suggests that a defect of innate immune response to microbial agents is involved in IBD. This editorial outlines the immunopathogenesis of IBD and their current and future therapy. We present IBD as a result of dysregulated mucosal response in the intestinal wall facilitated by defects in epithelial barrier function and the mucosal immune system with excessive production of cytokines growth factors, adhesion molecules, and reactive oxygen metabolites, resulting in tissue injury. Established and evolving therapies are discussed in the second part of this editorial and at the end of this section we review new therapies to modulate the immune system in patients with IBD.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071871>Efficacy of heat-killed Lactococcus lactis JCM 5805 on immunity and fatigue during consecutive high intensity exercise in male athletes: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial.</a></h2><p>Lactococcus lactis JCM 5805 (LC-Plasma) is a unique lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). We aimed to evaluate the effect of LC-Plasma on dendritic cell (DC) activity and subjective indices of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and fatigue in athletes under high intensity exercise.We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial. Fifty-one male subjects belonging to a university sports club were randomized into placebo (n = 25) and LC-Plasma (n = 26) groups. Individuals ingested placebo capsules containing cornstarch or LC-Plasma capsules containing 100 billion cells of heat-killed LC-Plasma per day for 13 days. During the intervention period, subjects performed high intensity exercise according to their sports club training regime. Blood and saliva sampling were obtained at days 1 and 14, and physical conditions were recorded in a diary. We investigated expression of maturation markers on DCs, muscle damage and stress markers and used student's t test adjusted by Bonferoni's method for multiple comparison between groups. These data were presented as mean ± SD. We also investigated cumulative days of symptoms regarding infections and fatigue and used Chi-square test for comparison between groups. These data were presented as cumulative number.CD86 as maturation marker on pDC was significantly increased in the LC-Plasma group at day 14 (Placebo: 296 ± 70 vs. LC-Plasma: 365 ± 115; Mean Fluorescent Intensity; p = 0.013). Cumulative days of URTI were significantly lower in the LC-Plasma group (Placebo: URTI positive 56, URTI negative 256 vs. LC-Plasma: URTI positive 39, URTI negative 299; days; p = 0.028) and symptoms like sneeze or running nose were significantly lower in the LC-Plasma group (Placebo: Symptom positive 52, Symptom negative 258, vs. LC-Plasma: Symptom positive 36, Symptom negative 301; days; p = 0.032). Moreover, the cumulative days of fatigue were significantly fewer in the LC-Plasma group (Placebo: Symptom positive 128, Symptom negative 182, vs. LC-Plasma: Symptom positive 110, Symptom negative 225; days; p = 0.032). Markers of muscle damage and stress markers were not significantly different between groups.We consider that heat-killed LC-Plasma supplementation relieves morbidity and symptoms of URTI via activation of pDC and decreases fatigue accumulation during consecutive high intensity exercise in athletes.

Pathophysiology of IBD and NEC includes the production of diverse lipid mediators, including platelet-activating factor (PAF) that mediate inflammatory responses in the disease. PAF is known to activate NF-κB, however, the mechanisms of PAF-induced inflammation are not fully defined. We have recently described a novel PAF-triggered pathway of NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), requiring the pivotal role of the adaptor protein Bcl10 and its interactions with CARMA3 and MALT1. The current studies examined the potential role of the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus in reversing the PAF-induced, Bcl10-dependent NF-κB activation and IL-8 production in IECs. PAF treatment (5 µM×24 h) of NCM460 and Caco-2 cells significantly increased nuclear p65 NF-κB levels and IL-8 secretion (2-3-fold, P<0.05), compared to control, which were blocked by pretreatment of the cells for 6 h with L. acidophilus (LA) or its culture supernatant (CS), followed by continued treatments with PAF for 24 h. LA-CS also attenuated PAF-induced increase in Bcl10 mRNA and protein levels and Bcl10 promoter activity. LA-CS did not alter PAF-induced interaction of Bcl10 with CARMA3, but attenuated Bcl10 interaction with MALT1 and also PAF-induced ubiquitination of IKKγ. Efficacy of bacteria-free CS of LA in counteracting PAF-induced inflammatory cascade suggests that soluble factor(s) in the CS of LA mediate these effects. These results define a novel mechanism by which  counteract PAF-induced inflammation in IECs.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191486>Microbiome: Bacterial broadband.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28085895>Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 Attenuates Induction of Hypertrophy in Cardiomyocytes but Not through Secreted Protein MSP-1 (p75).</a></h2><p>Previous animal studies have shown that the administration of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus can provide a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion and necrotic injury to the intestine, liver, and heart, as well as a therapeutic effect to the outcome of ischemic injury to the heart, including cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

The lactic acid bacteria (LAB), frequently employed as , are unusual in having little or no requirement for iron. Iron in the human body is sequestered by transferrins and lactoferrin, limiting bacterial growth. An increase in the availability of iron in the intestine by bleeding, surgery, or under stress leads to an increase in the growth and virulence of many pathogens. Under these high iron conditions, LAB are rapidly out-competed; for the levels of probiotic bacteria to be maintained under high iron conditions they must be able to respond by increasing growth rate to compete with the normal flora. Despite this, iron-responsive genera are poorly characterised as .Here, we show that a panel of  are not able to respond to increased iron availability, and identify an isolate of Streptococcus thermophilus that can increase growth rate in response to increased iron availability. The isolate of S. thermophilus selected was able to reduce epithelial cell death as well as NF-κB signalling and IL-8 production triggered by pathogens. It was capable of crossing an epithelial cell barrier in conjunction with E. coli and downregulating Th1 and Th17 responses in primary human intestinal leukocytes.We propose that an inability to compete with potential pathogens under conditions of high iron availability such as stress and trauma may contribute to the lack of efficacy of many LAB-based  in treating disease. Therefore, we offer an alternative paradigm which considers that  should be able to be competitive during periods of intestinal bleeding, trauma or stress.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25280039>Retrospective observational study to investigate Sinerga, a multifactorial nutritional product, and bacterial extracts in the prevention of recurrent respiratory infections in children.</a></h2><p>In this retrospective observational clinical study, 167 children, aged 3 to 7 years, of both sexes, with a clinical history of recurrent respiratory infections, administered with bacterial extracts of first and second generation or Sinerga a nutritional product containing palmitoylethanolamide, bovine colostrum, phenylethylamine and the new generation of probiotic kluyveromyces FM B0399, were observed.

Both groups consisted of 7 sham-operated rats, 10 rats that underwent I/R, and 10 that underwent I/R plus 8 wk of probiotic dietary supplementation. In rats fed a standard diet, I/R induced a decrease in sinusoid perfusion (P < 0.001), severe liver inflammation, and necrosis besides an increase of tissue levels of malondialdehyde (P < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1beta (P < 0.001), and IL-6 (P < 0.001) and of serum levels of transaminase (P < 0.001) and lipopolysaccharides (P < 0.001) vs. sham-operated rats.

The severity of liver and gut microbiota alterations induced by I/R was even greater in rats with liver inflammation and steatosis, i.e., MCD-fed animals. LP-F19 supplementation significantly reduced the harmful effects of I/R on the liver and on gut microbiota in both groups of rats, although the effect was slightly less in MCD-fed animals.

We aimed to quantify the prevalence of bloating in gastroparesis and relate its severity to clinical factors and quality of life.Survey, examination, and scintigraphy data were compared in 335 gastroparesis patients from 6 centers of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium. Bloating severity was stratified using Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) bloating subscale scores.Bloating severity of at least mild (GCSI ≥2) and severe (GCSI ≥4) grades were reported by 76 and 41% of patients, respectively. Bloating severity related to female gender (P<0.0001) and overweight status (P=0.04) on regression analysis and correlated with intensity of nausea, postprandial fullness, visible distention, abdominal pain, and altered bowel function (P<0.05). Disease etiology, smoking status, and gastric emptying did not relate to bloating subset (P>0.05). Disease-specific quality of life and general measures of well-being were progressively impaired with increasing bloating severity (P=0.01). Probiotic use (P=0.03) and use of antidepressants with significant norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor activity (P=0.045) use related to bloating severity; antiemetic use trended higher with worsening bloating (P=0.06).Bloating is prevalent in gastroparesis and is severe in many individuals. Bloating severity relates to female gender, body weight, and intensity of other symptoms. The symptom impairs quality of life but is not influenced by gastric emptying rates.

Although several predisposing factors have been identified, such as prematurity, enteral feeding, and infection, its pathogenesis remains elusive. In the past 20 years, we have established several animal models of NEC in rats and found several endogenous mediators, especially platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a pivotal role in NEC. Injection of PAF induces intestinal necrosis, and PAF antagonists prevent the bowel injury induced by bacterial endotoxin, hypoxia, or challenge with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) plus endotoxin in adult rats. The same is true for lesions induced by hypoxia and enteral feeding in neonatal animals. Human patients with NEC show high levels of PAF and decreased plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase, the enzyme degrading PAF. The initial event in our experimental models of NEC is probably polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and adhesion to venules in the intestine, which initiates a local inflammatory reaction involving proinflammatory mediators including TNF, complement, prostaglandins, and leukotriene C4. Subsequent norepinephrine release and mesenteric vasoconstriction result in splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion. Bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) enter the intestinal tissue during local mucosal barrier breakdown, and endotoxin synergizes with PAF to amplify the inflammation. Reactive oxygen species produced by the activated leukocytes and by intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase may be the final pathway for tissue injury. Protective mechanisms include nitric oxide produced by the constitutive (mainly neuronal) nitric oxide synthase, and indigenous  such as Bifidobacteria infantis. The former maintains intestinal perfusion and the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the latter keep virulent bacteria in check. The development of tissue injury depends on the balance between injurious and protective mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178233>Mechanistic and therapeutic advances in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by targeting the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common metabolic diseases currently in the context of obesity worldwide, which contains a spectrum of chronic liver diseases, including hepatic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic carcinoma. In addition to the classical "Two-hit" theory, NAFLD has been recognized as a typical gut microbiota-related disease because of the intricate role of gut microbiota in maintaining human health and disease formation. Moreover, gut microbiota is even regarded as a "metabolic organ" that play complementary roles to that of liver in many aspects. The mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-mediated development of NAFLD include modulation of host energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and bile acid and choline metabolism.

Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut microbiota aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of  can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. They also suggest the therapeutic potential of L. helveticus NS8 in stress-related and possibly other kinds of depression.Copyright © 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 90 patients with MHE were allocated by simple randomisation to three parallel equal groups. Group A received lactulose, group B a probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus) and group C served as the control. After informed consent, patients were tested for gut micrecology, fasting blood ammonia, liver functions and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination to study brain metabolites, mainly choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), glutamine+glutamate (Glx) and creatinin (Cre). Patients who developed overt encephalopathy were excluded from analysis. The whole battery of investigations was repeated in the same order after 4weeks.The probiotic was better tolerated than lactulose. The relative risk reduction (RRR) of developing overt encephalopathy was 60% in the case of lactulose and 80% in the case of probiotic, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.4 and 2.3, respectively. The differential but not total microecology count was significantly shifted towards saccharolytic rather than proteolytic bacteria. The mI/Cre and (Cho+mI)/Glx ratios were significantly increased and the Glx/Cre ratio was significantly reduced after 1month-follow-up in the probiotic group compared to the lactulose group and in both treatment groups compared to the control group.Both probiotic and lactulose therapy can improve blood ammonia and psychometric tests in MHE and reduce the risk of developing overt encephalopathy.

It provides, on the one hand, prolonged viability of probiotic bacteria in culture fluid within 6 months and, on the other hand, optimal pharmacokinetics of preparation due to gradual desorption of metabolites from sorbent globules.Sorbent Spherocell DEAE is biocompatible with cells of manufacturing strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and E. coli and recommended for designing of immobilized .</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039147>Lactobacillus plantarum ZDY04 exhibits a strain-specific property of lowering TMAO via the modulation of gut microbiota in mice.</a></h2><p>Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is oxidized from trimethylamine (TMA) by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs), promotes the development of atherosclerosis and is a new target for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease from the perspective of intestinal flora. TMA is transformed by intestinal flora from TMA-containing nutrients, such as choline. Some small molecular agents lower serum TMAO and/or cecal TMA levels. However,  that can effectively reduce serum TMAO levels are currently lacking. In this work, five potentially probiotic strains were administered to mice supplemented with 1.3% choline. Only Lactobacillus plantarum ZDY04 significantly reduced serum TMAO and cecal TMA levels by modulating the relative abundance of the families Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Bacteroidaceae and the genus Mucispirillum in mice and not by influencing the expression levels of hepatic FMO3 and metabolizing choline, TMA, and TMAO. In addition, L. plantarum ZDY04 can significantly inhibit the development of TMAO-induced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- 1.3% choline-fed mice as compared with the untreated PBS group. In conclusion, the use of L. plantarum ZDY04 may be an alternative approach to reduce serum TMAO levels and TMAO-induced atherosclerosis in mice.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22308719>[Sorption properties of various polysaccharide matrixes to Lactobacillus plantarum 8RA-3 bacteria].</a></h2><p>Study of sorption properties of various spherical polysaccharide matrixes designated as Spherocell to probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 8RA-3 bacteria.Industrial strain of L. plantarum 8PA-3 was used. The process of immobilization of lactobacilli on 3 variants of spherical sorbents was studied. The first sorbent - neutral, composed of nonpolar cellulose matrix with ("0") charge, the second--DEAE obtained by modification of cellulose by diethylaminoethyl groups with positive ("+") charge and the third--CM (carboxymethyl) with negative ("-") charge. Cellulose matrixes were designated by us by the term Spherocell. Immobilization of bacterial cells on Spherocell was performed by addition of suspension containing 1.0 x 10(9) CFU/ml. The effect of bacterial immobilization was evaluated by CFU/ ml titration and by electron microscopy.The dependence on matrix charge of adsorption immobilization on sorbent granules of lactobacilli cells was shown. At certain equal parameters (granule size, surface characteristics, charge value) the positively charged matrix sorbed 3-10 times more cells than neutral and 20-25 times more than negatively charged matrix. Each 100-180 microm Spherocell DEAE particle could sorb more than 1000 viable bacterial cells.Positively charged polysaccharide matrix Spherocell DEAE obtained by modification of cellulose by diethylaminoethyl groups is promising for creation of immobilized probiotic preparations.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465927>Probiotic supplementation and trimethylamine-N-oxide production following a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the multi-strain probiotic VSL#3 would attenuate the increase in fasting plasma concentrations of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) following a high-fat diet.Nineteen healthy, non-obese males (18-30 years) participated in the present study. Following a 2-week eucaloric control diet, subjects were randomized to either VSL#3 (900 billion live bacteria) or placebo (cornstarch) during the consumption of a hypercaloric (+1,000 kcal day(-1) ), high-fat diet (55% fat) for 4 weeks. Plasma TMAO, L-carnitine, choline, and betaine (UPLC-MS/MS) were measured at baseline and following a high-fat diet.Plasma TMAO significantly increased 89% ± 66% vs. 115% ± 61% in both the VSL#3 and placebo groups, respectively; however, the magnitude of change in plasma TMAO was not different (P > 0.05) between them. Plasma L-carnitine, choline, and betaine concentrations did not increase following the high-fat diet in either group.A high-fat diet increases plasma TMAO in healthy, normal-weight, young males. However, VSL#3 treatment does not appear to influence plasma TMAO concentrations following a high-fat diet. Future studies are needed to determine whether other therapeutic strategies can attenuate the production of TMAO.© 2015 The Obesity Society.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453804> Affect One-Carbon Metabolites and Catecholamines in a Genetic Rat Model of Depression.</a></h2><p> may influence one-carbon (C1) metabolism, neurotransmitters, liver function markers, or behavior.Male adult Flinders Sensitive Line rats (model of depression, FSL; n = 22) received Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 (10 or 10 colony-forming units per day) or vehicle for 10 weeks.
