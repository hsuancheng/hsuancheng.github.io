We designed experiments to demonstrate that ER stress is initiated in the hippocampus under chronic IH and determined its role in apoptotic cell death, impaired synaptic structure and plasticity, and memory deficits.Two weeks of IH disrupted ER fine structure and upregulated ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein, in the hippocampus, which could be suppressed by ER stress inhibitors,  (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid. Meanwhile, ER stress induced apoptosis via decreased Bcl-2, promoted reactive oxygen species production, and increased malondialdehyde formation and protein carbonyl, as well as suppressed mitochondrial function. These effects were largely prevented by ER stress inhibitors. On the other hand, suppression of oxidative stress could reduce ER stress. In addition, the length of the synaptic active zone and number of mature spines were reduced by IH. Long-term recognition memory and spatial memory were also impaired, which was accompanied by reduced long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral pathway. These effects were prevented by coadministration of the TUDCA.These results show that ER stress plays a critical role in underlying memory deficits in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-associated IH. Attenuators of ER stress may serve as novel adjunct therapeutic agents for ameliorating OSA-induced neurocognitive impairment.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029706>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Upregulation of STARD1 Promotes Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure.</a></h2><p>Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Mitochondrial SH3BP5 (also called SAB) and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediate the hepatotoxic effects of APAP. We investigated the involvement of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STARD1), a mitochondrial cholesterol transporter, in this process and sensitization by valproic acid (VPA), which depletes glutathione and stimulates steroidogenesis.Nonfasted C57BL/6J mice (control) and mice with liver-specific deletion of STARD1 (Stard1), SAB (Sab), or JNK1 and JNK2 (Jnk1+2) were given VPA with or without APAP. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry and for APAP , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial function. Adult human hepatocytes were transplanted into Fah/Rag2/Il2rg/NOD (FRGN) mice to create mice with humanized livers.Administration of VPA before administration of APAP increased the severity of liver damage in control mice. The combination of VPA and APAP increased expression of CYP2E1, formation of NAPQI-protein adducts, and depletion of glutathione from liver tissues of control mice, resulting in ER stress and the upregulation of STARD1. Livers from control mice given VPA and APAP accumulated cholesterol in the mitochondria and had sustained mitochondrial depletion of glutathione and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of ER stress, by administration of  to control mice, prevented upregulation of STARD1 in liver and protected the mice from hepatoxicity following administration of VPA and APAP. Administration of N-acetylcysteine to control mice prevented VPA- and APAP-induced ER stress and liver injury. Stard1 mice were resistant to induction of ALF by VPA and APAP, despite increased mitochondrial levels of glutathione and phosphorylated JNK; we made similar observations in fasted Stard1 mice given APAP alone. Sab mice or Jnk1+2 mice did not develop ALF following administration of VPA and APAP. The ability of VPA to increase the severity of APAP-induced liver damage was observed in FRGN mice with humanized liver.In studies of mice, we found that upregulation of STARD1 following ER stress mediates APAP hepatoxicity via SH3BP5 and phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

(Fructus Psoraleae (FP)) have been widely used for the treatment of various skin diseases for hundred years. Recently, the emerging FP-induced toxic effects, especially hepatotoxicity, in clinic are getting the public's attention. However, its exact toxic components and mechanisms underlying remain unclear. Bavachin, one of flavonoids in FP, has been documented as a hepatotoxic substance, and the present study aimed to determine the toxicity caused by bavachin and the possible toxic mechanisms involved using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results showed that bavachin could significantly inhibited cell proliferation and trigger the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in a dose dependent manner. Downregulating ER stress using  (TUDCA) obvious attenuated bavachin-triggerd cell apoptosis. Then, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of Mitofusion2 (Mfn2) resulted in a remarkable aggravation of ER stress through the inhibition of the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). Additionally, suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by ROS Scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cystein (NAC)) also reduced bavachin-induced ER stress. Taken together, our study demonstrated that bavachin-induced ER stress caused cell apoptosis by Mfn2-Akt pathway, and that ROS may participate upstream in this mechanism. Here, we not only provide a new understanding of ROS/Mfn2/Akt pathway in bavachin-induced cytotoxicity via the ER stress, but also identify a new specific intervention to prevent FP-induced hepatotoxicity in the future.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534273> Enhances Mitochondrial Biogenesis, Neural Stem Cell Pool, and Early Neurogenesis in Adult Rats.</a></h2><p>Although neurogenesis occurs in restricted regions of the adult mammalian brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) produce very few neurons during ageing or after injury. We have recently discovered that the endogenous bile acid  (TUDCA), a strong inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis and a neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, also enhances NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neuronal conversion by improving mitochondrial integrity and function of NSCs. In the present study, we explore the effect of TUDCA on regulation of NSC fate in neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using rat postnatal neurospheres and adult rats exposed to the bile acid. TUDCA significantly induced NSC proliferation, self-renewal, and neural differentiation in the SVZ, without affecting DG-derived NSCs. More importantly, expression levels of mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins and mitochondrial antioxidant responses were significantly increased by TUDCA in SVZ-derived NSCs. Finally, intracerebroventricular administration of TUDCA in adult rats markedly enhanced both NSC proliferation and early differentiation in SVZ regions, corroborating in vitro data. Collectively, our results highlight a potential novel role for TUDCA in neurologic disorders associated with SVZ niche deterioration and impaired neurogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651747> Improves Motor Symptoms in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe motor symptoms, and currently there is no treatment that retards disease progression or reverses damage prior to the time of clinical diagnosis.  (TUDCA) is neuroprotective in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD; however, its effect in PD motor symptoms has never been addressed. In the present work, an extensive behavior analysis was performed to better characterize the MPTP model of PD and to evaluate the effects of TUDCA in the prevention/improvement of mice phenotype. MPTP induced significant alterations in general motor performance paradigms, including increased latency in the motor swimming, adhesive removal and pole tests, as well as altered gait, foot dragging, and tremors. TUDCA administration, either before or after MPTP, significantly reduced the swimming latency, improved gait quality, and decreased foot dragging. Importantly, TUDCA was also effective in the prevention of typical parkinsonian symptoms such as spontaneous activity, ability to initiate movement and tremors. Accordingly, TUDCA prevented MPTP-induced decrease of dopaminergic fibers and ATP levels, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Overall, MPTP-injected mice presented motor symptoms that are aggravated throughout time, resembling human parkinsonism, whereas PD motor symptoms were absent or mild in TUDCA-treated animals, and no aggravation was observed in any parameter. The thorough demonstration of improvement of PD symptoms together with the demonstration of the pathways triggered by TUDCA supports a subsequent clinical trial in humans and future validation of the application of this bile acid in PD.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049998>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Is Involved in Cochlear Cell Apoptosis in a Cisplatin-Induced Ototoxicity Rat Model.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress arises when excessive improperly folded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen. When ER stress occurs, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is subsequently activated to restore ER proteostasis. However, severe ER stress leads to apoptosis. Recent studies have suggested that cisplatin cytotoxicity may be related to ER stress. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ER stress participates in cochlear cell apoptosis in a cisplatin-induced ototoxicity rat model and to also determine the possible relationship between ER stress and hearing loss. Our results revealed that treatment with cisplatin upregulated the expression of active caspase-12 in cochlear cells, which is indicative of cisplatin-induced activation of ER-specific apoptosis. Increased expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-9 suggested a close relationship between severe ER stress and -dependent apoptosis in the cochlear cells of cisplatin-treated rats. In addition, we found that  (TUDCA), a promoter of ER proteostasis, had a protective effect on cisplatin-induced hearing loss. These results demonstrate that ER stress is involved in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of cochlear cells in vivo.© 2017 S.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that Qu could evoke ER stress to enhance drug cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer (OC). However, Qu-induced ER stress in OC is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that Qu evoked ER stress to involve in  apoptosis pathway via the p-STAT3/Bcl-2 axis in OC cell lines and in primary OC cells. Unexpectedly, inhibition of ER stress did not reverse Qu-induced cell death. Further functional studies revealed that Qu-induced ER stress could activate protective autophagy concomitantly by activating the p-STAT3/Bcl-2 axis in this process. Moreover, the autophagy scavenger 3-MA was shown to enhance Qu's anticancer effects in an ovarian cancer mice xenograft model. These findings revealed a novel role of ER stress as a "double edge sword" participating in Qu-induced apoptosis of OC and might provide a new angle to consider in clinical studies of biological modifiers that may circumvent drug resistance in patients by targeting protective autophagy pathways.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26054569>Ilexgenin A inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress and ameliorates endothelial dysfunction via suppression of TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in an AMPK dependent manner.</a></h2><p>Ilexgenin A is a natural triterpenoid with beneficial effects on lipid disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis and its mechanisms. Palmitate (PA) stimulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and subsequent thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Ilexgenin A enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and improved ER stress by suppression of ROS-associated TXNIP induction. However, these effects were blocked by knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK is essential for its action in suppression of ER stress. Meanwhile, ilexgenin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thereby reduced IL-1β secretion. It also inhibited inflammation and apoptosis exposed to PA insult. Consistent with these results in endothelial cells, ilexgenin A attenuated ER stress and restored the loss of eNOS activity in vascular endothelium, and thereby improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta. A further analysis in high-fat fed mice showed that oral administration of ilexgenin A blocked ER stress/NLRP3 activation with reduced ROS generation and increased NO production in vascular endothelium, well confirming the beneficial effect of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these results show ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation was responsible for endothelial dysfunction and ilexgenin A ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by suppressing ER-stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a regulation of AMPK. This finding suggests that the application of ilexgenin A is useful in the management of cardiovascular diseases in obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NP) are widely used, but their effects on biological systems and mechanism of toxicity have not been elucidated fully. Here, we report the toxicological mechanism of TiO2-NP in cell organelles. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) were exposed to 50 and 100 μg/mL TiO2-NP for 24 and 48 h. Our results showed that TiO2-NP induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the cells and disrupted the -associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) and calcium ion balance, thereby increasing autophagy. In contrast, an inhibitor of ER stress,  (TUDCA), mitigated the cellular toxic response, suggesting that TiO2-NP promoted toxicity via ER stress. This novel mechanism of TiO2-NP toxicity in human bronchial epithelial cells suggests that further exhaustive research on the harmful effects of these nanoparticles in relevant organisms is needed for their safe application.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30785084>TUDCA-treated chronic kidney disease-derived hMSCs improve therapeutic efficacy in ischemic disease via PrP.</a></h2><p>Although autologous human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are a promising source for regenerative stem cell therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the barriers associated with pathophysiological conditions limit therapeutic applicability to patients. We confirmed that level of cellular prion protein (PrP) in serum was decreased and mitochondria function of CKD-derived hMSCs (CKD-hMSCs) was impaired in patients with CKD. We proved that treatment of CKD-hMSCs with  (TUDCA), a bile acid, enhanced the mitochondrial function of these cells through regulation of PINK1-PrP-dependent pathway. In a murine hindlimb ischemia model with CKD, tail vein injection of TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs improved the functional recovery, including kidney recovery, limb salvage, blood perfusion ratio, and vessel formation along with restored expression of PrP in the blood serum of the mice. These data suggest that TUDCA-treated CKD-hMSCs are a promising new autologous stem cell therapeutic intervention that dually treats cardiovascular problems and CKD in patients.Copyright © 2019.

Nowadays, mitochondria are constituted by small circular mitochondrial DNA of 16 kb, responsible for the control of several proteins, including polypeptides of the electron transport chain. Throughout evolution, these organelles acquired the capacity of regulating energy production and , thus becoming central modulators of cell fate. In fact, mitochondria are crucial for a variety of cellular processes, including adenosine triphosphate production by oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and also cellular specialization in a variety of tissues that ultimately relies on specific mitochondrial specialization and maturation.

The clinical expression of the disorder, usually occurring in young adults, is typically characterized by subacute, usually sequential, bilateral visual loss, resulting from the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. As the precise action of mitochondrial DNA mutations on the overall cell metabolism in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is unknown, we investigated the metabolomic profile of the disease. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 188 metabolites in fibroblasts from 16 patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and eight healthy control subjects. Latent variable-based statistical methods were used to identify discriminating metabolites. One hundred and twenty-four of the metabolites were considered to be accurately quantified. A supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model separating patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy from control subjects showed good predictive capability (Q 2cumulated = 0.57). Thirty-eight metabolites appeared to be the most significant variables, defining a Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy metabolic signature that revealed decreased concentrations of all proteinogenic amino acids, spermidine, putrescine, isovaleryl-carnitine, propionyl-carnitine and five sphingomyelin species, together with increased concentrations of 10 phosphatidylcholine species. This signature was not reproduced by the inhibition of complex I with rotenone or piericidin A in control fibroblasts. The importance of sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines in the Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy signature, together with the decreased amino acid pool, suggested an involvement of the endoplasmic reticulum. This was confirmed by the significantly increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, as well as the greater expression of C/EBP homologous protein and the increased XBP1 splicing, in fibroblasts from affected patients, all these changes being reversed by the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, TUDCA (). Thus, our metabolomic analysis reveals a pharmacologically-reversible endoplasmic reticulum stress in complex I-related Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy fibroblasts, a finding that may open up new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy with endoplasmic reticulum-targeting drugs.© The Author (2016).

Given that both (i) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in pregnancy and (ii) gestational exposure to Δ9-THC leads to placental deficiency, we hypothesized that Δ9-THC may directly induce placental ER stress, influencing trophoblast gene expression and mitochondrial function. BeWo human trophoblast cells treated with Δ9-THC (3-30 μM) led to a dose-dependent increase in all ER stress markers and CHOP; these effects could be blocked with CB1R/CB2R antagonists. Moreover, expression of ER stress-sensitive genes ERRγ, VEGFA, and FLT-1 were increased by Δ9-THC, and abrogated with the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA. Δ9-THC also diminished mitochondrial respiration and ATP-coupling due to decreased abundance of mitochondrial chain complex proteins. Collectively, these findings indicate that Δ9-THC can directly augment ER stress resulting in aberrant placental gene expression and impaired mitochondrial function.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which particulate matter 2.5 (PM) induces damage in human HaCaT keratinocytes and normal human dermal fibroblasts, and to evaluate the preventive capacity of the ginsenoside Rb1. PM induced oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation; this effect was inhibited by ginsenoside Rb1. Through gene silencing of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as , , , and , and through the use of the ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA), it was demonstrated that PM-induced ER stress also causes apoptosis and ultimately leads to cell death; however, this phenomenon was reversed by ginsenoside Rb1. We also found that TUDCA partially restored the production of ATP that was inhibited by PM, and its recovery ability was significantly higher than that of ginsenoside Rb1, indicating that the process of ER stress leading to cell damage may also occur via the mitochondrial pathway. We concluded that ER stress acts alone or via the mitochondrial pathway in the induction of cell damage by PM, and that ginsenoside Rb1 blocks this process.

Exercise triggers the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α). To investigate the role of the UPR in exercise-induced adaptations, we subjected rats to 3 h of chronic contractile activity (CCA) for 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days followed by 3 h of recovery. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling, through PGC-1α mRNA, increased 14-fold after 1 day of CCA. This resulted in 10-32% increases in cytochrome c oxidase activity, indicative of mitochondrial content, between days 3 and 7, as well as increases in the autophagic degradation of p62 and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A (LC3)-II protein. Before these adaptations, the UPR(ER) transcripts activating transcription factor-4, spliced X-box-binding protein 1, and binding immunoglobulin protein were elevated (1.3- to 3.8-fold) at days 1-3, while CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein and heat shock protein (HSP) 70 were elevated at mRNA and protein levels (1.5- to 3.9-fold) at days 1-7 of CCA.

Myristic acid (MA), a free fatty acid highly abundant in copra/palmist oils, is a predictor of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and stimulates ceramide synthesis. Here we investigated the synergism between MA and PA in ceramide synthesis, ER stress, lipotoxicity and NASH. Unlike PA, MA is not lipotoxic but potentiated PA-mediated lipoapoptosis, ER stress, caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH). Moreover, MA kinetically sustained PA-induced total ceramide content by stimulating dehydroceramide desaturase and switched the ceramide profile from decreased to increased ceramide 14:0/ceramide16:0, without changing medium and long-chain ceramide species. PMH were more sensitive to equimolar ceramide14:0/ceramide16:0 exposure, which mimics the outcome of PA plus MA treatment on ceramide homeostasis, than to either ceramide alone. Treatment with myriocin to inhibit ceramide synthesis and  to prevent ER stress ameliorated PA plus MA induced apoptosis, similar to the protection afforded by the antioxidant BHA, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk and JNK inhibition. Moreover, ruthenium red protected PMH against PA and MA-induced cell death. Recapitulating in vitro findings, mice fed a diet enriched in PA plus MA exhibited lipodystrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, increased liver ceramide content and cholesterol levels, ER stress, liver damage, inflammation and fibrosis compared to mice fed diets enriched in PA or MA alone. The deleterious effects of PA plus MA-enriched diet were largely prevented by in vivo myriocin treatment. These findings indicate a causal link between ceramide synthesis and ER stress in lipotoxicity, and imply that the consumption of diets enriched in MA and PA can cause NASH associated with lipodystrophy.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p></html>
