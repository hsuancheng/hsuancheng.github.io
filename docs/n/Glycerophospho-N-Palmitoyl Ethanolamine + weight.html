Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but insulin was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201912>Walnut Protein Hydrolysates Play a Protective Role on Neurotoxicity Induced by d-Galactose and Aluminum Chloride in Mice.</a></h2><p>In recent years, with an increase in the aging population, neurodegenerative diseases have attracted more and more attention. This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of defatted walnut meal protein hydrolysates (DWMPH) on neurotoxicity induced by d-galactose (d-gal) and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) in mice. The animal models were established by combining treatments with d-gal (200 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) and AlCl₃ (100 mg/kg in drinking water) for 90 days. During the 90 days, 1 g/kg of DWMPH was administrated orally every day. The results indicated that DWMPH treatment alleviated oxidative stress, reversed cholinergic dysfunction, and suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the brains of d-gal + AlCl₃-treated mice, and thus improving the learning and memory functions of these mice, which was closely correlated with the strong antioxidant activity of DWMPH. This finding suggests that DWMPH might be a promising dietary supplement in improving neuronal dysfunctions of the brain.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800212>Influence of Age on Anticontractile Effect of Perivascular Adipose Tissue in Normotensive and Hypertensive Rats.</a></h2><p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) and its vasomodulatory effects play an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of blood vessels. Alterations in PVAT associated with reduction in its anticontractile influence are proven to contribute to vascular dysfunction in hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine whether the changes in PVAT properties could participate in progression of vascular abnormalities in developing spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR, both in 5th and in 12th week of age, were used. Systolic blood pressure was similar between WKY rats and SHR in 5th week of age; however, in 12th week, it was significantly increased in SHR comparing to WKY rats. The amount of retroperitoneal fat was higher in WKY rats in both age groups, whereas  was higher in WKY rats only in 12th week, when compared to age-matched SHR. From isolated superior mesenteric arteries, two ring preparations were prepared for isometric tension recording, one with PVAT intact and other with PVAT removed. In WKY rats as well as in SHR, arterial contractile responses to noradrenaline, applied cumulatively on rings, were significantly inhibited in the presence of intact PVAT. In both age groups, anticontractile effect of PVAT was higher in WKY rats than in SHR. Neurogenic contractions, induced by electrical stimulation of perivascular sympathoadrenergic nerves, were significantly attenuated in the presence of PVAT in WKY mesenteric arteries from both age groups; however, in arteries from SHR, intact PVAT had no influence on this type of contractile responses. The results suggest that in SHR impairment of anticontractile effect of PVAT precedes hypertension and might contribute to its development.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969932>PTENα regulates mitophagy and maintains mitochondrial quality control.</a></h2><p>PTEN plays an important role in tumor suppression, and PTEN family members are involved in multiple biological processes in various subcellular locations. Here we report that PTENα, the first identified PTEN isoform, regulates mitophagy through promotion of PARK2 recruitment to damaged mitochondria. We show that PTENα-deficient mice exhibit accumulation of cardiac mitochondria with structural and functional abnormalities, and PTENα-deficient mouse hearts are more susceptible to injury induced by isoprenaline and ischemia-reperfusion. Mitochondrial clearance by mitophagy is also impaired in PTENα-deficient cardiomyocytes. In addition, we found PTENα physically interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN, which is an important mediator of mitophagy. PTENα binds PRKN through the membrane binding helix in its N-terminus, and promotes PRKN mitochondrial translocation through enhancing PRKN self-association in a phosphatase-independent manner. Loss of PTENα compromises mitochondrial translocation of PRKN and resultant mitophagy following mitochondrial depolarization. We propose that PTENα functions as a mitochondrial quality controller that maintains mitochondrial function and cardiac homeostasis.BECN1 beclin 1; CCCP carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; FBXO7 F-box protein 7; FS fraction shortening; HSPA1L heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1 like; HW: BW heart : ratio; I-R ischemia-reperfusion; ISO isoprenaline; MAP1LC3/LC3 microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBH membrane binding helix; MFN1 mitofusin 1; MFN2 mitofusin 2; Nam nicotinamide; TMRM tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; WGA wheat germ agglutinin.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29343706>Caloric restriction lowers endocannabinoid tonus and improves cardiac function in type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoids (ECs) are associated with obesity and ectopic fat accumulation, both of which play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The effect of prolonged caloric restriction on ECs in relation to fat distribution and cardiac function is still unknown. Therefore, our aim was to investigate this relationship in obese T2D patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).In a prospective intervention study, obese T2D patients with CAD (n = 27) followed a 16 week very low calorie diet (VLCD; 450-1000 kcal/day). Cardiac function and fat accumulation were assessed with MRI and spectroscopy. Plasma levels of lipid species, including ECs, were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.VLCD decreased plasma levels of virtually all measured lipid species of the class of N-acylethanolamines including the EC anandamide (AEA; -15%, p = 0.016), without decreasing monoacylglycerols including the EC 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Baseline plasma AEA levels strongly correlated with the volume of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT; R = 0.44, p < 0.001). VLCD decreased the volume of SAT (-53%, p < 0.001), visceral white adipose tissue (VAT) (-52%, p < 0.001), epicardial white adipose tissue (-15%, p < 0.001) and paracardial white adipose tissue (-28%, p < 0.001). VLCD also decreased hepatic (-86%, p < 0.001) and myocardial (-33%, p < 0.001) fat content. These effects were accompanied by an increased left ventricular ejection fraction (54.8 ± 8.7-56.2 ± 7.9%, p = 0.016).Caloric restriction in T2D patients with CAD decreases AEA levels, but not 2-AG levels, which is paralleled by decreased lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and heart, and improved cardiovascular function. Interestingly, baseline AEA levels strongly correlated with SAT volume. We anticipate that dietary interventions are worthwhile strategies in advanced T2D, and that reduction in AEA may contribute to the improved cardiometabolic phenotype induced by  loss.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037606>Asprosin: Possible target in connection with ghrelin and cytokine network expression in the post-burn treatment.</a></h2><p>Burn injury is a severe form of trauma associated with pain, metabolic abnormalities, susceptibility to infections, muscle loss, mental and emotional distress. Conventional therapies as well as some recent approaches for the treatment of burned patients are currently in use. Nutritional therapy is also suggested as a supplementary option in major burns. Within this context, hormones involved in the regulation of appetite will have a paramount importance. The aim is to evaluate the interactions among ghrelin, some inflammatory parameters and the burn injury. Asprosin is also involved into this discussion due to its ghrelin-like actions. Aside from the consideration of insulin as well as stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine), an orexigenic, anti-inflammatory hormone, ghrelin affecting both metabolic and inflammatory systems is also involved in the protocols designed for burn treatment. Ghrelin's actions exerted by way of growth-hormone secretagogue receptor, neuropeptide Y, agouti-related protein, proopiomelanocortin and gamma amino butyric acid are being investigated. Asprosin, one of the remarkably few hormones identified as appetite stimulator, acts as another orexigenic hormone by using almost the same signalling pathways as those of ghrelin. Interleukin-6 should also be evaluated both as a reliable biomarker of inflammation and also with its inhibitory effects on TNF-α within the scope of burn injury. In conclusion, treatment protocols during burn injury may be designed to raise decreased concentrations of ghrelin and to repress increased levels of inflammatory agents such as TNF-α. IL-6 may be evaluated from an entirely different aspect. The potential therapeutic use of asprosin may be considered within an integrative approach with a focus on cachexia-anorexia developed in severe burn trauma.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

MRI amongst others is of Para clinical methods greatly effective in diagnosis phase. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps provide some information that could reflect tissue cellularity. Neurosurgeons, in particular to detect the tumor cellularity, must send the specimens taken through biopsy to the pathology unit. This study is aimed at determining the tumor cellularity in brain.In this cross-sectional study, 32 patients (18 males and 14 females of the range 18 – 77 y/o) between April 2014 and February 2016 who were referred to the neurosurgery department of Shohada-E Tajrish Hospital of Tehran participated. Imaging was made using single voxel MR Spectroscopy, ADC and T2W Multi Echo Pulse Sequence in addition to routine pulse sequences and the images were analyzed using MATLAB software to determine the cellularity of brain tumors in comparison to the biopsy.findings showed that by decreasing T2 relaxation time, the amount of ADC, N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA) and also, increase Choline metabolite, lead to registering tumors in the lower class on the designed table and these tumors have a higher degree of consistency and cellularity. T2 Relaxation time, the tumors will stand at higher class on the designed table. Also the results indicated that 85% diagnostic  of T2 relaxation time and 83% diagnostic  of ADC compared with biopsy could reveal the brain tumor cellularity (P>0.05).some cellular metabolite changes such as NAA and Choline, ADC value and T2 relaxation time feature could effectively be used to distinguish and illustrate the degree of cellularity of brain tumors especially Intra-axial brain tumors (with about 85%. vs. biopsy).

This prospective study was to ascertain the clinical significance of 3 Tesla MRS in the evaluation of patients with thyroid nodules (TNs) as an ancillary diagnostic technique for thyroid carcinoma.Magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3T at echo- times (TEs) 136 and 270 ms was carried out on 15 patients with total number of 32 TNs larger than 1 cm3, which all were surgically resected. Choline (Chol) to creatine (Cr) ratio was assessed at 136 and 270 TEs on each nodule and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine optimal cut-off point. The findings were compared with histopathology of thyroid specimens.There were 23 benign and 9 malignant lesions (7 papillary and 2 follicular thyroid carcinomas). The mean values of Chol/Cr at 136 and 270 TEs was 2.28 ± 3.65 and 1.52 ± 1.67 respectively and the difference between benign and malignant nodules was only significant at 136 TEs. The study revealed that Chol/ Cr ratio cut-off point of 2.5 best correlates with histopathology results (sensitivity = 75%; specificity = 100%; PPV = 100%; NPV= 92%).This preliminary study showed that 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy might be a specific modality for the evaluation of thyroid nodules in differentiation of benign from malignant thyroid tissue.

There are limitations in simulated bench models related to patient and nebulizer factors. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of inhaled drug mass between in vitro and ex vivo studies by testing aerosol deposition of various types of nebulizers.Ten healthy subjects were recruited to receive aerosol therapy with five nebulizers in random order: 1) a jet nebulizer (JN); 2) a breath-enhanced nebulizer (BEN); 3) a manually triggered nebulizer (MTN), 4) a breath-actuated nebulizer (BAN), and 5) a vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) with valved-adapter. A unit dose of salbutamol containing 5 mg in 2.5 mL was placed into the nebulizer and administered for 10 min. For the ex vivo study, minute ventilation of healthy subjects was recorded for 1 min. For the in vitro study a breathing simulator was utilized with adult breathing patterns. Aerosolized drug from the nebulizers and the accessory tubes was captured using inspiratory and expiratory collecting filters. Captured drug was eluted, measured and expressed as inhaled and exhaled mass using spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 276 nm.10 healthy subjects were recruited, aged 20.8 ± 0.7 years old, with a mean height of 166.2 ± 9.2 cm and  of 64.7 ± 12.4 kg. There was no significant difference in the inhaled drug dose between the JN and BEN (15.0 ± 1.94% and 17.74 ± 2.65%, respectively, p = .763), yet the inhaled doses were lower than the other three nebulizers (p < .001). The VMN delivered greater inhaled dose than the other four nebulizers (p < .01). The respiratory rate of the cohorts was significantly correlated with the inhaled drug dose. For the in vitro model, the JN delivered a lower inhaled dose (11.6 ± 1.6, p < .001) than the other nebulizers, whereas the MTN and BAN deposited significantly lower exhaled doses (1.7 ± 0.4 and 2.7 ± 0.2, respectively, p < .001). The VMN demonstrated a greater drug dose with the in vitro study than the ex vivo model (44.0 ± 0.9% and 35.5 ± 6.3% respectively, p = .003), whereas the JN in the ex vivo model resulted in a greater inhaled drug dose (15.0 ± 1.9% for ex vivo vs 11.6 ± 1.6% for in vitro, p = .008).These in vitro/ex vivo model comparisons of nebulizers performance indicated that breath-related nebulizers can be estimated using an in vitro model; however, the JN and VMN delivered inhaled drug mass differed between models. There was a significant correlation between respiratory rate and inhaled mass, and the inhaled drug dose generated by VMN correlated with minute ventilation. This study demonstrated that the VMN produced greater inhaled drug dose and lowest residual dose, whereas the BEN, BAN, and MTN produced lower exhaled drug dose in both in vitro and ex vivo models.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we identify sympathetic neuron-associated macrophages (SAMs) as a population of cells that mediate clearance of NE via expression of solute carrier family 6 member 2 (SLC6A2), an NE transporter, and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a degradation enzyme. Optogenetic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) upregulates NE uptake by SAMs and shifts the SAM profile to a more proinflammatory state. NE uptake by SAMs is prevented by genetic deletion of Slc6a2 or inhibition of the encoded transporter. We also observed an increased proportion of SAMs in the SNS of two mouse models of obesity. Genetic ablation of Slc6a2 in SAMs increases brown adipose tissue (BAT) content, causes browning of white fat, increases thermogenesis, and leads to substantial and sustained  loss in obese mice. We further show that this pathway is conserved, as human sympathetic ganglia also contain SAMs expressing the analogous molecular machinery for NE clearance, which thus constitutes a potential target for obesity treatment.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286102>Pin1 facilitates isoproterenol‑induced cardiac fibrosis and collagen deposition by promoting oxidative stress and activating the MEK1/2‑ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway in rats.</a></h2><p>Peptidyl‑prolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) is a member of a large superfamily of phosphorylation‑dependent peptidyl‑prolyl cis/trans isomerases, which not only regulates multiple targets at various stages of cellular processes, but is also involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including microbial infection, cancer, asthma and Alzheimer's disease. However, the role of Pin1 in cardiac fibrosis remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated the potential mechanism of Pin1 in isoprenaline (ISO)‑induced myocardial fibrosis in rats. The rats were randomly divided into three groups. Echocardiography was used to evaluate changes in the size, shape and function of the heart, and histological staining was performed to visualize inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunohistochemistry and Picrosirius red staining were used to differentiate collagen subtypes. Additionally, cardiac‑specific phosphorylation of mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and extracellular‑signal regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and the activities of Pin1 and α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) and other oxidative stress parameters were estimated in the heart. The administration of ISO resulted in an increase in cardiac parameters and elevated the heart‑to‑ ratio. Histopathological examination of heart tissues revealed interstitial inflammatory cellular infiltrate and disorganized collagen fiber deposition. In addition, lipid peroxidation products and oxidative stress marker activity in plasma and tissues were significantly increased in the ISO‑treated rats. Western blot analysis showed significantly elevated protein levels of phosphorylated Pin1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 and α‑SMA in remodeling hearts. Treatment with juglone following intraperitoneal injection of ISO significantly prevented inflammatory cell infiltration, improved cardiac function, and suppressed oxidative stresses and fibrotic alterations. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that the activation of Pin1 promoted cardiac extracellular matrix deposition and oxidative stress damage by regulating the phosphorylation of the MEK1/2‑ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the expression of α‑SMA. By contrast, the inhibition of Pin1 alleviated cardiac damage and fibrosis in the experimental models, suggesting that Pin1 contributed to the development of cardiac remodeling in ISO‑administered rats, and that the inactivation of Pin1 may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29313696>Spontaneous hepatic rupture in a bodybuilder: a case report and review of the literature.</a></h2><p>This article is the first description of a spontaneous hepatic rupture in a young bodybuilder with a history of clenbuterol and ephedrine alkaloid use.

We conducted a characterization of tiotropium Respimat when administered with AeroChamber Plus Flow-Vu anti-static valved holding chamber (test VHC) with face mask in 1-5-year-olds with persistent asthmatic symptoms.In vitro tiotropium dose and particle size distribution delivered into a cascade impactor were evaluated under fixed paediatric and adult flow rates between actuation and samplings. The tiotropium mass likely to reach children's lungs was assessed by tidal breathing simulations and an ADAM-III Child Model. PK exposure to tiotropium in preschool children with persistent asthmatic symptoms (using test VHC) was compared with pooled data from nine Phase 2/3 trials in older children, adolescents, and adults with symptomatic persistent asthma not using test VHC.At fixed inspiratory flow rates, emitted mass and fine particle dose decreased under lower flow conditions; dose reduction was observed when Respimat was administered by test VHC at paediatric flow rates. In <5-year-old children, such a dose reduction is appropriate. In terms of dose per kg/, in vitro-delivered dosing in children was comparable with adults. Transmission and aerosol holding properties of Respimat when administered with test VHC were fully sufficient for aerosol delivery to patients. At zero delay, particles <5 μm (most relevant fraction) exhibited a transfer efficacy of ≥60%. The half-time was>10 s, allowing multiple breaths. Standardized tidal inhalation resulted in an emitted mass from the test VHC of approximately one-third of labelled dose, independent of coordination and face mask use, indicating predictable tiotropium administration by test VHC with Respimat. Tiotropium exposure in 1-5-year-old patients using the test VHC, when adjusted by height or  surface, was comparable with that in older age groups without VHCs; no overexposure was observed.

In vitro release of AmB into phosphate buffer from the imine conjugates was negligible with less than 0.2% of the drug released in 48h. Capping of residual aldehyde handles using 2- or glycine resulted in increased release of the drug in vitro. Injectable gels of gelatin crosslinked with oxidized alginate incorporating the SA-AmB conjugates as well as AmB were also fabricated and drug release was examined. In vitro release from the gel discs showed that AmB was released to the extent of 15-20% in 2days.

The growing rates of HCC may be partially attributable to increased numbers of people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, details of the liver-specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the NAFLD-NASH-HCC progression remain unclear, and mouse models that can be used to explore the exact factors that influence the progression of NAFLD/NASH to the more chronic stages of liver disease and subsequent HCC are not yet fully established. We have previously reported a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) as a dietary NASH model with rapidly progressive liver fibrosis in mice. The current study in C57BL/6J mice fed CDAHFD provided evidence for the chronic persistence of advanced hepatic fibrosis in NASH and disease progression towards HCC in a period of 36 weeks. When mice fed CDAHFD were switched back to a standard diet, hepatic steatosis was normalized and NAFLD activity score improved, but HCC incidence increased and the phenotype of fibrosis-associated HCC development was observed. Moreover, when mice continued to be fed CDAHFD for 60 weeks, HCC further developed without severe  loss or carcinogenesis in other organs. The autochthonous tumours showed a variety of histological features and architectural patterns including trabecular, pseudoglandular and solid growth. The CDAHFD mouse model might be a useful tool for studying the development of HCC from NAFLD/NASH, and potentially useful for better understanding pathological changes during hepatocarcinogenesis.© 2017 The Authors.

Here we investigate whether sAC is involved in hypertrophic growth using two different model systems.In isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes hypertrophy was induced by 24 h β1-adrenoceptor stimulation using isoprenaline (ISO) and a β2-adrenoceptor antagonist (ICI118,551). To monitor hypertrophy cell size along with RNA/DNA- and protein/DNA ratios as well as the expression level of α-skeletal actin were analyzed. sAC activity was suppressed either by treatment with its specific inhibitor KH7 or by knockdown. Both pharmacological inhibition and knockdown blunted hypertrophic growth and reduced expression levels of α-skeletal actin in ISO/ICI treated rat cardiomyocytes. To analyze the underlying cellular mechanism expression levels of phosphorylated CREB, B-Raf and Erk1/2 were examined by western blot. The results suggest the involvement of B-Raf, but not of Erk or CREB in the pro-hypertrophic action of sAC. In wild type and sAC knockout mice pressure overload was induced by transverse aortic constriction. Hemodynamics, heart  and the expression level of the atrial natriuretic peptide were analyzed. In accordance, transverse aortic constriction failed to induce hypertrophy in sAC knockout mice. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Erk1/2 in TAC-induced hypertrophy.Soluble adenylyl cyclase might be a new pivotal player in the cardiac hypertrophic response either to long-term β1-adrenoceptor stimulation or to pressure overload.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29384879>Amputation of multiple limbs caused by use of inotropics: Case report, a report of 4 cases.</a></h2><p>We present 4 cases of symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) associated with use of inotropic agent to elevate blood pressure. SPG is a relatively rare phenomenon characterized by symmetrical distal ischemic damage that leads to gangrene of 2 or more sites in the absence of large blood vessel obstruction, where vasoconstriction rather than thrombosis is implicated as the underlying pathophysiology. We present 4 SPG cases of the multiple limbs amputation, associated with inevitable use of inotropic agents.Inotropic agents including dopamine and norepinephrine are used frequently in the treatment of hypotension, and its effectiveness in treating shock is firmly established. However, it can be caused peripheral gangrene by prolonged administration of high dose inotropics, inducing the constant contraction of the peripheral blood vessels.These 4 patients had different clinical histories and background factors, but each experienced sepsis. The level of amputation is determined by the line of demarcation in concert with considerations of the biomechanics of stump stability,  bearing, and ambulation.After recovering of general conditions and completion of demarcation, these 4 patients underwent the amputation of multiple limbs.(bilateral amputations of upper extremities or bilateral amputations of lower extremities).In each patient, there was no additional amputation caused by extension of SPG, and the rehabilitation with appropriate orthosis was performed. Treatment of underlying disease were continued too.It is important to alert the possibility of amputations, according to the use of inevitable inotropics. We recommended the careful use of the inotropic agents to the physicians in treating septic shock.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30604484>Standard concentration infusions of inotropic and vasoactive drugs in paediatric intensive care: a strategy for patient safety.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using different standard concentration infusions for high-alert inotropic and vasoactive drugs in paediatric intensive care units (ICUs).Retrospective data analysis was performed on drug prescriptions for patients in paediatric ICUs. A matrix was developed based on optimal concentration recommendations for each drug, taking into consideration solution stability and patient safety. Hypothetical volumes were calculated for three standard solutions (high concentration - HC, low concentration - LC and fluid restriction - FR) and compared to the actual administered volumes to evaluate the impact of the volumes of each standard solution for varying  ranges in paediatric care. Finally, a risk assessment of the standard infusions was conducted using the NPSA 20 tool along with an assessment of the pharmacoeconomic impact.The results suggest the need for at least two standard concentrations for each of the studied drugs in order to attend to the different  ranges and clinical conditions of paediatric patients in intensive care.High concentration is ideal for patients up to 20 kg. For patients over 20 kg, FR is recommended, while LC should only be used in specific situations. Modifying the hospital pharmacotherapy system to include standard solutions is safer and reduces the risks of adverse effects. The pharmacoeconomic analysis did not show any impact on costs, although a reduction in adverse effects should be considered.© 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28901218>Four-week dietary supplementation with 10- and/or 15-fold basal choline caused decreased  in Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h2><p>Choline is an essential nutrient utilized for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and lipoprotein packaging and secretion. Recently, choline supplementation has been used by athletes and the public for  loss. However, the potential toxicological impact of choline dietary supplementation requires further investigation. This study examined the effects of choline dietary supplementation in Sprague Dawley rats for 4 weeks. Rats were fed diets containing basal choline levels (control) or 5-, 10-, or 15-fold (5×, 10×, or 15×) basal diet concentration. In groups fed choline-supplemented diets, there were no toxicologically relevant findings in clinical observations, food intake, clinical chemistry, liver , or liver histopathology. However, decreased mean   (8.5-10.2%) and  gains (24-31%) were noted for the 10× choline-supplemented (females only) and 15× choline-supplemented (both sexes) groups relative to the control groups from day 3 onward. These  effects were not related to a persistent reduction in average food intake. Serum cholesterol was increased in the 15× choline-supplemented male rats relative to the controls, an expected effect of choline supplementation; however, there were no changes in the serum cholesterol of female rats. Serum choline concentrations were increased in female rats relative to the male rats across all treatment groups. The maximum tolerated dose for male and female rats were the 15× and 10× choline supplements, respectively, based on decreased mean  and  gains. This study supported the conclusions of a clinical trial that showed a high choline diet can decrease  in humans.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29575205>Estimate of choline nutritional requirements for chicks from 1 to 21 days of age.</a></h2><p>Choline is an essential nutrient in poultry diets because it performs various important metabolic functions. The objective of this study was to re-evaluate the choline requirements of male broiler chickens from 1 to 21 days of age at two levels of methionine. Two assays using 2,160 Cobb chickens (1,080 in each assay) were conducted. The study design was completely randomized and consisted of six treatments and six replicates, with 30 animals per experimental unit. The semipurified basal diet was formulated with corn, soya bean meal, soya protein concentrate, starch and sugar, providing 390 mg/kg choline and 0.593% digestible methionine (requirement level) in Assay 1 and a reduction of about one-quarter in the requirement level of digestible methionine (0.440%) in Assay 2. Choline chloride (62.5%) was added by a supplementation technique to both basal diets to compose crescent levels of choline supplementation (715, 1,040, 1,365, 1,690 and 2,015 mg/kg). The  gain responses were fitted using quadratic polynomial (QP) and broken-line (BL) models. The ideal intake of choline (mg/bird.day) was estimated from the first intercept of the QP with the BL plateau (BL + QP). The results showed that the diet with the 25% reduction in digestible methionine limited the maximum  gain by approximately 10%. The choline requirements of broilers from 1 to 7, 1 to 14 and 1 to 21 days of age were 27,013, 44,458 and 62,535 mg/bird.day, respectively, for the requirement level of digestible methionine and 26,796, 41,820 and 56,578 mg/bird.day for the broilers receiving the diet with the 25% reduction in digestible methionine.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29755192>Efficacy and pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine with epinephrine or dexmedetomidine after intraperitoneal administration in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine in combination with epinephrine or dexmedetomidine after intraperitoneal administration in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Sixteen healthy adult cats (3.3 ± 0.6 kg) were included in a prospective, randomized, masked clinical trial after obtaining owners' consent. Anesthetic protocol included buprenorphine-propofol-isoflurane. Meloxicam [0.2 mg/kg  (BW)] was administered subcutaneously before surgery. Cats were randomly divided into 2 groups to receive 1 of 2 treatments. Intraperitoneal bupivacaine 0.25% (2 mg/kg BW) was administered with epinephrine (BE group; 2 μg/kg BW) or dexmedetomidine (BD group; 1 μg/kg BW) before ovariohysterectomy ( = 8/group). A catheter was placed in the jugular vein for blood sampling. Blood samples were collected for up to 8 h after bupivacaine was administered. Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and non-compartmental model, respectively. Pain was evaluated using the UNESP-Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale (MCPS), the Glasgow composite feline pain scale (GPS), and a dynamic visual analog scale up to 8 h after extubation. Rescue analgesia was provided with buprenorphine if MCPS was ≥ 6. Repeated  linear models were used for analysis of pain and sedation scores ( < 0.05). Maximum bupivacaine plasma concentrations (Cmax) for BE and BD were 1155 ± 168 ng/mL and 1678 ± 364 ng/mL ( = 0.29) at 67 ± 13 min (Tmax) and 123 ± 59 min ( = 0.17), respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters and pain scores were not different between treatments ( > 0.05). One cat in the BE group received rescue analgesia ( = 0.30). Intraperitoneal bupivacaine with epinephrine or dexmedetomidine produced concentrations below toxic levels and similar analgesic effects. It is therefore safe to administer these drug combinations in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29860242>Gut microbiota metabolites, amino acid metabolites and improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism: the POUNDS Lost trial.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut microbiota have been linked to host insulin resistance, diabetes and impaired amino acid metabolism. We investigated whether changes in gut microbiota-dependent metabolite of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its nutrient precursors (choline and L-carnitine) were associated with improvements in glucose metabolism and diabetes-related amino acids in a -loss diet intervention.We included 504 overweight and obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of four energy-reduced diets varying in macronutrient intake. The 6-month changes (Δ) in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine levels after the intervention were calculated.Greater decreases in choline and L-carnitine were significantly (p<0.05) associated with greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and insulin resistance. We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with diabetes-related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving insulin sensitivity during a -loss intervention for obese patients. Dietary fat intake may modify the associations of TMAO with insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism..© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

Median age and  of patients were 9 years (interquartile range, 1-15 yr) and 38.5 kg (interquartile range, 12-54.8 kg). Median Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score was 17 (interquartile range, 10-27). Mean epinephrine dose was 1.3 ± 1.1 µg/kg. Median number of doses per patient was two. If more than one dose was provided, median dosing interval was 6.5 minutes. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were compared at the time of epinephrine administration and 1-4 minutes (median = 1 min) following administration. Heart rate changed from 130 ± 41 to 150 ± 33 beats/min (p < 0.05), and mean arterial blood pressure changed from 51 ± 17 to 75 ± 27 mm Hg (p < 0.001). Variability in mean arterial blood pressure response was observed; nonresponders required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 66% of doses resulted in up to 100% mean arterial blood pressure increase, and 21% of doses resulted in greater than 100% mean arterial blood pressure increase. Doses below 1 µg/kg were associated with a lower mean arterial blood pressure increase than doses between 1 and 5 µg/kg (mean percent change in mean arterial blood pressure = 6.6% vs 60%, respectively). Children less than or equal to 2 years old had the greatest percentage increase in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure.Provision of low-dose bolus epinephrine during periods of acute hypotension can result in a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. This dosing strategy may provide temporary stabilization while other therapies are added or adjusted, but further research is needed.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29170159>Reduced expression of cardiac ryanodine receptor protects against stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia, but increases the susceptibility to cardiac alternans.</a></h2><p>Reduced protein expression of the cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) is thought to affect the susceptibility to stress-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) and cardiac alternans, but direct evidence for the role of RyR2 protein expression in VT and cardiac alternans is lacking. Here, we used a mouse model () that expresses a reduced level of the RyR2 protein to determine the impact of reduced RyR2 protein expression on the susceptibility to VT, cardiac alternans, cardiac hypertrophy, and sudden death. Electrocardiographic analysis revealed that after the injection of relatively high doses of caffeine and epinephrine (agents commonly used for stress test), wild-type (WT) mice displayed long-lasting VTs, whereas the  mutant mice exhibited no VTs at all, indicating that the  mutant mice are resistant to stress-induced VTs. Intact heart Ca imaging and action potential (AP) recordings showed that the  mutant mice are more susceptible to fast-pacing induced Ca alternans and AP duration alternans compared with WT mice. The  mutant mice also showed an increased heart-to- ratio and incidence of sudden death at young ages. Furthermore, the  mutant hearts displayed altered Ca transients with increased time-to-peak and decay time (), increased ventricular wall thickness and ventricular cell area compared with WT hearts. These results indicate that reduced RyR2 protein expression suppresses stress-induced VTs, but enhances the susceptibility to cardiac alternans, hypertrophy, and sudden death.© 2018 The Author(s).

Fifteen juvenile female piglets (18-20 kg ) were randomly assigned into three groups (n=5 animals each): i) control (clinically healthy animals, without doxazosin treatment), ii) animals with induced inflammation of the urinary bladder, but without doxazosin treatment (experimental group I) and iii) animals with inflamed bladder, treated orally with doxazosin (0.1 mg/kg  for 30 days; experimental group II). Thereafter, the pigs were sacrificed and strips of the bladder trigone were suspended in organ baths. The tension and amplitude of the smooth muscles was measured before and after exposition to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 10-6-10-4 M), acetylocholine (ACh; 10-5-10-3 M) and norepinephrine (NE; 10-9-10-7 M). 5-HT caused an increase in the tension of contractions in all the groups and the amplitude in the experimental groups, however, the effect was higher in the experimental group I than in group II as compared to that found in the pre-treatment period. ACh caused an increase in the tension in the control group and a decrease in the amplitude in both experimental groups; these changes significantly differed between the control and doxazosin-treated group. NE caused a decrease in the tension in both experimental groups and amplitude in all the groups, however, the effect was most strongly expressed in doxazosine-treated group.

Whether and how overnutrition increases appetite through the adipose-to-brain axis is unclear. O-linked beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) couples nutrient cues to O-GlcNAcylation of intracellular proteins at serine/threonine residues. Chronic dysregulation of O-GlcNAc signaling contributes to metabolic diseases. Here we show that adipocyte OGT is essential for high fat diet-induced hyperphagia, but is dispensable for baseline food intake. Adipocyte OGT stimulates hyperphagia by transcriptional activation of de novo lipid desaturation and accumulation of N-arachidonyl  (AEA), an endogenous appetite-inducing cannabinoid (CB). Pharmacological manipulation of peripheral CB1 signaling regulates hyperphagia in an adipocyte OGT-dependent manner. These findings define adipocyte OGT as a fat sensor that regulates peripheral lipid signals, and uncover an unexpected adipose-to-brain axis to induce hyperphagia and obesity.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30503784>Application of derivative emission fluorescence spectroscopy for determination of ibuprofen and phenylephrine simultaneously in tablets and biological fluids.</a></h2><p>Two sensitive, rapid, and accurate derivative emission spectrofluorimetric methods applying zero crossing techniques were developed for simultaneous determination of binary mixtures of ibuprofen (IBU) and phenylephrine hydrochloride (PHE) in pure powder, synthetic mixture and combined tablets. The proposed methods were performed via measuring the intersected drug derivative amplitude of one drug at the zero crossing points for the other one and vice versa. The two methods rely on the measurement of the combined drugs native fluorescence after excitation at 270 nm in methanol directly, followed by differentiation using first (D) and second derivative (D) techniques. Applying the D, IBU was measured quantitatively at 293.1 nm at zero crossing of PHE, on the other side; PHE was measured quantitatively at 300.7 nm at zero crossing of IBU. By the same way, applying the D, the wavelengths selected were 303.5 nm for IBU and 312.9 nm for PHE. The concentration plots of derivative fluorescence intensity were rectilinear over the range of 0.5-10 μg/mL and 0.025-0.5 μg/mL for IBU and PHE, respectively. The results obtained with average % recoveries ± RSD are 99.73 ± 0.72 (IBU, D), 99.49 ± 0.95 (PHE, D), 99.79 ± 0.47 (IBU, D), and 99.88 ± 0.34 (PHE, D) were in good agreement with the comparison method. The proposed methods offer high sensitivity that enable direct analysis of IBU and PHE in spiked human plasma.

Obesity is associated with a blunting of the sympathetic response to meal ingestion, but interpretation of studies investigating these responses is compromised by their failure to account for the rate of gastric emptying, which is an important determinant of postprandial cardiovascular and sympathetic responses and, in both health and obesity, exhibits a wide interindividual variation. We sought to determine the effects of intraduodenal glucose infusion, bypassing gastric emptying, on BP, heart rate (HR), and noradrenaline responses in obese and healthy control subjects. 12 obese subjects (age 36.6 ± 3.9 years,  mass index (BMI) 36.1 ± 1.3 kg/m ) and 23 controls (age 27.8 ± 2.4 years, BMI 22.4 ± 0.5 kg/m ) received intraduodenal infusions of glucose at 1 or 3 kcal/min, or saline, for 60 min (t = 0-60 min), followed by intraduodenal saline (t = 60-120 min). BP and HR were measured with an automatic cuff, and blood samples collected for measurement of plasma noradrenaline. Intraduodenal glucose at 1 kcal/min was associated with a fall in diastolic BP in the control subjects only (P < 0.01), with no change in systolic BP, HR or noradrenaline in either group. In both groups, intraduodenal glucose at 3 kcal/min was associated with a fall in diastolic (P < 0.01), but not systolic, BP, and rises in HR (P < 0.001) and plasma noradrenaline (P < 0.01), with no difference in responses between the groups.

In this study, we report our results relating to the efficacy of this intervention in mitigating adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on infant growth and cognitive function.Sixty-nine Cape Coloured (mixed ancestry) heavy drinkers in Cape Town, South Africa, recruited in mid-pregnancy, were randomly assigned to receive a daily oral dose of either 2 g of choline or placebo from time of enrollment until delivery. Each dose consisted of an individually wrapped packet of powder that, when mixed with water, produced a sweet tasting grape-flavored drink. The primary outcome, eyeblink conditioning (EBC), was assessed at 6.5 months. Somatic growth was measured at birth, 6.5, and 12 months, recognition memory and processing speed on the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence, at 6.5 and 12 months.Infants born to choline-treated mothers were more likely to meet criterion for conditioning on EBC than the placebo group. Moreover, within the choline arm, degree of maternal adherence to the supplementation protocol strongly predicted EBC performance. Both groups were small at birth, but choline-treated infants showed considerable catch-up growth in  and head circumference at 6.5 and 12 months. At 12 months, the infants in the choline treatment arm had higher novelty preference scores, indicating better visual recognition memory.This exploratory study is the first to provide evidence that a high dose of choline administered early in pregnancy can mitigate adverse effects of heavy PAE on EBC, postnatal growth, and cognition in human infants. These findings are consistent with studies of alcohol-exposed animals that have demonstrated beneficial effects of choline supplementation on classical conditioning, learning, and memory.Copyright © 2018 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30103176>Bupropion attenuates morphine tolerance and dependence: Possible role of glutamate, norepinephrine, inflammation, and oxidative stress.</a></h2><p>Morphine - the main pillar of nociceptive pain management - systemic use is associated with development of tolerance and dependence. Tolerance and dependence lay a heavy burden in clinical pain management settings. An added  to this dilemma is that effective, safe, and tolerable solution to this problem is still beyond reach. Antidepressants were reported as possible alleviators of opioid tolerance and dependence. One of the increasingly used antidepressant in clinical practice is bupropion given its high safety and tolerability profile.The study was performed on male Balb-c mice weighing 20-30g. Hot plate test was used for assessment of bupropion (5mg/kg, ip) possible analgesic activity and enhancement of morphine acute analgesia (1 and 5mg/kg, sc). Repeated morphine (5mg/kg, sc) administration for 9days developed tolerance and dependence, bupropion (5mg/kg, ip) was concurrently administered to evaluate its potential to modulate these processes. We also biochemically analyzed bupropion effect on these phenomena through modulation of neurotransmitters (glutamate and norepinephrine), inflammatory status (nitric oxide), and pro-antioxidant balance (malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione).Bupropion was devoid of intrinsic analgesic activity and did not enhance morphine acute analgesia. However, bupropion significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and dependence development and abstinence syndrome with corresponding suppression of morphine induced changes in glutamate, norepinephrine, inflammatory status, and prooxidant-antioxidant balance.Bupropion efficacy in attenuation of morphine tolerance and dependence with its high safety and tolerability profile provide an alternative option to conventional agents e.g., ketamine and clonidine to modulate these phenomena.Copyright © 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Herein, polyethyleneimine (PEI) dilute solution medium shows an intensive SOS signal without any fluorescence response. Interestingly, NE can be selectively induced by PEI to emit bright fluorescence, and meanwhile causes an observable decrease in the SOS signal due to the interactions between NE and PEI. The simultaneous variation of the two independent signals can be used for ratiometric sensing of NE. Under the optimal conditions, the resultant ratiometric sensor displays high sensitivity and selectivity toward NE by simultaneously monitoring fluorescence and SOS signals with the same excitation wavelength. The proposed sensor exhibits a good linear relationship versus NE concentration in the range of 10.0 nM-45.0 μM with a detection limit of 2.0 nM (S/N = 3) and has been successfully applied to the determination of NE in real samples without the use of any extra reagent. The combination of fluorescence and SOS signals provides a new scheme for ratiometric sensor design, greatly simplifying experimental procedure and effectively enhancing detection accuracy. Moreover, the proposed analytical strategy further broadens the application of dilute solutions of polymers in research into optical sensor and green analytical chemistry.

The nonapeptide hemopressin has been reported to inhibit feeding after both central and peripheral administration, possibly playing a role of antagonist/inverse agonist of CB1 receptors, and consequently blocking the orexigenic effects of endogenous cannabinoids. VD-hemopressin(α) and RVD- hemopressin(α), are N-terminal extended forms of hemopressin. VD-hemopressin(α) has CB1 agonist activity, and as such it has been shown to stimulate feeding. RVD-hemopressin(α) is reported to play a negative allosteric modulatory function on CB1 receptors, but there are no data on its possible effects on feeding and metabolic control.We have studied, in rats, the effects of 14 daily intraperitoneal (ip) injections of RVD-hemopressin(α) (10nmol).We found that RVD-hemopressin(α) treatment inhibited food intake while total  was not affected. The null effect on  despite diminished feeding could be related to decreased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT). We also investigated the underlying neuromodulatory effects of RVD-hemopressin(α) and found it to down regulate proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression, together with norepinephrine (NE) levels, in the hypothalamus.In conclusion, RVD-hemopressin(α) administration has an anorectic effect, possibly related to inhibition of POMC and NE levels in the hypothalamus.

Toxification of rats at a dose of 1/100 DL50 for 60 days and at a dose of 1/10 DL50 for 50 days was accompanied by an increase in blood levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, indicating the hyperactivation of the mediator and hormonal parts of the sympathoadrenal system, and tension of the protective and adaptive reactions of the organism. Prolonged hypercatecholemia may become a pathogenic factor due to intensification of the quinidine route of oxidation of norepinephrine and epinephrine with the formation of reactive radicals and active forms of oxygen. Reduced serum content of catecholamines on the 60th day of oral administration at a dose of 1/10 DL50 reflects, on the one hand, a decrease in their tissue deposit, and, on the other, a decrease in the activity and reserve capacities of the sympathoadrenal system.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120036>Chemical Sympathectomy, but not Adrenergic Blockade, Improves Stroke Outcome.</a></h2><p>A robust adrenergic response following stroke impairs lymphocyte function, which may prevent the development of autoimmune responses to brain antigens. We tested whether inhibition of the sympathetic response after stroke would increase the propensity for developing autoimmune responses to brain antigens.Male Lewis rats were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (OHDA) prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), labetalol after MCAO, or appropriate controls. Behavior was assessed weekly and animals survived to 1 month at which time ELISPOT assays were done on lymphocytes from spleen and brain to determine the Th1 and Th17 responses to myelin basic protein (MBP), ovalbumin (OVA), and concanavalin A. A subset of animals was sacrificed 72 hours after MCAO for evaluation of infarct volume and lymphocyte responsiveness. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured as a biomarker of systemic inflammation.Despite similar initial stroke severity and infarct volumes, 6-OHDA-treated animals lost less  and experienced less hyperthermia after stroke. 6-OHDA-treated animals also had decreased CRP in circulation early after stroke and experienced better neurological outcomes at 1 month. The Th1 and Th17 responses to MBP did not differ among treatment groups at 1 month, but the Th1 response to OVA in spleen was more robust in labetalol and less robust in 6-OHDA-treated animals.Chemical sympathectomy with 6-OHDA, but not treatment with labetalol, decreased systemic markers of inflammation early after stroke and improved long-term outcome. An increase in Th1 and Th17 responses to MBP was not seen with inhibition of the sympathetic response.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, evidence in humans is scarce. We aim to investigate the association between serum choline and betaine levels with  composition in general population.This is an observational cross-sectional study performed in 1081 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study. Serum choline and betaine levels were measured based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technology.  composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry following a 12-hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses.Significantly inverse correlations were found between serum betaine levels and all obesity measurements in males (r ranged from -0.12 to -0.23, and p<0.01 for all) but not in females. Serum choline was negatively associated with total percent  fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), ,  mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (r ranged from -0.11 to -0.19, and p<0.05 for all) in males and positively associated with , BMI and WC (r ranged from 0.09 to 0.10, and p<0.05 for all) in females. The negative associations between serum choline and betaine levels with obesity in males were more profound in those not on any medication than those taking medications. Moreover, obese males had the lowest serum choline and betaine levels, followed by overweight males, and normal  males having the highest serum choline and betaine levels, especially in those not taking medications (p<0.05). Likewise, subjects with the highest serum levels of both had the lowest obesity indexes, especially those not taking medications.Higher serum choline and betaine levels were associated with a more favorable  composition (lower  fat and higher lean  mass) in males and the favorable association was more pronounced in non-medication users.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052661>Effect of sodium 4-phenylbutyrate on Clenbuterol-mediated muscle growth.</a></h2><p>Previously, we highlighted induction of an integrated stress response (ISR) gene program in skeletal muscle of pigs treated with a beta-adrenergic agonist. Hence we tested the hypothesis that the ER-stress inhibitor, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), would inhibit Clenbuterol-mediated muscle growth and reduce expression of genes that are known indicators of an ISR in mice. Clenbuterol (1mg/kg/day) administered to C57BL6/J mice for 21 days increased  (p<0.001), muscle  (p<0.01), and muscle fibre diameters (p<0.05). Co-administration of PBA (100mg/kg/day) did not alter the Clenbuterol-mediated phenotype, nor did PBA alone have any effects compared to that of the vehicle treated mice. Clenbuterol increased skeletal muscle mRNA expression of phosphoserine amino transferase 1 (PSAT1, p<0.001) and cyclophillin A (p<0.01) at day 3, but not day 7. Clenbuterol decreased mRNA expression of activating transcription factor (ATF) 4 and ATF5 at day 3 (p<0.05) and day 7 (p<0.01), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) variant 2 mRNA at day 3 only (p<0.01) and DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3/CHOP) mRNA at day 7 only (p<0.05). Co-administration of PBA had no effect on Clenbuterol-induced changes in skeletal muscle gene expression. In contrast, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with 5mM PBA (8hr) attenuated the thapsigargin-induced ISR gene program. Prolonged (24-48hr) treatment with PBA caused atrophy (p<0.01), reduced neoprotein synthesis (p<0.0001) and decreased expression of myogenin and fast myosin heavy chain genes (p<0.01), indicating an inhibition of myogenic differentiation. In summary, Clenbuterol did not induce an ISR gene program in mouse muscle. On the contrary, it reduced expression of a number of ISR genes, but it increased expression of PSAT1 mRNA. Co-administration of PBA had no effect on Clenbuterol-mediated muscle growth or gene expression in mice, whereas PBA did inhibit thapsigargin-induced ISR gene expression in cultured C2C12 cells and appeared to inhibit myogenic differentiation, independent of altering ISR gene expression.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29775125>Influence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) on the microbial properties of anaerobic granular sludge acclimated to isoplophyl alcohol (IPA) wastewater under psychrophilic conditions.</a></h2><p>In this study, a continuous flow experiment was conducted in which a lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor at psychrophilic conditions (18-19°C) was fed with artificial wastewater, containing tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and isoplophyl alcohol (IPA), from the electronics industry. This was done to evaluate process performance and microbial properties of the granular sludge that was retained in the reactor. The inoculated granular sludge was precultured with IPA containing wastewater but not TMAH; as a result, no degradation was observed in 30 days of operation. To enhance degradation, the reactor was seeded with 2%  of the TMAH-enriched sludge, after which TMAH was enhanced. Consequently, the total COD removal efficiency reached 90% at an organic loading rate of 7.5 kg COD/m/day. The TMAH inflow decreased the diameter of the retained granular sludge, but the sludge retained its settleability. The proliferation of the Methanometylovorans microorganisms present in the enrichment culture was confirmed by analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene in the retained sludge. In addition, TMAH degradation was inhibited by addition chloroform, a methanogen inhibitor. These results suggested species in the genus Methanometylovorans in the granular sludge contributed significantly to methanogenic TMAH degradation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29935093>Nebivolol ameliorated kidney damage in Zucker diabetic fatty rats by regulation of oxidative stress/NO pathway: Comparison with captopril.</a></h2><p>The aim was to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of nebivolol on renal damage in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, in comparison with those of atenolol and captopril. Animals were divided into: control lean Zucker rats, ZDF rats, ZDF rats orally treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg), atenolol (100 mg/kg) or captopril (40 mg/kg) for 6 months. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood glucose, kidney structure and function, plasma and kidney levels of nitric oxide (NO) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and oxidant status were evaluated. Kidney expressions of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms 2 and 4 and subunit p22 , nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, endothelial NOS (eNOS) uncoupling, protein arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) 1, and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) 1 and 2 were tested. All drugs induced a similar control of SBP. Nebivolol did not affect the increased plasma glucose. Unlike atenolol, nebivolol prevented the decrease in plasma insulin, and, like captopril, it reduced plasma lipid contents. Nebivolol ameliorated, to a greater extent than captopril, damages to renal structure and function, which were associated with an improvement in interlobular artery dysfunction. Nebivolol elevated kidney phosphorylation of AMPK, attenuated NOX4 and p22 expression and oxidative stress marker levels. Nebivolol increased plasma and renal NO, enhanced expressions of eNOS, p-eNOS and neuronal NOS, and suppressed eNOS uncoupling and inducible NOS expression. High ADMA in plasma and kidney were decreased by nebivolol through increasing DDAH2 and decreasing protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1. Long-term treatment of nebivolol ameliorated diabetic nephropathy, at least in part, via regulation of renal oxidative stress/NO pathway.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700800>In reply: Spinal anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in obese parturients: is this the best option?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569748>The Effects of Inhaled Terbutaline on 3-km Running Time-Trial Performance.</a></h2><p>Terbutaline is a prohibited drug except for athletes with a therapeutic use exemption certificate; terbutaline's effects on endurance performance are relatively unknown.  To investigate the effects of 2 therapeutic (2 and 4 mg) inhaled doses of terbutaline on 3-km running time-trial performance.  A total of 8 men (age 24.3 [2.4] y;  77.6 [8] kg; and height 179.5 [4.3] cm) and 8 women (age 22.4 [3] y;  58.6 [6] kg; and height 163 [9.2] cm) free from respiratory disease and illness provided written informed consent. Participants completed 3-km running time trials on a nonmotorized treadmill on 3 separate occasions following placebo and 2- and 4-mg inhaled terbutaline in a single-blind, repeated- design. Urine samples (15 min postexercise) were analyzed for terbutaline concentration. Data were analyzed using 1-way repeated- analysis of variance, and significance was set at  < .05 for all analyses.  No differences were observed for completion times (1103 [201] s, 1106 [195] s, 1098 [165] s;  = .913) for the placebo or 2- and 4-mg inhaled trials, respectively. Lactate values were higher ( = .02) after 4 mg terbutaline (10.7 [2.3] mmol·L) vs placebo (8.9 [1.8] mmol·L). Values of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEV) were greater after inhalation of 2 mg (5.08 [0.2];  = .01) and 4 mg terbutaline (5.07 [0.2];  = .02) compared with placebo (4.83 [0.5] L) postinhalation. Urinary terbutaline concentrations were mean 306 (288) ng·mL and 435 (410) ng·mL ( = .2) and peak 956 ng·mL and 1244 ng·mL after 2 and 4 mg inhaled terbutaline, respectively. No differences were observed between the male and female participants.  Therapeutic dosing of terbutaline does not lead to an improvement in 3-km running performance despite significantly increased FEV. The findings suggest that athletes using inhaled terbutaline at high therapeutic doses to treat asthma will not gain an ergogenic advantage during 3-km running performance.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811871>The protective impact of betaine on the tissue structure and renal function in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rat.</a></h2><p>Myocardial infarction is one of the most common life threatening diseases that may lead to renal disorders via oxidative stress and inflammation. Betaine is a safe and well-tolerated compound exhibiting beneficial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Previous studies have demonstrated protective effects of betaine against myocardial infarction and renal injury. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of betaine on tissue structure and renal function after isoprenaline-induced myocardial infarction in rats.Fifty Wistar strain male albino rats, weighing 200 ± 10, were selected for the study. The animals were housed individually under standard environmental conditions (Light-dark cycle, temperature and constant humidity) for 1 week. After acclimatization, they were randomly divided into five groups. G1, G2, and G3 groups received betaine at doses of 50, 150, and 250 mg/kg /day via gavage for a period of 60 days. After 60 days, isoprenaline is injected subcutaneously (200 mg/kg ). In the isoprenaline group (G4), the rats were injected with isoprenaline (200 mg/kg ) and the control group (G5) received a standard diet (Without isoprenaline). Then, isoproterenol solution was used for induction of myocardial infarction. At the end, the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein was detected using immunohistochemical analysis and kidney tissues were assessed via histopathological analysis. In addition, serum level of TNF-α and creatinine level were measured via ELISA test and colorimetric methods, respectively.The results of our study indicate that isoproterenol-induced renal histopathological injury without changing creatinine level. Betaine has protective effects against renal injuries induced by isoprenaline and the expression of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein showed no significant difference in all groups. Further, betaine reduced TNF-α level significantly.According to our results, betaine has protective effects on isoprenaline-induced renal failure via a decrease in TNF-α level and nitric oxide synthase.© 2019 The Authors.

Seventeen healthy subjects volunteered to participate in a double-blind and randomised experimental design composed of four identical experimental trials. On four trials separated by 72 h, participants ingested a placebo or 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg of p-synephrine. After resting for 60 min to allow substance absorption, participants performed an exercise test of increasing intensity on a cycle ergometer while gas exchange was measured continuously. None of the doses of p-synephrine affected energy expenditure or heart rates during the test. The highest rate of fat oxidation with the placebo (0.35 ± 0.05 g/min) was reached at 38.0 ± 1.9% of VO . The ingestion of 1 mg/kg increased maximal fat oxidation to 0.47 ± 0.11 g/min (p = 0.01) but did not change the intensity at which it was obtained (42.0 ± 9.4% of VO ). The ingestion of 2 and 3 mg/kg of p-synephrine increased maximal fat oxidation to 0.55 ± 0.14 g/min (p < 0.01), although only 3 mg/kg slightly changed the intensity at which it was obtained (43.0 ± 9.5% of VO , p < 0.01). In conclusion, although all p-synephrine increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise, the highest effects were found with 2 and 3 mg/kg.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30771961>Ratio fluorometric determination of ATP base on the reversion of fluorescence of calcein quenched by Eu(III) ion using carbon dots as reference.</a></h2><p>A kind of nitrogen doped carbon dots (NCDs) with excellent stable luminescence performance was prepared by pyrolysis using  as precursor. By simply mixing solution of NCDs and calcein-Eu, a ratio fluorometric probe with carbon dots as "internal reference" and calcein-Eu as recognition group was constructed for ATP detection. The fluorescence of the calcein can be selectively quenched by Eu, and can be restored when ATP was added because Eu ions exhibit higher affinity to the oxygen-donor atoms originated from phosphates than that from carboxylate groups. Meanwhile, fluorescence of NCDs was not affected by Eu, calcein or ATP. By adding NCDs as "internal reference" in the above system, a new ratiometric strategy for detecting ATP was conducted. The dynamic linear range for ATP detection was 5.0 × 10 mol L~ 2.0 × 10 mol L, and the detection limit was 2.0 × 10 mol L.The method was successfully applied to detecting ATP in adenosine disodium triphosphate injection. Compared with calcein- Eu probe without NCDs as reference, the ratio fluorometric probe effectively reduced interference and improved the accuracy and sensitivity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ErbB4 is highly expressed in NE neurons, and its genetic variation has been linked to BPD; however, how ErbB4 regulates NE neuronal function and contributes to BPD pathogenesis is unclear. Here we find that conditional deletion of ErbB4 in locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons increases neuronal spontaneous firing through NMDA receptor hyperfunction, and elevates catecholamines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, -deficient mice present mania-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased sucrose preference. These behaviors are completely rescued by the anti-manic drug lithium or antagonists of catecholaminergic receptors. Our study demonstrates the critical role of ErbB4 signaling in regulating LC-NE neuronal function, reinforcing the view that dysfunction of the NE system may contribute to the pathogenesis of mania-associated disorder.© 2018, Cao et al.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29856245>Effects of dietary supplementation of choline and carnitine on growth performance, meat oxidative stability and carcass composition of broiler chickens fed diets with different metabolisable energy levels.</a></h2><p>1. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of two lipotropic factors (choline and carnitine) on growth performance, oxidative stability of leg and breast muscles and carcass characteristics in broiler chickens fed diets differing in metabolisable energy (ME) levels. 2. A total of 540 one-d-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were allotted to 9 experimental diets, including three ME levels (control, or 0.42 or 0.84 MJ/kg higher ME) and three types of supplemental lipotropic factors (control, 1000 mg/kg of choline or 100 mg/kg of carnitine) as a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded during the starter (1-14 d of age), grower (15-28 d of age) and finisher (29-42 d of age) periods. 3. Results showed that the increase in dietary ME level had no impact on ADFI during the starter and grower periods. In the finisher period, increasing dietary ME decreased (P < 0.001) ADFI. Raising dietary ME level by 0.84 MJ/kg resulted in the greater ADG during the grower (P < 0.05) and finisher (P < 0.001) periods. Moreover, an improvement in FCR was observed with feeding the +0.84 MJ/kg diet. Dietary supplementation of lipotropic factors improved FCR values in birds fed the control and +0.84 MJ/kg diets during the grower and finisher periods (P < 0.01). 4. Dietary supplementation of both choline and carnitine increased (P < 0.05) moisture content of leg muscle, although malondialdehyde content of leg muscle was decreased (P < 0.01) in the presence of both lipotropic factors. Dietary supplementation of carnitine decreased (P < 0.01) leg fat content, and this effect was more obvious with higher ME levels, giving a significant ME × lipotrope interaction (P < 0.05). Higher dietary ME level (+0.84 MJ/kg) reduced (P < 0.05) protein content of breast muscle, but this factor was increased (P < 0.05) by dietary supplementation of choline. 5. Although dietary ME level had no marked effect on carcass yield and internal organ , supplemental choline increased (P < 0.01) carcass yield. 6.

Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a new multimodal wound infiltration method for treating postoperative pain after knee and hip arthroplasty. This method is based on systematic infiltration of a mixture of ropivacaine, a long acting local anaesthetic, ketorolac, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (NSAID), and adrenalin around all structures subject to surgical trauma in knee and hip arthroplasty.Paper I: to assess whether pain relief after LIA in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is as effective as femoral block. Paper II: to assess whether the plasma concentration of ropivacaine and ketorolac after LIA in TKA reaches levels linked to toxicity. Paper III: to assess whether the plasma concentration of unbound ropivacaine after LIA in THA reaches levels linked to toxicity and if it is higher in THA as compared to TKA. Paper IV: to assess whether the plasma concentration of ketorolac after LIA in THA reaches levels linked to toxicity, and whether administration of ketorolac in LIA is safer as compared to the intramuscular route.Two patient cohorts of 40 patients scheduled for elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 15 patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty (THA) contributed to this work. In a randomized trial the efficacy of LIA in TKA with regard to pain at rest and upon movement was compared to femoral block.Both methods result in a high quality pain relief and similar morphine consumption during the 24h monitoring period. In the same patient cohort the maximal total plasma concentration of ropivacaine was below the established toxic threshold for most patients. All patients in the THA cohort were subjected to the routine LIA protocol. In these patients both the total and unbound plasma concentration of ropivacaine was determined. The concentration was below the established toxic threshold. As ropivacaine binds to α-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) we assessed the possibility that increased AAG may decrease the unbound concentration of ropivacaine. A 40% increase in AAG was detected during the first 24h after surgery, however the fraction of unbound ropivacaine remained the same. There was a trend towards increased C of ropivacaine with increasing age and decreasing creatinine clearance but the statistical power was too low to draw any conclusion. Administration of 30mg ketorolac according to the LIA protocol both in TKA and THA resulted in a similar C as previously reported after 10mg intramuscular ketorolac. Neither age, nor  or BMI, nor creatinine clearance, correlates to maximal ketorolac plasma concentration or total exposure to ketorolac (AUC).LIA provides good postoperative analgesia which is similar to femoral block after total knee arthroplasty. The plasma concentration of ropivacaine seems to be below toxic levels in most TKA patients. The unbound plasma concentration of ropivacaine in THA seems to be below the toxic level.The use of ketorolac in LIA may not be safer than other routes of administration, and similar restrictions should be applied in patients at risk of developing side effects.Copyright Â© 2016.

[F]FCh-PET parameters (maximum standardized uptake value: SUV in early phase (after 2 min) and late phase (after 50 min), metabolic volume, and adenoma-to-background ratio (ABR), preoperative laboratory results (PTH and serum calcium concentration), and postoperative histopathology (location, size, volume, and  of adenoma) were assessed. Relationship of PET parameters, laboratory parameters, and histopathological parameters was assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation coefficient. MRI characteristics of parathyroid adenomas were also analyzed.The majority of patients underwent a PET/MR scan, 42 patients (80.7 %); 10 patients (19.3 %) underwent PET/CT. We found a strong positive correlation between late-phase SUV and preoperative PTH level (r = 0.768, p < 0.001) and between late-phase ABR and preoperative PTH level (r = 0.680, p < 0.001). The surgical specimen volume was positively correlated with the PET/MR lesion volume (r = 0.659, p < 0.001). No significant association was observed between other [F]FCh-PET parameters, laboratory parameters, and histopathological findings. Cystic adenomas were larger than non-cystic adenomas (p = 0.048).[F]FCh uptake of parathyroid adenomas is strongly correlated with preoperative PTH serum concentration. Therefore, the preoperative PTH level might potentially be able to predict success of [F]FCh-PET imaging in hyperparathyroidism, with higher lesion-to-background ratios being expected in patients with high PTH.

FP/Salm has been shown to control symptoms of asthma and COPD better than a double dose of inhaled steroids. The patient in our report had a history of COPD, and suffered relapse of RP when given only steroids. It is possible that COPD history helps explain this patient's more difficult treatment course. Therefore, this combination may be more effective than inhaled steroids for patients with a history of COPD.This patient suffered adverse reactions triggered by methylprednisolone:  gain, hyperglycaemia and sleep disturbance after more than two months of intravenous and oral prednisolone. These reactions disappeared when we switched the patients to FP/Salm maintenance therapy.The patient underwent upper right lobectomy in September 2011. Immunohistochemistry indicated low squamous cell differentiation, and he was diagnosed with stage IIB disease (T2N1M0) according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) (7th edition).One month after repeat radiotherapy, the patient experienced fever (37.6°C), cough, chest distress and shortness of breath. We performed serologic tests, laboratory tests for procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, as well as sputum and blood cultures to rule out bacterial infection. Chest CT showed consolidation with air bronchogram in the hilum of the right lung and ground-glass densities in the right lower lobe and left upper lobe. These radiographic signs are typical of RP. Since the patient required oxygen, he was diagnosed with grade III RP.After the patinet was diagnosed with grade III RP. The patient was immediately prescribed oxygen, anti-infectives for prophylaxis, treatments to facilitate expectoration and prevent asthma, and most importantly, intravenous methylprednisone at an initial dose of 60  per day. And we cut the steroid dose in half every one week when the patient's symptoms improved obviously, and the patchy shadow on the chest radiograph sharply reduced. Then we give him FP (500 mg)/Salm (50 mg) twice daily for two months. Then the dose was halved for an additional two months.The patient showed no signs of tumor or RP relapse by the last follow-up in March 2018.This maintenance therapy of FP/Salm for patient with grade III RP may help avoid relapse when steroid therapy is tapered, particularly for patients with a history of COPD. It may also reduce risk of steroid-associated adverse effects. Based on the results observed with our patient, we intend to design a prospective trial to assess the efficacy of FP/Salm when used as preventive treatment for patients at high risk of RP, and when used as maintenance treatment for patients with grade III RP.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29873129>Cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness of obese Zucker rats: The role of AMPK.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of the study? Is the reduced signalling of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of energy homeostasis in the heart, responsible for the reduced β-adrenergic responsiveness of the heart in obesity? What is the main finding and its importance? Inhibition of AMPK in isolated hearts prevented the reduced cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness of obese rats, which was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of AMPK, a proxy of AMPK activity. This suggests a direct functional link between β-adrenergic responsiveness and AMPK signalling in the heart, and it suggests that AMPK might be an important target to restore the β-adrenergic responsiveness in the heart in obesity.The obesity epidemic impacts heavily on cardiovascular health, in part owing to changes in cardiac metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy homeostasis in the heart and is regulated by β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) in normal conditions. In obesity, chronic sympathetic overactivation leads to impaired cardiac β-AR responsiveness, although it is unclear whether AMPK signalling, downstream of β-ARs, contributes to this dysfunction. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether reduced AMPK signalling is responsible for the reduced β-AR responsiveness in obesity. In isolated hearts of lean and obese Zucker rats, we tested β-AR responsiveness to the β -AR agonist isoprenaline (ISO, 1 × 10 to 5 × 10  m) in the absence and presence of the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (CC, 10 μm). The β -AR expression and AMPK phosphorylation were assessed by Western blot. β-Adrenergic responsiveness was reduced in the hearts of obese rats (logEC of ISO-developed pressure dose-response curves: lean -8.53 ± 0.13 × 10  m versus obese -8.35 ± 0.10 × 10  m ; P < 0.05 lean versus obese, n = 6 per group). This difference was not apparent after AMPK inhibition (logEC of ISO-developed pressure curves: lean CC -8.19 ± 0.12 × 10  m versus obese CC 8.17 ± 0.13 × 10  m, P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). β -Adrenergic receptor expression and AMPK phosphorylation were reduced in hearts of obese rats (AMPK at Thr : lean 1.73 ± 0.17 a.u. versus lean CC 0.81 ± 0.13 a.u., and obese 1.18 ± 0.09 a.u. versus obese CC 0.81 ± 0.16 a.u., P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). Thus, a direct functional link between β-adrenergic responsiveness and AMPK signalling in the heart exists, and AMPK might be an important target to restore the reduced cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness in obesity.© 2018 The Authors.

Choline regulates lipid metabolism and thus may influence adiposity. This study investigates the effect of maternal choline supplementation on fetal adiposity in a mouse model of maternal obesity. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a high-fat (HF) diet or a control (NF) diet and received either 25 mM choline supplemented (CS) or control untreated (CO) drinking water for 6 weeks before timed-mating and throughout gestation. At embryonic day 17.5, HF feeding led to higher ( < 0.05) percent total  fat in fetuses from the HFCO group, while the choline supplemented HFCS group did not show significant difference versus the NFCO group. Similarly, HF feeding led to higher ( < 0.05) hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the HFCO but not the HFCS fetuses. mRNA levels of lipogenic genes such as , , and , as well as the transcription factor  that favors lipogenesis were downregulated ( < 0.05) by maternal choline supplementation in the HFCS group, which may serve as a mechanism to reduce fat accumulation in the fetal liver during maternal HF feeding. In summary, maternal choline supplementation improves indices of fetal adiposity in obese dams at late gestation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29419590>Extended Release Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection (Exparel) for Early Postoperative Pain Control Following Pharyngoplasty.</a></h2><p>Liposomal bupivacaine (LB, Exparel) is a long-acting local anesthetic reported to decrease postoperative.

Differential isotope labeling (DIL) improves mass spectrometric (MS) analysis in metabolomics by derivatizing metabolites with two isotopic forms of the same reagent. Despite its advantages, DIL-liquid chromatographic (LC)-MS/MS can result in substantial increase in workload when fully validated quantitative methods are required. To decrease the workload, we hypothesized that single point calibration or relative quantification could be used as alternative methods. Either approach will result in significant saving in resources and time. To test our hypothesis, six urinary metabolites were selected as model compounds. Urine samples were analyzed using a fully validated multipoint dansyl chloride-DIL-LC-MS/MS method. Samples were reprocessed using single point calibration and relative quantification modes. Our results demonstrated that the performance of single point calibration or relative quantification was inferior, for some metabolites, to multipoint calibration. The lower limit of quantification failed in the quantification of  in most of participant samples using single point calibration. In addition, its precision was not acceptable in one participant during serine and  quantification. On the other hand, relative quantification resulted in the least accurate data. In fact, none of the data generated from relative quantification for serine was comparable to that obtained from multipoint calibration. Finally, while single point calibration showed an overall acceptable performance for the majority of the model compounds, we cannot extrapolate the findings to other metabolites within the same analytical run. Analysts are advised to assess accuracy and precision for each metabolite in which single point calibration is the intended quantification mean.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29727404>Effects of p-Synephrine and Caffeine Ingestion on Substrate Oxidation during Exercise.</a></h2><p>Caffeine and p-synephrine are substances usually included in commercially available products for  loss because of their purported thermogenic effects. However, scientific information is lacking about the effects of combining these substances on substrate oxidation during exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the isolated and combined effects of p-synephrine and caffeine on fat oxidation rate during exercise.In a double-blind randomized experiment, 13 healthy subjects participated in four experimental trials after the ingestion of a capsule containing a placebo, 3 mg·kg of caffeine, 3 mg·kg of p-synephrine, or the combination of these doses of caffeine and p-synephrine. Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry during a cycle ergometer ramp test from 30% to 90% of V˙O2max.In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of caffeine, p-synephrine, or p-synephrine + caffeine did not alter total energy expenditure or heart rate during the whole exercise test. However, the ingestion of caffeine (0.44 ± 0.15 g·min, P = 0.03), p-synephrine (0.43 ± 0.19 g·min, P < 0.01), and p-synephrine + caffeine (0.45 ± 0.15 g·min, P = 0.02) increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise when compared with the placebo (0.30 ± 0.12 g·min). The exercise intensity that elicited maximal fat oxidation was similar in all trials (~46.2% ± 10.2% of V˙O2max).Caffeine, p-synephrine, and p-synephrine + caffeine increased the maximal rate of fat oxidation during exercise compared with a placebo, without modifying energy expenditure or heart rate.

Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) calyces are enriched with natural polyphenols known for antioxidant and anti-hypertensive effects, yet its effects on early cardiac remodelling in post myocardial infarction (MI) setting are still unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the actions of roselle extract on cardiac remodelling in rat model of MI. Male Wistar rats (200-300 g) were randomly allotted into three groups: Control, MI, and MI + Roselle. MI was induced with isoprenaline (ISO) (85 mg/kg, s.c) for two consecutive days followed by roselle treatment (100 mg/kg, orally) for 7 days. Isoprenaline administration showed changes in heart  to  (HW/BW) ratio. MI was especially evident by the elevated cardiac injury marker, troponin-T, and histological observation. Upregulation of plasma levels and cardiac gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 was seen in MI rats. A relatively high percentage of fibrosis was observed in rat heart tissues with over-expression of collagen (Col)-1 and Col-3 genes following isoprenaline-induced MI. On top of that, cardiomyocyte areas were larger in heart tissues of MI rats with upregulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression, indicating cardiac hypertrophy. Interestingly, roselle supplementation attenuated elevation of plasma troponin-T, IL-6, IL10, and gene expression level of IL-10. Furthermore, reduction of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy were observed. In conclusion, roselle treatment was able to limit early cardiac remodelling in MI rat model by alleviating inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy; hence, the potential application of roselle in early adjunctive treatment to prevent heart failure.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29386559>Adrenergic hormones induce extrapituitary prolactin gene expression in leukocytes-potential implications in obesity.</a></h2><p>The pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL), originally described for its role in lactation, has been implemented in over 300 functions and is produced by multiple cell types outside of the pituitary. Monocyte/macrophages in particular show robust expression of extra-pituitary prolactin (ePRL). While ePRL protein is identical to pituitary PRL and translated from the same gene, tissues outside the pituitary engage an alternative promoter to regulate expression. Many of the factors regulating this expression, however, remain unknown. Here we show that the adrenergic hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine induce PRL expression in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 at physiological concentrations. Furthermore, our experiments show the polarization state of differentiated macrophages can influence their response in vitro, with inflammatory M macrophages-common in obese adipose-showing the highest levels of PRL expression compared to other macrophage types. Adrenergic hormones have a clearly defined role in adipocyte lipid metabolism, stimulating lipolysis through hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) induction. Meanwhile, PRL has been shown to stimulate lipogenesis. This highlights ePRL production as a possible factor in obesity. The overall balance of these two signals could play a critical role in determining overall lipid turnover/accumulation in adipose depots where large numbers of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) reside.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28902942>A study on reducing the absorption of lidocaine from the airway in cats.</a></h2><p>To determine if the combination of lidocaine with epinephrine or gamma globulin would decrease the rate or reduce the amount of local absorption of lidocaine through the airway.Twenty adult male cats were randomly and evenly distributed into four groups: 1) Group LG: lidocaine administered with gamma globulin; 2) Group LS: lidocaine administered with physiological saline); 3) Group LE: lidocaine administered with epinephrine; 4) Group C: control group.

For this purpose, the study was carried out on Wistar rats and three doses of adrenaline were used: 0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg, and 3 mg/kg . To achieve these aims, we investigated the effects of adrenaline on catalase (CAT), Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite (NO-), carbonyl groups (PCC), and nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Total activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), its relative distribution (LDH-LDH) activity, level of acute phase proteins (APPs), and genotoxic effect were also evaluated. The obtained results revealed that all doses of adrenaline induced a significant rise in CAT activity, MDA level, PCC, NO , and 3-NT and a significant decrease in SOD activity compared to control. Adrenaline exerted an increase in total activity of LDH, LDH, and LDH isoenzymes. Further study showed that adrenaline significantly decreased serum albumin level and albumin-globulin ratio, while the level of APPs ( -acid glycoprotein and haptoglobulin) is increased. The micronucleus test revealed a genotoxic effect of adrenaline at higher concentrations (1.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg ) compared to untreated rats. It can be concluded that adrenaline exerts oxidative and nitrative stress in rats, increased damage to lipids and proteins, and damage of cardiomyocytes and cytogenetic damage. Obtained results may contribute to better understanding of the toxicity of adrenaline with aims to preventing its harmful effects.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941414>Dietary choline supplementation regulated lipid profiles of egg yolk, blood, and liver and improved hepatic redox status in laying hens.</a></h2><p>Five hundred and forty 19-wk-old HyLine Brown laying hens were randomly distributed to 6 dietary treatments and fed 1of 6 corn-soybean meal-based diets added into choline with 0, 425, 850, 1,700, 3,400, and 6,800 mg/kg to investigate effects of dietary choline supplementation on lipid profiles of egg yolk, serum and liver, and hepatic redox status of laying hens.

We examined time-dependent changes in adipose tissue levels of endocannabinoids as well as in parameters of glucose homeostasis induced by n-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice, and compared these results with the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8, 16 or 24 weeks a high-fat diet alone (cHF) or supplemented with n-3 PUFA (cHF + F). Overweight/obese, T2DM patients on metformin therapy were given for 24 weeks corn oil (Placebo; 5 g/day) or n-3 PUFA concentrate as above (Omega-3; 5 g/day). Endocannabinoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to cHF-fed controls, the cHF + F mice consistently reduced 2-arachidonoylglycerol (up to ~2-fold at week 24) and anandamide (~2-fold) in adipose tissue, while the levels of endocannabinoid-related anti-inflammatory molecules N-eicosapentaenoyl  (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl  (DHEA) increased more than ~10-fold and ~8-fold, respectively. At week 24, the cHF + F mice improved glucose tolerance and fasting blood glucose, the latter being positively correlated with adipose 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels only in obese cHF-fed controls, like fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the patients, n-3 PUFA failed to reduce 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels in adipose tissue and serum, but they increased both adipose tissue and serum levels of EPEA and DHEA. In conclusion, the inability of n-3 PUFA to reduce adipose tissue and serum levels of classical endocannabinoids might contribute to a lack of beneficial effects of these lipids on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2018.

Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty acid effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty acid and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation.

The results demonstrated that excessive autophagy occurred following 5 min of ISO stimulation in vitro. This enhanced autophagy was blocked by pretreatment with hydrogen‑rich medium. Furthermore, hydrogen improved the deteriorated hypertrophic responses and inhibited the enhanced autophagic activity mediated by ISO administration in vivo, as indicated by decreasing HW and HW/BW, and suppressing the protein expression levels of Beclin1, Atg7 and LC3B II.

Various cardiac stress markers, including infarct size and heart/ index, were investigated in animals with ISO-induced MI, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), creatinine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), cardiac troponin-T (CTT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde. INOS, p38, caspase-3, and connexin 43 expressions were analyzed in animals. Inflammatory mediators, tissue necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were detected in serum of experimental animals.Group I animals indicated normal levels of biochemical parameters, whereas group II animals indicated high levels of these parameters and successful induction of MI. Pretreatment of animal groups III, IV, and V with RPG revealed amelioration of infarct size, heart/ index, CK, LD, CTT in rats, whereas group VI animals were treated only with RPG (5.0 mg/kg/day) and not with ISO. Levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MD, SOD, p38, and iNOS expressions were significantly downregulated by RPG administration (5.0 mg/kg/day).RPG ameliorates MI caused by ISO in rats and provides cardioprotective effect, via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic effect.© 2019 S.

However, when isolating secreted product from conditioned medium (CM), after cell exposure to a trigger, it is better to remove FCS in the culture medium for identification of secreted products of interest. However, it is unknown whether defined medium adversely affects active efflux protein expression and tight junction formation.Using different gastrointestinal cell lines chosen with different levels of efflux transporter expression, fully defined components, such as using transferrin, insulin, selenium and  without FCS or with a reduced percentage of FCS (2%) were tested as an optimal choice for cell growth. In addition to morphological characteristics, the expression of the ABC efflux transporters, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), ABCC2 (multidrug resistance associated protein 2), ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) and occludin was determined.The cells required a minimum of 2% FCS for expression of transporters. Fully defined medium with no serum adversely affected the expression of transporters, especially P-gp. An important characteristic of Caco-2 cells is its ability to form tight junctions. Caco-2 did not form adequate tight junctions without 10% FCS added in the medium, as evidenced by low TEER values and reduced occluding immunohistochemistry.FCS is required for efflux protein expression and tight junction generation. Nevertheless, it is possible to use 5 fold less FCS which assists with low molecular  secretion isolation. Passage number also contributes significantly to the presence of these transporters.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Acute oral administration of soy peptide (0.026 g/30 g ) caused a notable increase in tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor, in the serum and cerebral cortex, whereas casein peptide administration at the same dose led to an increase in tyrosine in the serum, but not in the cerebral cortex. In addition to tyrosine, soy peptide administration also led to an effective augmentation of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG), a principal metabolite of noradrenaline, and significant facilitation of noradrenergic turnover in the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and hippocampus compared to the vehicle control. Casein peptide administration also led to an increase in MHPG only in the cerebral cortex, and caused facilitation of noradrenergic turnover in the cerebral cortex and brainstem. These in vivo observations suggest that both soy and casein peptide intake at this concentration can lead to an increased availability of tyrosine and stimulation of noradrenergic turnover in the brain.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29052589>Obesity: Specialized macrophages contribute to obesity.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28859148>Stellate ganglion block attenuates chronic stress induced depression in rats.</a></h2><p>Stress is a significant factor in the etiology of depression. Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has been shown to maintain the stability of the autonomic system and to affect the neuroendocrine system, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The objective of this study was to determine the antidepressant-like effects of SGB on the autonomic system and the HPA axis, apoptosis-related proteins, related spatial learning and memory impairment, and sensorimotor dysfunction.Forty-eight Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to four experimental groups: control + saline (sham group), control + SGB (SGB group), unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) + saline (UCMS group), and UCMS + SGB (UCSG group). Stress-induced effects and the function of SGB were assessed using  of , coat state, sucrose consumption, and behavior in open-field and Y-maze tests. Neuronal damage was assessed histologically using the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining method, while western blotting was used to investigate changes in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Plasma corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone (CORT), noradrenaline and adrenaline were measured to evaluate changes in the autonomic system and HPA axis.SGB treatment significantly improved sensorimotor dysfunction and spatial learning and memory impairment following UCMS. Moreover, UCMS significantly decreased , sucrose preference and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and increased scores on  of coat state, adrenal gland , levels of CORT, CRF, ACTH, noradrenaline and adrenaline, as well as increased neuronal loss, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. These symptoms were attenuated by treatment with SGB.These findings suggest that SGB can attenuate depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. These protective effects appear to be due to an anti-apoptotic mechanism of two stress pathways-the autonomic system and the HPA axis.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200739>[Effects of sleep deprivation induced blood stasis syndrome on platelet activation in rats].</a></h2><p>Blood stasis syndrome is the pre-state of thrombotic disease.

The patients were randomly divided into the observation group (n=117) and the control group (n=116). The observation group received a subcutaneous injection of low molecular  heparin at 2-7 days after surgery, and the control group was not treated with anticoagulation. The prevalence of VTE and the changes of CD62P, CD63, PAF, and D-D before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. The VTE prevalence after surgery, the changes of CD62P, CD63, PAF, D-D before and after surgery and the correlation of the above indexes with VTE were analyzed.The prevalence of VTE in the observation group was 0.85% (1/117), which was lower than that of the control group (13.79%) (16/116); the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in blood coagulation function between the two groups before and after operation (p>0.05).

Polymer nanodiscs have been useful as a membrane mimetic by not only providing a native-like membrane environment, but also have the ability to extract the desired membrane protein directly from the cell membrane. In spite of such great potential, polymer nanodiscs have their disadvantages including lack of size control and instability at low pH and with divalent metals. In this review, we discuss how these limitations have been overcome by simple modifications of synthetic polymers commonly used to form nanodiscs. Recently, size control has been achieved using an  functionalization of a low molecular  polymer. This size control enabled the use of polymer-based lipid-nanodiscs in solution NMR and macro-nanodiscs in solid-state NMR applications. The introduction of quaternary ammonium functional groups has been shown to improve the stability in the presence of low pH and divalent metal ions, forming highly monodispersed nanodiscs. The polymer charge has been shown to play a significant role on the reconstitution of membrane proteins due to the high charge density on the nanodisc's belt. These recent developments have expanded the applications of polymer nanodiscs to study the membrane proteins using wide variety of techniques including NMR, Cryo-EM and other biophysical techniques.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In benign and malignant PZ regions identified from pathology, voxel-based choline/citrate, polyamines/choline, polyamines/creatine, and (choline + polyamines + creatine)/citrate ratios were averaged, as were ADC values. Patients were randomly split into training and test sets; rules for separating benign from malignant regions were generated with classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and assessed on the test set for sensitivity and specificity. Odds ratios (OR) were evaluated using generalized estimating equations.CART analysis of all parameters identified only ADC and (choline + polyamines + creatine)/citrate as significant predictors of cancer. Sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 0.81 and 0.82 with MRSI-derived, 0.98 and 0.51 with DWI-derived, and 0.79 and 0.90 with MRSI + DWI-derived classification rules.

We have previously reported on the degrafting of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) polymer brushes from flat silicon substrates. Here, we present a detailed study on the effects of NaCl concentration and the grafting density and molecular  on the stability of PAA brushes during incubation in 0.1 M  buffer (pH 9.0) solutions. Without NaCl in the buffer solution, the PAA brushes remain intact. Adding NaCl facilitates etching of the substrate due to accelerating dissolution of the top silica layer and promoting degrafting of the PAA chains. The PAA grafting density and molecular  play an important role in the substrate etching by affecting the penetration barrier and local concentration of the etchants. We also tested the stability of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) made of hydrophobic alkyltrichlorosilanes anchored on silicon substrates. The results demonstrated that the SAMs were too thin to protect the substrates from etching, in contrast to thick poly(methyl methacrylate) brushes. Our findings suggest that both polymer brushes (especially polyelectrolyte brushes) and SAMs anchored to silicon substrates may undergo erosion/etching on the substrates in basic environments, which compromises their stability and therefore jeopardizes their applications in coating, biosensing, and so forth.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420089>Characterization of vascular dysregulation in meriones shawi after high-calorie diet feeding.</a></h2><p>The present study was initiated to characterize vascular dysregulations (contraction and relaxation) associated with metabolic defects in Merions shawi, a rodent from the gerbillidae family, submitted to 12 weeks high-calorie diet.

Endothelium-dependent relaxation to carbachol was enhanced, while relaxing effects of the NO donor SNAP and of diazoxide were unchanged. Insulin-evoked relaxation was depressed in aorta from diabetic meriones, and L-arginine relaxed contracted arteries from diabetic meriones, but not from lean meriones.

The combination of a lipid emulsion with levosimendan, was shown to be superior to administration of a lipid emulsion alone with regard to successful resuscitation. In this study, we compared the reversal effects of levosimendan, epinephrine, and a combination of the two agents in lipid-based resuscitation in a rat model of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest.Fifty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to bupivacaine (15 mg·kg) -induced asystole and were then randomly divided into 3 groups. A lipid emulsion was used as the basic treatment, and administration of drug combinations varied in each group as follows: (1) levosimendan combined with epinephrine (LiEL); (2) epinephrine (LiE); and (3) levosimendan (LiL). The resuscitation outcomes were recorded and included the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival at 40 min, time to first heartbeat, time to ROSC, and cumulative dose of epinephrine. We calculated the wet-to-dry ratio of the lung, blood gas values at 40 min and bupivacaine concentration of cardiac tissue and plasma.The rates of ROSC in LiEL and LiE groups were higher than LiL group (P < 0.001; LiEL vs LiL, P = 0.001; LiE vs LiL, P = 0.007). The survival rate in LiEL group was higher than LiE group (P = 0.003; LiEL vs LiE, P = 0.008; LiEL vs LiL, P = 0.001). The time to first heart beat in LiEL group was shorter than LiE, LiL groups. (P < 0.001; LiE vs LiEL, P = 0.001; LiL vs LiEL, P < 0.001). The time to ROSC in LiEL group was shorter than LiE, LiL groups (P < 0.001; LiEL vs LiE, P < 0.001; LiEL vs LiL, P < 0.001). The result was similar for the bupivacaine concentration of cardiac tissue and plasma (cardiac tissue: P = 0.002; plasma: P = 0.011). Furthermore, there were significant differences in the blood-gas values at 40 min, wet-to-dry lung  ratio, and ratio of damaged alveoli among groups.

It has received great interest due to its protective role in many disorders such as heart diseases and neurological disorders.We hypothesized that blueberry leaf extract might have a protective effect against cardiac hypertrophy via suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis.Blueberry leaf nutraceutical extract was administered orally to male albino rats at three different doses (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day of the extract, equivalent to 3.4, 6.8 and 13.6 mg of chlorogenic acid, respectively) once daily for 28 consecutive days against a dose of isoprenaline (ISO) (5 mg/kg) for 14 days.The results indicated that isoprenaline induced significant myocardial damage, characterized by conduction abnormalities, increased heart-to- ratio, increased serum CKMB, AST, c-TnI and LDH. Pretreatment with blueberry extract at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 6.8 mg chlorogenic acid) protected against ISO-induced ECG changes, leakage of cardiac enzymes and histopathological changes. Also, ISO caused significant glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation and reduction in activities of antioxidant catalase enzyme. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with blueberry extract. Additionally, ISO elicited inflammatory effects by increasing the expression of NF-κB, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-6 while pretreatment with blueberry extract significantly inhibited these inflammatory responses. Furthermore, ISO induced fibrosis by increasing the level of TGF-β while pretreatment with blueberry extract significantly reduced it.These findings indicate that blueberry leaf extract possessed a potent protective effect against ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy via suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

The present study evaluated the protective effect of α-bisabolol against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in rats. Male albino Wistar rats were pre- and co-treated with intraperitoneal injection of α-bisabolol (25 mg/kg ) daily for 10 days. To induce experimental MI, ISO (85 mg/kg ) was injected subcutaneously to the rats at an interval of 24 h for 2 days (9th and 10th day). ISO-induced MI was indicated by the decreased activities of heart creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in rats. ISO administration also enhanced the concentrations of heart mitochondrial lipid peroxidation products and decreased the activities/concentrations of mitochondrial antioxidants, Kreb's cycle dehydrogenases and mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I, II + III and IV in rats. Furthermore, ISO triggers calcium overload and ATP depletion in the rat's heart mitochondria followed by the mitochondrial cytochrome-C release and the activation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by upregulating the myocardial pro-apoptotic Bax, P, APAF-1, active caspase-3, active caspase-9 and down regulating the expressions of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. α-Bisabolol pre and co-treatment showed considerable protective effects on all the biochemical and molecular parameters studied.

The concentrations of the aforementioned polymers, as well as PEG-600 and PEG-1000 required for phase separation in mixtures with choline chloride reported in the literature are analyzed. It is found that the concentrations of polymers needed for phase separation in mixtures with 35%wt. choline chloride are linearly related with water hydrogen bond donor acidity or hydrogen bond acceptor basicity in the individual polymer solutions at given concentrations. Partition behavior of nine proteins was examined in both systems. The partition coefficients of proteins in PEG-600-choline chloride ATPS exceeded those observed in PEG-600-TMAO ATPS from ca. 2 to ca. 75-fold possibly due to the larger difference between the composition of the coexisting phases in the former ATPS.

Therefore, quantitative determination of choline is important in the biological and clinical analysis. So far, several methods have been investigated for measuring choline in the  fluids, each of which has disadvantages such as the need for specialist ability, complexity, and high cost. For this purpose, a facile and sensitive colorimetric biosensor based on DNAzyme-choline oxidase coupling used for the determination of choline. In this method, the first, choline oxidase produces HO and betaine in the presence of choline and oxygen, then, the DNAzyme converts colorless ABTS into green ABTS radicals. Compared to the previous methods, the linear range and the limit of detection of this talented biosensor were 0.1-25 μM and 22 nM. Choline measurement using this biosensor has shown satisfactory selectivity and repeatability. Its recovery was 96.9-103.7%, which shows the reliability of biosensor assay in biological samples. Simplicity, low cost, naked eye, high sensitivity, and precision are the benefits of this biosensor. Taken to gather, the proposed system can be considered as a great biosensor for measuring choline levels especially in point of care diagnostic.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

On each visit the participants consumed either a CA + C (100 mg of CA and 100 mg of C) or placebo (dextrose) capsule. After consumption, participants were monitored throughout a 45-min ingestion period, then completed a repeated Wingate protocol, and were then monitored throughout a 45-min recovery period. Cardiac autonomic function (Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)) and plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) were taken at four different time points; Ingestion period: baseline (I1), post-ingestion period (I2); Recovery period: immediately post-exercise (R1), post-recovery period (R2). Heart rate variability was assessed in 5-min increments.A repeated  ANOVA revealed significant time-dependent increases in HR, sympathetic related markers of HRV, and plasma E and NE at I2 only in the CA + C trial (p < 0.05); however, no meaningful changes in parasympathetic markers of HRV were observed. Participants recovered in a similar time-dependent manner in all markers of HRV and catecholamines following the PLA and CA + C trials.The consumption of CA + C results in an increase of sympathetic activity during resting conditions without influencing parasympathetic activity. CA + C provides no influence over cardiac autonomic recovery.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258368>Lisdexamfetamine: chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability in the treatment of binge eating disorder.</a></h2><p>The indications for lisdexamfetamine (LDX), a central nervous system stimulant, were recently expanded to include treatment of moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED). Areas covered: This review aims to describe the chemistry and pharmacology of LDX, as well as the clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of this medication for the management of BED. Expert opinion: LDX is the first medication with United States Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of BED. It is an inactive prodrug of d-amphetamine that extends the half-life of d-amphetamine to allow for once daily dosing. D-amphetamine acts primarily to increase the concentrations of synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine. Metabolism of LDX to d-amphetamine occurs when peptidases in red blood cells cleave the covalent bond between d-amphetamine and l-lysine. D-amphetamine is then further metabolized by CYP2D6. Excretion is primarily through renal mechanisms. In clinical trials, LDX demonstrated statistical and clinical superiority over placebo in reducing binge eating days per week at doses of 50 and 70 mg daily. Commonly reported side effects of LDX include dry mouth, insomnia,  loss, and headache, and its use should be avoided in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia or coronary artery disease. As with all CNS stimulants, risk of abuse needs to be assessed prior to prescribing.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867675>Resting sympathetic activity is associated with the sympathetically mediated component of energy expenditure following a meal.</a></h2><p>Individuals with high plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels at rest have a smaller reduction in resting energy expenditure (REE) following -adrenergic blockade. If this finding extends to the response to a meal, it could have important implications for the role of the sympathetic nervous system in energy balance and  gain. We hypothesized high muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) would be associated with a low sympathetically mediated component of energy expenditure following a meal. Fourteen young, healthy adults completed two visits randomized to continuous saline (control) or intravenous propranolol to achieve systemic -adrenergic blockade. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity and REE were measured (indirect calorimetry) followed by a liquid mixed meal (Ensure).  of energy expenditure continued every 30 min for 5 h after the meal and are reported as an area under the curve (AUC). Sympathetic support of energy expenditure was calculated as the difference between the AUC during saline and -blockade (AUC-AUC, -REE) and as a percent (%) of control (AUC÷AUC × 100). -REE was associated with baseline sympathetic activity, such that individuals with high resting MSNA (bursts/100 heart beats) and plasma NE had the greatest sympathetically mediated component of energy expenditure following a meal (MSNA: -REE =-0.58,  0.03; %REE  = -0.56, 0.04; NE: -REE = -0.55,  = 0.0535; %REE  = -0.54,  = 0.0552). Contrary to our hypothesis, high resting sympathetic activity is associated with a greater sympathetically mediated component of energy expenditure following a liquid meal. These findings may have implications for  maintenance in individuals with varying resting sympathetic activity.© 2017 The Authors.

SAL concentrations were measured by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in extracts of tissues from goats sacrificed 0.25, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the last dose. Our results showed that on Day 0.25 of the withdrawal period, the residual proportions of SAL (expressed as percentage) in liver, kidney, lung, hair, stomachs and muscle were 19.5%, 15.3%, 3.3%, 9.6%, 28.2% and 0.8%, respectively. As the withdrawal time increased, the SAL concentrations in most tissues (except hair) decreased rapidly over the first 3 days and more slowly in the following 25 days. After a 28-day withdrawal period, hair, lung, muscle, liver, fat, eyes, rumen, kidney and abomasum still contained ~32.3%, 15.3%, 7.1%, 6.5%, 5.6%, 1.5%, 0.8% and 0.5% compared to the initial residual concentrations determined on Day 0.25, respectively. On withdrawal Day 28, the highest concentrations of SAL were found in hair (16.58 ± 9.48 μg/kg), followed by liver (7.01 ± 0.94 μg/kg), lung (2.81 ± 1.23 μg/kg), kidney (0.64 ± 0.56 μg/kg), whereas the concentrations in other tissues were lower than limit of quantification (0.50 μg/kg). SAL residues were not detected in bile, plasma and brain on Days 7, 7 and 3 after discontinuation of dosing. These findings indicated that the distribution and depletion rates of SAL differed between tissues. It should be noted that SAL residues in stomach were higher than those in muscles during the early withdrawal. We conclude that hair is the preferred tissue to monitor the administration of SAL to living goats, whereas liver can be used to monitor SAL in the carcass for determination of compliance with food safety regulation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101852>Chronic Pressure Overload Induces Cardiac Hypertrophy and Fibrosis via Increases in SGLT1 and IL-18 Gene Expression in Mice.</a></h2><p>Increased gene expression levels of sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) are associated with hypertrophic and ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, it remains unclear whether chronic pressure overload increases SGLT1 expression, which in turn induces hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that pressure overload could increase SGLT1 gene expression, leading to the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.To create pressure overload-induced cardiomyopathy, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed in SGLT1-deficient (SGLT1) and wild-type (WT) mice. Six weeks after surgery, all mice were investigated. We observed a reduction of left ventricular fractional shortening and left ventricular dilatation in TAC-operated WT but not in TAC-operated SGLT1 mice. SGLT1, interleukin 18, connective tissue growth factor, and collagen type 1 gene expression levels were increased in TAC-operated WT mouse hearts compared with that of sham-operated WT mouse hearts. Moreover, heart/ ratio and ventricular interstitial fibrosis were increased in TAC-operated WT mice compared with that of sham-operated WT mice. Interestingly, these factors did not increase in TAC-operated SGLT1 mice compared with that of sham-operated WT and SGLT1 mice. Phenylephrine, an adrenergic α receptor agonist, caused cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in neonatal WT mouse hearts to a significantly larger extent than in neonatal SGLT1 mouse hearts.In conclusion, the results indicate that chronic pressure overload increases SGLT1 and IL-18 gene expressions, leading to the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These results make SGLT1 a potential candidate for the therapeutic target for hypertension-induced cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753212>Quantification of doping compounds in faecal samples from racing pigeons, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>The use of performance enhancing drugs is not only common in humans, but also in animal sports, including racing of horses, greyhounds and pigeons. The development of accurate analytical procedures to detect doping agents in sports is crucial in order to protect the fair-play of the game, avoid financial fraud in the attribution of eventual awards and, even more important, to protect the animals from harmful drugs and/or dangerous dosage regimens. The present study aimed to develop and validate, a method that enabled the screening and confirmation of the presence of a beta-agonist (clenbuterol) and three corticosteroids (betamethasone, prednisolone and budesonide) in faeces from pigeons. The extraction procedure entailed the combination of liquid-liquid extraction with solid-phase extraction and the analysis was performed by liquid- chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, with a single 15 minute chromatographic run-time. The method was validated concerning selectivity, linearity (with coefficients of determination always >0.99), accuracy (87.5-114.9%), inter-day and intra-day precisions, limits of detection (0.14-1.81 ng/g) and limits of quantification (0.49-6.08 ng/g), stability and extraction recovery (71.0%-99.3%). The method was successfully applied for the analysis of samples from two pigeons that had been orally administered betamethasone, demonstrating its suitability for doping control purposes.Copyright © 2018.

Our study used a novel fibroblast-specific, tamoxifen-inducible p38α knockout (KO) mouse line to characterize the role of fibroblast p38α in modulating cardiac hypertrophy, and we elucidated the mechanism. Myocardial injury was induced in tamoxifen-treated Cre-positive p38α KO mice or control littermates via chronic infusion of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Cardiac function was assessed by pressure-volume conductance catheter analysis and was evaluated for cardiac hypertrophy at tissue, cellular, and molecular levels. Isoproterenol infusion in control mice promoted overt cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction (reduced ejection fraction, increased end systolic volume, increased cardiac  index, increased cardiomyocyte area, increased fibrosis, and up-regulation of myocyte fetal genes and hypertrophy-associated microRNAs). Fibroblast-specific p38α KO mice exhibited marked protection against myocardial injury, with isoproterenol-induced alterations in cardiac function, histology, and molecular markers all being attenuated. In vitro mechanistic studies determined that cardiac fibroblasts responded to damaged myocardium by secreting several paracrine factors known to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, including IL-6, whose secretion was dependent upon p38α activity. In conclusion, cardiac fibroblast p38α contributes to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction, potentially via a mechanism involving paracrine fibroblast-to-myocyte IL-6 signaling.-Bageghni, S.

The toxin was purified by a combination of three chromatographic steps (ion-exchange on DEAE-Sephacel, molecular exclusion on Sephadex G-75, and affinity chromatography on HiTrap™ Heparin HP). BmooPAi was found to be a single-chain protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa on 14% SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions. Sequencing of BmooPAi by Edman degradation revealed the amino acid sequence LGPDIVPPNELLEVM. The toxin was devoid of proteolytic, haemorrhagic, defibrinating, or coagulant activities and induced no significant oedema or hyperalgesia. BmooPAi showed a rather specific inhibitory effect on ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma, whereas it had little or no effect on platelet aggregation induced by collagen and adenosine diphosphate. The results presented in this work suggest that BmooPAi is a toxin comprised of disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains, originating from autolysis/proteolysis of PIII SVMPs from  snake venom. This toxin may be of medical interest because it is a platelet aggregation inhibitor, which could potentially be developed as a novel therapeutic agent to prevent and/or treat patients with thrombotic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28988124>In vitro and in vivo evaluation of targeting tumor with folate-based amphiphilic multifunctional stabilizer for resveratrol nanosuspensions.</a></h2><p>Resveratrol (RSV) nanosuspensions, with long term stability and targeting delivery ability, were designed and demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo model. The folate modified distearoylphosphatidyl -polyethylene glycol (DSPE-PEG-FA), as target delivery carrier, was synthesized and confirmed by FTIR and H NMR. D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and DSPE-PEG-FA used as stabilizers formed two RSV nanosuspensions (RSV-NA and RSV-NB), which were prepared by anti-solvent precipitation method and optimized by central composite design-response surface model (CCD-RSM). The morphology of RSV nanosuspensions showed flake shapes and spherical shapes by SEM. And the distribution of particles was uniform by TEM and AFM. The two RSV nanosuspensions displayed an amorphous state, by XRPD and DSC determination. At room temperature, the optimum RSV nanosuspensions showed long term stability for 20days. The cell proliferation and morphology study revealed that the RSV nanosuspensions significantly enhanced the in vitro cytotoxicity against A549 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The recommended safe concentration was 5μM for in vitro study. In vivo studies of the two nanosuspensions also displayed higher antitumor efficacy by reduced tumor volume and . Compared with the saline group, the tumor inhibition ratio of the RSV-NA was 61.53±18.36% and RSV-NB was 64.61±21.13%. The mice  of the RSV-NA group and RSV-NB group was also maintained constant increasing. These results demonstrated that TPGS and DSPE-PEG-FA could be used as stabilizers for stable RSV nanosuspensions formulation with the potentiality for targeting delivery to human alveolar carcinoma cells with high stability and efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

DMF exhibited cardioprotective effect as evidenced by the reduction in cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase-MB and atrial natriuretic peptide levels. Moreover, DMF alleviated the changed oxidative stress and inflammatory biochemical markers through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. DMF interfered with TLR signalling pathway, evidenced by decreased levels of the TLR adaptor protein MyD88 and p-ERK1/2 and increased p-Akt level.Dimethyl fumarate exerted cardioprotective effect against ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

We compared LV and arterial (femoral and radial) dP/dt to the slope of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Ees), a load-independent measure of LV contractility, to determine the interactions between dP/dt and Ees as loading and LV contractility varied.We measured LV pressure-volume data using a conductance catheter and femoral and radial arterial pressures using a fluid-filled catheter in 10 anesthetized pigs. Ees was calculated as the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship during a transient inferior vena cava occlusion. Afterload was assessed by the effective arterial elastance. The experimental protocol consisted of sequentially changing afterload (phenylephrine/nitroprusside), preload (bleeding/fluid bolus), and contractility (esmolol/dobutamine). A linear-mixed analysis was used to assess the contribution of cardiac (Ees, end-diastolic volume, effective arterial elastance, heart rate, preload-dependency) and arterial factors (total vascular resistance and arterial compliance) to LV and arterial dP/dt.Both LV and arterial dP/dt allowed the tracking of Ees changes, especially during afterload and contractility changes, although arterial dP/dt was lower compared to LV dP/dt (bias 732 ± 539 mmHg⋅s for femoral dP/dt, and 625 ± 501 mmHg⋅s for radial dP/dt). Changes in cardiac contractility (Ees) were the main determinant of LV and arterial dP/dt changes.Although arterial dP/dt is a complex function of central and peripheral arterial factors, radial and particularly femoral dP/dt allowed reasonably good tracking of LV contractility changes as loading and inotropic conditions varied.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704028>Contractile responses in intact and mucosa-denuded human ureter-a comparison with urinary bladder detrusor preparations.</a></h2><p>Human proximal and distal ureter tissues were studied to clarify whether the presence of mucosa affects contractile responses. In histological studies, human ureter was compared with urinary bladder (detrusor). Contractions in response to high KCl solution, phenylephrine, and carbachol were measured in intact and mucosa-denuded strips of human ureter. Tissue sections of human bladder and ureter were used for histological staining. Thirty-four percent of the ureter strips contracted spontaneously with highly variable patterns, and this was affected neither by mucosa nor by proximal or distal tissue origin. Upon stimulation with 40 mM KCl, ureter strips exhibited strong phasic and weak tonic contractions. In intact strips, normalized tonic force was lower than in denuded strips, but no consistent effect of mucosa was observed with phasic contractions. Absolute force values of phasic contractions were weaker in proximal than distal ureter strips, but similar when normalized to tissue wet . Stimulation with 80 mM KCl enhanced tonic contraction fourfold; phasic contractions occurred rarely. Phenylephrine produced no statistically significant stronger tonic contraction in distal compared with proximal ureter strips; nevertheless, in some strips, pre-existing spontaneous contractions increased. Carbachol did not influence ureter contractions. In the bladder, a suburothelial cell layer stained positive with α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-specific antibodies could be further differentiated with vimentin- and desmin-specific antibodies. α-SMA positive cells were absent in suburothelial ureter tissue. Like in detrusor, the mucosa inhibits KCl-stimulated tonic ureter contractions. The mucosa of detrusor and ureter tissue exhibits distinct staining patterns for α-SMA, vimentin, and desmin.

Sublethal doses of Rhinella icterica toxic secretion (RITS) were assayed in Nauphoeta cinerea cockroaches, in order to understand the physiological and behavioral parameters, over the insect central and peripheral nervous system. RITS (10 μg/g) injections, induced behavioral impairment as evidenced by a significant decrease (38 ± 14%) in the distance traveled (p < .05), followed by an increase (90 ± 6%) of immobile episodes (p < .001, n = 28, respectively). In cockroaches semi-isolated heart preparations, RITS (16 μg/200 μl) induced a significant irreversible dose-dependent negative chronotropism, reaching ~40% decrease in heart rate in 20 min incubation. In in vivo cockroach neuromuscular preparations, RITS (20, 50 and 100 μg/g of animal ) induced a time-dependent inhibition of twitch tension that was complete for 20 μg/g, in 120 min recordings. RITS (10 μg/g) also induced a significant increase in the insect leg grooming activity (128 ± 10%, n = 29, p < .01), but not in the antennae counterparts. The RITS increase in leg grooming activity was prevented in 90% by the pretreatment of cockroaches with phentolamine (0.1 μg/g). The electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous neural compound action potentials showed that RITS (20 μg/g) induced a significant increase in the number of events, as well as in the rise time and duration of the potentials. In conclusion, RITS showed to be entomotoxic, being the neuromuscular failure and cardiotoxic activity considered the main deleterious effects. The disturbance of the cockroaches' behavior together with the electrophysiological alterations, may unveil the presence of some toxic components present in the poison with inherent biotechnological potentials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Reference intervals were optimized using data from 2,056 patients tested for PPGLs.Multivariate analyses, correcting for age and  surface area, indicated higher plasma and urinary metanephrine in males than females and sex differences in urinary normetanephrine and free methoxytyramine that largely reflected  size variation. There were positive associations of age with plasma metabolites, but negative relationships with urinary free metanephrine and methoxytyramine.

Significant between group differences were observed in norepinephrine (high fit: 3530.64 ± 2146.54 pmol · L-1, low fit: 4907.16 ± 3020.85 pmol · L-1) and NPY (high fit: 169.30 ± 85.89 pg · ml-1, low fit: 123.02 ± 88.86 pg · ml-1) concentrations at T3.This study revealed that despite significant increases in stress hormone concentrations in all subjects during SERE, fitter subjects exhibited differential hormonal responses during recovery, with quicker return of norepinephrine and NPY to baseline concentrations. This suggests physical fitness level may have a protective effect in recovery from periods of high stress military training.Szivak TK, Lee EC, Saenz C, Flanagan SD, Focht BC, Volek JS, Maresh CM, Kraemer WJ.

The rats were grouped as young control (YC 3 months old), old control (OC 15 months old), young diabetic (YD), old diabetic (OD), young control treated (YCT), old control treated (OCT), young diabetic treated (YDT), and old diabetic treated (ODT). Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection and subsequently SMe1EC2 (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered to YCT, OCT, YDT, and ODT rats for 5 months. In young and old rats, diabetes resulted in hypertension,  loss, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, which were partially prevented by SMe1EC2. SMe1EC2 also inhibited the diabetes-induced increase in aorta levels of AGEs (advanced glycosylation end-protein adducts), 4-HNE (4-hydroxy-nonenal-histidine), 3-NT (3-nitrotyrosine), and RAGEs (receptors for AGEs). The contractions of the aorta rings to phenylephrine (Phe) and KCL did not significantly change, but acetylcholine (ACh) and salbutamol relaxations were reduced in OC compared to YC rats. Diabetes induction increased Phe contractions in YC and OC rats, KCL contractions in YC rats, and did not cause further inhibition in already inhibited ACh and salbutamol relaxations in OC rats. We have achieved the lowest levels of ACh relaxation in YD rats compared to other groups. SMe1EC2 did not change the response of aorta to ACh, salbutamol and Phe in YC rats, and ameliorated ACh relaxations in OC and YD but not in OD rats. In YDT and ODT rats, increased Phe and KCL contractions, high blood pressure, and impaired salbutamol relaxations were amended by SMe1EC2. Phe contractions observed in YD and OD rats as well as KCl contractions observed in OC rats were the lowest levels when the rats were treated with SMe1EC2. When the bath solution was shifted to cyclopiazonic acid (CYP) or CYP plus Ca-free medium, the contraction induced by a single dose of Phe (3 × 10 M) was more inhibited in YD and OD than in YC but not in OC rats. In SMe1EC2-treated rats, neither the presence of CFM nor CFM plus CYP exhibited a significant change in response of aorta to a single dose of Phe. These findings suggest that α1-adrenergic receptor signaling is activated in both age groups of diabetic rats, diabetes activates K-depolarization and calcium mobilization via Ca especially in the aorta of young rats, and sensitizes the aorta of old rats to the regulating effect of SMe1EC2. ACh relaxations were inhibited in YC rats, increased in OC rats and unchanged in YD and OD rats when aortic rings pretreated with TEA, an inhibitor of calcium-activated K channels (K), or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), an inhibitor of voltage-sensitive K channels (K). ACh relaxations were inhibited in YCT, OCT, and YDT rats in the presence of 4-AP or TEA. In ODT rats, 4-AP did not change ACh relaxation but TEA inhibited. These findings suggest that the contribution of K and K to ACh relaxation is likely upregulated by SMe1EC2 when the relaxations were inhibited by aging or diabetes. We conclude that SMe1EC2 might be a promising agent for aging and diabetes related vascular disorders.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30014712>Effects of feeding diets containing essential oils and betaine to heat-stressed growing-finishing pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was to evaluate the effects of dietary essential oils (EO) and betaine on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and serum hormones in growing-finishing pigs under heat stress conditions.

Here we establish age-specific continuous reference intervals for catecholamine O-methylated metabolites in children evaluated for catecholamine producing tumors, particularly younger children with suspected neuroblastoma.Plasma concentrations of 3-methoxytyramine, normetanephrine, metanephrine, and 3-O-methyldopa were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 533 children aged 2 days to 18 years.Concentrations of plasma free normetanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine and 3-O-methyldopa were higher in neonates up until six months of age, but thereafter declined steeply to levels after one year that were <38% those of neonatal concentrations and to further lower concentrations in teenagers that were <23% those in neonates. In contrast, concentrations of plasma free metanephrine showed a reciprocal pattern with 50% lower concentrations in infants below one year compared to later in childhood.The dynamic reciprocal changes in plasma concentrations of normetanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine and 3-O-methyldopa compared to metanephrine during early childhood suggest underlying developmental changes in extra-adrenal and adrenal chromaffin tissue that must be considered for pediatric reference intervals, particularly in infants. With such reference intervals at hand, biochemical testing for catecholamine producing tumors in young children is substantially improved.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, epinephrine auto-injectors (EAI) were not available in a dose or platform designed for patients who weighed <15 kg, and, therefore, 0.15-mg EAIs were prescribed for these patients. Results of ultrasound studies indicate that currently marketed 0.15-mg EAIs have needle lengths that may strike bone in ∼29 to 43% of patients who weigh <15 kg and result in possible intraosseous injection.

This study was conducted with parents of children who were severely allergic so to evaluate simulated use of the 0.1-mg EAI by the intended user group. Fifteen participants were enrolled and received training on using the 0.1-mg EAI. Approximately 24 hours later, the participants completed a simulated emergency-use scenario by using the 0.1-mg EAI with an infant manikin.

Reduction in mortality and prevention of myocardial infarction are of utmost importance. Recently, there has been an increased interest globally to identify natural compounds that are pharmacologically potent and have low or no adverse effects for use in preventive medicine. Oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis play a significant role in the progression of myocardial infarction. The molecular mechanism on the antiapoptotic effects of zingerone in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats was evaluated. Rats were pretreated with zingerone (6mg/kg ) daily for 14 days and were then induced myocardial infarction with isoproterenol (100mg/kg ) on 15th and 16th day. Isoproterenol induced myocardial infarcted rats showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased heart oxidative stress markers and significantly (P < 0.05) decreased heart antioxidant systems. Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction study revealed altered myocardial expressions of B-cell lymphoma gene-2, B-cell lymphoma - extra large, B-cell lymphoma-2 associated-x, Bcl - 2 associated death promoter, Fas-receptor and caspases-8,-9 and- 3 genes in myocardial infarcted rats. Zingerone pretreatment revealed significant (P<0.05) preventive effects on all the above mentioned biochemical and molecular parameters evaluated in myocardial infarcted rats.

High-performance ion chromatography (HPIC) method with suppressed conductivity detection was used for this purpose. The HPIC analysis was performed with IonPac CS 14 column (250 x 4 mm) containing a macroporous weak cation-exchange stationary phase eluted with 10 mM methanesulfonic acid (MSA). Validation of the method confirmed its selectivity by achieving a satisfactory separation of alkyl- and alkanolamines and metal cations.

We also assessed the value of semiquantitative parameters in differentiating between parathyroid hyperplasia and adenoma.Both F-fluorocholine PET/CT and Tc-MIBI/tetrofosmin SPECT/CT were performed in 100 consecutive patients with biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. At least one abnormal focus on either F-fluorocholine or Tc-MIBI/tetrofosmin corresponding to a parathyroid gland or ectopic parathyroid tissue was considered as a positive finding. In 76 patients with positive findings on at least one imaging modality, surgical exploration was performed within 6 months, and the results were related to histopathological findings and clinical and laboratory findings at 3-6 months as the standard of truth. In 24 patients, no surgery was performed: in 18 patients with positive imaging findings surgery was refused or considered risky, and in 6 patients imaging was negative. Therefore, data from 82 patients (76 undergoing surgery, 6 without surgery) in whom the standard of truth criteria were met, were used in the final analysis.All patients showed biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism with a mean serum calcium level of 2.78 ± 0.34 mmol/l and parathormone (PTH) level of 196.5 ± 236.4 pg/ml. The study results in 76 patients with verified histopathology and 3 patients with negative imaging findings were analysed. Three of six patients with negative imaging showed normalized serum PTH and calcium levels on laboratory follow-up at 3 and 6 months, and the results were considered true negative. In a patient-based analysis, the detection rate with F-fluorocholine PET/CT was 93% (76/82), but was only 61% (50/82) with Tc-MIBI/tetrofosmin SPECT/CT. In a lesion-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and overall accuracy of F-fluorocholine PET/CT in the detection of parathyroid adenoma were 93.7%, 96.0%, 90.2%, 97.4% and 95.3%, respectively, and of Tc-MIBI/tetrofosmin SPECT/CT were 60.8%, 98.5%, 94.1%, 86.3% and 87.7%, respectively. Although F-fluorocholine PET-positive adenomatous lesions showed higher SUVmax values than the hyperplastic glands (6.80 ± 3.78 vs. 4.53 ± 0.40) in the semiquantitative analysis, the difference was not significant (p = 0.236).

As oxidative stress has previously been demonstrated to contribute to acute and chronic myocardial injury, we tested the effects of aucubin on cardiac remodelling and heart failure.Initially, H9c2 cardiomyocytes and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes pretreated with aucubin (1, 3, 10, 25 and 50 μM) were challenged with phenylephrine. Secondly, the transverse aorta was constricted in C57/B6 and neuronal NOS (nNOS)-knockout mice, then aucubin (1 or 5 mg·kg  day ) was injected i.p. for 25 days. Hypertrophy was evaluated by assessing morphological changes, echocardiographic parameters, histological analyses and hypertrophic markers. Oxidative stress was evaluated by examining ROS generation, oxidase activity and NO generation. NOS expression was determined by Western blotting.Aucubin effectively suppressed cardiac remodelling; in mice, aucubin substantially inhibited pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and inflammation, whereas knocking out nNOS abolished these cardioprotective effects of aucubin. Blocking or knocking down the β -adrenoceptor abolished the protective effects of aucubin in vitro. Furthermore, aucubin enhanced the protective effects of a β -adrenoceptor agonist in vitro by increasing cellular cAMP levels, whereas treatment with an adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibitor abolished the cardioprotective effects of aucubin.Aucubin suppresses oxidative stress during cardiac remodelling by increasing the expression of nNOS in a process that requires activation of the β -adrenoceptor/AC/cAMP pathway. These findings suggest that aucubin could have potential as a treatment for cardiac remodelling and heart failure.© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30731086>Syringic acid protects from isoproterenol induced cardiotoxicity in rats.</a></h2><p>Identification of pharmacologically potent antioxidant compounds for their use in preventive medicine is thrust area of current research.

SA was orally given to rats for 21 days at three different concentrations (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg). At 20th and 21st day, rats were subcutaneously injected with ISO and at the end of experimental period, rats were killed. ISO induced myocardial damage was averted by pre-co-treatment of SA, as decrease was found in serum level of marker enzymes (CKMB, LDH, AST, ALT), lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl (PC) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL 6). Furthermore, content of glutathione (GSH) and activities of antioxidant enzymes in heart tissue were significantly raised. Improvement in infarct size and erythrocyte (RBCs) morphology was also observed. The biochemical findings were supported by histopathological outcome and protective effect of SA was found to be dose dependent. The results of our study demonstrated that the cardioprotective potential of SA in rat model of ISO induced MI might be due to anti-lipid peroxidative and endogenous antioxidant system enhancement effects.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mean OEA, SEA, and PEA concentrations were lower in the high compared to the low WAZ group (all  < 0.02), and a higher concentration of SEA was associated with lower anthropometric , e.g., triceps skinfold thickness (mm) (β = -2.235, 95% CI = -4.04, -0.43,  = 0.016), and  gain per day since birth (g) (β = -8.169, 95% CI = -15.26, -1.08,  = 0.024). This raises the possibility, that the content of satiety factors OEA, SEA, and PEA in human milk may affect infant growth.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389139>Inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy by aromadendrin through down-regulating NFAT and MAPKs pathways.</a></h2><p>Cardiac hypertrophy is a maladaptive response to pressure overload and it's an important risk factor for heart failure and other adverse cardiovascular events. Aromadendrin (ARO) has remarkable anti-lipid peroxidation efficacy and is a potential therapeutic medicine for the management of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we established the cardiac hypertrophy cell model in rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (RNVMs) with phenylephrine. The cell model was characterized by the increased protein synthesis and cardiomyocyte size, which can be normalized by ARO treatment in both concentration- and time-dependent manner. In transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced cardiac hypertrophy model, ARO administration improved the impairment of cardiac function and alleviated the cardiac hypertrophy indicators, like ventricular mass/, myocyte cross-sectional area, and the expression of ANP, BNP and Myh7. ARO treatment also suppressed the cardiac fibrosis and the correlated fibrogenic genes. Our further investigation revealed ARO could down-regulate pressure overload-induced Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-HNE expression, restore the decrease of GSH/GSSG ratio, meanwhile prevent nuclear translocation of NFAT and the activation of MAPKs pathways. Collectively, ARO has a protective effect against experimental cardiac hypertrophy in mice, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic drug for pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The preventive effects of diosmin on cardiac mitochondrial oxidative stress in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats were evaluated. Rats were pretreated with diosmin (10 mg/kg ) daily for 10 days. Myocardial infarction was induced in rats by isoproterenol (100 mg/kg ) injection twice at an interval of 24 h (on 11th and 12th day). Isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarcted rats showed a significant increase in the levels of cardiac diagnostic markers, heart mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, calcium ion, and a significant decrease in the levels of heart mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, isocitrate, malate, α-ketoglutarate, and succinate dehydrogenases. Transmission electron microscopic findings revealed damaged mitochondria with loss of cristae, swelling, and vacuolation in isoproterenol-induced rats' heart. Diosmin pretreatment showed significant preventive effects on all the biochemical parameters, and the structure of mitochondria was evaluated. Furthermore, the transmission electron microscopic study confirms the biochemical findings. The antioxidant and negative inotropic effects of diosmin inhibited cardiac mitochondrial oxidative stress and prevented mitochondrial damage in myocardial infarcted rats.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29571021>Linalyl acetate prevents olmesartan-induced intestinal hypermotility mediated by interference of the sympathetic inhibitory pathway in hypertensive rat.</a></h2><p>Olmesartan-associated enteropathy (OAE) is a life-threatening pathological condition, but its underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Although intestinal hypermotility is frequently accompanied by chronic diarrhea, there have been no studies of olmesartan-induced hypermotility. Intestinal motility should be well regulated by the enteric nervous system, but degeneration of enteric neurons has been reported in patients with chronic diarrheal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, suggesting a connection between OAE and intestinal hypermotility. In this study, interference with this inhibitory pathway was analyzed in a model of olmesartan-induced intestinal hypermotility (OIH) in rats with nicotine-induced hypertension exposed to chronic immobilizing stress. The effects of the potent inhibitory neurotransmitters norepinephrine (NE) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which act via different pathways, were assessed ex vivo, with only NE-modulated frequency and amplitude of spontaneous contractions found to be elevated in OIH rat jejunum. Clinical symptoms frequent in OAE, including atrophy of the intestinal epithelium and  loss, were observed in these rats. Interestingly, olmesartan significantly elevated heart rate while lowering blood pressure in OIH rats. These abnormal conditions were prevented by adding linalyl acetate (LA), while the blood pressure-lowering effects of olmesartan were maintained. These findings suggest that olmesartan induces intestinal hypermotility by interfering with the sympathetic inhibitory pathway, and reduces epithelial cell size or  in hypertensive rats. As LA prevented these effects, combination treatment with olmesartan plus LA may provide better antihypertensive efficacy without inducing OAE.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Except for the normal group, rats of other groups were injected back subcutaneously with ISO(5 mg·kg⁻¹) for 10 consecutive days. At the same time, preventive administration groups began to give different doses of the sample for 30 days and model group began to give normal saline. Left ventricular systolic pressure(LVSP) was measured in each group by common carotid artery cannulation, and the left ventricle(LW)/tibia length, heart  index(HWI) and myocardial hydroxyproline(Hydro) content were calculated. Myocardial tissue HE staining and Masson staining were used to observe the myocardial structure and the degree of myocardial fibrosis respectively. Atrial natriuretic peptide(ANP), brain natriuretic peptide(BNP), and cardiac troponin I(cTN-I) concentration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The results showed that as compared with the normal group, the levels of ANP, BNP and cTN-I in plasma were significantly increased in ISO-induced hypertrophic rats; as compared with the model group, D. candidumcan inhibit ISO-induced ventricular pressure and ventricular hypertrophy, reduce myocardial collagen synthesis, improve myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling, and significantly down-regulate ANP, BNP and cTN-I levels in plasma.

Hence, the aim of this study was to describe alterations in and show potential correlations between the structural characteristics and the molecular and biochemical markers of cardiac remodelling on a model of isoproterenol-induced heart failure. Two groups of 3-month-old male Wistar rats (n = 8 per group) were sacrificed after four weeks of treatment: control (placebo), ISO (5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally). Chronic ISO treatment led to heart failure (HF) characterized by significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) accompanied by an increase in left ventricular  (LVW) along with increased collagen content in the LV. The collagen content correlated negatively with SBP (R = -0.776, P < 0.001) and positively with LVW (R = 0.796, P < 0.001), with Col1a1 (0.83; P < 0.001) and Acta2 (0.73; P < 0.01). Moreover, the mRNA expression of fibrotic remodelling indicator, i.e. TGF-β1 tended to increase, while the level of fibrinolysis markers (MCP-1, TIMP-2, MMP) were unchanged. The plasma markers of collagen, procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP) was 37.34 ± 7.10 pg/mL in control and was reduced by 42% (P < 0.05) in the ISO group and procollagen III N-terminal propeptide (PIIINP) was 1216.7 ± 191.0 pg/mL in control and was decreased by 66% (P < 0.05) in the ISO group. Surprisingly, there was no positive correlation between plasma markers of collagen, i.e. PICP and PIIINP and collagen content or molecular markers of collagen. However, both PICP and PIIINP correlated with BW (R = 0.712, resp. 0.803, P < 0.001), which was significantly reduced (by 25%, P < 0.05) in the ISO group. In conclusion, we assume that the collagen content of the left ventricle does not need unavoidably correlate with plasma markers of collagen, which might be affected by confounding factors in heart failure, such as loss of , presumably associated with a catabolic condition.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662579>Errors in Aerosol Inhaler Use and Their Effects on Maternal and Fetal Outcomes among Pregnant Asthmatic Women (Subanalysis from QAKCOP Study).</a></h2><p>Data on inhaler technique and its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes during pregnancy are seldom reported. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate inhaler technique and identify errors in inhaler use among pregnant women with asthma. Secondary objectives were to identify factors associated with poor inhaler technique and study the association between inhaler technique and maternal and fetal outcomes. This was a cross-sectional, face-to-face, prospective study of 80 pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma. Seventy-three and 41 asthmatic pregnant women reported using pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), respectively. Overall, wrong inhaler technique was observed in 47 (64.4%) subjects. Among pMDI users, correct inhaler use was observed in only 26/73 (35.6%) of the patients, with lack of coordination between inhalation and generation of the aerosol and failure to breathe out gently before using the inhaler, being the most common errors. Among DPI users, 21 (51.2%) demonstrated correct inhaler use, with failure to perform a breath-hold for 10 seconds after inhaling the powder and to exhale gently before using the inhaler being the most common errors. Significant associations between inhaler technique and patient's understanding of asthma medications and the kind of follow-up clinic (respiratory versus nonrespiratory clinic) were found. No significant associations between inhaler technique and various maternal and fetal outcomes or asthma control were found. In conclusion, improper inhalation technique is significantly prevalent in pregnant asthmatic women, particularly among those being followed in nonspecialized respiratory clinics. The lack of significant association between the inhaler technique and asthma control (and hence maternal and fetal outcomes) may simply reflect the high prevalence of uncontrolled asthma and significant contribution of other barriers to poor asthma control in the current patient's cohort.

ISP was administered subcutaneously for two subsequent days to induce myocardial injury. Assessment of myocardial injury was done by estimation of hemodynamic functions, myocardial infarcted area, cardiac injury markers, lipid profile, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and histopathology of heart and liver. Rats pretreated with kaempferol showed reduction in the myocardial infarcted area and heart rate. However, no improvement was observed in change in , mean arterial, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Kaempferol showed significant decrease in serum LDH, CK-MB, troponin-I and lipid profile. However, highest dose of kaempferol did not reduce the serum triglyceride level. Further, antioxidant enzymes, SOD and catalase, were also higher. However, reduced glutathione, serum SGOT and creatinine did not show any improvement. Kaempferol showed reduction in MDA level. Kaempferol at highest dose showed reduction in pro-MMP-2 expression and MMP-9 level. mRNA expression level of TNF-α was not different in kaempferol-pretreated myocardial injured rats with ISP-alone group. Pretreatment with kaempferol at highest dose showed mild mononuclear infiltration and degenerative changes in heart tissue section of myocardial injured rats. Rats pretreated with kaempferol at higher concentration showed normal cordlike arrangement of hepatocytes with moderate swelling of hepatocytes (vacuolar degeneration) around the central vein.

Extracts of the bitter orange and other preparations containing p-synephrine have been used worldwide to promote  loss and for sports performance. The purpose of the study was to measure the action of p-synephrine on hepatic enzyme activities linked to carbohydrate and energy metabolism and the levels of adenine mononucleotides. Enzymes and adenine mononucleotides were measured in the isolated perfused rat liver and in vivo after oral administration of the drug (50 and 300 mg/kg) by using standard techniques. p-Synephrine increased the activity of glycogen phosphorylase in vivo and in the perfused liver. It decreased, however, the activities of pyruvate kinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase also in vivo and in the perfused liver. p-Synephrine increased the hepatic pools of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate. Stimulation of glycogen phosphorylase is consistent with the reported increased glycogenolysis in the perfused liver and increased glycemia in rats. The decrease in the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity indicates that p-synephrine is potentially capable of inhibiting the transformation of carbohydrates into lipids. The capability of increasing the adenosine triphosphate-adenosine diphosphate pool indicates a beneficial effect of p-synephrine on the cellular energetics.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30105550>Cardioprotective role of FA against isoproterenol induced cardiac toxicity.</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to investigate the protective effect of ferulic acid (FA) against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac toxicity in rats.

To facilitate delivery, siRNAs are often enclosed in nanoparticles (NPs). However, upon endocytosis such NPs are mainly trafficked towards lysosomes. To avoid degradation, cytosolic release of siRNA should occur prior to fusion of endosomes with lysosomes, but current endosomal escape strategies remain inefficient. In contrast to this paradigm, we aim to exploit lysosomal accumulation by treating NP-transfected cells with low molecular  drugs that release the siRNA from the lysosomes into the cytosol. We show that FDA-approved cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) significantly improved gene silencing by siRNA-loaded nanogels in cancer cells through simple sequential incubation. CADs induced lysosomal phospholipidosis, leading to transient lysosomal membrane permeabilization and improved siRNA release without cytotoxicity. Of note, the lysosomes could be applied as an intracellular depot for triggered siRNA release by multiple CAD treatments.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, macroscopic haemoglobinuria (MH) and subsequent renal impairment are severe complications after sclerotherapy using EO. The present study aimed to clarify the MH risk factors for better peri-operative management of venous malformations.Data collected during 130 procedures involving 94 patients who were undergoing sclerotherapy using EO for venous malformation were retrospectively analysed. Pre-operative and operative variables, including sex, age, pre-operative  mass index, location, depth, type of lesion, size, number of procedures, type of drainage vein, ratio of sclerosant to air, and injected total dose of 5% EO per  (BW), were examined. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to determine the possible risk factors for MH.Following sclerotherapy, MH occurred in 27.7% of patients, but no patient developed post-operative renal impairment because of aggressive hydration and haptoglobin administration. On univariable analysis, diffuse lesion, lesion size ≥50 cm, and total injected dose of 5% EO ≥ 0.18 mL/kg were found to be the MH risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified a total injected dose of 5% EO ≥ 0.18 mL/kg as the significant independent factor contributing to MH risk.Macroscopic haemoglobinuria is a reversible complication if immediate and appropriate interventions with aggressive hydration and haptoglobin administration are performed; therefore, it should be closely monitored following sclerotherapy, especially when using 5% EO ≥ 0.18 mL/kg.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

Choline participates in fatty acid metabolism, serves as a methyl donor and influences growth signaling, which may modify placental macronutrient homeostasis and affect fetal growth. Using a mouse model of maternal obesity, we assessed the effect of maternal choline supplementation on preventing fetal overgrowth and restoring placental macronutrient homeostasis. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a high-fat (HF, 60% kcal from fat) diet or a normal (NF, 10% kcal from fat) diet with a drinking supply of either 25 mM choline chloride or control purified water, respectively, beginning 4 weeks prior to mating until gestational day 12.5. Fetal and placental , metabolites and gene expression were measured. HF feeding significantly (P<.05) increased placental and fetal  in the HF-control (HFCO) versus NF-control (NFCO) animals, whereas the HF choline-supplemented (HFCS) group effectively normalized placental and fetal  to the levels of the NFCO group. Compared to HFCO, the HFCS group had lower (P<.05) glucose transporter 1 and fatty acid transport protein 1 expression as well as lower accumulation of glycogen in the placenta. The HFCS group also had lower (P<.05) placental 4E-binding protein 1 and ribosomal protein s6 phosphorylation, which are indicators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activation favoring macronutrient anabolism.

Five groups of rabbits were designed as control, HS, HS + MOE, HS + Vit C, and HS + NaHCO. HS groups were exposed to high temperatures, while treatments were given in drinking water for 6 weeks. Levels of blood cortisol, leptin, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 were assayed using ELISA, while adrenaline was assayed calorimetrically. Expression of HSP70, FOXP3, T cell receptor (TCR) γ, and δ mRNA was tested using real-time (RT)-PCR, while HSP70 protein expression was tested using western blotting in liver and kidney tissues. Infiltration of regulatory T cells (Treg; CD25) and NK (CD56) cells were tested using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The levels of liver enzymes (ALT & AST), urea, and creatinine were assayed calorimetrically, while  gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated.

Here we provide evidence for the usefulness of a Drosophila larva model to investigate genetic influence on vulnerability to sugar overconsumption. Using genetic and RNA interference approaches, we show that the activity of the Oamb gene, which encodes a receptor for octopamine (OA, the invertebrate homologue of norepinephrine), plays a major role in controlled sugar consumption. Furthermore, Oamb appears to suppress sugar food intake in fed larvae in an acute manner, and neurons expressing this Oamb receptor do not overlap with neurons expressing Octβ3R, another OA receptor previously implicated in hunger-driven exuberant sugar intake. Together, these results suggest that two separate sub-circuits, defined by Oamb and Octβ3R respectively, co-regulate sugar consumption according to changes in energy needs. We propose that the noradrenergic-like system defines an ancient regulatory mechanism for prevention of sugar overload.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536965>The convenient use of fluorescamine for spectrofluorimetric determination of midodrine hydrochloride in pure form and its tablets formulation: Application to content uniformity testing.</a></h2><p>A novel sensitive and simple spectrofluorimetric method was developed then validated for determination of midodrine in both its authentic pure form and its tablets. This method is based on the reaction between midodrine's aliphatic primary amine moiety with fluorescamine reagent, using borate buffer at pH 7.8 and yielding a highly fluorescent product whose fluorescence intensity was measured at 462 nm after excitation at 388 nm. This method represents the first attempt for determination of midodrine spectrofluorimetrically. A calibration curve was constructed showing that the linear range was 0.2-3.0 μg/ml. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation values were 0.06 and 0.19 μg/ml respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) and the determination coefficient (r ) values were 0.9992 and 0.9984 respectively. The proposed method was validated according to ICH guidelines and successfully applied for determination of midodrine in its tablets with an overall % recovery of 99.56 ± 0.95.

In addition, the current study was designed to bring information regarding the mechanisms underlying the participation of Ca2+ handling and b-adrenergic system.Sixty-day-old male SHR rats were submitted to food ad libitum (C), 50% food restriction (R50) or RF cycles for 90 days. Cardiac remodeling was assessed by ultrastructure analysis and isolated papillary muscle function. The level of significance considered was 5% (a = 0.05).The RF rats presented lower cardiac atrophy than R50 in relation to C rats. The C rats increased  gain, R50 maintained their initial  and RF rats increased and decreased  during RF. The RF did not cause functional impairment because the isotonic and isometric parameters showed similar behavior to those of C. The isotonic and isometric cardiac parameters were significantly elevated in RF rats compared to R50 rats. In addition, the R50 rats had cardiac damage in relation to C for isotonic and isometric variables. While the R50 rats showed focal changes in many muscle fibers, the RF rats displayed mild alterations, such as loss or disorganization of myofibrils.Fasting/refeeding promotes cardiac beneficial effects and attenuates myocardial injury caused by caloric restriction in SHR rats, contributing to reduce the cardiovascular risk profile and morphological injuries.

We compared the incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) in obese patients who received a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion vs those who received bolus dosing for the treatment of spinal-induced hypotension.In this multicentre, double-blinded randomized controlled trial, 160 obese women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion initiated at 50 μg·min (and titrated according to a predefined algorithm) or 100 μg phenylephrine boluses to treat hypotension. Maternal systolic blood pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline. The primary study outcome was the incidence of IONV.Intraoperative nausea and vomiting were significantly reduced in the infusion group compared to the bolus group (46% vs 75%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.80; P < 0.001).

In the present study, we explored whether AdipoRon attenuates isoprenaline (ISO) or l-thyroxine-induced cardiac hypertrophy in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and whether the anti-hypertrophy effect is mediated by AMPK-related pathway. Here, cardiac hypertrophy was induced by injection of l-thyroxine or ISO in SD rats. In the treatment group, AdipoRon was co-administered. We examined the effects of AdipoRon on cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophy signaling pathway. The  of SD rats was recorded every day. Rats were killed for collection of blood and heart under anesthesia. The left heart  and heart  were weighed. Paraffin-embedded heart tissue regions (4 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson to detect left heart hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. The serum BNP levels were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of ANP, BNP, PGC-1α, and ERRα were evaluated by real-time PCR analysis. The protein expression levels of PGC-1α, ERRα, and pAMPK/AMPK were determined by western blot analysis. The results showed that AdipoRon significantly reversed heart  (HW)/ (BW) ratio, left ventricular (LV)/BW ratio, serum BNP level and the mRNA level of ANP and BNP induced by ISO or l-thyroxine. ISO or l-thyroxine reduced both the mRNA level and protein level of ERRα and PGC-1α, and also reduced the protein level of pAMPK/AMPK. However, AdipoRon reversed ISO or l-thyroxine-induced changes of pAMPK/AMPK, ERRα, and PGC-1α.

At the end of the treatment, food and water intake, urine output and  gain were evaluated and renal function studies were performed. Renal tissue was used for the morphological, quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical studies.ISO did not change metabolic parameters or urine output. However it induced a decrease in renal blood flow and an increase in the filtration fraction. These changes were accompanied by increased cortical mRNA and protein expression for the renal oxidative stress components including Nox 4 and p22phox; ER stress, pro-inflamatory, pro-apoptotic as well as RAS components. ISO also induced a significant increase in medullar renin protein expression.These findings support relevant information regarding the contribution of specific β-adrenergic hyperactivity in early stage of renal injury, indicating the reactive oxygen species, ER stress and intrarenal RAS as important factors in this process.© 2017 The Author(s).

Endothelial activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has protective effects in diabetes.Mice with constitutive endothelial activation of AMPK (CA-AMPK) were given a high fat diet to induce obesity or kept on standard chow as lean controls for up to 2 years. A subset of obese animals was changed to standard chow after 30 weeks of high fat feeding. En-dothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent responses were examined by isometric tension recording.Endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO)- and apamin plus charybdotoxin-sensitive relaxations were preserved and similar between aortic or renal arterial preparations of lean and obese CA-AMPK mice and their wild-type littermates. Despite comparable release of vasoconstrictor prostanoids, cyclooxygenase-dependent contractions were enhanced during NO synthase inhibition in carotid arterial rings of obese CA-AMPK mice. Contractions to the α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine were augmented in renal arteries of obese animals, a genotype-independent phenomenon reversible by  loss. These data indicate a higher α1-adrenergic reactivity in renal arteries of aged mice with obesity. The current results highlight the potential of  loss to alleviate vascular dysfunction.

The aim of this study was to investigate the response to glucagon, adrenergic agonists (α and β) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) on glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis in liver perfusion of Walker-256 tumor-bearing rats with advanced cachexia. Liver ATP content was also investigated. Rats without tumor (healthy) were used as controls. Agonists α (phenylephrine) and β (isoproterenol) adrenergic, instead of adrenaline, and cAMP, the second messenger of glucagon and isoproterenol, were used in an attempt to identify mechanisms involved in the responses. Glucagon (1 nM) stimulated glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibited glycolysis in the liver of healthy and tumor-bearing rats, but their effects were lower in tumor-bearing rats. Isoproterenol (20 µM) stimulated glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis in healthy rats and had virtually no effect in tumor-bearing rats. cAMP (9 µM) also stimulated glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibited glycolysis in healthy rats but had practically no effect in tumor-bearing rats. Phenylephrine (2 µM) stimulated glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibited glycolysis and these effects were also lower in tumor-bearing rats than in healthy. Liver ATP content was lower in tumor-bearing rats. In conclusion, tumor-bearing rats with advanced cachexia showed a decreased hepatic response to glucagon, adrenergic agonists (α and β), and cAMP in glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis, which may be due to a reduced rate of regulatory enzyme phosphorylation caused by the low ATP levels in the liver.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30055775>PEMT rs12325817 and PCYT1A rs7639752 polymorphisms are associated with betaine but not choline concentrations in pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Maternal metabolism during gestation may depend on nutrient intake but also on polymorphism of genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolism of different nutrients.

Raspberry ketone (RK) is a red raspberry (Rubusidaeus, Family-Rosaceae) plant constituent, which activates PPAR-α. This study was conducted to assess the cardioprotective action of RK against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiotoxicity. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (six rats/group). Rats were orally administered with RK (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) and fenofibrate (standard, 80 mg/kg) for 28 days and ISO was administered (85 mg/kg, subcutaneously) on 27th and 28th day. Administration of ISO in rats significantly altered hemodynamic and electrocardiogram patterns, total antioxidant capacity, PPAR-α, and apolipoprotein C-III levels. These myocardial aberrations were further confirmed during infarct size, heart  to  ratio and immunohistochemical assessments (caspase-3 and nuclear factor-κB). RK pretreatment (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly protected rats against oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia caused by ISO as demonstrated by change in hemodynamic, biochemical and histological parameters. The results so obtained were quite comparable with fenofibrate. Moreover, RK was found to have binding affinity with PPAR-α, as confirmed by docking analysis. PPAR-α expression and concentration was also found increased in presence of RK which gave impression that RK probably showed cardioprotection via PPAR-α activation, however direct binding study of RK with PPAR-α is needed to confirm this assumption.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The current study evaluated the effects of a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin (Apo), on the production of reactive oxygen species and the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy under sustained β-adrenergic stimulation in male Wistar rats. As evident from the HW/BW ratio, HW/TL ratio, echocardiography, and histopathology, hypertrophic responses induced by isoproterenol (Iso; 5 mg/Kg , subcutaneous) were blocked by Apo (10 mg/Kg , intraperitoneal). Iso treatment increased the transcript levels of cybb and p22-phox, the two subunits of Nox. Iso treatment also caused a decrease in reduced glutathione level that was restored by Apo. Increase in mRNA levels of a number of markers of hypertrophy, viz., ANP, BNP, β-MHC, and ACTA-1 by Iso was either partially or completely prevented by Apo. Activation of key signaling kinases such as PKA, Erk, and Akt by Iso was also prevented by Apo treatment.

Dysregulation of these systems contributes to stress-related diseases such as human obesity, but their interrelation remains unclear. The study was aimed to test for the first time in vivo whether central noradrenergic activity quantitatively indexed by the availability of the presynaptic NA transporter (NAT) is associated with HPA axis responsiveness as measured with the combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin releasing hormone stimulation (dex/CRH) test and copeptin as a surrogate marker of the serum AVP tone in highly obese, otherwise, healthy individuals compared to age- and sex-matched non-obese, healthy controls. In order to assess central NAT availability, positron emission tomography (PET) was applied using the NAT-selective radiotracer S,S-[C]O-methylreboxetine (MRB) and correlated with curve indicators derived from the dex/CRH test (maximum, MAX, and area under the curve, AUC, for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) as well as with copeptin. In non-obese controls, positive correlations were found between the NAT distribution volume ratios (DVR) of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala with the HPA response (OFC: ACTH r = 0.87, p = .001; cortisol r = 0.86, p = .002; amygdala: ACTH r = 0.86, p = .002; cortisol r = 0.79, p = .006), while in obesity, the hypothalamic DVR correlated inversely with the HPA axis response (cortisol, r = -0.66, p = .04) and with copeptin (r = -0.71, p = .02). This association of central NAT availability with HPA axis responsiveness and copeptin suggests a mechanistic interaction between noradrenergic transmission with HPA axis activity and the serum AVP system that differs between non-obese individuals with prefrontal-limbic involvement and obesity with a hypothalamic-centered relationship.

In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the   of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the  of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole- insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol.

A normative range was derived using the 95% prediction interval for the geometric mean OUFCC, calculated from run-in and washout periods.Twenty-six children contributed 41 OUFCC values. The geometric mean OUFCC was 9.0 nmol/mmol (95% PI: 3.6, 22.7 nmol/mmol).The OUFCC preliminary normative range was 3.6 to 22.7 nmol/mmol in Tanner stage one children. A larger study in healthy children is warranted to confirm these findings and to assess potential differences in OUFCC across developmental stages and age groups, and by gender and race.2013-004719-32, CLINICALTRIALS..</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28971642>Increased CD11b+ cells and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha levels during cardiomyopathy induced by chronic adrenergic activation.</a></h2><p>Systemic CD11b+ cells have been associated with several cardiac diseases, such as chronic heart failure.To assess the levels of circulating CD11b+ cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in cardiomyopathy induced by chronic adrenergic stimulation.Male Lewis rats were injected with low doses of isoproterenol (isoprel) for 3 months. Cardiac parameters were tested by echocardiography. The percentage of CD11b+ cells was tested by flow cytometry. The levels of inflammatory cytokines in the sera were determined by an inflammation array, and the expression levels of cardiac interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reactions. Cardiac fibrosis and inflammation were determined by histological analysis.Chronic isoprel administration resulted in increased heart rate, cardiac hypertrophy, elevated cardiac peri-vascular fibrosis, reduced fractional shortening, and increased heart  per  ratio compared to control animals. This clinical presentation was associated with accumulation of CD11b+ cells in the spleen with no concomitant cardiac inflammation. Cardiac dysfunction was also associated with elevated sera levels of IL-1 alpha and over expression of cardiac IL-1 receptor type 2.CD11b+ systemic levels and IL-1 signaling are associated with cardiomyopathy induced by chronic adrenergic stimulation. Further studies are needed to define the role of systemic immunomodulation in this cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109047>Bioavailability and Cardiovascular Effects of Adrenaline Administered by Anapen Autoinjector in Healthy Volunteers.</a></h2><p>The administration of adrenaline is a life-saving intervention for anaphylactic reactions. However, it has been questioned whether the needle length of the autoinjectors is sufficient to achieve genuine intramuscular delivery and optimal bioavailability.To assess the adequacy of Anapen, which has a relatively short needle length (10.5 mm), through a comparison of the depot localization, plasma pharmacokinetics, and cardiovascular responses of adrenaline delivered via Anapen versus a prefilled syringe with a 25.4-mm needle, which is generally used for intramuscular injections.This randomized, open-label, crossover study compared the impact of adrenaline administration at 2 sites in the thigh of 18 normal  male volunteers, using either Anapen or the prefilled syringe; in addition, we studied the treatment of 12 overweight women with Anapen. The depot depth was measured by ultrasonography, plasma adrenaline level was evaluated by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and heart rates were measured using a Holter monitor.Intramuscular injections were given with both devices at both thigh sites in nonobese men, but not in overweight women. Adrenaline levels showed a double peak, with parallel changes in the heart rate. The first peak, of potential vital importance in anaphylaxis treatment, occurred at approximately 10 minutes postinjection, with maximum concentration and area under the curve significantly higher with Anapen than with prefilled syringes; the magnitude of the second peak did not differ among the various conditions. Unexpectedly, in overweight women treated with Anapen, the magnitude of the first peak was similar to that observed in men, despite the injection being subcutaneous, and the overall bioavailability was enhanced.Needle length and intramuscular injection are not absolute requirements for autoinjector efficacy, but the monitoring of injection location, biphasic adrenaline levels, and cardiovascular responses is important for the assessment of their therapeutic relevance in anaphylaxis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Beta-adrenoceptors attenuate muscle wasting. We hypothesized that specific muscle atrophy signaling pathways and altered metabolism may be attenuated in cancer cachectic animals receiving treatment with the beta agonist formoterol. In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of tumor-bearing rats (intraperitoneal inoculum, 10 AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells, 7-day study period) with and without treatment with formoterol (0.3 mg/kg /day/7days, subcutaneous), atrophy signaling pathways (NF-κB, MAPK, FoxO), proteolytic markers (ligases, proteasome, ubiquitination), autophagy markers (p62, beclin-1, LC3), myostatin, apoptosis, muscle metabolism markers, and muscle structure features were analyzed (immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry). In diaphragm and gastrocnemius of cancer cachectic rats, fiber sizes were reduced, levels of structural alterations, atrophy signaling pathways, proteasome content, protein ubiquitination, autophagy, and myostatin were increased, while those of regenerative and metabolic markers (myoD, mTOR, AKT, and PGC-1alpha) were decreased. Formoterol treatment attenuated such alterations in both muscles. Muscle wasting in this rat model of cancer-induced cachexia was characterized by induction of significant structural alterations, atrophy signaling pathways, proteasome activity, apoptotic and autophagy markers, and myostatin, along with a significant decline in the expression of muscle regenerative and metabolic markers. Treatment of the cachectic rats with formoterol partly attenuated the structural alterations and atrophy signaling, while improving other molecular perturbations similarly in both respiratory and limb muscles. The results reported in this study have relevant therapeutic implications as they showed beneficial effects of the beta agonist formoterol in the cachectic muscles through several key biological pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The myofibroblasts are characterized by immunoexpressions of vimentin, desmin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in varying degrees. The cellular characteristics remain investigated in myocardial fibrosis. We analyzed immunophenotypes of myofibroblasts appearing in isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis in rats until 28 days after injection (10 mg/kg ); the lesions developed as interstitial edema and inflammatory cell reaction on 8 hr and days 1 and 3, and fibrosis occurred on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 by gradual deposition of collagens, showing the greatest grade on day 14; the lesions gradually reduced with sporadic scar until day 28. Myofibroblasts expressing vimentin and α-SMA increased with a peak on day 3, and then, gradually decreased onwards. Interestingly, Thy-1 expressing cells appeared in the affected areas, apparently being corresponding to the grade similar to vimentin- and α-SMA-positive cells. Thy-1 is expressed in immature mesenchymal cells such as pericytes with pluripotent nature. The immunoreactivity for A3-antigen, a marker for immature mesenchymal cells, was seen in some surrounding cells. There were no cells reacting with antibodies to nestin or glial fibrillary acidic protein, although hepatic myofibroblats have been reported to react with these antibodies.

In this paper, the dissolution of wool fiber and the regeneration of wool keratin in the deep eutectic solvent (DES) of choline chloride-urea was detailed studied. The results showed that 35.1 mg wool completely dissolved in 1 g DES at 130 °C in 5 h. The polarizing microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images along with the amino acid analysis suggested that the DES mainly dissolved the wool cortex layer. Compared with the raw wool, the regenerated wool keratin contained much more fragments of low molecular  polypeptide chains from SDS-PAGE results. And the percentage of α-helix dramatically decreased, while the content of β-sheet and disordered structure increased. All the results indicated that the DES can be used as a kind of green solvent for the regeneration of wool keratin without losing the long peptide chains. The method also offered a possibility of large-scale for wasted wool reuse.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have reported negative effects of LAN on health and behavior in humans and nonhuman animals. Exposure of non-diabetic mice to dim LAN impairs glucose tolerance, whereas a return to dark nights (LD) reverses this impairment. We predicted that exposure to LAN would exacerbate the metabolic abnormalities in TALLYHO/JngJ (TH) mice, a polygenic model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).We exposed 7-week old male TH mice to either LD or LAN for 8-10 weeks in two separate experiments. After 8 weeks of light treatment, we conducted intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing (ipGTT) followed by intraperitoneal insulin tolerance testing (ipITT). In Experiment 1, all mice were returned to LD for 4 weeks, and ipITT was repeated.The major results of this study are i) LAN exposure for 8 weeks exacerbates glucose intolerance and insulin resistance ii) the effects of LAN on insulin resistance are reversed upon return to LD, iii) LAN exposure results in a greater increase in  compared to LD exposure, iv) LAN increases the incidence of mice developing overt T2DM, and v) LAN exposure decreases survival of mice with T2DM.In conclusion, LAN exacerbated metabolic abnormalities in a polygenic mouse model of T2DM, and these effects were reversed upon return to dark nights. The applicability of these findings to humans with T2DM needs to be determined.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Inconsistencies in the association of plasma N-acylethanolamines with human obesity and cardiometabolic risk have emerged among previous studies, possibly caused by heterogeneous cohorts and designs, and by unstandardized N-acylethanolamine measurements. We aimed to characterize changes in the plasma profile, including N-acylethanolamine levels and ratios associated with obesity, menopause in women, and ageing in men, and to define the significance of such a profile as a biomarker for metabolic imbalance.Adult, drug-free women (n = 103 premenopausal and n = 81 menopausal) and men (n = 144) were stratified according to the  mass index (BMI) into normal  (NW; BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (OW; BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m), and obese (OB; BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined. Validated blood processing and analytical procedures for N-acylethanolamine measurements were used. We investigated the effect of BMI and menopause in women, and BMI and age in men, as well as the BMI-independent influence of metabolic parameters on the N-acylethanolamine profile.BMI and waist circumference directly associated with AEA in women and men, and with PEA in premenopausal women and in men, while BMI directly associated with OEA in premenopausal women and in men. BMI, in both genders, and waist circumference, in women only, inversely associated with PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA. Menopause increased N-acylethanolamine levels, whereas ageing resulted in increasing OEA relative abundance in men. AEA and OEA abundances in premenopausal, and PEA and OEA abundances in lean menopausal women, were directly associated with hypertension. Conversely, PEA and OEA abundances lowered with hypertension in elderly men. Insulin resistance was associated with changes in N-acylethanolamine ratios specific for premenopausal (reduced PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA), menopausal (reduced OEA/AEA) women and men (reduced OEA/AEA and OEA/PEA). PEA and OEA levels increased with total cholesterol, and OEA abundance specifically increased with HDL-cholesterol. Elevated triglyceride levels were associated with increased N-acylethanolamine levels only in menopausal women.Obesity-related N-acylethanolamine hypertone is characterized by imbalanced N-acylethanolamine ratios. The profile given by a combination of N-acylethanolamine absolute levels and ratios enables imbalances to be identified in relationship with different metabolic parameters, with specific relevance according to gender, menopause and age, representing a useful means for monitoring metabolic health. Finally, N-acylethanolamine system appears a promising target for intervention strategies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Here, we show that the anti-tumor immune response can be modulated by the brain's reward system, a key circuitry in emotional processes. Activation of the reward system in tumor-bearing mice (Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and B16 melanoma) using chemogenetics (DREADDs), resulted in reduced tumor . This effect was mediated via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), manifested by an attenuated noradrenergic input to a major immunological site, the bone marrow. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which develop in the bone marrow, became less immunosuppressive following reward system activation. By depleting or adoptively transferring the MDSCs, we demonstrated that these cells are both necessary and sufficient to mediate reward system effects on tumor growth. Given the central role of the reward system in positive emotions, these findings introduce a physiological mechanism whereby the patient's psychological state can impact anti-tumor immunity and cancer progression.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29115861>Postnatal overnutrition affects metabolic and vascular function reflected by physiological and histological changes in the aorta of adult Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>Rigorous nutritional care during early life leads to healthy adulthood. Cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, the most prevalent clinical challenges worldwide, are epidemiologically linked to poor nutritional habits throughout life. We aimed to understand whether postnatal overnutrition (PO) initiated during lactation affects metabolic markers and vascular function later in life. To test this hypothetical effect, we studied a PO Wistar rat model based on adjusting litter size at the third day of age to three pups and eight for the control group (C). Systemic parameters such as  and food intake were significantly increased in adult rats, measured up to 36 weeks. Moreover, fat mass, triglycerides, insulin and systolic blood pressure were all significantly increased in the PO group. Furthermore, we assessed whether these alterations would affect morphological and functional parameters in isolated vessels. Consistent with systemic alterations of the vasculature, contraction of thoracic aortic rings, determined by dose-response curves to norepinephrine (NE), was significantly reduced in PO rats. Histological stains revealed that the relative area of collagen was higher and the elastic fiber density was lower in the distal rings of PO rats.

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that increases in lean  mass caused by deletion of myostatin improves cardiac performance and vascular function. Echocardiography was used to quantify left ventricular function at baseline and after acute administration of propranolol and isoproterenol to assess -adrenergic reactivity. Additionally, resistance vessels in several beds were removed, cannulated, pressurized to 60 mmHg and reactivity to vasoactive stimuli was assessed. Hemodynamics were measured using in vivo radiotelemetry. Myostatin deletion results in increased fractional shortening at baseline. Additionally, arterioles in the coronary and muscular microcirculations are more sensitive to endothelial-dependent dilation while nonmuscular beds or the aorta were unaffected. -adrenergic dilation was increased in both coronary and conduit arteries, suggesting a systemic effect of increased muscle mass on vascular function. Overall hemodynamics and physical characteristics (heart  and size) remained unchanged. Myostatin deletion mimics in part the effects of exercise on cardiovascular function. It significantly increases lean muscle mass and results in muscle-specific increases in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This suggests that increases in muscle mass may serve as a buffer against pathological states that specifically target cardiac function (heart failure), the -adrenergic system (age), and nitric oxide bio-availability (atherosclerosis). Taken together, pharmacological inhibition of the myostatin pathway could prove an excellent mechanism by which the benefits of exercise can be conferred in patients that are unable to exercise.© 2017 The Authors.

Simultaneous measurements of intracellular Ca ([Ca]) and tension were performed in MA from OZR and compared to lean Zucker rats (LZR), and the effects of selective inhibitors of PI3K, ERK-MAPK kinase and PKC were assessed on the functional responses of VSM voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (Ca1.2). Increases in [Ca] induced by α-adrenoceptor activation and high K depolarization were not different in arteries from LZR and OZR although vasoconstriction was enhanced in OZR. Blockade of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) markedly reduced depolarization-induced Ca responses in arteries from lean but not obese rats, suggesting impaired Ca-induced Ca release (CICR) from SR in arteries from OZR. Enhanced Ca influx after treatment with ryanodine was abolished by nifedipine and coupled to up-regulation of Ca1.2 channels in arteries from OZR. Increased activation of ERK-MAPK and up-regulation of PI3Kδ, PKCβ and δ isoforms were associated to larger inhibitory effects of PI3K, MAPK and PKC blockers on VSM L-type channel Ca entry in OZR. Changes in arterial Ca handling in obesity involve SR Ca store dysfunction and enhanced VSM Ca entry through L-type channels, linked to a compensatory up-regulation of Ca1.2 proteins and increased activity of the ERK-MAPK, PI3Kδ and PKCβ and δ, signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Cows were randomly enrolled based on predefined selection criteria ( condition score and parity). Base diets without MDS were formulated for gestation (15.4% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.25; 1.44 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter) and lactation (16.6% crude protein with a predicted Lys-to-Met ratio of 3.36; 1.64 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg of dry matter). Blood sampling occurred from d -28 relative to expected calving through d 14 postpartum. Liver tissue was biopsied at d -28 relative to expected calving and on d 5 and 14 postpartum. In addition to routine analyses, serum AA concentrations on d 10 and 12 were quantified using mass spectrometry. Plasma triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) were qualitatively measured using time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using a mixed model with repeated . Dry matter intake and milk yield were not modified by MDS. The transition from d -28 relative to expected parturition to d 14 postpartum was characterized by increased plasma fatty acid (0.15 to 0.71 mmol/L) and β-hydroxybutyrate (0.34 to 0.43 mmol/L) levels and liver lipid content (3.91 to 9.16%). Methyl donor supplementation increased the serum Met level by 26% and decreased the serum Lys-to-Met ratio by 21% on d 10 and 12, respectively. Moreover, the increase in hepatic lipid content from d 5 through 14 postpartum was suppressed with MDS relative to control (3.57 vs. -0.29%). Dietary MDS modified the TAG and CE lipidome. For example, MDS increased plasma TAG 46:3 (carbon number:double bond) by 116% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. Moreover, MDS tended to increase plasma CE 34:6. In contrast, MDS lowered plasma TAG 54:8 by 39% relative to control cows on d 5 postpartum. We concluded that in the absence of gains in dry matter intake and milk and milk protein yields, dietary MDS slows the progression of hepatic lipid accumulation and modifies the plasma TAG lipidome in transition cows.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Twelve multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows that calved in late winter in a seasonally calving pasture-based dairying system were managed for a 670-d lactation by delaying rebreeding. In each of four 40-d experimental periods commencing at 73, 217, 422, and 520 (±9.1) d in milk (DIM), cows were offered a diet of perennial ryegrass (73 and 422 DIM) or pasture hay and silage (217 and 520 DIM), supplemented with 1 (CON; n = 6) or 6 kg of grain (GRN; n = 6) as a ration. Daily energy intake was approximately 160 and 215 MJ of metabolizable energy/cow for the CON and GRN treatments, respectively. At all other times, cows were managed as a single herd and grazed pasture supplemented with grain to an estimated daily total intake of 180 MJ of metabolizable energy/cow. Cows were fitted with a jugular catheter during the final week of each experimental period. Two doses of epinephrine (0.1 and 1.6 µg/kg of ) were infused via the catheter 2 h apart to each cow at approximately 100, 250, 460, and 560 DIM. Blood plasma concentrations of glucose and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured before and after infusions. Cows in the GRN treatment had greater milk yield, milk fat and protein yields, and  than cows in the CON treatment. The maximum plasma glucose concentration was observed at 100 DIM for both the low and high doses of epinephrine. Thus, sensitivity and responsiveness to exogenous epinephrine were greater during early lactation, coinciding with increased priority of milk synthesis. Both the sensitivity and responsiveness to epinephrine decreased with decreasing milk yield, as measured by the acute appearance of NEFA in the plasma. Increased plasma glucose and NEFA clearance rates before 300 DIM indicated greater uptake of these substrates by the mammary gland for milk synthesis in early and mid lactation. These results support previous findings that major changes occur in terms of adipose tissue metabolism during extended lactations. Overall, sensitivity to epinephrine was not affected by diet, but responsiveness was greater in cows fed the GRN diet. The endocrine regulation of nutrient partitioning throughout traditional and extended lactations is complex, with many interactions between stage of lactation, diet, and milk yield potential.Copyright © 2018 American Dairy Science Association.

Wistar rats were assigned to 4 groups (n=10): The control group received saline treatment; the ISO group received an intraperitoneal injection of ISO (100 mg/kg); and the TIM (low) and TIM (high) groups received an intraperitoneal injection of ISO, plus a 1 and 2 mg/kg dose of TIM orally, respectively. TIM rats were treated with TIM daily for 12 days and received ISO injections on the final 2 days to induce MI. Cardiac function, apoptosis index and protein expression were subsequently determined. The levels of oxidative stress markers were determined by ELISAs, whereas DNA damage was detected using a Cell Death Detection ELISA kit. Gene and protein expression were determined via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. Following treatment with ISO, the maximum left ventricular contraction/relaxation velocity and left ventricular systolic pressure were significantly decreased, whereas the left ventricular end‑diastolic pressure was increased; however, treatment with TIM significantly ameliorated ISO‑induced cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, TIM treatment significantly decreased oxidative stress and inhibited the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, as determined by a decrease in caspase activities, increased expression of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and reduced expression of cleaved caspase‑3, cleaved caspase‑9 and Bcl‑2‑associated X. Furthermore, treatment with TIM upregulated the levels of apelin in the plasma and myocardium of ISO‑treated rats. The results indicated that TIM protected cardiomyocytes against ISO‑induced MI, potentially via the apelin/apelin receptor signaling pathway.

Eighteen hours after dapagliflozin administration, oxygen consumption and brown adipose tissue (BAT) expression of ucp1, a thermogenesis-related gene, were significantly decreased as compared with those after vehicle administration. In addition, dapagliflozin significantly suppressed norepinephrine (NE) turnover in BAT and c-fos expression in the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus (rRPa), which contains the sympathetic premotor neurons responsible for thermogenesis. These findings indicate that the dapagliflozin-mediated acute decrease in energy expenditure involves a reduction in BAT thermogenesis via decreased sympathetic nerve activity from the rRPa. Furthermore, common hepatic branch vagotomy abolished the reductions in ucp1 expression, NE contents in BAT, and c-fos expression in the rRPa. In addition, alterations in hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, such as decreases in glycogen contents and upregulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, occurred prior to the suppression of BAT thermogenesis, e.g., 6 h after dapagliflozin treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that SGLT2i acutely suppresses energy expenditure in BAT via regulation of an interorgan neural network consisting of the common hepatic vagal branch and sympathetic nerves.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031084>Diethylaminoethyl- chitosan as an efficient carrier for siRNA delivery: Improving the condensation process and the nanoparticles properties.</a></h2><p>Chitosan has been indicated as a promising carrier for the preparation of small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery systems due to its remarkable properties. However, its weak interactions with siRNA molecules makes the condensation of siRNA molecules into nanoparticles difficult. In this work, a non-viral gene delivery system based on diethylaminoethyl chitosan (DEAE-CH) derivatives of varied Mw (25-230 kDa) having a low degree of substitution of 15% was investigated. The presence of secondary and tertiary amino groups strengthened the interaction of siRNA and DEAE-CH derivatives of higher Mw (130 kDa to 230 kDa) and provided the preparation of spherical nanoparticles at low charge ratios (N/P 2 to 3) with low polydispersities (0.15 to 0.2) in physiological ionic strength. Nanoparticles prepared with all derivatives exhibited remarkable silencing efficiencies (80% to 90%) on different cell lines (HeLa, MG-63, OV-3) by adjusting the charge ratios. A selected PEG-folic acid labeled derivative (FA-PEG-DEAE15-CH) was synthesized and its nanoparticles completely inhibited the mRNA expression level of TNF-α in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The study demonstrates that the insertion of DEAE groups provides improved physical properties to chitosan-siRNA nanoparticles and holds potential for in vivo applications.Copyright © 2018.

Animals received 0.2 mL of epinephrine, 0.2 or 0.3 mL of 2% lidocaine, or 0.2 mL of BSS. Cats were anesthetized, and all solutions were injected intracamerally. PD, IOP, HR, and MAP were assessed at baseline, following anterior chamber paracentesis (T0), and at every 5 minutes, until anesthesia was terminated (T60). PD and IOP continued to be assessed for 2 additional hours during recovery from anesthesia. In another group, cats were not anesthetized and one of the eyes was treated with one drop of 0.5% tropicamide to check for maximal pupil diameter.Faster onset and longer duration of sufficient mydriasis (>10 mm) were observed in epinephrine treatment group, when comparing with cats treated with both doses of lidocaine. Eyes treated with epinephrine achieved the largest maximum pupil diameter (mm) when comparing with eyes treated with 0.3 mL of lidocaine (11.01 ± 0.16), tropicamide (10.66 ± 0.17), and 0.2 mL of lidocaine (10.23 ± 0.12) (P < .0001). In all groups, IOP decreased significantly at T0, but tended to return to baseline at T60. HR and MAP did not change significantly during time and among treatments.The intracameral injection of 0.2 mL of 1:100 000 epinephrine and 0.3 mL of 2% lidocaine can be used as an alternative to tropicamide in healthy cats.

However, the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in kwashiorkor is uncertain. Our objective was to develop a mouse model of childhood undernutrition in order to test the hypothesis that feeding a maize vegetable diet (MVD), like that consumed by children at risk for kwashiorkor, will cause hepatic steatosis which is prevented by supplementation with choline. A MVD was developed with locally sourced organic ingredients, and fed to weanling mice ( = 9) for 6 or 13 days. An additional group of mice ( = 4) were fed a choline supplemented MVD. ,  composition, and liver changes were compared to control mice ( = 10) at the beginning and end of the study. The MVD resulted in reduced  gain and hepatic steatosis. Choline supplementation prevented hepatic steatosis and was associated with increased hepatic concentrations of the methyl donor betaine. Our findings show that (1) feeding a MVD to weanling mice rapidly induces hepatic steatosis, which is a hallmark disturbance of kwashiorkor; and that (2) hepatic steatosis associated with feeding a MVD is prevented by choline supplementation. These findings support the concept that insufficient choline intake may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in kwashiorkor.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29938346>Tocolysis with the β-sympathomimetic fenoterol does not increase the occurrence of infantile hemangioma in preterm and term infants.</a></h2><p>β-sympathomimetics are used in obstetrics as tocolytic agents, despite a remarkable profile of side effects. Recently, the β-sympathomimetic tocolytic drug hexoprenaline was identified as an independent risk factor for the development of infantile hemangioma (IH) in preterm infants. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this observed effect was applicable to other β-mimetic tocolytic agents like fenoterol.Clinical prospectively collected data of all infants born between 2001 and 2012 and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Heidelberg University Hospital and respective maternal data were merged. For the current retrospective cohort study, cases (IH) were matched to controls (no IH) at a ratio of 1:4, adjusting for birth , gestational age, gender and multiple gestations. Prenatal exposure to fenoterol and perinatal outcome were analyzed in the total cohort and in subgroups.N = 5070 infants were admitted to our neonatal department, out of which n = 172 infants with IH were identified and compared to n = 596 matched controls. Exposure to fenoterol was not associated with a higher rate of IH in the total matched population (OR 0.926, 95% CI 0.619-1.384) or in a subgroup of neonates < 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth  < 1500 g (OR 1.127, 95% CI 0.709-1.791). In the total matched population, prenatal exposure to glucocorticoids was associated with a reduced occurrence of IH (OR 0.566, 95% CI 0.332-0.964) and neonates with IH showed a prolonged total hospital stay compared to controls (69 vs. 57 days, p = 0.0033). Known risk factors for IH were confirmed by our large study cohort and included female gender, low birth , preterm birth and multiple gestations (all p < 0.005).Exposure to fenoterol during pregnancy does not increase the occurrence of IH.

We previously determined that platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) was overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) and that PAF can promote ovarian cancer progression via PAF/PAFR-mediated inflammatory signalling pathways. Evidence suggests that MSCs can secrete high concentrations of PAF. Here, we investigated the role of PAF/PAFR signalling in the microenvironment mediated by MSCs and OCCs and its effect on cancer progression.The PAF concentrations in the culture media of MSCs, OCCs and co-cultured MSCs and OCCs were determined by ELISA. The effects of MSCs on OCCs in vitro were assessed on cells treated with conditioned medium (CM). The expression and phosphorylation of key proteins in the PAF/PAFR signalling pathway were evaluated. In vivo, MSCs/RFP and SKOV3 cells were co-administered at different proportions to nude mice by interscapular injection. Mice in the WEB2086 group were intraperitoneally injected with the PAFR antagonist WEB2086 at a dose of 1 mg/kgd for the duration of the animal experiments. Tumour progression was observed, and the  and survival time of mice were measured. The PAF concentration in peripheral and tumour site blood was determined by ELISA.High concentrations of PAF were detected in CM from MSCs and MSCs co-cultured with OCCs. Both types of medium promoted non-mucinous OCC proliferation and migration but had no effect on mucinous-type OCCs. These effects could be blocked by PAFR inhibitors. The expression and phosphorylation of key proteins in the PAF/PAFR pathway significantly increased upon treatment with PAF and MSC-CM. In vivo, the tumour volume was larger following co-injection of SKOV3 cells and MSCs/RFP than following injection of SKOV3 cells alone. The tumour-promoting effect of MSCs/RFP was blocked by the PAFR antagonist WEB2086. Serum PAF concentrations significantly increased in co-injected mice.Our results suggest that the tumour-promoting effect of MSCs on OCCs via their cross-talk in the tumour microenvironment was, at least in part, mediated by the PAF/PAFR pathway, suggesting a new target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29746901>Epinephrine, auto-injectors, and anaphylaxis: Challenges of dose, depth, and device.</a></h2><p>This review was undertaken to review epinephrine dosing, site and route of administration, focusing on special populations (patients weighing less than 15 kg, and obese patients); and to discuss storage and delivery of epinephrine in prehospital and hospital settings.Review of published literature.Relevance.The recommended 0.01-mg/kg (maximum 0.3-0.5 mg) epinephrine dose in anaphylaxis is based on limited pharmacokinetic data in healthy volunteers. No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics studies involving patients in anaphylaxis have been published. When epinephrine auto-injectors (EAIs) are used in infants, the dose increasingly exceeds the recommended dose as  decreases, although the clinical significance of this is unclear. Limited data indicate that the intramuscular route and lateral thigh site are superior. Ultrasound studies suggest that 0.15 EAI needles may be too long for many patients weighing less than 15 kg, and 0.3 mg EAI needles may be too short for obese patients weighing more than 30 kg. A newly available 0.1 mg EAI has a lower dose and shorter needle better suited to patients weighing 7.5 to 15 kg. In some medical settings, vials and syringes may provide a safe, efficient alternative with substantial cost savings over EAIs.EAIs should be available in the community with doses and needle depths that meet the needs of all patients. More research on epinephrine pharmacodynamics are needed in children and adults in anaphylaxis, to better delineate what optimal doses should be. Optimizing epinephrine dose and delivery has the potential to improve anaphylaxis outcomes and prevent adverse events.Copyright © 2018 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

However, a systematic comparison of effects of diets with different composition of 18-C fatty acids on browning/beiging phenotype has not been done. In this study, we compared the effects of different dietary fats, rich in specific 18-carbon fatty acids, on thermogenesis and lipid metabolism. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet containing 5.6% kcal fat from lard and 4.4% kcal fat from soybean oil (CON) or high-fat diets (HFD) containing 25% kcal from lard and 20% kcal fat from shea butter (stearic acid-rich fat; SHB), olive oil (oleic acid-rich oil; OO), safflower oil (linoleic acid-rich oil; SFO), or soybean oil (mixed oleic, linoleic, and α-linolenic acids; SBO)  for 12 weeks, with or without a terminal 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. When compared to SHB, feeding OO, SFO, and SBO resulted in lower  gain. The OO fed group had the highest thermogenesis level, which resulted in lower  fat accumulation and improved glucose and lipid metabolism. Feeding SFO downregulated expression of lipid oxidation-related genes and upregulated expression of lipogenic genes, perhaps due to its high n-6:n-3 ratio. In general, HFD-feeding downregulated  expression in both subcutaneous and epididymal white adipose tissue, and suppressed NE-induced  expression in brown adipose tissue. These results suggest that the position of double bonds in dietary fatty acids, as well as the quantity of dietary fat, may have a significant effect on the regulation of oxidative and thermogenic conditions in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913465>In brief: Auvi-Q epinephrine auto-injector for infants and toddlers.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700799>Spinal anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in obese parturients: is this the best option?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126894>Transient Overexpression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A in Adipose Tissue Promotes Energy Expenditure via Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</a></h2><p>Adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) stimulates functional blood vessel formation in obese fat pads, which in turn facilitates healthy expansion of the adipose tissue. However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129597>Cocaine and desipramine elicit distinct striatal noradrenergic and behavioral responses in selectively bred obesity-resistant and obesity-prone rats.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated a role for norepinephrine (NE) in energy regulation and feeding, and basal differences have been observed in hypothalamic NE systems in obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant rats. Differences in the function of brain reward circuits, including in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), have been shown in obesity-prone vs. obesity-resistant populations, leading many researchers to explore the role of striatal dopamine in obesity. However, alterations in NE transmission also affect NAc mediated behaviors. Therefore, here we examined differences in striatal NE and the response to norepinephrine transporter blockers in obesity-prone and obesity-resistant rats. We found that striatal NE levels increase following systemic cocaine administration in obesity-prone, but not obesity-resistant rats. This could result from either blockade of striatal norepinephrine transporters (NET) by cocaine leading to reduced NE reuptake, or circuit-based responses following cocaine administration resulting in increased NE release. Retrodialysis of the NET inhibitor, desipramine, into the ventral striatum did not cause selective increases in striatal NE levels in obesity-prone rats, suggesting that circuit-based mechanisms underlie NE increases following systemic cocaine administration. Consistent with this, systemic desipramine treatment decreased locomotor activity in obesity-prone, but not obesity-resistant rats. Furthermore, obesity-prone rats were also more sensitive to desipramine-induced reductions in food intake compared to obesity-resistant rats. Taken together, these data expand our understanding of differences in NE systems of obesity-prone vs. resistant rats, and provide new insights into basal differences in striatal systems that may influence feeding behavior.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

HR is determined by the discharge rate of the sinus node, which is dependent on the autonomic nervous system and the release of catecholamines. The allometric relationship between BW and HR in different species has been described as inversely proportional; however, this relationship has been refuted. Certain authors have reported that the relationship between HR and BW in dogs is based on temperament as well as sympathetic autonomic stimulation of the sinus node in small breeds compared with large breeds. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of , sex, age and temperament on the HR, heart rate variability and serum catecholamine (epinephrine and norepinephrine) levels in dogs. We evaluated 48 adult dogs of both sexes and various breeds and ages and divided the dogs into 5 BW groups: <5kg (n = 8), 5-10kg (n = 10), 10-25kg (n = 10), 25-45kg (n = 10), and >45kg (n = 10).

Nevirapine is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which metabolizes artemether and lumefantrine. To address the concern that the antiretroviral nevirapine impacts the antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine pharmacokinetics, a prospective non-randomized controlled study in children presenting with uncomplicated malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa was carried out.Participants received artemether-lumefantrine (20/120 mg -based BID) for 3 days during nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) co-administration (158-266 mg/m2 QD). HIV positive participants who were not yet on ART drugs were also enrolled as the control group. The target enrollment was children aged 3-12 years (n = 24 in each group). Intensive pharmacokinetics after the last artemether-lumefantrine dose was assessed for artemether, its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine. Pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), maximum concentration and day 7 lumefantrine concentrations) were estimated using non-compartmental methods and compared to controls.Nineteen children (16 on nevirapine and three not on ART) enrolled. Fifteen of the 16 (aged 4 to 11 years) on nevirapine-based ART were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Due to evolving WHO HIV treatment guidelines, insufficient children were enrolled in the control group (n = 3), so the pharmacokinetic data were compared to a historical control group of 20 HIV-uninfected children 5-12 years of age who also presented with malaria and underwent identical study procedures. Decreases of pharmacokinetic exposure [as estimated by AUC (AUC0-8hr)] were marginally significant for artemether (by -46%, p = 0.08) and dihydroartemisinin (-22%, p = 0.06) in the children on nevirapine-based ART, compared to when artemether-lumefantrine was administered alone. Similarly, peak concentration was decreased by 50% (p = 0.07) for artemether and 36% (p = 0.01) for dihydroartemisinin. In contrast, exposure to lumefantrine increased significantly in the context of nevirapine [AUC0-120hr:123% (p<0.001); Cday7:116% (p<0.001), Cmax: 95% (p<0.001)].Nevirapine-based ART increases the exposure to lumefantrine in pre-pubescent children with a trend toward diminished artemether and dihydroartemisinin exposure. These findings contrast with other studies indicating NVP reduces or results in no change in exposure of antimalarial drugs, and may be specific to this age group (4-12 years). Considering the excellent safety profile of artemether-lumefantrine, the increase in lumefantrine is not of concern. However, the reduction in artemisinin exposure may warrant further study, and suggests that dosage adjustment of artemether-lumefantrine with nevirapine-based ART in children is likely warranted.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413575>Analysis of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and plasmalogen molecular species in food lipids using an improved 2D high-performance liquid chromatography system.</a></h2><p>Phospholipids are an important class of lipids in cell membranes and food.

This study examined the prognostic value of three markers of sympathetic activity and their relationship to beta blocker dose in heart failure patients.A post hoc analysis of 858 heart failure subjects in the ADMIRE-HF trial was performed. Variables related to sympathetic activity were plasma norepinephrine, baseline heart rate, the heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio of  I-mIBG uptake, and beta blocker dose. Univariate and multivariate analyses for occurrence of mortality (all-cause and cardiac) and arrhythmic events were performed. Beta blocker dose was significantly related to age, heart rate, b-type natriuretic peptide (negatively),  mass index,  and plasma norepinephrine. Univariate predictors of all-cause and cardiac mortality were baseline heart rate (χ  = 4.5, P = 0.029 and χ  = 5 .2, P = 0.022, respectively), plasma norepinephrine level (χ  = 8.9, P = 0.0006 and χ  = 8.6, P = 0.003, respectively), and H/M (χ = 22.4, P < 0.0001 and χ  = 17.8, P < 0.0001, respectively).

In separate analyses using multiple measurements of heart rate, mean heart rate >67 b.p.m. was associated with significantly higher cardiac mortality.Higher beta blocker dose was associated with lower mortality, but of the variables associated with sympathetic activity examined, cardiac  I-mIBG uptake was the most powerful prognostic marker in heart failure patients. Elevated heart rate was associated with greater risk for cardiac death.© 2017 The Authors.

Eligible for inclusion were infants born at less than 31 weeks' gestation with a  less than the ninth centile; infants born at less than 31 weeks' gestation with a grade II or higher intraventricular haemorrhage/preterm white matter injury; infants born between 31 weeks' and 40 weeks' gestation plus 28 days with a grade II or higher intraventricular haemorrhage/preterm white matter injury, moderate or severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, or defined neuroimaging abnormalities. Treatment/control supplementation was for 2 years (double-blind, randomized, controlled design). Infants were stratified according to sex, gestation, and brain injury severity. Primary outcome was cognitive composite score (CCS) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III at 24mo). Secondary outcomes were language composite score (LCS) of the Bayley-III, motor composite score (MCS) of the Bayley-III, and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) score.Sixty-two neonates were recruited, 59 were randomized (34 males, 25 females). Fifty-three started supplementation. Most families found supplementation acceptable. The treatment group CCS-Bayley-III scores were non-significantly higher than controls (mean score difference at 24mo: 9.0; 95% confidence interval -0.2 to 18.2). Language and VABS-II scores, but not motor score, were non-significantly higher in the treatment group.Most families found supplementation feasible. Improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in the treatment group were not statistically significant. A larger multicentre trial exploration is warranted.Dietary supplementation of neonates at risk of neurodevelopmental impairment is feasible. No statistically significant neurodevelopmental advantages were identified for the treatment group compared to controls. Treatment group cognitive and language advantage are of a clinically meaningful magnitude.© 2018 Mac Keith Press.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845147>Dietary fatty acid composition impacts plasma fatty acid ethanolamide levels and  composition in golden Syrian hamsters.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs) are a class of lipid amides that regulate numerous pathophysiological functions. To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall  composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high oleic canola oil:docosahexaenoic acid; H+EPA, 85:15 high oleic canola oil:eicosapentaenoic acid; HOCO, high oleic canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on energy expenditure and overall  composition to determine if dietary fatty acid (DFA) composition affects diet-induced obesity (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of  composition, energy expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy .</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305401>Changes in Gut Microbiota-Related Metabolites and Long-term Successful  Loss in Response to -Loss Diets: The POUNDS Lost Trial.</a></h2><p>Adiposity and the gut microbiota are both related to the risk of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to comprehensively examine how changes induced by a -loss diet intervention in gut microbiota-related metabolites, such as trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline and l-carnitine), were associated with improvements in adiposity and regional fat deposition.This study included 510 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient intake. We examined associations of 6-month changes in blood metabolites (TMAO, choline, and l-carnitine) with improvements in  (BW), waist circumference (WC),  fat composition, fat distribution, and resting energy expenditure (REE).Individuals with a greater reduction of choline ( < 0.0001) and l-carnitine ( < 0.01) rather than TMAO showed significant losses of BW and WC at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly predictive of decreases in  fat composition, fat distribution, and REE. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the baseline diabetes risk status, such as the presence of hyperglycemia (31% of the total participants) and fasting glucose levels, did not modify the associations. Early changes in choline and l-carnitine were significantly predictive of  loss over 2 years ( < 0.05 for all). Individuals with increases in choline or l-carnitine were 2.35-times (95% CI 1.38, 4.00) or 1.77-times (1.06, 2.95) more likely to fail to lose  (-5% or more loss) at 2 years.Overweight and obese individuals who showed decreases in circulating choline or l-carnitine levels achieved greater improvements of adiposity and energy metabolism by eating a low-calorie -loss diet, suggesting that such metabolites are predictive of individuals' response to the treatment. Further investigations are necessary to confirm our findings, particularly in a population with prediabetes that is more representative of the U.S. population with obesity.ClinicalTrials.gov .© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29154437>Effect of adding different levels of rumen protected choline to the diet on productive and reproductive performance of female goats and growth of their kids from birthing to weaning.</a></h2><p>Forty female goats in the third parity were randomly divided into four similar groups. The experiment was started 20 days before mating and lasted until the end of the suckling period for 60 days and weaning their kids. The first group were fed diet without supplementation and kept as control while in the second, third and fourth groups, each doe was fed diets with rumen protected choline (RPC) at the rate of 10, 20 and 40 g/day, respectively. Results showed that number of doe kidding twins and triplets and litter  of kids born per group increased with increasing the level of RPC in the diet of goats and viability rate of born kids during the suckling period improved due to RPC supplementation in the diets of their mothers. Duration of estrous, days from weaning to estrous, days from kidding to estrous and kidding interval decreased significantly, while conception rate increased due to adding RPC. Milk choline concentrations and total choline secretion though milk were progressively increased significantly with increasing the level of RPC supplementation. Live  and daily  gain of their suckling male and female kids at weaning increased significantly with increasing RPC levels in the diets of their mothers.© 2017 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965593>Isoproterenol exacerbates hyperglycemia and modulates chromium distribution in mice fed with a high fat diet.</a></h2><p>Isoproterenol (ISO), a nonselective β-adrenoceptor agonist for treating bradycardia and asthma, has been proposed to raise blood glucose level. Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an obesity mouse model.Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an obesity animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their metabolic parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile, insulin level time profile, insulin sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas insulin levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic syndrome in the obesity animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

(TVL) is a folk medicine, native to South Africa which has previously shown antioxidant, anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic effects.The aim of the current study was to investigate the protective role of wild garlic or TVL on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial necrosis in rats.Animal (n = 6 each group) were pre and co-treated with TVL (60 mg/kg ) daily for 30 days. Myocardial necrosis was administrated by subcutaneous injection of ISO (85 mg/kg ) into rats on 29th and 30th day. On the 31st day, rats were anaesthetized and blood, heart samples were obtained for the biochemical, histopathological and molecular study. The specific protein target analysis from TVL was done by reverse docking study (reverse pharmacophore mapping) using PharmMapper.The levels of cardiac markers, lipid peroxidation products, and heart rate were considerably increased in ISO-induced myocardial necrosis in rats whilst plasma enzymatic antioxidants were significantly decreased. Myocardial necrotic mRNA genes were increased in ISO-induced myocardial necrosis in rats compared to controls. Pre and co-treatment with TVL and ramipril of myocardial necrosis in rats showed significant effects on all the biochemical and molecular studies evaluated. TVL reduced heart rate, prevented oxidative stress and downregulated the Fas-receptor and caspase-mediated apoptosis-signaling pathway, and heart muscle damage in myocardial necrosis in rats. The specific target protein [disulfide, bis (2-sulfhydrylethyl] from TVL mediates the protective effects.Wild garlic or TVL extract has shown a protective effect on ISO-induced myocardial necrosis in rats by increasing antioxidant production confirmed with docking studies.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Under the optimized condition (170 °C, 60 min, 0.6 wt% HSO, 10.7 wt% solid loading), the biphasic solvent solubilized 96% xylan in raw switchgrass, which was simultaneously converted to furfural with a yield of 84.04%. The biphasic solvent was also able to selectively extract lignin, which had a high purity (93.1%), and uncondensed moieties (i.e., Hibbert's ketone), as well as decreased molecular  and polydispersity index. The resultant pulp was enriched with cellulose (73.3%), which can be completely hydrolyzed into glucose within 48 h via enzymatic hydrolysis. Aqueous ChCl was successfully recycled and reused for atleast three cycles with similar performance in switchgrass fractionation. This study demonstrated that aqueous ChCl/MIBK biphasic system was an effective solvent system for co-production of furfural, high quality technical lignin and digestible cellulose for further upgrading.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
