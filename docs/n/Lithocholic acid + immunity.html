<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29074825>[Update on recent progress in vitamin D research. Vitamin D receptor and the nuclear receptor superfamily.]</a></h2><p>The vitamin D receptor(VDR)is a ligand-dependent transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily. VDR belongs to the NR1I subfamily along with other nuclear receptors involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as pregnane X receptor. The oxysterol receptors liver X receptors α/β and the bile  receptor farnesoid X receptor belong to the NR1H subfamily, which are closely related to the NR1I subfamily. NR1I and NR1H nuclear receptors form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor. The active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D[1,25(OH)D], acts as a physiological VDR ligand, and regulates various physiological processes, including calcium and bone metabolism, cellular growth and differentiation, immunity, and cardiovascular function. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand.  stimulates xenobiotic metabolism and regulates immune and inflammatory responses via VDR, and its calcemic action is limited and observed only in vitamin D-deficient animals. Thus,  may be a function-selective VDR ligand. VDR is a promising drug in the treatment of bone and mineral disorders, cancer, autoimmune disease, , and cardiovascular disease. However, the adverse effect hypercalcemia limits wider clinical application of 1,25(OH)D and its derivatives. Elucidation of the mechanism of VDR function by  should expand the possibility of VDR-targeted approaches.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150987>Bile Acids Activated Receptors Regulate Innate .</a></h2><p>Once known exclusively for their role in nutrients absorption, primary bile acids, chenodeoxycholic and cholic , and secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and , are signaling molecules, generated from cholesterol breakdown by the interaction of the host and intestinal microbiota, acting on several receptors including the G protein-coupled bile  receptor 1 (GPBAR1 or Takeda G-protein receptor 5) and the Farnesoid-X-Receptor (FXR). Both receptors are placed at the interface of the host immune system with the intestinal microbiota and are highly represented in cells of innate  such as intestinal and liver macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer T cells. Here, we review how GPBAR1 and FXR modulate the intestinal and liver innate immune system and contribute to the maintenance of a  phenotype in entero-hepatic tissues, and how regulation of innate  might help to explain beneficial effects exerted by GPBAR1 and FXR ligands in immune and metabolic disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27406326>Bile acids induce necrosis in pancreatic stellate cells dependent on calcium entry and sodium-driven bile uptake.</a></h2><p>Acute biliary pancreatitis is a sudden and severe condition initiated by bile reflux into the pancreas. Bile acids are known to induce Ca signals and necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells but the effects of bile acids on stellate cells are unexplored. Here we show that cholate and taurocholate elicit more dramatic Ca signals and necrosis in stellate cells compared to the adjacent acinar cells in pancreatic lobules; whereas taurolithocholic  3-sulfate primarily affects acinar cells. Ca signals and necrosis are strongly dependent on extracellular Ca as well as Na ; and Na -dependent transport plays an important role in the overall bile  uptake in pancreatic stellate cells. Bile -mediated pancreatic damage can be further escalated by bradykinin-induced signals in stellate cells and thus killing of stellate cells by bile acids might have important implications in acute biliary pancreatitis.Acute biliary pancreatitis, caused by bile reflux into the pancreas, is a serious condition characterised by premature activation of digestive enzymes within acinar cells, followed by necrosis and inflammation. Bile acids are known to induce pathological Ca signals and necrosis in acinar cells. However, bile -elicited signalling events in stellate cells remain unexplored. This is the first study to demonstrate the pathophysiological effects of bile acids on stellate cells in two experimental models: ex vivo (mouse pancreatic lobules) and in vitro (human cells). Sodium cholate and taurocholate induced cytosolic Ca elevations in stellate cells, larger than those elicited simultaneously in the neighbouring acinar cells. In contrast, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate (TLC-S), known to induce Ca oscillations in acinar cells, had only minor effects on stellate cells in lobules. The dependence of the Ca signals on extracellular Na and the presence of sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) indicate a Na -dependent bile  uptake mechanism in stellate cells. Bile  treatment caused necrosis predominantly in stellate cells, which was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca and significantly reduced in the absence of Na , showing that bile-dependent cell death was a downstream event of Ca signals. Finally, combined application of TLC-S and the inflammatory mediator bradykinin caused more extensive necrosis in both stellate and acinar cells than TLC-S alone. Our findings shed new light on the mechanism by which bile acids promote pancreatic pathology. This involves not only signalling in acinar cells but also in stellate cells.© 2016 The Authors The Journal of Physiology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30647128>Bile  analogues are activators of pyrin inflammasome.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are critical metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract and contribute to maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis through cross-talk with the gut microbiota. The conversion of bile acids by the gut microbiome is now recognized as a factor affecting both host metabolism and immune responses, but its physiological roles remain unclear. We conducted a screen for microbiome metabolites that would function as inflammasome activators and herein report the identification of 12-oxo- (BAA485), a potential microbiome-derived bile  metabolite. We demonstrate that the more potent analogue 11-oxo-12-hydroxylithocholic  methyl ester (BAA473) can induce secretion of interleukin-18 (IL-18) through activation of the inflammasome in both myeloid and intestinal epithelial cells. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen with compound induced pyroptosis in THP-1 cells, we identified that inflammasome activation by BAA473 is pyrin-dependent (). To our knowledge, the bile  analogues BAA485 and BAA473 are the first small molecule activators of the pyrin inflammasome. We surmise that pyrin inflammasome activation through microbiota-modified bile  metabolites such as BAA473 and BAA485 plays a role in gut microbiota regulated intestinal immune response. The discovery of these two bioactive compounds may help to further unveil the importance of pyrin in gut homeostasis and autoimmune diseases.© 2019 Alimov et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28493883> controls adaptive immune responses by inhibition of Th1 activation through the Vitamin D receptor.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are established signaling molecules next to their role in the intestinal emulsification and uptake of lipids. We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile  species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated  (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling pathways in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile -based drugs and gut microbiota. Our data may suggest that these factors also impact on adaptive immunity via a yet unrecognized LCA-Th cell axis.</p></html>
