Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of this  disease. The gene-environment interaction could lead to modulation of various   resulting in altered levels of various metabolites. Thus, identifying metabolites could aid in deciphering  that could be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. With the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry based methodologies, it is now possible to screen thousands of metabolites in a single snapshot thus, allowing the identification of potential disease metabolite markers. In this work, using an untargeted metabolomic approach, we attempted to identify metabolites that have altered levels in CAD patients. Using reverse phase and HILIC based chromatography followed by mass spectrometry we identified a total of 32 metabolites ( fold; p<0.05) in plasma whose levels were significantly altered in CAD samples. Further, we have validated the discriminative ability of these metabolites in an independent set of CAD and control samples using multivariate PLS-DA analysis. Interestingly,  PC (:0), Cortisol,  PC (P-17:0), and glycerophosphocholine were among the top discriminators for CAD which implies involvement of  pathway in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Herein, we report that an unbiased metabolomic study has the potential to identify newer markers which are involved in several important biological  like lipid ,  pathway etc. which in turn are implicated in CAD. These markers could be of potential clinical importance for screening subjects at risk of CAD. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The phenotypes were obtained by calculating the differences of annual changes in waist minus hip circumference. The difference was displayed for all cohorts. The highest 10% of this difference were defined as WG whereas the lowest 10% were defined as HG. A total of 121 concordant metabolite measurements were conducted using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ® kits in EPIC and KORA. Sex-specific associations with metabolite concentration as independent and phenotype as the dependent variable adjusted for confounders were calculated. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing.Across studies both sexes gained on average more waist than hip circumference. We could identify 12 metabolites as being associated with the WG (n = 8) or HG (n = 4) in men, but none were significant after correction for multiple testing; 45 metabolites were associated with the WG (n = 41) or HG (n = 4) in women. For WG, n = 21 metabolites remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Respective odds ratios (OR) ranged from 0.66 to 0.73 for tryptophan, the diacyl- (PC) C32:3, C36:0, C38:0, C38:1, C42:, C42:5, the acyl-alkyl-PCs C32:, C34:0, C36:0, C36:1, C36:, C38:0, C38:, C40:1, C40:, C40:5, C40:6, 42:, C42:3 and -PC C17:0.Both weight-gaining men and women showed a clear tendency to gain more abdominal than peripheral fat. Gain of abdominal fat seems to be related to an initial  state reflected by low concentrations of specific metabolites, at least in women. Thus, higher levels of specific PCs may play a protective role in gaining waist circumference.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599289>Altered triglyceride and phospholipid  predates the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in obese pregnancy.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with obesity and long-term health risks, is usually diagnosed at approximately 28 weeks of gestation. An understanding of lipid  in women at risk of GDM could contribute to earlier diagnosis and treatment. We tested the hypothesis that altered lipid  at the beginning of the second trimester in obese pregnant women is associated with a diagnosis of GDM. Plasma samples from 831 participants (16-45 years, 15- weeks gestation, BMI ≥ 30) from the UPBEAT study of obese pregnant women were used. The lipid, sterol and glyceride fraction was isolated and analysed in a semi-quantitative fashion using direct infusion mass spectrometry. A combination of uni-, multi-variate and multi-variable statistical analyses was used to identify candidate biomarkers in plasma associated with a diagnosis of GDM (early third trimester; IADPSG criteria). Multivariable adjusted analyses showed that participants who later developed GDM had a greater abundance of several triglycerides (48:0, 50:1, 50:, 51:5, 53:4) and  (38:5). In contrast sphingomyelins (32:1, 41:, 42:3), - (16:0, :1),  (35:, 40:7, 40:10), two polyunsaturated triglycerides (46:5, 48:6) and several oxidised triglycerides (48:6, 54:4, 56:4, 58:6) were less abundant. We concluded that both lipid and triglyceride  were altered at least 10 weeks before diagnosis of GDM. Further investigation is required to determine the functional consequences of these differences and the mechanisms by which they arise.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30040874>Distinct disruptions in Land's cycle remodeling of glycerophosphocholines in murine cortex mark symptomatic onset and progression in two Alzheimer's disease mouse models.</a></h2><p>Changes in glycerophosphocholine  are observed in Alzheimer's disease; however, it is not known whether these  disruptions are linked to cognitive decline. Here, using unbiased lipidomic approaches and direct biochemical assessments, we profiled Land's cycle lipid remodeling in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and temporal-parietal-entorhinal cortices of human amyloid beta precursor protein (ΑβPP) over-expressing mice. We identified a cortex-specific hypo- signature at symptomatic onset and a cortex-specific hyper- signature of Land's cycle glycerophosphocholine remodeling over the course of progressive behavioral decline. When N5 TgCRND8 and ΑβPP  /PSI mice first exhibited deficits in the Morris Water Maze, levels of -, LPC(:0/0:0), LPC(16:0/0:0), LPC(24:6/0:0), LPC(25:6/0:0), the -platelet-activating factor (PAF), LPC(O-:0/0:0), and the PAF, PC(O-22:6/:0), declined as a result of reduced calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A α (cPLA α) activity in all cortices but not hippocampus. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, an environmental risk factor that triggers earlier learning memory impairment in ΑβPP  /PSI mice, elicited these same  changes in younger animals. Thus, this lipidomic signature of phenoconversion appears age-independent. By contrast, in symptomatic N5 TgCRND8 mice, cPLA α activity progressively increased; overall - (LPC) and LPC(O) and PC(O-:1/:0) levels progressively rose. Enhanced cPLA α activity was only detected in transgenic mice; however, age-dependent increases in the PAF acetylhydrolase 1b α to α expression ratio, evident in both transgenic and non-transgenic mice, reduced PAF hydrolysis thereby contributing to PAF accumulation. Taken together, these data identify distinct age-independent and age-dependent disruptions in Land's cycle  linked to symptomatic onset and progressive behavioral decline in animals with pre-existing Αβ pathology.

The aim of the study was to use of untargeted metabolomics to identify and validate changes in the blood metabolites profile, occurring as a result of HF-REF development. The analyses were performed first in the derivation set (36 chronic HF-REF patients and 19 controls without the disease) and repeated in validation cohort (31 chronic HF-REF patients and 20 controls). Independent analyses of both sets revealed statistically significant decline in intensities of  (PC): 34:4 and 36:5, lysophosphatidylcholine (-PC): 14:0, 15:0, :0, :, 20:3, lysophosphatidylethanolamine (-PE): :1 and : in chronic HF-REF patients. More symptomatic patients and those with ischaemic etiology of HF-REF presented greater deficit in phospholipids (PLs) intensities. The decrease of identified PLs intensities (as compared to controls) correlated with decreased serum cholesterol level, impaired renal function, reduced exercise capacity, enhanced ventilatory response and  parameters associated with altered fatty acids oxidation. In multiple regression analysis PLs deficit was significantly associated with age, carnitines serum intensity, renal function, uric acid, cholesterol level. In conclusion, HF-REF is associated with significant disturbances in phospholipids . Greater reduction in serum intensities of particular identified PLs is associated with older age, worse clinical condition, impaired oxidative muscle  and enhanced catabolic status.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is characterized by myocardium ischemia as a result of nutrients depletion and hypoxia. The cell can respond to this injury by autophagy or apoptosis, which determines the evolution and possible recovery of the myocardium infarction. Lipids play an important role in cardiovascular disease. However reports stating lipidome variations in cardiovascular disease are scarce and the role that lipids play in this pathological condition is not completely understood. The aim of this work was to identify changes in lipid profile of a myoblast H9c2 cell line under starvation and ischemia, to better understand and recognize new biomarkers for myocardial infarction. Lipidomic profile was evaluated by HILIC-LC-MS and GC-MS. Cardiac cells showed alterations in  PC (34:1) and PC (36:), lysophosphatidylcholines  PC(16:0), lysoPC(:1) and lysoPC(:0), phosphatidylethanolamine PE (34:1), phosphatidylserine PS (36:1), phosphatidylinositol PI (36:), PI (38:3) and PI (38:5), sphingomyelin SM (34:1) and cardiolipins CL(68:4), CL(72:5) and CL(74:7) in ischemia and/or starvation, in comparison with control. Specific differences observed only in starvation were decrease of SM (34:1) and FA (20:4), and increase of PS (36:1). Differences observed only in ischemia were decrease of PC (36:),  PC (16:0) and FA (:1) and simultaneous increase of FA (16:0), and FA (:0). Interestingly, PC (34:1) increased in ischemia and decreased in starvation. In conclusion, our work suggests that lipids are potential markers for evaluation of cell fate, either cell death or recovery, which will be useful to improve diagnosis and prognostic of cardiovascular diseases.
