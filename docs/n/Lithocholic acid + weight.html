Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal microbiota profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue  and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content  were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue . The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue . Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AGO-received mice is still unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AGO administration affects the gut microbial composition and inhibits obesity in mice.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27072966>Functional role of MicroRNA-19b in acinar cell necrosis in acute necrotizing pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>The expression of microRNA-19b (miR-19b) in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and its functional role in acinar cell necrosis of SD rats were investigated. Twelve SD rats were divided into two groups randomly, including control group and ANP group. The rat ANP models were established by intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine (2400 mg/kg ), and equal volume of 0.9% NaCl was injected in the control group. MiRNA chip assay was performed to examine the expression of miRNAs in the pancreas in two different groups. Besides, to further explore the role of miR-19b in ANP in vitro, taurolithocholic  3-sulfate disodium salt (TLC-S) (200 μmol/L) was administrated to treat the rat pancreatic acinar cell line, AR42J, for establishing the ANP cells model. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was adopted to measure the miR-19b expression. Moreover, the mimic miRNA, miRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO) and control vector were used to transfect AR42J cells, the expression of miR-19b was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the necrotizing rate of AR42J cells was detected with AO/EB method. The expression of miR-19b was significantly higher in ANP group than in control group as displayed by the miRNA chip assay. Furthermore, after inducing necrosis of AR42J cells in vitro, the expression of miR-19b was significantly increased by 2.51±0.14 times in comparison with the control group. As revealed by qRT-PCR assay, the expression of miR-19b was 5.94±0.95 times higher in the mimic miRNA group than in the control vector group, companied with an obviously increased acinar cell necrotizing rate (50.3%±1.5% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Moreover, the expression of miR-19b in the miRNA AMO group was 0.38±0.15 times lower than in the control vector group, and the cell necrosis rate was much lower accordingly (23.1%±3.3% vs. 39.6%±2.3%, P<0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference between the control vector cells and the cells without treatment (P>0.05). The expression of miR-19b was significantly induced in ANP. In addition, up-regulation of miR-19b could promote the necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells and miR-19b deficiency could decrease the rate of pancreatic acinar cell necrosis.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31069691>Serum Bile  Levels Before and After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Their Correlation with Obesity-Related Comorbidities.</a></h2><p>The rising prevalence of morbid obesity is increasing the demand for bariatric surgery. The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced  loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile  (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the metabolic improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to metabolic and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45 ± 12 years, mean BMI 45 ± 7 kg/m) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12 months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total  acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic  changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.Serum BA are associated with glucose metabolism and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration. In conclusion, an interplay between glucose metabolism and circulating BA exists but further studies are needed.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28560290>Farnesoid X Receptor Agonist Treatment Alters Bile   but Exacerbates Liver Damage in a Piglet Model of Short-Bowel Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Options for the prevention of short-bowel syndrome-associated liver disease (SBS-ALDs) are limited and often ineffective. The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a newly emerging pharmaceutical target and FXR agonists have been shown to ameliorate cholestasis and metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of obeticholic  (OCA) treatment in preventing SBS-ALDs.Piglets underwent 75% small-bowel resection (SBS) or sham surgery (sham) and were assigned to either a daily dose of OCA (2.4 mg/kg/day) or were untreated. Clinical measures included weight gain and stool studies. Histologic features were assessed. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine bile  composition in end point bile and portal serum samples. Gene expression of key FXR targets was assessed in intestinal and hepatic tissues via quantitative polymerase chain reaction.OCA-treated SBS piglets showed decreased stool  and altered liver histology when compared with nontreated SBS piglets. OCA prevented SBS-associated taurine depletion, however, further analysis of bile and portal serum samples indicated that OCA did not prevent SBS-associated alterations in bile  composition. The expression of FXR target genes involved in bile  transport and synthesis increased within the liver of SBS piglets after OCA administration whereas, paradoxically, intestinal expression of FXR target genes were decreased by OCA administration.Administration of OCA in SBS reduced  malabsorption and altered bile  composition, but did not prevent the development of SBS-ALDs. We postulate that extensive small resection impacts the ability of the remnant intestine to respond to FXR activation.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29799205>-Based Peptide Delivery System for an Enhanced Pharmacological and Pharmacokinetic Profile of Xenopus GLP-1 Analogs.</a></h2><p>GLP-1 analogs suffer from the main disadvantage of a short in vivo half-life.  (LCA), one of the four main bile acids in the human , possesses a high albumin binding rate. We therefore envisioned that a LCA-based peptide delivery system could extend the half-life of GLP-1 analogs by facilitating the noncovalent binding of peptides to human serum albumin. On the basis of our previously identified Xenopus GLP-1 analogs (1-3), a series of LCA-modified Xenopus GLP-1 conjugates were designed (4a-4r), and the bioactivity studies of these conjugates were performed to identify compounds with balanced in vitro receptor activation potency and plasma stability. 4c, 4i, and 4r were selected, and their LCA side chains were optimized to further increase their stability, affording 5a-5c. Compound 5b showed a more increased albumin affinity and prolonged in vitro stability than that of 4i and liraglutide. In db/ db mice, 5b exhibited comparable hypoglycemic and insulinotropic activity to liraglutide and semaglutide. Importantly, the enhanced albumin affinity of 5b resulted in a prolonged in vivo antidiabetic duration. Finally, chronic treatment investigations of 5b demonstrated the therapeutic effects of 5b on HbA1c, , blood glucose, and pancreatic endocrine deficiencies on db/ db mice. Our studies revealed 5b as a promising antidiabetic candidate. Furthermore, our study suggests the derivatization of Xenopus GLP-1 analogs with LCA represents an effective strategy to develop potent long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30324765>Systematic Modulation of the Supramolecular Gelation Properties of Bile  Alkyl Amides.</a></h2><p>The self-assembly properties of nine low-molecular- gelators (LMWGs) based on bile  alkyl amides were studied in detail. Based on the results, the number of hydroxyl groups attached to the steroidal backbone plays a major role in the gelation, although the nature of the aliphatic side chain also modulates the gelation abilities. Of the 50 gel systems studied, 35 are based on  and 15 on cholic  derivatives. The deoxycholic  derivatives did not form any gels. The gelation occurred primarily in aromatic solvents and the gels manifested typical fibrous or spherical morphologies. The  C cross-polarized magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectra measured on the crystalline materials and the corresponding wet organogels were analogous, suggesting that the chemical environments, that is, the intermolecular interactions found in the two materials were similar. The single-crystal X-ray structures of all nine bile- amide derivatives studied revealed very similar molecular conformations in the solid state and gave insights into the possible intermolecular interactions in the gel state.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In this study, low molecular weight linear polyethyleneimine (2.5 kDa) was modified by conjugation to a , , and complexed with a natural polysaccharide, dermatan sulfate (DS), to mask extra cationic charges of the modified polymer. In vitro examination revealed that these modifications improved complex stability with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and transfection efficiency. This novel ternary polyplex (pDNA/3E/DS) was used to investigate if tumor-targeted radiotherapy led to enhanced accumulation and retention of gene therapy vectors in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Imaging of biodistribution revealed that tumor irradiation led to increased accumulation and retention as well as decreased off-target tissue buildup of pDNA in not only pDNA/3E/DS, but also in associated PEI-based polyplexes and commercial DNA delivery vehicles. The DS-containing complexes developed in this study displayed the greatest increase in tumor-specific pDNA delivery. These findings demonstrate a step forward in nucleic  vehicle design as well as a promising approach to overall cancer gene therapy through utilization of radiotherapy as a tool for enhanced delivery.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26273290>First serine protease inhibitor isolated from Rhinella schneideri poison.</a></h2><p>Toad secretions are a source of molecules with potential biotechnological application on a wide spectrum of diseases. Toads from the Rhinella family have two kinds of poisonous glands, namely granular and mucous glands. Rhinella schneideri toads produce granular secretions that comprise a great number of molecules, including serine proteases inhibitors. Serine proteases, such as trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, are enzymes that have a serine amino  into its catalytic site and can be found in a large number of vertebrate species and pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, the present work aims to purify a serine protease inhibitor from Rhinella schneideri granular secretions.This study presents the protocol used to purify a serine protease inhibitor from the Rhinella schneideri poison. The granular secretion was submitted to dialysis in order to separate the low molecular  compounds, which were submitted to a reversed phase-fast protein liquid chromatography fractionation step in a C2C18 column. The major fractions were tested over trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase through colorimetric assay. The inhibition tests were performed with the enzyme in absence (positive control) and presence of fractions, denatured enzyme (negative control) and the respective chromogenic substrate. Rs20 was the compound with the major inhibitory activity over chymotrypsin, inducing a delay in the formation of the chromogenic enzymatic product. The structure characterization of Rs20 was performed by high resolution electronspray ionization-mass spectrometry (HRESI-MS) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HRESI showed an intense signal suggesting the presence of bufadienolide with less than 10 ppm error. In addition, it was observed a low intense signal at m/z 399 that could be , a biosynthetic precursor of bufadienolide. Finally, GC-MS analysis applying NIST library identification reinforced this hypothesis.The current study have isolated and partially characterized the function and structure of the first bufadienolide with inhibitory action over chymotrypsin.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872803>Barley β-glucan increases fecal bile  excretion and short chain fatty  levels in mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals.</a></h2><p>The cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan has been proposed to be the result of a pleiotropic effect, which involves several biological mechanisms such as gut fermentation, inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased bile  excretion and its synthesis. However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular  (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular  promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544648>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the anthropogenic marker isolithocholic  in water.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are promising chemical markers to assess the pollution of water samples with fecal material. This study describes the optimization and validation of a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the bile  isolithocholic  (ILA). The quantification range of the optimized assay was between 0.09 and 15 μg/L. The assay was applied to environmental water samples. Most studies until now were focused on bile  fractions in the particulate phase of water samples. In order to avoid tedious sample preparation, we undertook to evaluate the dynamics and significance of ILA levels in the aqueous phase. Very low concentrations in tap and surface water samples made a pre-concentration step necessary for this matrix as well as for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. Mean recoveries for spiked water samples were between 97% and 109% for tap water and WWTP influent samples and between 102% and 136% for WWTP effluent samples. 90th percentiles of intra-plate and inter-plate coefficients of variation were below 10% for influents and below 20% for effluents and surface water. ILA concentrations were quantified in the range of 33-72 μg/L in influent, 21-49 ng/L in effluent and 18-48 ng/L in surface water samples. During wastewater treatment the ILA levels were reduced by more than 99%. ILA concentrations of influents determined by ELISA and LC-MS/MS were in good agreement. However, findings in LC-ELISA experiments suggest that the true ILA levels in concentrated samples are lower due to interfering effects of matrix compounds and/or cross-reactants. Yet, the ELISA will be a valuable tool for the performance check and comparison of WWTPs and the localization of fecal matter input into surface waters.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At the end of intervention, serum and hepatic cholesterol, triglyceride levels, hepatic gene expression of key regulators of cholesterol and  as well as fecal cholesterol and bile  excretion were determined.Dietary supplementation of the HF/HS diet with PomX and inulin decreased hepatic and serum total cholesterol. Supplementation with PomX and inulin together resulted in lower hepatic and serum total cholesterol compared to individual treatments. Compared to HF/HS control, PomX increased gene expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp7b1, key regulators of bile  synthesis pathways.

However, the implication of these mechanisms is unclear because of the low bioavailability of BBR. Because the main action site of BBR is the gut and intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of , we hypothesized that the effects of BBR on intestinal FXR signaling pathway might account for its pharmacological effectiveness. Using wild type (WT) and intestine-specific FXR knockout (FXR) mice, we found that BBR prevented the development of high--diet-induced obesity and ameliorated triglyceride accumulation in livers of WT, but not FXR mice. BBR increased conjugated bile acids in serum and their excretion in feces. Furthermore, BBR inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity in gut microbiota, and significantly increased the levels of tauro-conjugated bile acids, especially tauro-cholic (TCA), in the intestine. Both BBR and TCA treatment activated the intestinal FXR pathway and reduced the expression of fatty- translocase Cd36 in the liver. These results indicate that BBR may exert its -lowering effect primarily in the gut by modulating the turnover of bile acids and subsequently the ileal FXR signaling pathway. In summary, we provide the first evidence to suggest a new mechanism of BBR action in the intestine that involves, sequentially, inhibiting BSH, elevating TCA, and activating FXR, which lead to the suppression of hepatic expression of Cd36 that results in reduced uptake of long-chain fatty acids in the liver.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29083862>Tethering of Chemotherapeutic Drug/Imaging Agent to Bile -Phospholipid Increases the Efficacy and Bioavailability with Reduced Hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Weakly basic drugs display poor solubility and tend to precipitate in the stomach's acidic environment causing reduced oral bioavailability.

Our studies confirmed a significant reduction in the tumor volume, tumor weight, and reduced hepatotoxicity with a significant increase in median survival on LCA-Tam-PC treatment as compared to the parent drug. Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies using LCA-Tam-NBD-PC witnessed the enhanced gut absorption, blood circulation, and tumor site accumulation of phospholipid-drug conjugate leading to improved antitumor activity.

The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels.

It has been suggested that 75% accuracy and cost <$500 categorise biomarkers as cost-effective.To identify differences in faecal bile acids, faecal fat and fasting serum C4 (7a-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) among patients with IBS-D, IBS-C and healthy controls and to determine accurate, cost-effective biomarkers for clinically relevant diarrhoea and constipation.We assessed daily stool frequency and consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale) from validated bowel diaries, 48 hours total and individual faecal bile acids, 48 hours faecal fat and , fasting serum C4 and FGF19, and colonic transit by scintigraphy from healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with IBS-D and IBS-C (Rome III criteria). We utilised multivariate logistic regression to determine biomarkers of clinically significant diarrhoea or constipation based on stool frequency, consistency and .Among the 126 HV (44M/82F, 37.5 ± 10.9 years [SD]), 64 IBS-D (5M/59F, 41.9 ± 12.2 years), and 30 IBS-C (0M/30F, 44.6 ± 10 years) patients, there were significant differences between all groups in stool , frequency, and consistency; in addition, there were differences in colonic transit at 48 hours, faecal fat, and total and individual faecal bile acids between IBS-D and IBS-C. Reduced total and primary faecal bile acids and increased faecal  were significant predictors of decreased faecal , frequency and consistency with AUC > 0.82 (sensitivity >76%, specificity >72%). Total and primary faecal bile acids and faecal fat were significant predictors of increased stool , frequency and consistency with AUC > 0.71 (sensitivity >55%, specificity >74%).The faecal parameters had a 11.5 positive likelihood ratio in predicting elevated faecal .Faecal bile acids and faecal fat are cost-effective and accurate biomarkers associated with significant bowel dysfunction among IBS-D and IBS-C patients.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p></html>
