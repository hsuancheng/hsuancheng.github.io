<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26633490>Anti-Diabetic Effects of  and Rotundic Acid.</a></h2><p>Anti-diabetic effects of  (MEA) and rotundic acid (RA) were examined. MEA or RA at 0.05% or 0.1% was supplied to diabetic mice for six weeks. The intake of MEA, not RA, dose-dependently lowered plasma glucose level and increased plasma insulin level. MEA, not RA, intake dose-dependently reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and fibrinogen level; as well as restored antithrombin-III and protein C activities in plasma of diabetic mice. MEA or RA intake decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma and liver. Histological data agreed that MEA or RA intake lowered hepatic lipid droplets, determined by ORO stain. MEA intake dose-dependently declined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione levels, increased glutathione content and maintained the activity of glutathione reductase and catalase in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. MEA intake dose-dependently reduced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. RA intake at 0.1% declined cardiac and renal levels of these inflammatory factors. These data indicated that MEA improved glycemic control and hemostatic imbalance, lowered lipid accumulation, and attenuated oxidative and inflammatory stress in diabetic mice. Thus,  could be considered as an anti-diabetic agent.</p><p>Keyword: oxygen</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27728894> protects against hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in retinal microvascular endothelial cells via ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p> (MA) is an abundant triterpenoid in Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. (Apiaceae) that has been used as a wound-healing, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent. Up to now, the effects of MA against oxidative stress remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of MA and its mechanisms on hypoxia-induced human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (hRMECs). hRMECs were pre-treated with different concentrations of MA (0-50μM) for 30min before being incubated under hypoxia condition (37°C, 5% CO and 95% N). Cell apoptosis was evaluated with MTT assay and TUNEL staining, and the expression of apoptosis- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related molecules was assessed with western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Intracellular ROS level was evaluated using DCFH-DA. Intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated using related Kits. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) nuclear translocation was assessed with western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence staining. MA significantly reduced oxidative stress in hypoxia-induced hRMECs, as shown by increased cell viability, SOD and GSH-PX leakage, decreased TUNEL- and ROS-positive cell ratio, LDH and MDA leakage, caspase-3 and -9 activity, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, MA also attenuated hypoxia-induced ER stress in hRMECs, as shown by reduced mRNA levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CHOP), protein levels of cleaved activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring kinase/endonuclease 1 alpha (IRE1α), phosphorylation of pancreatic ER stress kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), cleaved caspase-12 and ATF4 translocation to nucleus. The current study indicated that the regulation of oxidative stress and ER stress by MA would be a promising therapy to reverse the process and development of hypoxia-induced hRMECs dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
