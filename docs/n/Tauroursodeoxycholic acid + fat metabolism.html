Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common chronic liver disorder in developed countries, is characterized by the abnormal retention of excess  within hepatocytes and predisposes individuals to liver cancer. We previously reported that the levels of Lissencephaly 1 (LIS1, also known as PAFAH1B1) are down-regulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Following up on this observation, we found that genetic deletion of  in the mouse liver increases  accumulation and inflammation in this organ. Further analysis revealed that loss of  triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduces triglyceride secretion. Attenuation of ER stress by addition of  (TUDCA) diminished  accumulation in the -deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, the Golgi stacks were disorganized in -deficient liver cells. Of note, the  liver-knockout mice exhibited increased hepatocyte ploidy and accelerated development of liver cancer after exposure to the liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced  levels can spur the development of liver diseases from steatosis to liver cancer and provide a useful model for delineating the molecular pathways that lead to these diseases.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22374970>-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in liver cells results in two distinct outcomes: adaptation with enhanced insulin signaling or insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Chronically elevated fatty acids contribute to insulin resistance through poorly defined mechanisms. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the subsequent unfolded protein response (UPR) have been implicated in -induced insulin resistance. However, the UPR is also a fundamental mechanism required for cell adaptation and survival. We aimed to distinguish the adaptive and deleterious effects of -induced ER stress on hepatic insulin action. Exposure of human hepatoma HepG2 cells or mouse primary hepatocytes to the saturated fatty acid palmitate enhanced ER stress in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, exposure of HepG2 cells to prolonged mild ER stress activation induced by low levels of thapsigargin, tunicamycin, or palmitate augmented insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. This chronic mild ER stress subsequently attenuated the acute stress response to high-level palmitate challenge. In contrast, exposure of HepG2 cells or hepatocytes to severe ER stress induced by high levels of palmitate was associated with reduced insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis, as well as increased expression of glucose-6-phosphatase. Attenuation of ER stress using chemical chaperones (trimethylamine N-oxide or ) partially protected against the -induced changes in insulin signaling. These findings in liver cells suggest that mild ER stress associated with chronic low-level palmitate exposure induces an adaptive UPR that enhances insulin signaling and protects against the effects of high-level palmitate. However, in the absence of chronic adaptation, severe ER stress induced by high-level palmitate exposure induces deleterious UPR signaling that contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177958>Reduction of endoplasmic reticulum stress using chemical chaperones or Grp78 overexpression does not protect muscle cells from palmitate-induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a novel link between elevated fatty acids levels, obesity and insulin resistance in liver and adipose tissue. However, it is unknown whether ER stress also contributes to -induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, the major tissue responsible of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Here, we investigated the possible role of ER stress in palmitate-induced alterations of insulin action, both in vivo, in gastrocnemius of high-palm diet fed mice, and in vitro, in palmitate-treated C(2)C(12) myotubes. We demonstrated that 8 weeks of high-palm diet increased the expression of ER stress markers in muscle of mice, whereas ex-vivo insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation was not altered in this tissue. In addition, exposure of C(2)C(12) myotubes to either tuncamycine or palmitate induced ER stress and altered insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation. However, alleviation of ER stress by either TUDCA or 4-PBA treatments, or by overexpressing Grp78, did not restore palmitate-induced reduction of insulin-stimulated PKB phosphorylation in C(2)C(12) myotubes. This work highlights that, even ER stress is associated with palmitate-induced alterations of insulin signaling, ER stress is likely not the major culprit of this effect in myotubes, suggesting that the previously proposed link between ER stress and insulin resistance is less important in skeletal muscle than in adipose tissue and liver.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Prolonged bile salt pool depletion is associated with down-regulation of maximum taurocholate transport and decreased canalicular membrane specific bile salt binding sites. This study was undertaken to investigate: a) whether adaptive down-regulation of maximum hepatic bile salt transport occurs to the same extent for bile acids of different hydrophobicity; and b) the role of microtubule-dependent vesicular pathway in the adaptive changes of bile salt transport capacity.Male rats were subjected to 24-h or 48-h external biliary diversion to induce bile salt pool depletion. Basal bile flow, bile salt secretion and  secretion, maximum secretory rate of three bile salts of different hydrophobicity (tauroursodeoxycholate, taurocholate and taurochenodeoxycholate) and changes in the biliary excretion of two markers of the microtubule-dependent vesicular pathway (horseradish peroxidase and polyethyleneglycol molecular weight-900) were measured in control and bile salt-depleted rats. Taurocholate-stimulated horseradish peroxidase biliary excretion was also assessed in order to define whether the restoration of bile salt flux across the hepatocytes increased the excretion of this marker in bile salt-depleted rats.The reduction in the maximum secretory rate of the three bile salts under study observed after prolonged biliary diversion was clearly related to their hydrophobicity, with greater reduction for taurochenodeoxycholate and smaller reduction for tauroursodeoxycholate, compared with taurocholate. The biliary excretion of vesicular transport markers was significantly reduced in bile salt-depleted rats. However, when stimulated by taurocholate, biliary excretion of horseradish peroxidase was similar to controls.The magnitude of the decrease of the hepatic bile salt maximum transport capacity seen after bile salt pool depletion is directly related to the hydrophobicity of the bile salt infused. A functionally depressed vesicular transport pathway appears to be also a contributing factor to this phenomenon.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804416>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy reduces hepatic steatosis while increasing serum bile acids in a weight-loss-independent manner.</a></h2><p>Our objective was to investigate the role of bile acids in hepatic steatosis reduction after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).High  diet (HFD)-induced obese C57Bl/6 mice were randomized to VSG, Sham operation (Sham), Sham operation with pair feeding to VSG (Sham-PF), or nonsurgical controls (Naïve). All mice were on HFD until sacrifice. Mice were observed postsurgery and data for body weight, body composition, metabolic parameters, serum bile acid level and composition were collected. Further hepatic gene expression by mRNA-seq and RT-PCR analysis was assessed.VSG and Sham-PF mice lost equal weight postsurgery while VSG mice had the lowest hepatic triglyceride content at sacrifice. The VSG mice had elevated serum bile acid levels that positively correlated with maximal weight loss. Serum bile composition in the VSG group had increased cholic and . These bile acid composition changes in VSG mice explained observed downregulation of hepatic lipogenic and bile acid synthetic genes.VSG in obese mice results in greater hepatic steatosis reduction than seen with caloric restriction alone. VSG surgery increases serum bile acids that correlate with weight lost postsurgery and changes serum bile composition that could explain suppression of hepatic genes responsible for lipogenesis.Copyright © 2013 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26581663>Undernourishment in utero Primes Hepatic Steatosis in Adult Mice Offspring on an Obesogenic Diet; Involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.</a></h2><p>In order to investigate the possible involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the developmental origins of hepatic steatosis associated with undernourishment in utero, we herein employed a fetal undernourishment mouse model by maternal caloric restriction in three cohorts; cohort 1) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 9 weeks of age (wks) before a high fat diet (HFD), cohort 2) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks, cohort 3) assessment of hepatic steatosis and the ER stress response at 22 wks on a HFD after the alleviation of ER stress with a chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), from 17 wks to 22 wks. Undernourishment in utero significantly deteriorated hepatic steatosis and led to the significant integration of the ER stress response on a HFD at 17 wks. The alleviation of ER stress by the TUDCA treatment significantly improved the parameters of hepatic steatosis in pups with undernourishment in utero, but not in those with normal nourishment in utero at 22 wks. These results suggest the pivotal involvement of the integration of ER stress in the developmental origins of hepatic steatosis in association with undernourishment in utero.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23150771>Obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress causes chronic inflammation in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Adipose tissue plays a central role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis under normal conditions. Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and adipose tissue dysfunction. In this study, we observed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the inflammatory response occurred in adipose tissue of mice fed a high- diet for a period of 16 weeks. After 16 weeks of feeding, ER stress markers increased and chronic inflammation occurred in adipose tissue. We found that ER stress is induced by free fatty acid (FFA)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and up-regulated gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Oral administration to obese mice of chemical chaperons, which alleviate ER stress, improved chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, followed by the suppression of increased body weight and improved insulin signaling. These results indicate that ER stress plays important pathophysiological roles in obesity-induced adipose tissue dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029706>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Induced Upregulation of STARD1 Promotes Acetaminophen-Induced Acute Liver Failure.</a></h2><p>Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF). Mitochondrial SH3BP5 (also called SAB) and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediate the hepatotoxic effects of APAP. We investigated the involvement of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STARD1), a mitochondrial cholesterol transporter, in this process and sensitization by valproic acid (VPA), which depletes glutathione and stimulates steroidogenesis.Nonfasted C57BL/6J mice (control) and mice with liver-specific deletion of STARD1 (Stard1), SAB (Sab), or JNK1 and JNK2 (Jnk1+2) were given VPA with or without APAP. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry and for APAP , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial function. Adult human hepatocytes were transplanted into Fah/Rag2/Il2rg/NOD (FRGN) mice to create mice with humanized livers.Administration of VPA before administration of APAP increased the severity of liver damage in control mice. The combination of VPA and APAP increased expression of CYP2E1, formation of NAPQI-protein adducts, and depletion of glutathione from liver tissues of control mice, resulting in ER stress and the upregulation of STARD1. Livers from control mice given VPA and APAP accumulated cholesterol in the mitochondria and had sustained mitochondrial depletion of glutathione and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of ER stress, by administration of  to control mice, prevented upregulation of STARD1 in liver and protected the mice from hepatoxicity following administration of VPA and APAP. Administration of N-acetylcysteine to control mice prevented VPA- and APAP-induced ER stress and liver injury. Stard1 mice were resistant to induction of ALF by VPA and APAP, despite increased mitochondrial levels of glutathione and phosphorylated JNK; we made similar observations in fasted Stard1 mice given APAP alone. Sab mice or Jnk1+2 mice did not develop ALF following administration of VPA and APAP. The ability of VPA to increase the severity of APAP-induced liver damage was observed in FRGN mice with humanized liver.In studies of mice, we found that upregulation of STARD1 following ER stress mediates APAP hepatoxicity via SH3BP5 and phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Following treatment with TNF‑α, cell viability was determined by MTT assay to select the optimum concentration and duration of TNF‑α treatment in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Intracellular  droplet dispersion and glycerin content in culture media were determined to evaluate the effect of TUDCA on TNF‑α‑induced lipolysis in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes. Western blotting was performed to detect protein expression levels of perilipin‑A and protein markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress: Immunoglobulin‑binding protein (BiP), inositol‑requiring enzyme (IRE), c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylated (p)‑IRE and p‑JNK. Following treatment with 50 ng/ml TNF‑α for 24 h, glycerin content increased significantly and  droplets were dispersed. Glycerin content was reduced significantly and dispersal of  droplets reduced following pretreatment of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with 1 mmol/l TUDCA. TNF‑α additionally activated the expression of BiP, p‑IRE and p‑JNK in a time‑dependent manner; following pretreatment of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes with 1 mmol/l TUDCA, the expression levels of these three proteins decreased. Therefore, TUDCA may inhibit TNF-α-induced lipolysis in 3T3‑L1 adipocytes and reduce production of free fatty acids. Its underlying molecular mechanisms are potentially associated with the inhibition of activation of the IRE‑JNK signaling pathway, which influences perilipin-A expression levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8387948>Evidence for involvement of oxygen free radicals in bile acid toxicity to isolated rat hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>The mechanisms by which hydrophobic bile acids are toxic to the liver are unknown. To determine whether the generation of free radicals is involved in the hepatotoxicity of bile acids, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were incubated with individual bile acids (100 to 200 mumol/L) for 4 hr. Hepatocyte viability (trypan blue exclusion) declined to 40% to 50% in incubations with taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurolithocholic acid, whereas taurocholic acid and  were not toxic.  peroxidation was significantly associated with the loss of cell viability. Preincubation with different antioxidants-D-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, D-alpha-tocopherol, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, superoxide dismutase, catalase, superoxide dismutase + catalase, deferoxamine or apotransferrin-protected against the loss of viability and inhibited  peroxidation in cells incubated with 200 mumol/L taurolithocholic acid. alpha-Tocopheryl succinate added after 90 min of incubation with taurolithocholic acid ameliorated further hepatocyte toxicity and  peroxidation. Incubation of hepatocytes with 500 mumol/L of taurochenodeoxycholic acid or taurolithocholic acid under a low oxygen tension (9% O2) similarly caused  peroxidation and cell injury that was reversed by preincubation with D-alpha-tocopherol.

However, its function in hepatic  is unclear. Here, we identified a role for mGPDH in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Specifically, mGPDH expression and activity were lower in fatty livers from patients and mice with NAFLD (ob/ob, high- diet [HFD] and db/db). Liver-specific depletion of mGPDH in mice or mGPDH knockdown in cultured hepatocytes exacerbated diet-induced triglyceride accumulation and steatosis through enhanced lipogenesis. RNA-sequencing revealed that mGPDH regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins and processes. mGPDH deletion exacerbated tunicamycin (ER stress inducer)-induced hepatic steatosis, whereas  (ER stress inhibitor) rescued mGPDH depletion-induced steatosis on an HFD. Moreover, ER stress induced by mGPDH depletion could be abrogated by the intracellular Ca chelator 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane N,N,N´,N´-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) inhibitor cyclosporine A, or cyclophilin-D (Cyp-D) knockdown. mGPDH promoting Cyp-D ubiquitination was also observed. Finally, liver-specific mGPDH overexpression attenuated hepatic steatosis in ob/ob and HFD mice. Conclusion: mGPDH is a pivotal regulator of hepatic . Its deficiency induces ER stress by suppressing Cyp-D ubiquitination, a key regulator of the mitochondrial Ca conductance channel mPTP, and results in hepatic steatosis. mGPDH may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7582394>Effect of  on biliary  composition. A dose-response study.</a></h2><p> has been proposed for the treatment of hepatobiliary disease, but data on the enrichment of biliary  pool and on changes of biliary lipids after administration of the compound are scarce. We studied the composition of biliary lipids in a series of 33 patients with radiolucent stones, before and after treatment with , 3.5 - 16.6 mg/kg/day for 4 - 6 weeks. Duodenal bile was collected with the Entero-Test after gallbladder contraction.  administration produced the following dose-dependent effects: a linear decrease of cholesterol saturation (r = 0.59, p < 0.001); a non-linear increase of the percent of ursodeoxycholic acid in bile (r = 0.59, p < 0.001); a non-linear increase of the fraction of ursodeoxycholate conjugated with taurine. At the dose of 11 mg/kg per day, cholesterol saturation was 80%, ursodeoxycholic acid represented about 45% of biliary bile acids, and about half of UDCA was conjugated with taurine. Biliary bile acids were repeatedly measured in 6 patients during long-term treatment with 9.7 - 12.1 mg/kg. The fraction of  decreased progressively from 67.6% +/- 10.5 to 29.1% +/- 5.  is as effective as ursodeoxycholic acid on a molar basis in reducing biliary cholesterol saturation and in enriching bile with ursodeoxycholate.

Conversely, antioxidant properties of  (TUDC), a hydrophilic bile acid, have been suggested as a possible mechanism by which TUDC confers its beneficial effect in a variety of diseases. We have investigated the effect of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDC), a hydrophobic bile acid and TUDC on  peroxidation using a pure  system both in the presence and absence of iron ions. Neither TDC nor TUDC showed any effect on spontaneous  peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes or sodium arachidonate solution. This lack of effect excludes the possibility of direct prooxidant or antioxidant properties for TDC and TUDC. Addition of ferrous ions (0.1 mM) to the  system brought about a linear increase in  peroxidation with time. The presence of TDC caused an increase in the rate and extent of iron-stimulated  peroxidation. The propensity of bile acids to increase iron-induced  peroxidation was related to hydrophobicity of the individual bile acids, with the highest effect observed with taurolithocholic acid, whereas TUDC did not have any influence. The TDC-induced increase in the iron-stimulated  peroxidation was concentration dependent. Addition of TUDC (10 mM) completely abolished the effect of TDC (2 mM) on iron-induced  peroxidation. This finding suggests that TUDC does not function as an antioxidant per se but may prevent  peroxidation caused by TDC. In conclusion, only in the presence of iron ions, hydrophobic bile acids may enhance  peroxidation. TUDC has no antioxidant activity per se but may counter the TDC-induced increase in iron-stimulated  peroxidation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859785>Increased monocyte-derived reactive oxygen species in type 2 diabetes: role of endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit increased oxidative stress in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including monocytes; however, the mechanisms remain unknown. What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding of this study is that factors contained within the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes can contribute to increased oxidative stress in monocytes, making them more adherent to endothelial cells. We show that these effects are largely mediated by the interaction between endoplasmic reticulum stress and NADPH oxidase activity. Recent evidence suggests that exposure of human monocytes to glucolipotoxic media to mimic the composition of plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) results in the induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The extent to which these findings translate to patients with T2D remains unclear. Thus, we first measured ROS (dihydroethidium fluorescence) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood of T2D patients (n = 8) and compared the values with age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 8). The T2D patients exhibited greater basal intracellular ROS (mean ± SD, +3.4 ± 1.4-fold; P < 0.05) compared with control subjects. Next, the increase in ROS in PBMCs isolated from T2D patients was partly recapitulated in cultured human monocytes (THP-1 cells) exposed to plasma from T2D patients for 36 h (+1.3 ± 0.08-fold versus plasma from control subjects; P < 0.05). In addition, we found that increased ROS formation in THP-1 cells treated with T2D plasma was NADPH oxidase derived and led to increased endothelial cell adhesion (+1.8 ± 0.5-fold; P < 0.05) and lipid uptake (+1.3 ± 0.3-fold; P < 0.05). Notably, we found that T2D plasma-induced monocyte ROS and downstream functional effects were abolished by treating cells with , a chemical chaperone known to inhibit ER stress. Collectively, these data indicate that monocyte ROS production with T2D can be attributed, in part, to signals from the circulating environment. Furthermore, an interplay between ER stress and NADPH oxidase activity contributes to ROS production and may be a mechanism mediating endothelial cell adhesion and foam cell formation in T2D.© 2016 The Authors.

High cholesterol levels in OA chondrocytes leads to decreased membrane fluidity and blocks the signaling cascade associated with the expression of chondrogenic genes. It is known that bile acid plays a role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and the digestion of fats in the human body.  (TUDCA), as a member of the bile acid family, also aids in the transport of cellular cholesterol. In this study, we hypothesized that TUDCA might be able to promote the restoration of OA cartilage by reducing membrane cholesterol levels in OA chondrocytes and by stimulating the chondrogenic signaling cascade. To assess this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of TUDCA on degenerated chondrocytes isolated from patients with OA. Importantly, treatment with TUDCA at sub-micellar concentrations (2500 μM) significantly increased cell proliferation and Cyclin D1 expression compared with the controls. In addition, the expression of chondrogenic marker genes (SOX9, COL2, and ACAN), proteins (SOX9 and COL2), and glycosaminoglycan (Chondroitin sulfate) was much higher in the TUDCA-treated group compared to the controls. We also found that TUDCA treatment significantly reduced the intracellular cholesterol levels in the chondrocytes and increased membrane fluidity. Furthermore, the stability of TGF receptor 1 and activity of focal adhesion proteins were also increased following TUDCA treatment. Together, these results demonstrated that TUDCA could be used as an alternative treatment for the restoration of OA cartilage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9537863>Ethanol-induced changes of intracellular thiol compartmentation and protein redox status in the rat liver: effect of tauroursodeoxycholate.</a></h2><p>Ethanol impairs cellular antioxidant defense and protein . Hydrophilic bile acids are protective against ethanol-induced cytotoxicity. This study investigated the compartmentation of intracellular thiol and protein redox status after acute ethanol intoxication in the liver and the effect of tauroursodeoxycholate pretreatment.The concentrations of total glutathione, glutathione bound to proteins, sulfhydryl proteins, carbonyl proteins and malondialdehyde were measured in hepatic cytosol, mitochondria and nuclei after oral administration of 25% ethanol (4 g/kg) or isocaloric carbohydrate solution to rats. The metabolisms of ethanol and acetaldehyde were investigated by giving 4-methylpyrazole (1 mmol/kg i.p.) or cyanamide (15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to ethanol ingestion. One group of rats received tauroursodeoxycholate (12 mg/kg p.os) 1 h before ethanol ingestion.Ethanol significantly decreased the glutathione concentrations. Significant increases in glutathione bound to proteins, carbonyl protein and malondialdehyde concentrations were also noted, especially at the mitochondrial level. Enhanced carbonyl protein formation was also observed (p < 0.01). The inhibition of acetaldehyde , but not ethanol , exaggerated the alterations produced by ethanol. Pretreatment with tauroursodeoxycholate significantly reduced  and protein oxidation, particularly in mitochondria. By contrast, no changes were observed in glutathione content and compartmentation.Ethanol intoxication differentially impairs thiol and protein redox status in the subcellular fractions of rat liver. These alterations seem dependent on acetaldehyde rather than ethanol. Tauroursodeoxycholate administration protects proteins and lipids from ethanol-induced oxidative damage without influencing the glutathione content and compartmentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9458268>Activation of protein kinase C alpha and delta by bile acids: correlation with bile acid structure and diacylglycerol formation.</a></h2><p>The feedback repression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase transcriptional activity and mRNA levels by taurocholate (TCA) occurs via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signal. To determine whether bile acids could activate PKC indirectly via generation of diacylglycerol (DG), their effects on DG levels in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were determined using a DG kinase assay. To determine whether bile acids might activate PKC isozymes more directly, their effects on PKC alpha and delta purified from baculovirus expression systems were examined in phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine/Triton X-100 (PS/PC/TX) mixed micelles. Addition of tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA), taurocholate (TCA), or taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) (50 microM) to the cells rapidly (15 min) increased DG content in cultured rat hepatocytes to 105%, 155%, and 130%, respectively, as compared to untreated control cultures. Addition of TCA increased PKC alpha specific activity with EC50 of approximately 400 nM; maximal activity was observed with 5 microM. Other taurine-conjugated bile acids (5 microM) increased PKC alpha specific activity (pmol/min/microg protein) in proportion to their relative hydrophobicity: PS/PC/TX 17 +/- 2; + TUDCA 29 +/- 18; + TCA 68 +/-13; + TDCA 166 +/- 21; and, taurochenodeoxycholate 178 +/- 20 (P vs. PS/PC/TX = 0.54, 0.019, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively); unconjugated bile acids gave similar results (r2 for activity vs. hydrophobicity index 0.59). Taurine-conjugated bile acid interaction enthalpies, as determined by dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine chromatography, were more highly correlated (r2 = 0.96) with PKC alpha activation than with the hydrophobicity index. TCA also stimulated the activity of purified PKCdelta with EC50 of approximately 150 nM and maximally (2.7-fold) at 1 microM.

ATX-LPA signalling is involved in multiple biological and pathophysiological processes, including vasculogenesis, fibrosis, cholestatic pruritus and tumour progression. ATX has a tripartite active site, combining a hydrophilic groove, a hydrophobic lipid-binding pocket and a tunnel of unclear function. We present crystal structures of rat ATX bound to 7α-hydroxycholesterol and the bile salt tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA), showing how the tunnel selectively binds steroids. A structure of ATX simultaneously harbouring TUDCA in the tunnel and LPA in the pocket, together with kinetic analysis, reveals that bile salts act as partial non-competitive inhibitors of ATX, thereby attenuating LPA receptor activation. This unexpected interplay between ATX-LPA signalling and select steroids, notably natural bile salts, provides a molecular basis for the emerging association of ATX with disorders associated with increased circulating levels of bile salts. Furthermore, our findings suggest potential clinical implications in the use of steroid drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11181071>Amyloid beta-peptide disrupts mitochondrial membrane  and protein structure: protective role of tauroursodeoxycholate.</a></h2><p>Mitochondria have been implicated in the cytotoxicity of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta), which accumulates as senile plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) modulates cell death, in part, by preventing mitochondrial membrane perturbation. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of isolated mitochondria, we tested the hypothesis that A beta acts locally in mitochondrial membranes to induce oxidative injury, leading to increased membrane permeability and subsequent release of caspase-activating factors. Further, we intended to determine the role of TUDC at preventing A beta-induced mitochondrial membrane dysfunction. The results demonstrate oxidative injury of mitochondrial membranes during exposure to A beta and reveal profound structural changes, including modified membrane  polarity and disrupted protein mobility. Cytochrome c is released from the intermembrane space of mitochondria as a consequence of increased membrane permeability. TUDC, but not cyclosporine A, almost completely abrogated A beta-induced perturbation of mitochondrial membrane structure. We conclude that A beta directly induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria through a mechanism that is accompanied by profound effects on mitochondrial membrane redox status,  polarity, and protein order. TUDC can directly suppress A beta-induced disruption of the mitochondrial membrane structure, suggesting a neuroprotective role for this bile salt.Copyright 2001 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19834331> attenuates  accumulation in endoplasmic reticulum-stressed macrophages.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress provoked under diabetic conditions augments the expression of scavenger receptors on macrophages, promoting the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake and atherogenesis. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) attenuates  accumulation in macrophages subjected to ER stress.Cultured human macrophages were subjected to ER stress by treating them with tunicamycin.  uptake by macrophages subjected to ER stress in the presence or absence of TUDCA was assessed by oil red O staining and by assessing the cellular uptake of Dil-oxidized low-density lipoprotein by fluorescence measurement. Protein levels and phosphorylation status of ER stress markers, insulin-signaling molecules, and scavenger receptor were assessed by Western blotting.Treatment of cultured human macrophages with the ER stressor tunicamycin caused an increase in the protein levels of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD-36) and augmentation of  uptake both of which were inhibited by TUDCA. TUDCA treatment inhibited tunicamycin-induced ER stress as evidenced by the attenuation of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2a and glucose reactive protein-78. In addition, TUDCA improved insulin signaling in macrophages by augmenting Akt phosphorylation and blunting c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity.Inhibition of macrophage ER stress may represent a potential strategy in preventing atherogenesis under diabetic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859643>Undernourishment in utero and hepatic steatosis in later life: A potential issue in Japanese people.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of  syndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD in Japan has nearly doubled in the last 10-15 years. Increasing evidence supports undernourishment in utero being causatively connected with the risk of NAFLD in later life. Low body mass index (BMI) has been common among Japanese women of childbearing age for several decades due to their strong desire to be thin. It is plausible that insufficient maternal energy intake by pregnant Japanese women may underlie the rapid increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in Japan. In order to clarify the mechanisms by which undernourishment in utero primes adult hepatic steatosis, we developed a mouse model of fetal undernourishment with a hepatic fat deposit-prone phenotype on an obesogenic high fat diet in later life. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response parameters were activated concomitantly with the deterioration of hepatic steatosis and also that the alleviation of ER stress with the chemical chaperone,  (TUDCA), significantly improved hepatic steatosis. Therefore, undernourishment in utero may program the future integration of ER stress in the liver on an obesogenic diet in later life and also induce the deterioration of hepatic steatosis. These results also provide an insight into interventions for the potential high-risk population of NAFLD, such as those born small or exposed to maternal undernourishment during the fetal period, with the alleviation of ER stress by dietary supplements and/or specific food including chaperones.© 2016 Japanese Teratology Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485902>Vasonatrin peptide attenuates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and underlying mechanisms.</a></h2><p>Diabetes mellitus increases morbidity/mortality of ischemic heart disease. Although atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide reduce the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion damage in nondiabetic rats, whether vasonatrin peptide (VNP), the artificial synthetic chimera of atrial natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide, confers cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, especially in diabetic patients, is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of VNP on ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetic rats and to further elucidate its mechanisms. The high- diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion operation. VNP treatment (100 μg/kg iv, 10 min before reperfusion) significantly improved the instantaneous first derivation of left ventricle pressure (±LV dP/dtmax) and LV systolic pressure and reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, apoptosis index, caspase-3 activity, plasma creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Moreover, VNP inhibited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by suppressing glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). These effects were mimicked by 8-bromine-cyclic guanosinemonophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a cGMP analog, whereas they were inhibited by KT-5823, the selective inhibitor of PKG. In addition, pretreatment with  (TUDCA), a specific inhibitor of ER stress, could not further promote the VNP's cardioprotective effect in diabetic rats. In vitro H9c2 cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and incubated with or without VNP (10(-8) mol/l). Gene knockdown of PKG1α with siRNA blunted VNP inhibition of ER stress and apoptosis, while overexpression of PKG1α resulted in significant decreased ER stress and apoptosis. VNP protects the diabetic heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting ER stress via the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. These results suggest that VNP may have potential therapeutic value for the diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3628457>Effect of tauroursodeoxycholate feeding, with or without taurine supplementation on hepatic bile acids and cholesterol  in the hamster.</a></h2><p>This study reports the effect of short-term  (TUDCA) and of TUDCA with addition of taurine on the  composition of gallbladder bile, on cholesterol and bile acid synthesis and intestinal excretion, in the female hamsters. After either one or two weeks, the percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in bile of treated hamsters significantly increased. Both treatments (TUDCA alone or TUDCA + taurine) decreased the percentage of cholic acid without affecting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase or cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities. Sterol and bile acid content of the feces collected during the period of the study did not show any difference. Bile acid glycine to taurine conjugation ratio (G/T ratio) in TUDCA treated animals was significantly higher in respect to controls after only one week of treatment.

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of leptin resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we show that increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the hypothalamus of obese mice inhibits leptin receptor signaling. The genetic imposition of reduced ER capacity in mice results in severe leptin resistance and leads to a significant augmentation of obesity on a high- diet. Moreover, we show that chemical chaperones, 4-phenyl butyric acid (PBA), and  (TUDCA), which have the ability to decrease ER stress, act as leptin-sensitizing agents. Taken together, our results may provide the basis for a novel treatment of obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796972>Bile acid signaling in : metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of  and bile acid markers linked to anti-obesity and anti-diabetes in mice.</a></h2><p>Bile acid synthesis is the major pathway for catabolism of cholesterol. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver and plays an important role in regulating , glucose and energy . Transgenic mice overexpressing CYP7A1 (CYP7A1-tg mice) were resistant to high- diet (HFD)-induced obesity, fatty liver, and diabetes. However the mechanism of resistance to HFD-induced obesity of CYP7A1-tg mice has not been determined. In this study, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of CYP7A1-tg mice were analyzed to explore the metabolic alterations in CYP7A1-tg mice that govern the protection against obesity and insulin resistance by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analyses. Lipidomics analysis identified seven  markers including lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and ceramides that were significantly decreased in serum of HFD-fed CYP7A1-tg mice. Metabolomics analysis identified 13 metabolites in bile acid synthesis including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, , taurocholic acid, and tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-β-MCA) that differed between CYP7A1-tg and wild-type mice. Notably, T-β-MCA, an antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was significantly increased in intestine of CYP7A1-tg mice. This study suggests that reducing 12α-hydroxylated bile acids and increasing intestinal T-β-MCA may reduce high  diet-induced increase of phospholipids, sphingomyelins and ceramides, and ameliorate diabetes and obesity.

(TUDCA) modulates the apoptotic threshold, in part, by preventing Bax translocation both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms by which Bax induces and TUDCA inhibits release of cytochrome c are unclear. We show here that recombinant Bax protein induced cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria without detectable swelling. Co-incubation with TUDCA prevented efflux of mitochondrial factors and proteolytic processing of caspases in cytosolic extracts. Spectroscopic analyses of mitochondria exposed to Bax revealed increased polarity and fluidity of the membrane  core as well as altered protein order, indicative of Bax binding, together with loss of spin-label paramagnetism, characteristic of oxidative damage. TUDCA markedly abrogated the Bax-induced membrane perturbation. In conclusion, our results indicate that Bax protein directly induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria through a mechanism that does not require the permeability transition. Rather, it is accompanied by changes in the organization of membrane lipids and proteins. TUDCA is a potent inhibitor of Bax association with mitochondria. Thus, TUDCA modulates apoptosis by suppressing mitochondrial membrane perturbation through pathways that are also independent of the mitochondrial permeability transition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9187880>Membrane cholesterol content of cholesterol/phospholipid vesicles determines the susceptibility to both damage and protection by bile salts: implications for bile physiology.</a></h2><p>To investigate the effect of membrane  composition on the susceptibility to bile salt damage and protection.Artificial model cholesterol/phospholipid (c/p) membranes (vesicles) with a varying cholesterol (0-15 mM) and phospholipid content (3-30 mM), and with a c/p ratio ranging up to 1.70, were prepared by sonication. We examined the effect of incubation with increasing concentrations of either tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC), taurocholate (TC) or taurodeoxycholate (TDC) alone, or with proportionally varying mixtures of TUDC and TDC.Vesicle integrity was assessed by the change in optical absorbance at 340 nm.Absorption of the bile salt-vesicle mixture decreased, with increasing bile salt concentration and hydrophobicity: TUDC less than TC less than TDC. Moreover, bile salt-induced damage also depended on membrane composition: vesicles containing more than 5 mM cholesterol and with a c/p ratio greater than 0.8 were less likely to be solubilized by 30 mM bile salt. Similarly, only in cholesterol-rich vesicles (c/p > 0.5) was a protective effect of TUDC against membrane disruption by TDC revealed upon incubation with various TUDC/TDC mixtures.Apart from the bile salt concentration and hydrophobicity, the cholesterol content of vesicles is pivotal, both in the bile salt-induced solubilization of cholesterol/phospholipid vesicles and in the potency of TUDC to prevent this.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8728319>Adsorption of mixtures of bile salt taurine conjugates to lecithin-cholesterol membranes: implications for bile salt toxicity and cytoprotection.</a></h2><p>Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC), a relatively hydrophilic bile salt, reduces disruption of cholesterol-rich membranes by more hydrophobic bile salts such as taurocholate (TC), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), or taurodeoxycholate (TDC). We examined the interactions of these bile salts in adsorption to large unilamellar vesicles to determine whether TUDC may stabilize membranes by preventing adsorption of more toxic bile salts. Fractional adsorption was quantified by rapid ultrafiltration. Adsorption coefficient Ai was defined for each bile salt i as ([bound i]/[free i])/[lecithin]. Affinity of different bile salts for lecithin vesicles varied with their relative hydrophobicity, increasing in the order TUDC < TC << TCDC < or = TDC. Ai of each bile salt fell with its accumulation on membranes, reaching a minimum at bound bile salt/lecithin mole ratio (B:L) between 0.05 and 0.1, then increasing with formation of higher-affinity mixed micelles. Inclusion of cholesterol in vesicles reduced Ai of all bile salts. In heterologous binding studies at submicellar concentrations, Ai of each bile salt varied with total B:L but was independent of the specific bile salts present on the membrane. Addition of TUDC to TDC reduced binding of TDC to membranes only slightly and lowered the threshold TDC concentration associated with transition to mixed micelles. However, above this threshold, TUDC markedly altered the adsorption of TDC to lecithin-containing phases. We conclude that TUDC does not directly stabilize membranes; rather, reduced permeabilization and dissolution of cholesterol-rich membranes after addition of TUDC to TDC may result from effects on the formation and structure of simple and mixed micelles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178931>Endoplasmic reticulum stress upregulates protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B and impairs glucose uptake in cultured myotubes.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been recognised as a common pathway in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of insulin signalling and is localised on the ER membrane. The aim of the study was to investigate the cross-talk between ER stress and PTP1B.Leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob), Ptp1b (also known as Ptpn1) knockout and C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a high- or normal-chow diet for 20 weeks. ER stress was induced in cultured myotubes by treatment with tunicamycin. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to assess proteins involved in the ER stress response. Myotube glucose uptake was determined by measuring 2-deoxy[(3)H]glucose incorporation.A high- diet induced ER stress and PTP1B expression in the muscle tissue of mice and these responses were attenuated by treatment with the ER chaperone  (TUDCA). Cultured myotubes exhibited increased levels of PTP1B in response to tunicamycin treatment. Silencing of Ptp1b with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or overexpression of Ptp1b with adenovirus construct failed to alter the levels of ER stress. Ptp1b knockout mice did not differ from the wild-type mice in the extent of tunicamycin-induced upregulation of glucose-regulated protein-78. However, tunicamycin-induced phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase-2 were significantly attenuated in the Ptp1b knockout mice. Treatment with TUDCA or silencing of PTP1B reversed tunicamycin-induced blunted myotube glucose uptake.Our data suggest that PTP1B is activated by ER stress and is required for full-range activation of ER stress pathways in mediating insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21237159>The chemical chaperones tauroursodeoxycholic and 4-phenylbutyric acid accelerate thyroid hormone activation and energy expenditure.</a></h2><p>Exposure of cell lines endogenously expressing the thyroid hormone activating enzyme type 2 deiodinase (D2) to the chemical chaperones  (TUDCA) or 4-phenylbutiric acid (4-PBA) increases D2 expression, activity and T3 production.

This study examined the effect of TUDCA on cardiomyocyte function in high- diet-induced obesity.Adult mice were fed low or high  diet for 5 months prior to treatment of TUDCA (300 mg/kg. i.p., for 15d). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), cardiomyocyte mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) property, insulin signaling molecules including IRS-1, Akt, AMPK, ACC, GSK-3β, c-Jun, ERK and c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) as well as ER stress and intracellular Ca(2+) regulatory proteins were examined. Myocardial ultrastructure was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).High- diet depressed peak shortening (PS) and maximal velocity of shortening/relengthenin as well as prolonged relengthening duration. TUDCA reversed or overtly ameliorated high  diet-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction including prolongation in relengthening. TUDCA alleviated high- diet-induced decrease in SERCA2a and phosphorylation of phospholamban, increase in ER stress (GRP78/BiP, CHOP, phosphorylation of PERK, IRE1α and eIF2α), ultrastructural changes and mitochondrial permeation pore opening. High- diet feeding inhibited phosphorylation of AMPK and promoted phosphorylation of GSK-3β. TUDCA prevented high -induced dephosphorylation of AMPK but not GSK-3β. High  diet promoted phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Ser(307)), JNK, and ERK without affecting c-Jun phosphorylation, the effect of which with the exception of ERK phosphorylation was attenuated by TUDCA.These data depict that TUDCA may ameliorate high  diet feeding-induced cardiomyocyte contractile and intracellular Ca(2+) defects through mechanisms associated with mitochondrial integrity, AMPK, JNK and IRS-1 serine phosphorylation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27811171>Fibroblast growth factor 21 reverses suppression of adiponectin expression via inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose tissue of obese mice.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has recently emerged as a novel endocrine hormone involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid . However, the exact mechanisms whereby FGF21 mediates insulin sensitivity remain not fully understood. In the present study, FGF21was administrated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and tunicamycin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and  parameters, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicators, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting. The administration of FGF21 in obese mice reduced body weight, blood glucose and serum insulin, and increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in alleviation of insulin resistance. Meanwhile, FGF21 treatment reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress in adipose tissue of obese mice. Additionally, suppression of ER stress via the ER stress inhibitor  increased adiponectin expression and improved insulin resistance in obese mice and in tunicamycin-induced adipocytes. In conclusion, our results showed that the administration of FGF21 reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress under the condition of insulin resistance, demonstrating the causative role of ER stress in downregulating adiponectin levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16741293>The mechanism of ABCG5/ABCG8 in biliary cholesterol secretion in mice.</a></h2><p>The main player in biliary cholesterol secretion is the heterodimeric transporter complex, ABCG5/ABCG8, the function of which is necessary for the majority of sterols secreted into bile. It is not clear whether the primary step in this process is flopping of cholesterol from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane, with desorption by mixed micelles, or decreasing of the activation energy required for cholesterol desorption from the outer membrane leaflet. In this study, we investigated these mechanisms by infusing Abcg8(+/+), Abcg8(+/-), and Abcg8(-/-) mice with hydrophilic and hydrophobic bile salts. In Abcg8(-/-) mice, this failed to substantially stimulate biliary cholesterol secretion. Infusion of the hydrophobic bile salt taurodeoxycholate also resulted in cholestasis, which was induced in Abcg8(-/-) mice at a much lower infusion rate compared with Abc8(-/-) and Abcg8(+/-) mice, suggesting a reduced cholesterol content in the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Indeed, isolation of canalicular membranes revealed a reduction of 45% in cholesterol content under these conditions in Abcg8(-/-) mice. Our data support the model that ABCG5/ABCG8 primarily play a role in flopping cholesterol (and sterols) from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11408049>Effect of sodium tauroursodeoxycholate on phalloidin-induced cholestasis in rats.</a></h2><p>We investigated the therapeutic effect of tauroursodeoxycholate on phalloidin-induced cholestasis in rats. Intrahepatic cholestasis was induced by administration of phalloidin (500 microg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days. From the day of the last phalloidin injection, tauroursodeoxycholate (60-360 micromol/kg) was given intravenously twice a day for 4 days. On the next day after the last tauroursodeoxycholate administration, bile flow, serum biochemical parameters and biliary  excretion rates were determined. Tauroursodeoxycholate significantly suppressed the decrease in bile flow and increases in serum alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase activities, cholesterol, phospholipid and bile acid concentrations observed in phalloidin-induced cholestasis in rats. Furthermore, tauroursodeoxycholate significantly improved the biliary cholesterol and phospholipid excretion rates in phalloidin-induced cholestasis in rats.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis and its mechanisms. Palmitate (PA) stimulation induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and subsequent thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Ilexgenin A enhanced LKB1-dependent AMPK activity and improved ER stress by suppression of ROS-associated TXNIP induction. However, these effects were blocked by knockdown of AMPKα, indicating AMPK is essential for its action in suppression of ER stress. Meanwhile, ilexgenin A inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by down-regulation of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 induction, and thereby reduced IL-1β secretion. It also inhibited inflammation and apoptosis exposed to PA insult. Consistent with these results in endothelial cells, ilexgenin A attenuated ER stress and restored the loss of eNOS activity in vascular endothelium, and thereby improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rat aorta. A further analysis in high-fat fed mice showed that oral administration of ilexgenin A blocked ER stress/NLRP3 activation with reduced ROS generation and increased NO production in vascular endothelium, well confirming the beneficial effect of ilexgenin A on endothelial homeostasis in vivo. Taken together, these results show ER stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation was responsible for endothelial dysfunction and ilexgenin A ameliorated endothelial dysfunction by suppressing ER-stress and TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a regulation of AMPK. This finding suggests that the application of ilexgenin A is useful in the management of cardiovascular diseases in obesity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Physicochemical and biological properties of the four diastereoisomers of 3 alpha,7 beta-dihydroxy-22,23-methylene-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid.</a></h2><p>To define the influence of the side chain modification on physicochemical and biological properties of bile acids, 3 alpha,7 beta-dihydroxy-22,23-methylene-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid, a cyclopropyl analog of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was synthesized in both unconjugated and taurine-conjugated form. The presence of a cyclopropyl ring at C-22, C-23 position introduces chirality generating four diasteroisomers (A, B, C, and D) which greatly differ for the hydrophilicity and critical micellar concentration: A and B are more hydrophilic (K' = 0.21, 0.80 and CMC = 25,20 mM, respectively) than UDCA (K' = 0.95; CMC = 19 mM) while C and D are more hydrophobic and with lower CMC (K' = 1.30, 2.05; CMC = 14, 10 mM, respectively) than UDCA. Differences in these properties are related to the orientation of the C-25 carboxyl which in isomers A and B is oriented toward the back of the steroid body, reducing the continuity of the hydrophobic area. Using the isolated perfused rat liver we found that the isomers inhibited [3H]UDCA uptake differently. Isomer D (noncompetitive) was the most potent (51%) while isomer A (competitive) was the least potent (15%). When infused intravenously to rats, only D isomer and UDCA were quantitatively recovered in bile. They were secreted predominantly as taurine and glycine conjugates. Isomers A, B, C are not conjugated and only partially recovered in bile as unconjugates (less than 15% of the administered dose). The increase in bile flow per unit increase in bile acid secretion induced by isomers A, B, and C, was much greater than that induced by isomer D which is similar to that of UDCA (0.32 +/- 0.04 and 0.22 +/- 0.01, respectively) while it is reduced during infusion of the other isomers. When infused as taurine conjugates they behaved similarly to . When incubated in anaerobic conditions with human stools only isomer D is partially 7-dehydroxylated (t/2 = 18 hr) even though slower than UDCA (t/2 = 5 hr). The substrate specificity of the taurine conjugated toward cholyglycine hydrolase is very poor, only isomers C and D are partially deconjugated with a kinetics much slower than that of UDCA (10 hr vs. 0.2 hr). By using molecular models it is possible to explain these differences due to the conformation of the side chain that, in the case of isomer D, is quite similar to UDCA. These data are useful to explain the  of dihydroxy bile acids and to design new analogs with enhanced cholelitholytic activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8937941>Effect of taurohyodeoxycholic acid on biliary  secretion in man: preliminary report.</a></h2><p>Taurohyodeoxycholic acid and  were infused intraduodenally at a rate of 0.8 g/h for three hours in 3 cholecystectomized T-tube patients.

Here we investigated the effects of troxerutin on the enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in high- diet (HFD)-treated mice and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Mice were divided into four groups: Control group, HFD group, HFD + Troxerutin group, and Troxerutin group. Troxerutin was treated by daily oral administration at doses of 150 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks.  (TUDCA) was used to inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Our results showed that troxerutin effectively improved obesity and related metabolic parameters, and liver injuries in HFD-treated mouse. Furthermore, troxerutin significantly attenuated enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis in HFD-fed mouse. Moreover, troxerutin notably suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 transcriptional activation and release of inflammatory cytokines in HFD-treated mouse livers. Mechanismly, troxerutin dramatically decreased Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) expression, as well as interaction between NOD1/2 with interacting protein-2 (RIP2), by abating oxidative stress-induced ER stress in HFD-treated mouse livers, which was confirmed by TUDCA treatment. These improvement effects of troxerutin on hepatic glucose disorders might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect. In conclusion, troxerutin markedly diminished HFD-induced enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis via its inhibitory effects on ER stress-mediated NOD activation and consequent inflammation, which might be mediated by its anti-obesity effect.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24766485>Endoplasmic reticulum stress does not contribute to steatohepatitis in obese and insulin-resistant high--diet-fed foz/foz mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver (steatosis) and steatohepatitis [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)] are hepatic complications of the metabolic syndrome. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is proposed as a crucial disease mechanism in obese and insulin-resistant animals (such as ob/ob mice) with simple steatosis, but its role in NASH remains controversial. We therefore evaluated the role of ER stress as a disease mechanism in foz/foz mice, which develop both the metabolic and histological features that mimic human NASH. We explored ER stress markers in the liver of foz/foz mice in response to a high- diet (HFD) at several time points. We then evaluated the effect of treatment with an ER stress inducer tunicamycin, or conversely with the ER protectant  (TUDCA), on the metabolic and hepatic features. foz/foz mice are obese, glucose intolerant and develop NASH characterized by steatosis, inflammation, ballooned hepatocytes and apoptosis from 6 weeks of HFD feeding. This was not associated with activation of the upstream unfolded protein response [phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) activity and spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1)]. Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and up-regulation of activating transcription factor-4 (Atf4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (Chop) transcripts were however compatible with a 'pathological' response to ER stress. We tested this by using intervention experiments. Induction of chronic ER stress failed to worsen obesity, glucose intolerance and NASH pathology in HFD-fed foz/foz mice. In addition, the ER protectant TUDCA, although reducing steatosis, failed to improve glucose intolerance, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis in HFD-fed foz/foz mice. These results show that signals driving hepatic inflammation, apoptosis and insulin resistance are independent of ER stress in obese diabetic mice with steatohepatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31155263>Fatty acid-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress promoted  accumulation in calf hepatocytes, and endoplasmic reticulum stress existed in the liver of severe fatty liver cows.</a></h2><p>Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, often termed ER stress, is intrinsically linked with perturbation of  in humans and mice. Whether ER homeostasis is affected in cows experiencing fatty liver is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of ER stress in hepatic  accumulation in calf hepatocytes and ER stress status in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. In vitro experiments were conducted in which hepatocytes were isolated from calves and treated with different concentrations of fatty acids,  (TUDCA; a canonical inhibitor of ER stress), or both. The increase in phosphorylation level of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) proteins, and the cleavage of activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) protein in response to increasing doses of fatty acids (which were reversed by TUDCA treatment) in primary hepatocytes underscored a mechanistic link between fatty acids and ER stress. In addition, fatty acid treatment increased the abundance of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, fatty acid synthase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and  accumulation in calf primary hepatocytes, whereas inhibition of ER stress by incubating with TUDCA significantly weakened these effects. Overall, results in vitro indicate that inhibition of ER stress in calf hepatocytes alleviates fatty acid-induced  accumulation by downregulating the expression of lipogenic genes. In vivo experiments, liver and blood samples were collected from cows diagnosed as healthy (n = 15) or with severe fatty liver (n = 15). The phosphorylation level of PERK and IRE1α, the cleavage of ATF6 protein, and the abundance of several unfolded protein response genes (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, AMP-dependent transcription factor 4, and spliced X-box binding protein 1) were greater in liver of cows with severe fatty liver. The present in vivo study confirms the occurrence of ER stress in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. Considering the causative role of fatty acid-induced ER stress in hepatic  accumulation in calf hepatocytes, the existence of ER stress in the liver of severe fatty liver cows may presage its participation in fatty liver progression in dairy cows. However, the mechanistic relationship between ER stress and fatty liver in dairy cows remain to be determined.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

They can activate various cell signaling pathways including extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and protein kinase B (AKT) as well as the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) membrane-type bile acid receptor (TGR5/M-BAR). Activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways by conjugated bile acids has been reported to be sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) and dominant-negative Gα(i) in primary rodent hepatocytes. However, the GPCRs responsible for activation of these pathways have not been identified. Screening GPCRs in the -activated phylogenetic family (expressed in HEK293 cells) identified sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P(2) ) as being activated by taurocholate (TCA). TCA, taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA),  (TUDCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and S1P-induced activation of ERK1/2 and AKT were significantly inhibited by JTE-013, a S1P(2) antagonist, in primary rat hepatocytes. JTE-013 significantly inhibited hepatic ERK1/2 and AKT activation as well as short heterodimeric partner (SHP) mRNA induction by TCA in the chronic bile fistula rat. Knockdown of the expression of S1P(2) by a recombinant lentivirus encoding S1P(2) shRNA markedly inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT by TCA and S1P in rat primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes prepared from S1P(2) knock out (S1P(2) (-/-) ) mice were significantly blunted in the activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways by TCA. Structural modeling of the S1P receptors indicated that only S1P(2) can accommodate TCA binding. In summary, all these data support the hypothesis that conjugated bile acids activate the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways primarily through S1P(2) in primary rodent hepatocytes.Copyright © 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12065295>Effects of bile acids on the muscle functions of guinea pig gallbladder.</a></h2><p>Hydrophobic bile acids impair gallbladder emptying in vivo and inhibit gallbladder muscle contraction in response to CCK-8 in vitro. This study was aimed at determining the mechanisms of muscle cell dysfunction caused by bile acids in guinea pig gallbladders. Muscle cells were obtained by enzymatic digestion. Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDC), a hydrophobic bile acid, caused a contraction of up to 15% and blocked CCK-induced contraction. Indomethacin abolished the TCDC-induced contraction. Hydrophilic bile acid  (TUDC) had no effect on muscle contraction but prevented the TCDC-induced contraction and its inhibition on CCK-induced contraction. Pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitor PH2I, xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, and free-radical scavenger catalase also prevented TCDC-induced contraction and its inhibition of the CCK-induced contraction. TCDC caused H2O2 production,  peroxidation, and increased PGE2 synthesis and activities of catalase and SOD. These changes were significantly inhibited by pretreatment of PH2I or allopurinol. Inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) also blocked the TCDC-induced contraction. It is concluded that hydrophobic bile acids cause muscle cell dysfunction by stimulating the formation of H2O2 via activation of NADPH and xanthine oxidase. H2O2 causes  peroxidation and activates cPLA2 to increase PGE2 production, which, in turn, stimulates the synthesis of free-radical scavengers through the PKC-MAPK pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20699416>DsbA-L alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced adiponectin downregulation.</a></h2><p>Obesity impairs adiponectin expression, assembly, and secretion, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The aims of this study were 1) to determine the molecular mechanisms by which obesity impairs adiponectin multimerization and stability, and 2) to determine the potential role of disulfide-bond-A oxidoreductase-like protein (DsbA-L), a recently identified adiponectin interactive protein that promotes adiponectin multimerization and stability in obesity-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and adiponectin downregulation. (TUDCA), a chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress, was used to study the mechanism underlying obesity-induced adiponectin downregulation in db/db mice, high- diet-induced obese mice, and in ER-stressed 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The cellular levels of DsbA-L were altered by RNAi-mediated suppression or adenovirus-mediated overexpression. The protective role of DsbA-L in obesity- and ER stress-induced adiponectin downregulation was characterized.Treating db/db mice and diet-induced obese mice with TUDCA increased the cellular and serum levels of adiponectin. In addition, inducing ER stress is sufficient to downregulate adiponectin levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which could be protected by treating cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or by overexpression of DsbA-L.ER stress plays a key role in obesity-induced adiponectin downregulation. In addition, DsbA-L facilitates adiponectin folding and assembly and provides a protective effect against ER stress-mediated adiponectin downregulation in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424209>The role of  on adipogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells by modulation of ER stress.</a></h2><p>Obesity has become a serious public health problem in the developed world. Increased mass of adipose tissue in the obese is due to an increase in both the size (hypertrophy) and number (hyperplasia) of adipocytes. The chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) not only decreases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, but also plays a role as a leptin-sensitizing agent for preadipocytes in mice and humans. In this study, we examine whether TUDCA has an effect on adipogenesis from human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). Therefore, the effect of TUDCA on ER stress,  accumulation, and adipogenic differentiation from hASCs was investigated using histological staining, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and western blotting in vitro. It was found that TUDCA treatment of hASCs significantly decreases the representative ER stress marker (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78)), adipogenic markers (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPDH)), and  accumulation. Furthermore, we confirmed that TUDCA treatment of hASCs significantly decreased in vivo adipogenic tissue formation and ER stress comparing with PBS treatment of hASCs. The results indicate that TUDCA plays a critical role in adipogenesis from hASCs by modulating ER stress and, therefore, has potential pharmacologic and therapeutic applications as an anti-obesity agent.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It has always been assumed that bile salt secretion (BSec) fully controls this process. Recently we have demonstrated, that mdr2 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an important controlling step as well. In this study we have analysed the control structure of this pathway with Metabolic Control Analysis.FVB mice homozygous (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-) for mdr2 P-glycoprotein were infused via the tail vein with tauroursodeoxycholate in stepwise increasing concentrations. Bile was collected and biliary lipids were determined by standard techniques.To simplify the pathway we have lumped all reactions involved in BSsec into bile in one step. Since this step is not controlled by the canalicular BS concentration, the FCC of BS secretion on phospholipid secretion (PLsec) could be calculated from a plot between BS and PL secretion. The FCC of BSsec varied from 80% at low flux to a value of 90% at maximal BS output. The FCC of mdr2 P-gp was determined by varying the gene dose of mdr2 P-gp. Since PLsec showed linear kinetics towards canalicular BS the FCC could be calculated via the Deviation index. The values for the FCC of mdr2 P-gp in (+/+) mice vary from 80% at low flux to 125% at maximal BS output.Both BS secretion and mdr2 P-gp strongly control biliary phospholipid secretion. The sum of the FCCs of both steps is always much higher than 100% implicating the presence of step(s) which exert negative control. We hypothesize that steps controlling biliary water transport account for the negative control.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29093479>Bile acid TUDCA improves insulin clearance by increasing the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in the liver of obese mice.</a></h2><p>Disruption of insulin secretion and clearance both contribute to obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia, though reduced insulin clearance seems to be the main factor. The liver is the major site for insulin degradation, a process mainly coordinated by the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). The beneficial effects of taurine conjugated bile acid (TUDCA) on insulin secretion as well as insulin sensitivity have been recently described. However, the possible role of TUDCA in insulin clearance had not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrated that 15 days treatment with TUDCA reestablished plasma insulin to physiological concentrations in high  diet (HFD) mice, a phenomenon associated with increased insulin clearance and liver IDE expression. TUDCA also increased IDE expression in human hepatic cell line HepG2. This effect was not observed in the presence of an inhibitor of the hepatic membrane bile acid receptor, S1PR2, nor when its downstream proteins were inhibited, including IR, PI3K and Akt. These results indicate that treatment with TUDCA may be helpful to counteract obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia through increasing insulin clearance, likely through enhanced liver IDE expression in a mechanism dependent on S1PR2-Insulin pathway activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24225943>Restoration of the unfolded protein response in pancreatic β cells protects mice against type 1 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Perturbations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis can evoke stress responses leading to aberrant glucose and . ER dysfunction is linked to inflammatory disorders, but its role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown. We identified defects in the expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) mediators ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) and XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) in β cells from two different T1D mouse models and then demonstrated similar defects in pancreatic β cells from T1D patients. Administration of a chemical ER stress mitigator,  (TUDCA), at the prediabetic stage resulted in a marked reduction of diabetes incidence in the T1D mouse models. This reduction was accompanied by (i) a significant decrease in aggressive lymphocytic infiltration in the pancreas, (ii) improved survival and morphology of β cells, (iii) reduced β cell apoptosis, (iv) preserved insulin secretion, and (v) restored expression of UPR mediators. TUDCA's actions were dependent on ATF6 and were lost in mice with β cell-specific deletion of ATF6. These data indicate that proper maintenance of the UPR is essential for the preservation of β cells and that defects in this process can be chemically restored for preventive or therapeutic interventions in T1D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17699733>Thematic review series: Adipocyte Biology. Adipocyte stress: the endoplasmic reticulum and metabolic disease.</a></h2><p>In the context of obesity and its related maladies, the adipocyte plays a central role in the balance, or imbalance, of metabolic homeostasis. An obese, hypertrophic adipocyte is challenged by many insults, including surplus energy, inflammation, insulin resistance, and considerable stress to various organelles. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one such vital organelle that demonstrates significant signs of stress and dysfunction in obesity and insulin resistance. Under normal conditions, the ER must function in the unique and trying environment of the adipocyte, adapting to meet the demands of increased protein synthesis and secretion, energy storage in the form of triglyceride droplet formation, and nutrient sensing that are particular to the differentiated  cell. When nutrients are in pathological excess, the ER is overwhelmed and the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. Remarkably, the consequences of UPR activation have been causally linked to the development of insulin resistance through a multitude of possible mechanisms, including c-jun N-terminal kinase activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This review will focus on the function of the ER under normal conditions in the adipocyte and the pathological effects of a stressed ER contributing to adipocyte dysfunction and a thwarted metabolic homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30092598>Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Affects  in Atherosclerosis Via CHOP Activation and Over-Expression of miR-33.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an important event in atherosclerosis.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between ER stress and  and to verify that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process.An atherosclerosis model was established in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed a Western diet, and THP-1 derived macrophages were used in this study. Hematoxylin-eosin and Oil Red O staining were used to quantify the atherosclerotic plaques. 1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate labeled oxidized low-density lipoprotein binding assay and a Cholesterol Efflux Fluorometric Assay Kit were used to observe cholesterol uptake and efflux. The mRNA and protein levels of biomarkers associated with ER stress and cholesterol  in atherosclerotic plaques and macrophages were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to observe alterations of ABCA1 localization. Small interfering RNAs were used to knock down CHOP and miR-33 in macrophages to alter CHOP and miR-33 expression.Atherosclerotic lesions and systemic  levels were ameliorated after inhibition of ER stress () in vivo. In vitro studies confirmed that ER stress regulated the  catabolism of macrophages by promoting cholesterol uptake, inhibiting cholesterol efflux, and modulating the expression of related transporters. CHOP contributed to  disorder following ER stress. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-33 was involved in ER stress that induced  disorder in macrophages. These findings support a model of ER stress induction by oxidized low-density lipoprotein that affects macrophage  catabolism disorder.Our data shed new light on the relationship between ER stress and  in vivo and in vitro, and confirm that upregulation of miR-33 is involved in this process. The relationship between ER stress and miR-33 represents a novel target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

A tracer dose of sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-[14C]linoleoylPC was injected as a bolus into the recirculating liver perfusate, under constant infusion of 0.75 mumol/min of tauroursodeoxycholate or taurodeoxycholate. The effects on bile flow, biliary  secretion, 14C disappearance from the perfusate and its appearance in bile, as well as hepatic and biliary biotransformation were determined. With both the bile salts, about 40% of the [14C]PC was taken up by the liver from the perfusate over 100 min. During the same period less than 2% of the given radioactivity was secreted into bile. More than 95% of the 14C recovered in bile was located within the identical injected PC molecular species. The biliary secretion of labeled as well as unlabeled PC, however, was significantly higher in livers perfused with taurodeoxycholate than tauroursodeoxycholate, while the reverse was observed with respect to bile flow and total bile salt secretion. The exogenous PC underwent extensive hepatic metabolization which appeared to be influenced by the type of bile salt perfusing the liver. After 2 h perfusion, the liver radioactivity was found, in decreasing order, in PC, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and diacylglycerol. In addition, the specific activity of triacylglycerol was significantly higher in tauroursodeoxycholate than in taurodeoxycholate-perfused livers (P less than 0.025), while the reverse was true for the specific activity of hepatic PC (P less than 0.01). Because taurodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate showed opposite effects on both biliary  secretion and hepatic PC biotransformations, we conclude that the hepatic  of glycerolipids is influenced by the physiochemical properties of bile salts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28552716>Nrf2 activation by  in experimental models of Parkinson's disease.</a></h2><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the cause of PD remains elusive, mitochondrial dysfunction and severe oxidative stress are strongly implicated in the cell death that characterizes the disease. Under oxidative stress, the master regulator of cellular redox status, nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2), is responsible for activating the transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Nrf2 is a promising target to limit reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage in PD. Here, we show that  (TUDCA) prevents both 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP)- and α-synuclein-induced oxidative stress, through Nrf2 activation, in SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, we used C57BL/6 male mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to elucidate the effect of TUDCA in this in vivo model of PD. In vivo, TUDCA treatment increases the expression of Nrf2, Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1, and Nrf2 downstream target antioxidant enzymes HO-1 and GPx. Moreover, we found that TUDCA enhances GPx activity in the brain. Altogether, our results suggest that TUDCA is a promising agent to limit ROS-mediated damage, in different models of PD acting, at least in part, through modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Therefore, TUDCA should be considered a promising therapeutic agent to be implemented in PD.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated in the rat the hepatobiliary , choleretic properties, and biliary maximum secretory rate (SRmax) of taurohyodeoxycholic in comparison with these two bile salts. Each compound was infused intravenously, at a rate increased in a stepwise manner from 100 to 300 nmol/min/100 g body wt, in bile salt-depleted bile fistula rats. The three bile salts appeared rapidly starting with the infusion and increased to represent more than 95% of the total bile salts. No apparent biliary metabolites were formed. All the bile salts caused a dose-dependent increase in bile flow and biliary  output. The absolute increase in bile flow was lower in rats infused with taurohyodeoxycholic acid, yet the volume of bile formed per nanomole of secreted bile salt was 13.8 nl for taurohyodeoxycholic, 6.4 nl for , and 10.9 nl for taurocholic. The SRmax values were 1080, 3240, and 960 nmol/min/100 g, respectively. At all infusion rates, taurohyodeoxycholic acid caused a greater (P < 0.001) secretion of biliary lecithin compared to the other bile salts. There were no significant differences in the biliary secretion of cholesterol and proteins. Electron microscopy showed the recruitment of vesicles and lamellar bodies around and within bile canaliculi. In conclusion, taurohyodeoxycholic promotes a biliary lecithin secretion greater than expected from physicochemical predictions, representing a novel secretory property with potential pharmacological relevance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512345> overloading during liver regeneration causes delayed hepatocyte DNA replication by increasing ER stress in mice with simple hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Impaired fatty liver regeneration has already been reported in many genetic modification models. However, in diet-induced simple hepatic steatosis, which showed similar phenotype with clinical pathology, whether liver regeneration is impaired or not remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated liver regeneration in mice with diet-induced simple hepatic steatosis, and focused on excess  accumulation occurring during liver regeneration.Mice were fed high  diet (HFD) or control diet for 9-10 weeks. We analyzed intrahepatic  accumulation, DNA replication, and various signaling pathways including cell proliferation and ER stress during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.

The expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2 was also delayed in HFD mice. The amounts of liver triglyceride were at least twofold higher in HFD mice at each time point. Intrahepatic palmitic acid was increased especially in HFD mice. ER stress induced during liver regeneration was significantly higher in HFD mice. In HFD mice, pretreatment with TUDCA reduced ER stress and resulted in improvement of delayed liver regeneration.In simple hepatic steatosis,  overloading occurring during liver regeneration might be caused ER stress and results in delayed hepatocyte DNA replication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29689346>B-type natriuretic peptide attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress in H9c2 cardiomyocytes underwent hypoxia/reoxygenation injury under high glucose/high  conditions.</a></h2><p>Exogenously administered B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been shown to provide cardioprotection against various heart diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study explores whether BNP exerts its cardioprotection against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury under high glucose/high  (HG/HF) conditions in cardiac H9c2 cells and uncovers the underlying mechanisms. Our data revealed that BNP significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), with a maximal effect at the BNP concentration of 10 mol/L. In addition, by analyzing the activation of cleaved caspase-3 and by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, we showed that BNP attenuated H/R-induced cell apoptosis in HG/HF conditions. Western blot analysis showed enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like endoplastmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)(one of the three main signaling pathways in endoplastmic reticulum (ER) stress), and increased expression of GRP78 and CHOP proteins (ER stress-related proteins) in H9c2 cells which underwent H/R in HG/HF conditions. Treatment with BNP or 8-Br-cGMP (an analog of cGMP) reversed this activation. However, this effect was significantly weakened by KT-5823, a selective cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. In addition, similar to BNP, treatment with a specific inhibitor of ER stress  (TUDCA) protected the cells against H/R injury exposed to HG/HF conditions. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that BNP effectively protected cells against H/R injury under HG/HF conditions by inhibiting the ER stress via activation of the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Conjugated bile acid administration, such as  (TUDCA), improves insulin sensitivity, whereas short-circuiting bile acid circulation through ileal interposition surgery in rats raises TUDCA levels. We hypothesized that bariatric surgery outcomes could be recapitulated by short circuiting the normal enterohepatic bile circulation. We established a model wherein male obese rats underwent either bile diversion (BD) or Sham (SH) surgery. The BD group had a catheter inserted into the common bile duct and its distal end anchored into the middistal jejunum for 4-5 weeks. Glucose tolerance, insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response, hepatic steatosis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were measured. Rats post-BD lost significantly more weight than the SH rats. BD rats gained less  mass after surgery. BD rats had improved glucose tolerance, increased higher postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 response and serum bile acids but less liver steatosis. Serum bile acid levels including TUDCA concentrations were higher in BD compared to SH pair-fed rats. Fecal bile acid levels were not different. Liver ER stress (C/EBP homologous protein mRNA and pJNK protein) was decreased in BD rats. Bile acid gavage (TUDCA/ursodeoxycholic acid [UDCA]) in diet-induced obese rats, elevated serum TUDCA and concomitantly reduced hepatic steatosis and ER stress (C/EBP homologous protein mRNA). These data demonstrate the ability of alterations in bile acids to recapitulate important metabolic improvements seen after bariatric surgery.

Using Sr-bI/Abcg5 double knockout mice (dko), the present study investigated the differential contribution of two of the most relevant transporters: adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette subfamily G member 5 and 8 (ABCG5/G8) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) to sterol  and RCT. Plasma cholesterol levels increased in the following order, mainly due to differences in high density lipoprotein (HDL): Abcg5 ko < wild type < Sr-bI/Abcg5 dko < Sr-bI ko. Liver cholesterol content was elevated in Sr-bI ko only (P < 0.05). In Sr-bI/Abcg5 dko plasma plant sterols were highest, while hepatic plant sterols were lower compared with Abcg5 ko (P < 0.05). Under baseline conditions, biliary cholesterol secretion rates decreased in the following order: wild type > Sr-bI ko (-16%) > Abcg5 ko (-75%) > Sr-bI/Abcg5 dko (-94%), all at least P < 0.05, while biliary bile acid secretion did not differ between groups. However, under supraphysiological conditions, upon infusion with increasing amounts of the bile salt , Abcg5 became fully rate-limiting for biliary cholesterol secretion. Additional in vivo macrophage-to-feces RCT studies demonstrated an almost 50% decrease in overall RCT in Sr-bI/Abcg5 dko compared with Abcg5 ko mice (P < 0.01).These data demonstrate that (1) SR-BI contributes to ABCG5/G8-independent biliary cholesterol secretion under basal conditions; (2) biliary cholesterol mass secretion under maximal bile salt-stimulated conditions is fully dependent on ABCG5/G8; and (3) Sr-bI contributes to macrophage-to-feces RCT independent of Abcg5/g8.Copyright © 2013 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555> inhibits intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal  transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7498666>Regulation of protein secretion into bile: studies in mice with a disrupted mdr2 p-glycoprotein gene.</a></h2><p>Protein is secreted into bile via several independent pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these pathways are influenced by secretion of biliary .Protein secretion and biliary  output were studied in wild-type mice (+/+), heterozygotes (+/-), and homozygotes (-/-) for mdr2 gene disruption. Biliary  and protein output were varied by infusion with taurocholate (TC) and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC).Exocytosis and transcytosis were unaltered in (-/-) mice. Infusion with TC strongly induced secretion of alkaline phosphatase in (-/-) mice but had little effect in (+/-) and (+/+) mice. Infusion with TUDC had little effect on alkaline phosphatase output. In contrast, both TUDC and TC strongly stimulated secretion of aminopeptidase N and lysosomal enzymes in (+/+) mice but had no effect in (-/-) animals. Aminopeptidase N secretion correlated with phospholipid output, but only at high flux. At low flux, aminopeptidase N was secreted independently from both phospholipid and bile salts.The canalicular membrane enzymes alkaline phosphatase and aminopeptidase N are secreted via separate pathways. Part of alkaline phosphatase output is controlled by bile salt hydrophobicity, whereas at high  flux, aminopeptidase N secretion seems to be coupled to phospholipid output. Lysosomal enzymes follow the latter pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20829802>FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance: involvement of ER stress and IKKβ pathways.</a></h2><p>Free-fatty acids (FFAs) are well-characterized factor for causing production of inflammatory factors and insulin resistance in adipocytes. Using cultured adipocytes, we demonstrate that FFAs can activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway by examination of ER stress sensor activation and marker gene expression. Chemical chaperone  (TUDCA) can reduce FFA-induced adipocyte inflammation and improve insulin signaling whereas overexpression of spliced X-box protein 1 (XBP-1s) only attenuates FFA-induced inflammation. PKR-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (PERK) is one of the three major ER stress sensor proteins and deficiency of PERK alleviates FFA-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. The key downstream target of FFA-induced ER stress is IκB kinase β (IKKβ), a master kinase for regulating expression of inflammatory genes. Deficiency of PERK attenuates FFA-induced activation of IKKβ and deficiency of IKKβ alleviates FFA-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Consistently, overexpression of IKKβ in 3T3-L1 CAR adipocytes causes inflammation and insulin resistance. In addition, IKKβ overexpression has profound effect on adipocyte , including inhibition of lipogenesis and promotion of lipolysis. Furthermore, increased endogenous IKKβ expression and activation is also observed in isolated primary adipocytes from mice injected with lipids or fed on high- diet (HFD) acutely. These results indicate that ER stress pathway is a key mediator for FFA-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in adipocytes with PERK and IKKβ as the critical signaling components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381268>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha)-mediated regulation of multidrug resistance 2 (Mdr2) expression and function in mice.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is a nuclear receptor that controls expression of genes involved in  and is activated by fatty acids and hypolipidaemic fibrates. Fibrates induce the hepatic expression of murine multidrug resistance 2 ( Mdr2 ), encoding the canalicular phospholipid translocator. The physiological role of PPARalpha in regulation of Mdr2 and other genes involved in bile formation is unknown. We found no differences in hepatic expression of the ATP binding cassette transporter genes Mdr2, Bsep (bile salt export pump), Mdr1a / 1b, Abca1 and Abcg5 / Abcg8 (implicated in cholesterol transport), the bile salt-uptake systems Ntcp (Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide gene) and Oatp1 (organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1 gene) or in bile formation between wild-type and Ppar alpha((-/-)) mice. Upon treatment of wild-type mice with ciprofibrate (0.05%, w/w, in diet for 2 weeks), the expression of Mdr2 (+3-fold), Mdr1a (+6-fold) and Mdr1b (+11-fold) mRNAs was clearly induced, while that of Oatp1 (-5-fold) was reduced. Mdr2 protein levels were increased, whereas Bsep, Ntcp and Oatp1 were drastically decreased. Exposure of cultured wild-type mouse hepatocytes to PPARalpha agonists specifically induced Mdr2 mRNA levels and did not affect expression of Mdr1a / 1b. Altered transporter expression in fibrate-treated wild-type mice was associated with a approximately 400% increase in bile flow: secretion of phospholipids and cholesterol was increased only during high-bile-salt infusions. No fibrate effects were observed in Ppar alpha((-/-)) mice. In conclusion, our results show that basal bile formation is not affected by PPARalpha deficiency in mice. The induction of Mdr2 mRNA and Mdr2 protein levels by fibrates is mediated by PPARalpha, while the induction of Mdr1a / 1b in vivo probably reflects a secondary phenomenon related to chronic PPARalpha activation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22902434> peroxidation is not the primary mechanism of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in jaundiced Gunn rat pups.</a></h2><p>Hazardous levels of bilirubin produce oxidative stress in vitro and may play a role in the genesis of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND). We hypothesized that the antioxidants taurourosdeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), 12S-hydroxy-1,12-pyrazolinominocycline (PMIN), and minocycline (MNC) inhibit oxidative stress and block BIND in hyperbilirubinemic j/j Gunn rat pups that were given sulfadimethoxine to induce bilirubin encephalopathy.At peak postnatal hyperbilirubinemia, j/j Gunn rat pups were dosed with sulfadimethoxine to induce bilirubin encephalopathy. Pups were given TUDCA, PMIN, MNC, or vehicle pretreatment (15 min before sulfadimethoxine). After 24 h, BIND was scored by using a rating scale of neurobehavior and cerebellar tissue 4-hydroxynonenal and protein carbonyl dinitrophenyl content were determined. Nonjaundiced heterozygous N/j pups served as controls.Administration of sulfadimethoxine induced BIND and  peroxidation but not protein oxidation in hyperbilirubinemic j/j pups. TUDCA, PMIN, and MNC each reduced  peroxidation to basal levels observed in nonjaundiced N/j controls, but only MNC prevented BIND.These findings show that  peroxidation inhibition alone is not sufficient to prevent BIND. We speculate that the neuroprotective efficacy of MNC against BIND involves action(s) independent of, or in addition to, its antioxidant effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8607791>Chronic administration of ursodeoxycholic and  changes microsomal membrane  content and fatty acid compositions in rats.</a></h2><p>We studied the effect of oral supplementation with ursodeoxycholate (UDCA) or tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) on the  content and fatty acid composition of rat hepatic microsomes. UDCA and TUDCA significantly increased the total amount of lipids with the exception of cholesteryl-esters. UDCA significantly increased the triglycerides and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) microsomal content, and decreased the cholesterol/phospholipids and the phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PE ratio. Both treatments increased the percentage oleic acid and of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in each class of lipids. UDCA and TUDCA had a different action on PUFA microsomal molar percentage of phospholipids: UDCA increased the relative percentage of PUFA in the PE fraction, while TUDCA increased the relative percentage of PUFA in the PC fraction. These changes in the hepatic  content and composition might in part explain both cytoprotective action of these hydrophillic bile acids and their effect on membrane fluidity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26522062>Toll-like receptor 4-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress contributes to impairment of vasodilator action of insulin.</a></h2><p>Impairment of vasodilator action of insulin is associated with endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces proinflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) activate TLR4, which induces ER stress and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we determined whether TLR4-mediated ER stress is an obligatory step mediating SFA-induced endothelial dysfunction. Palmitate stimulated proinflammatory responses and ER stress, and this was suppressed by knockdown of TLR4 in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Next, we examined the role of TLR4 in vasodilatory responses in intact vessels isolated from wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and TLR4-KO mice after feeding high-fat (HFD) or normal chow diet (NCD) for 12 wk. Arterioles isolated from HFD WT mice exhibited impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation compared with arterioles isolated from NCD WT mice. Deficiency of TLR4 was protective from HFD-induced impairment of insulin-stimulated vasodilation. There were no differences in acetylcholine (Ach)- or sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-stimulated vasodilation between the two groups. Furthermore, we examined whether ER stress is involved in SFA-induced impairment of vasodilator actions of insulin. Infusion of palmitate showed the impairment of vasodilatory response to insulin, which was ameliorated by coinfusion with  (TUDCA), an ER stress suppressor. Taken together, the results suggest that TLR4-induced ER stress may be an obligatory step mediating the SFA-mediated endothelial dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30246717>Role of X-Box Binding Protein-1 in Fructose-Induced  Lipogenesis in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p>A high consumption of fructose leads to hepatic steatosis. About 20-30% of triglycerides are synthesized via de novo lipogenesis. Some studies showed that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is involved in this process, while others showed that a lipotoxic environment directly influences ER homeostasis. Here, our aim was to investigate the causal relationship between ERS and fatty acid synthesis and the effect of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1), one marker of ERS, on hepatic  accumulation stimulated by high fructose.HepG2 cells were incubated with different concentrations of fructose. Upstream regulators of de novo lipogenesis (i.e., carbohydrate response element-binding protein [ChREBP] and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c [SREBP-1c]) were measured by polymerase chain reaction and key lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid synthase [FAS], and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 [SCD-1]) by Western blotting. The same lipogenesis-associated factors were then evaluated after exposure of HepG2 cells to high fructose followed by the ERS inhibitor  (TUDCA) or the ERS inducer thapsigargin. Finally, the same lipogenesis-associated factors were evaluated in HepG2 cells after XBP-1 upregulation or downregulation through cell transfection.Exposure to high fructose increased triglyceride levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner and significantly increased mRNA levels of SREBP-1c and ChREBP and protein levels of FAS, ACC, and SCD-1, concomitant with XBP-1 conversion to an active spliced form. Lipogenesis-associated factors induced by high fructose were inhibited by TUDCA and induced by thapsigargin. Triglyceride level in XBP-1-deficient group decreased significantly compared with high-fructose group (4.41 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 6.52 ± 0.38 μmol/g, P < 0.001), as mRNA expressions of SREBP-1c (2.92 ± 0.46 vs. 5.08 ± 0.41, P < 0.01) and protein levels of FAS (0.53 ± 0.06 vs. 0.85 ± 0.05, P = 0.01), SCD-1 (0.65 ± 0.06 vs. 0.90 ± 0.04, P = 0.04), and ACC (0.38 ± 0.03 vs. 0.95 ± 0.06, P < 0.01) decreased. Conversely, levels of triglyceride (4.22 ± 0.54 μmol/g vs. 2.41 ± 0.35 μmol/g, P < 0.001), mRNA expression of SREBP-1c (2.70 ± 0.33 vs. 1.00 ± 0.00, P < 0.01), and protein expression of SCD-1 (0.93 ± 0.06 vs. 0.26 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), ACC (0.98 ± 0.09 vs. 0.43 ± 0.03, P < 0.01), and FAS (0.90 ± 0.33 vs. 0.71 ± 0.02, P = 0.04) in XBP-1s-upregulated group increased compared with the untransfected group.ERS is associated with de novo lipogenesis, and XBP-1 partially mediates high-fructose-induced  accumulation in HepG2 cells through augmentation of de novo lipogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6736779>Effects of four taurine-conjugated bile acids on mucosal uptake and lymphatic absorption of cholesterol in the rat.</a></h2><p>The importance of the bile acid structure on mucosal uptake and lymphatic absorption of cholesterol was investigated using four different taurine-conjugated bile acids. Pure synthetic conjugates of a trihydroxy bile acid, taurocholate, and three dihydroxy bile acids, tauroursodeoxycholate, taurochenodeoxycholate, and taurodeoxycholate were used to completely solubilize [14C]cholesterol and polar lipids for steady rate intraduodenal infusion for 8 hr in bile fistula rats. Lymph output and esterification of [14C]cholesterol and endogenous cholesterol were measured in hourly samples. A second group of bile fistula rats was given the same bile acids as the first group but without added cholesterol or other , i.e., fasting lymph fistula group. Mucosal uptake of [14C]cholesterol was studied using recovery of [14C]cholesterol from lumen and mucosa after 1-hr infusions in conscious bile fistula rats. Lymph output of [14C]cholesterol was promoted more rapidly with taurocholate than with the dihydroxy conjugates and [14C]cholesterol output differed for the three groups given dihydroxy bile acids. The mass of cholesterol in lymph, measured chemically, varied in parallel with [14C]cholesterol absorption. For fasting lymph, infusion of dihydroxy bile acids failed to produce a significant change in endogenous cholesterol output when compared with rats given saline only. Taurocholate infusion markedly increased endogenous cholesterol in lymph of fasted rats. Under all conditions where cholesterol output was stimulated, the increase could be accounted for mainly as esterified cholesterol. Mucosal uptake of [14C]cholesterol during 1-hr infusions in conscious bile fistula rats was slower with the dihydroxy bile acids than with taurocholate. The results indicate the marked effect of the number and configuration of the hydroxyl groups on the solubilizing bile acid for cholesterol absorption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438081>TUDCA, a bile acid, attenuates amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid-β deposition in APP/PS1 mice.</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the brain, leading to progressive cognitive decline. The endogenous bile acid  (TUDCA) is a strong neuroprotective agent in several experimental models of disease, including neuronal exposure to Aβ. Nevertheless, the therapeutic role of TUDCA in AD pathology has not yet been ascertained. Here we report that feeding APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice with diet containing 0.4 % TUDCA for 6 months reduced accumulation of Aβ deposits in the brain, markedly ameliorating memory deficits. This was accompanied by reduced glial activation and neuronal integrity loss in TUDCA-fed APP/PS1 mice compared to untreated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, TUDCA regulated  mediators involved in Aβ production and accumulation in the brains of transgenic mice. Overall amyloidogenic APP processing was reduced with TUDCA treatment, in association with, but not limited to, modulation of γ-secretase activity. Consequently, a significant decrease in Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) levels was observed in both hippocampus and frontal cortex of TUDCA-treated APP/PS1 mice, suggesting that chronic feeding of TUDCA interferes with Aβ production, possibly through the regulation of  mediators associated with APP processing. These results highlight TUDCA as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111690>Uric acid induces  accumulation via generation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and SREBP-1c activation in hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently one of the most common types of chronic liver injury. Elevated serum uric acid is a strong predictor of the development of fatty liver as well as metabolic syndrome. Here we demonstrate that uric acid induces triglyceride accumulation by SREBP-1c activation via induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hepatocytes. Uric acid-induced ER stress resulted in an increase of glucose-regulated protein (GRP78/94), splicing of the X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), the phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF-2α) in cultured hepatocytes. Uric acid promoted hepatic lipogenesis through overexpression of the lipogenic enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) via activation of SREBP-1c, which was blocked by probenecid, an organic anion transport blocker in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. A blocker of ER stress,  (TUDCA), and an inhibitor of SREBP-1c, metformin, blocked hepatic  accumulation, suggesting that uric acid promoted  synthesis in hepatocytes via ER stress-induced activation of SREBP-1c. Uric acid-induced activation of NADPH oxidase preceded ER stress, which further induced mitochondrial ROS production in hepatocytes. These studies provide new insights into the mechanisms by which uric acid stimulates  accumulation in the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22739135>MCP-1 induced protein promotes adipogenesis via oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.</a></h2><p>Obesity involves inflammation. MCP-1, an inflammatory chemokine, and MCP-1-induced protein (MCPIP) are known to induce adipogenesis that causes increase in the number of adipocytes. Here we elucidate the intermediate processes through which MCPIP induces adipogenesis. Forced expression of MCPIP in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes caused increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) production and inducible-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER), as indicated by expression of ER chaperones and protein disulfide isomerase, and autophagy as indicated by expression of beclin-1 and cleavage of LC3. Treatment of ROS inhibitor, apocynin attenuated MCPIP induction of adipogenesis as measured by the induction of transcription factors involved in adipogenesis, adipocyte markers and  droplet accumulation. Inhibition of ER stress with taurursodeoxycholate or knockdown of inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) inhibited MCPIP induced autophagy and adipogenesis. Preadipocytes in adipogenesis-inducing cocktail manifested ER stress and autophagy. Knockdown of MCPIP attenuated these effects. MCPIP induced p38 activation and p38 inhibitor, SB203580, attenuated MCPIP-induced adipogenesis.Copyright © 2012 S.

We studied the composition of biliary lipids in a series of 33 patients with radiolucent stones, before and after treatment with TUDCA, 3.5 to 16.6 mg/kg/die for 4-6 weeks. Duodenal bile was collected with the Entero-Test after gallbladder contraction. Cholesterol saturation was 147% + 67 before treatment. TUDCA administration produced the following dose-dependent effects: a) a linear decrease of cholesterol saturation (r = 0.59; p); b) a non-linear increase of the percent of ursodeoxycholate in bile (r = 0.59; p); c) a non-linear increase of the fraction of ursodeoxycholate conjugated with taurine. At the dose of 11 mg/kg per day, cholesterol saturation was 80%, ursodeoxycholic acid represented about 45% of biliary bile acids, and about half of urso was conjugated with taurine.

Here we show that ER stress-induced insulin receptor (IR) down-regulation may play a critical role in obesity-induced insulin resistance. The expression levels of IR are negatively associated with the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in insulin target tissues of db/db mice and mice fed a high- diet. Significant IR down-regulation was also observed in  tissue of obese human subjects and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with ER stress inducers. ER stress had little effect on IR tyrosine phosphorylation per se but greatly reduced IR downstream signaling. The ER stress-induced reduction in IR cellular levels was greatly alleviated by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine but not by the proteasome inhibitor N-benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z)-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132). Inhibition of autophagy prevented IR degradation but did not rescue IR downstream signaling, consistent with an adaptive role of autophagy in response to ER stress-induced insulin resistance. Finally, chemical chaperone treatment protects cells from ER stress-induced IR degradation in vitro and obesity-induced down-regulation of IR and insulin action in vivo. Our results uncover a new mechanism underlying obesity-induced insulin resistance and shed light on potential targets for the prevention and treatment of obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525950>Probiotic or synbiotic alters the gut microbiota and  in a randomised controlled trial of weight management in overweight adults.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota contributes to host energy , and altered gut microbiota has been associated with obesity-related metabolic disorders. We previously reported that a probiotic alone or together with a prebiotic controls body  mass in healthy overweight or obese individuals in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov ). We now aimed to investigate whether changes in the gut microbiota may be associated with the observed clinical benefits. Faecal and plasma samples were obtained from a protocol compliant subset (n=134) of participants from a larger clinical study where participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) into four groups: (1) placebo, 12 g/d microcrystalline cellulose; (2) Litesse® Ultra™ polydextrose (LU), 12 g/day; (3) Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420™ (B420), 10 cfu/d in 12 g microcrystalline cellulose; (4) LU+B420, 1010 cfu/d of B420 in 12 g/d LU for 6 months of intervention. The faecal microbiota composition and metabolites were assessed as exploratory outcomes at baseline, 2, 4, 6 months, and +1 month post-intervention and correlated to obesity-related clinical outcomes. Lactobacillus and Akkermansia were more abundant with B420 at the end of the intervention. LU+B420 increased Akkermansia, Christensenellaceae and Methanobrevibacter, while Paraprevotella was reduced. Christensenellaceae was consistently increased in the LU and LU+B420 groups across the intervention time points, and correlated negatively to waist-hip ratio and energy intake at baseline, and waist-area body  mass after 6 months treatment with LU+B420.

We hypothesized that the hypothalamic opioid system might also control energy  in peripheral tissues. Mice lacking the kappa opioid receptor (κOR) and adenoviral vectors overexpressing or silencing κOR were stereotaxically delivered in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of rats. Vagal denervation was performed to assess its effect on liver . Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was inhibited by pharmacological () and genetic (overexpression of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa) approaches. The peripheral effects on lipid  were assessed by histological techniques and western blot. We show that in the LHA κOR directly controls hepatic lipid  through the parasympathetic nervous system, independent of changes in food intake and body weight. κOR colocalizes with melanin concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1) in the LHA, and genetic disruption of κOR reduced melanin concentrating hormone-induced liver steatosis. The functional relevance of these findings was given by the fact that silencing of κOR in the LHA attenuated both methionine choline-deficient, diet-induced and choline-deficient, high-fat diet-induced ER stress, inflammation, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, whereas overexpression of κOR in this area promoted liver steatosis. Overexpression of glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa in the liver abolished hypothalamic κOR-induced steatosis by reducing hepatic ER stress.This study reveals a novel hypothalamic-parasympathetic circuit modulating hepatic function through inflammation and ER stress independent of changes in food intake or body weight; these findings might have implications for the clinical use of opioid receptor antagonists.

In vitro determination of high-performance liquid chromatography mobility, octanol/ water partitioning, cholesterol solubilizing capacity, and sensitivity to enzyme deconjugation by bacteria and cholylglycine-hydroxylase were performed. In vivo determination of the following was also performed: (1) maximum secretory rate (SRmax) and choleretic/secretory properties during intravenous (IV) administration; (2) site/ extent of absorption, effects on bile flow,  secretion, and biotransformations after intraduodenal infusion. N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholate has a lipophilicity slightly higher than tauroursodeoxycholate, close to taurocholate, and similar cholesterol solubilizing capacity. Deconjugation of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholate was 3.4 +/- 2.1% after 72 hours, that of tauroursodeoxycholate was 100% after 24 hours. During IV infusion of 300 nmol/min/ 100g, biliary secretion of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids averaged 185 +/- 76 (standard deviation) nmol/min/100 g and 221 +/- 77 nmol/min/ 100 g (not significant). Increasing infusion rates caused progressive enhancement of bile flow and bile salt secretion until the SRmax was reached (1,305 +/- 240 nmol/min/ 100 g for N-ethyl- and 3,240 nmol/min/100 g for tauroursodeoxycholate). The two bile salts were similarly choleretic. IV feeding of N-ethyl-tauroursodeoxycholic promoted a greater  secretion than tauroursodeoxycholate.

Four cholecystectomized patients who had gallstones and an interrupted enterohepatic circulation were intraduodenally infused with taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids on separate occasions at a dose of 0.8 to 1 g/h for 3 hours. In hourly bile samples collected for 8 hours after the beginning of the infusion, biliary bile acid composition (by high-performance liquid chromatography), biliary  concentrations (by standard methods), and distribution of biliary carriers (by gel chromatography) were evaluated. Blood liver function tests were performed before and after the infusions. Taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids became the predominant biliary bile acids in all patients except for one infused with taurohyodeoxycholic acid. Taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulated significantly greater (P < .05) cholesterol and phospholipid secretion per unit of secreted bile acid (0.098 and 0.451 micromol/micromol, respectively) compared with  (0.061 micromol/micromol for cholesterol and 0.275 micromol/micromol for phospholipids). The secretory ratio between phospholipid and cholesterol was significantly higher after infusion of taurohyodeoxycholic acid (3.88 micromol/micromol) compared with taroursodeoxycholic acid (3.09 micromol/micromol) (P < .05). Biliary enrichment with taurohyodeoxycholic acid was positively related with percent concentration of phospholipids but not with that of cholesterol. The opposite trend was observed in -enriched biles. In both taurohyodeoxycholic acid- and -rich bile, 80% to 90% of cholesterol was carried in a gel-chromatographic fraction corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 80 to 200 kd. No alteration in liver function test results was observed after taurohyodeoxycholic acid infusion. In conclusion, taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulates greater cholesterol and phospholipid secretion than , but with a higher phospholipid/cholesterol secretory ratio. In bile enriched with both bile acids, biliary cholesterol is transported in non-micellar aggregates.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the protection of TUDCA on high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) dysfunction and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy (DR) rats and the possible mechanism underlying was also explored.The proliferation of high glucose-induced HRMECs was determined by MTT assay. DR rats' model was established by an administration of high-glucose-fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30mg/kg). The cell supernatant and rats' serum were collected for the assays of NO content by ELISA kits. Retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe pathological changes. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in rat retinas. Furthermore, western blot analysis was carried out to examine the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF in high glucose-induced HRMECs.After treating with TUDCA, high glucose-induced HRMECs proliferation could be significantly inhibited. TUDCA (5.0μM, 25.0μM and 125.0μM) could decrease NO content in high glucose-induced HRMECs. Furthermore, TUDCA (500mg/kg/d and 250mg/kg/d) also decrease NO content in serum of DR rats. Additionally, both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that the over-expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF were significantly decreased by TUDCA.The data indicated that TUDCA could ameliorate DR by decreasing NO content and down-regulating the protein expression of ICAM-1, NOS, NF-κB p65 and VEGF. Thus, our experimental results suggested that TUDCA might be a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of DR.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition,  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018.

The experiments were designed to determine, in rats, whether selectivity (for PLPC and against SAPC) is influenced by bile acid hydrophobicity or secretion rate. We examined the effects of bile acid depletion and of ileal infusion of taurocholic acid, , and taurochenodeoxycholic acid. Compared to bile acid depletion, infusion of each bile acid caused PLPC to decrease from 59% of bile PC to 48%, and SAPC to increase from 2.6% to 5%. Bile acid hydrophobicity had no effect on PC selectivity, but selectivity decreased to a moderate degree as total PC secretion increased. To determine whether selectivity is for preformed molecular species, we used a new method to isotopically label four species of hepatic PC. This was done by intravenous injection of PLPC and SAPC labeled in the linoleate (14C) and arachidonate (3H) moieties. Assuming rapid mixing of each PC species in the hepatocyte as supported by the specific activity data, bile SAPC and SLPC were derived entirely from hepatic preformed SAPC and SLPC; bile PLPC was from both preformed PLPC (55%) and an unlabeled input (45%, probably direct secretion of newly synthesized PLPC). In conclusion, the selective composition of bile PC is not related to bile acid hydrophobicity, but is partially lost as secretion increases within the physiologic range.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24312631>Ursodeoxycholic acid but not  inhibits proliferation and differentiation of human subcutaneous adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Stress of endoplasmic reticulum (ERS) is one of the molecular triggers of adipocyte dysfunction and chronic low inflammation accompanying obesity. ERS can be alleviated by chemical chaperones from the family of bile acids (BAs). Thus, two BAs currently used to treat cholestasis, ursodeoxycholic and  (UDCA and TUDCA), could potentially lessen adverse metabolic effects of obesity. Nevertheless, BAs effects on human adipose cells are mostly unknown. They could regulate gene expression through pathways different from their chaperone function, namely through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and TGR5, G-coupled receptor. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze effects of UDCA and TUDCA on human preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes derived from paired samples of two distinct subcutaneous adipose tissue depots, abdominal and gluteal. While TUDCA did not alter proliferation of cells from either depot, UDCA exerted strong anti-proliferative effect. In differentiated adipocytes, acute exposition to neither TUDCA nor UDCA was able to reduce effect of ERS stressor tunicamycin. However, exposure of cells to UDCA during whole differentiation process decreased expression of ERS markers. At the same time however, UDCA profoundly inhibited adipogenic conversion of cells. UDCA abolished expression of PPARγ and lipogenic enzymes already in the early phases of adipogenesis. This anti-adipogenic effect of UDCA was not dependent on FXR or TGR5 activation, but could be related to ability of UDCA to sustain the activation of ERK1/2 previously linked with PPARγ inactivation. Finally, neither BAs did lower expression of chemokines inducible by TLR4 pathway, when UDCA enhanced their expression in gluteal adipocytes. Therefore while TUDCA has neutral effect on human preadipocytes and adipocytes, the therapeutic use of UDCA different from treating cholestatic diseases should be considered with caution because UDCA alters functions of human adipose cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6693062>Effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on biliary bile acid and bile  composition in gallstone patients.</a></h2><p>In five patients with radiolucent gallstones, the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (Urso) in doses of 250, 500, 750, 1,000, and 1,250 mg per day on biliary  and bile acid composition was studied. Biliary cholesterol decreased from 8.8 +/- 0.8 mole% to 4.4 +/- 0.2 mole% at 500 mg Urso per day (7.1 mg per kg) and to 4.2 +/- 0.3 mole% at 750 mg Urso per day (10.7 mg per kg). Administration of 1,000 or 1,250 mg Urso per day produced no further decrease of biliary cholesterol. The biliary content of phospholipids and total bile acids remained unchanged. During Urso treatment, the relative amounts of glyco-Urso and tauro-Urso in bile increased. Glyco-Urso reached a plateau at 49.1 +/- 2.1% of total bile acids during treatment with 1,000 mg Urso per day, and tauro-Urso increased up to 4.3 +/- 1.5% of total bile acids at 250 mg Urso per day. Simultaneously cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid decreased. The data indicate that Urso treatment reduces biliary cholesterol efficiently already at a dose of 500 mg per day; biliary bile acid composition changes up to 1,000 mg Urso per day. Doses greater than 1,000 mg per day produced no additional alterations in bile composition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634226>Reduction of Hypothalamic Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Activates Browning of White Fat and Ameliorates Obesity.</a></h2><p>The chaperone GRP78/BiP (glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa/binding immunoglobulin protein) modulates protein folding in reply to cellular insults that lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the role of hypothalamic GRP78 on energy balance, with particular interest in thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). For this purpose, we used diet-induced obese rats and rats administered thapsigargin, and by combining , histologic, physiologic, pharmacologic, thermographic, and molecular techniques, we studied the effect of genetic manipulation of hypothalamic GRP78. Our data showed that rats fed a high-fat diet or that were centrally administered thapsigargin displayed hypothalamic ER stress, whereas genetic overexpression of GRP78 specifically in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was sufficient to alleviate ER stress and to revert the obese and  phenotype. Those effects were independent of feeding and leptin but were related to increased thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue and induction of browning in WAT and could be reversed by antagonism of β3 adrenergic receptors. This evidence indicates that modulation of hypothalamic GRP78 activity may be a potential strategy against obesity and associated comorbidities.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p></html>
