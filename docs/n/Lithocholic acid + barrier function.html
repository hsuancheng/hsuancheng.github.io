Food intake and growth were unaffected by the dietary treatment. Supplemental dietary vitamin B(6) significantly reduced the production of a fecal secondary bile ,  (the most toxic secondary bile  and a risk factor for colon cancer), and markedly reduced the ratio of  to deoxycholic  (a less toxic secondary bile ) in feces (p<0.05). Increasing dietary vitamin B(6) increased fecal mucin levels (a marker of intestinal barrier function) in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05) but did not affect fecal immunoglobulin A levels (an index of intestinal immune function). Cecal levels of organic acids were not significantly affected by supplemental dietary vitamin B(6). These results suggest the possibility that dietary vitamin B(6) affects the colonic luminal environment by altering the production of secondary bile acids and mucins.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23645422>Tempe consumption modulates fecal secondary bile acids, mucins, immunoglobulin A, enzyme activities, and cecal microflora and organic acids in rats.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the effect of dietary tempe, a fermented soy product, on the colonic environment of rats fed high-fat (HF, 30 % fat; experiment 1) or low-fat (LF, 6 % fat; experiment 2) diets. Growing male rats were fed the experimental diets with or without 25 % tempe for 21 days. Tempe consumption slightly but significantly increased the growth of rats fed both the HF and LF diets (P < 0.05). With both the HF and LF diets, dietary tempe markedly reduced a harmful fecal secondary bile ,  (a risk factor of colon cancer) (P < 0.05), and markedly elevated fecal mucins (indices of intestinal barrier function) and immunoglobulin A (IgA, an index of intestinal immune function) (P < 0.05). With the HF diet, dietary tempe increased cecal acetate, butyrate, propionate, and succinate concentrations (P < 0.05). Analysis of the profile of cecal microflora revealed lower Bacteroides and higher Clostridium cluster XIVa levels in the tempe group of rats fed the HF diet (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the fecal activity of β-glucosidase was markedly higher in the tempe group (P < 0.05), while that of urease was lower (P < 0.05) with both the HF and LF diets. The present results suggest that tempe consumption modulates the colonic environment in rats.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19575493>Serum bile  profiling reflects enterohepatic detoxification state and intestinal barrier function in inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>To determine free and conjugated serum bile  (BA) levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.Comprehensive serum BA profiling was performed in 358 IBD patients and 310 healthy controls by liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.Serum levels of hyodeoxycholic , the CYP3A4-mediated detoxification product of the secondary BA  (LCA), was increased significantly in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), while most other serum BA species were decreased significantly. Total BA, total BA conjugate, and total BA glycoconjugate levels were decreased only in CD, whereas total unconjugated BA levels were decreased only in UC. In UC patients with hepatobiliary manifestations, the conjugated primary BAs glycocholic , taurocholic , and glycochenodeoxycholic  were as significantly increased as the secondary BAs LCA, ursodeoxycholic , and tauroursodeoxycholic  compared to UC patients without hepatobiliary manifestations. Finally, we found that in ileocecal resected CD patients, the unconjugated primary BAs, cholic  and chenodeoxycholic , were increased significantly compared to controls and patients without surgical interventions.Serum BA profiling in IBD patients that indicates impaired intestinal barrier function and increased detoxification is suitable for advanced diagnostic characterization and differentiation of IBD subgroups with defined clinical manifestations.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28554966>The Yin and Yang of bile  action on tight junctions in a model  epithelium.</a></h2><p>Gastrointestinal epithelial barrier loss due to tight junction (TJ) dysfunction and bile -induced diarrhea are common in patients with inflammatory diseases. Although excess  bile acids are known to alter mucosal permeability, few studies have compared the effects of specific bile acids on TJ function. We report that the primary bile , chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), and its 7-dehydroxylated derivative,  (LCA) have opposite effects on epithelial integrity in human  T84 cells. CDCA decreased transepithelial barrier resistance (pore) and increased paracellular 10 kDa dextran permeability (leak), effects that were enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines (PiC [ng/mL]: TNF[10] + IL-1[10] + IFN[30]). CDCA reversed the cation selectivity of the monolayer and decreased intercellular adhesion. In contrast, LCA alone did not alter any of these parameters, but attenuated the effects of CDCA ± PiC on paracellular permeability. CDCA, but not PiC, decreased occludin and not claudin-2 protein expression; CDCA also decreased occludin localization. LCA ± CDCA had no effects on occludin or claudin expression/localization. While PiC and CDCA increased IL-8 production, LCA reduced both basal and PiC ± CDCA-induced IL-8 production. TNF+ IL1ß increased IFN, which was enhanced by CDCA and attenuated by LCA CDCA±PiC increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was attenuated by LCA Finally, scavenging ROS attenuated CDCA's leak, but not pore actions, and LCA enhanced this effect. Thus, in T84 cells, CDCA plays a role in the inflammatory response causing barrier dysfunction, while LCA restores barrier integrity. Understanding the interplay of LCA, CDCA, and PiC could lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory and diarrheal diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

However, the crosstalk among nutrition, microbiota, and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased  production, and systemic accumulation of  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472180>The protective effect of  on the intestinal epithelial  is mediated by the vitamin D receptor via a SIRT1/Nrf2 and NF-κB dependent mechanism in Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p> (LCA) is both a secondary bile  and a vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand. The VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the intestinal mucosal . LCA can also substitute for vitamin D to carry out the in vivo functions of vitamin D. However, it is unclear whether activation of the VDR by LCA affects mucosal  . In the present study, we researched the protective effect of LCA on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intestinal epithelial  dysfunction in Caco-2 cells of the human epithelial intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line. Caco-2 cell monolayers were pretreated with LCA and then exposed to 100 ng/mL TNF-α. The results showed that LCA alleviated the decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and the increase in FITC-Dextran flux induced by TNF-α. LCA ameliorated the TNF-α-induced decrease in protein expression and distribution of ZO-1, E-cadherin, Occludin, and Claudin-1, which are tight junction markers. Additionally, the LCA treatment effectively counteracted TNF-α-mediated downregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase-1, which are related to oxidative stress. Increases in NF-κB p-p65 and p-IκB-α induced by TNF-α were significantly inhibited by LCA. Considering all these, the present study indicates that LCA has a significant protective effect on TNF-α-induced injury of intestinal   through the VDR and suggests that suppressing NF-κB signaling and activating the SIRT1/Nrf2 pathway might be one of the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of LCA.Copyright © 2019.

The bile--activated nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plays a pivotal role in regulating bile , lipid and glucose homeostasis as well as in regulating the inflammatory responses, barrier function and prevention of bacterial translocation in the intestinal tract. As expected, FXR is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide range of diseases of gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes. In this review, we discuss current knowledge of the roles of FXR in physiology of the digestive system and the related diseases. Better understanding of the roles of FXR in digestive system will accelerate the development of FXR ligands/modulators for the treatment of digestive system diseases.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18657865>PU.1 and bacterial metabolites regulate the human gene CAMP encoding antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in colon epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Mammalian antimicrobial peptides contribute to the protective barrier against microbes at epithelial surfaces. This study focuses on the promoter of the human CAMP gene, encoding the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and induction of the gene in the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29. CAMP promoter segments were inserted in front of a luciferase reporter in order to identify regulatory regions. A transcription promoting region was identified and the transcription factor PU.1 of the Ets family was recruited to this region as shown by ChIP analysis. This ties PU.1 to the regulation of human innate epithelial defences for the first time. In addition, the conserved second intron was found to exert a transcription enhancing effect in cooperation with the 3' end of the proximal promoter, and the importance of two upstream AUG codons was examined. Moreover, we here demonstrate that  enhances CAMP transcription, and does so additively with butyrate. Thus, a crosstalk between bacteria and host epithelia of the gut could be partially mediated via these two bacterial products to obtain gut homeostasis.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28360029>Ursodeoxycholic  and  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.</a></h2><p> Ursodeoxycholic  and  exert anti-inflammatory actions in the colon.  312: G550-G558, 2017. First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: barrier function</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291748>Burdock fermented by Aspergillus awamori elevates cecal Bifidobacterium, and reduces fecal deoxycholic  and adipose tissue weight in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with burdock powder and Aspergillus awamori-fermented burdock powder at 5% on the intestinal luminal environment and body fat in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet.
