Hochst (Marula) nut oil is a popular ingredient in cosmetics such as skin lotions, lipsticks and foundations. The demand for this African oil increased tremendously such that in 2008 almost US$ 20 million was spent on Marula oil for cosmetic product manufacturing. The ethnobotanical literature states that the Zulu people in South Africa amongst others applied the oil to maintain a healthy skin. Scientific studies to support the traditional use as well as the inclusion of Marula oil in cosmetic products is lacking. This study evaluated the irritancy potential (safety), the moisturising and hydrating effects as well occlusivity properties (efficacy) of Marula oil after topical application. In addition, the Marula oil used in this study was comprehensively characterised using two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.Quantification of the fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) was done using a LECO Pegasus 4D GC × GC-MS. To determine the safety and efficacy of Marula oil healthy caucasian adult female volunteers (n = 20) who complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the irritancy patch, moisture efficacy, hydrating and occlusivity tests were recruited for each study. A 2 × magnifying lamp (visual observation), Chromameter®, Aquaflux® and Corneometer® instruments were used to evaluate and monitor the irritancy level, skin  , transepidermal water loss, hydrating and occlusive effects of topically applied Marula oil.The GC × GC-MS analysis identified several saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids. Oleic  was the major fatty  constituting 69.0% of the oil followed by  (15.3%), linoleic  (9.2%), palmitoleic  (4.1%) and stearic  (1.5%). The clinical study revealed that Marula oil is non-irritant (p < 0.001), with moisturising and hydrating properties (p < 0.001) when applied to a lipid-dry (xerosis) skin. Additionally the oil exhibited occlusive effects (p < 0.001) when applied to normal skin. These findings may be linked to the absorption of the oil into the skin due to the high percentage of oleic  and the presence of  which are known to disturb the stratum corneum intercellular lipids. These fatty acids present in Marula oil are very similar to those present in the epidermis, and can be considered biomimetic.Marula oil rich in fatty acids exhibits moisturising, hydrating and occlusive properties. As the oil is non-irritating and provides a moisturising effect with moderate prevention of transepidermal water loss, average moisture retention properties and noteworthy occlusive effects, its inclusion in cosmetic products based on its traditional use may be justified depending on the application.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Podocyte injury can lead to dysfunction of the glomerular filtration , which is associated with proteinuria, a risk marker for the progression of CKD. Our previous studies demonstrated that  (PA) can induce podocyte apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we investigated the specific molecular mechanisms of PA-induced apoptosis in cultured podocytes.We cultured mouse podocytes and treated them with PA. Then, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay, lipid uptake was assessed by Oil Red O staining and boron-dipyrromethene staining, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, mitochondrial injury was assessed by JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy, and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using the MitoSOX Red reagent. The effects of PA on the mitochondria-mediated caspase activation pathway were investigated by examining the expression of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, Bid, cytochrome c, and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) using western blotting. The translocation of Bax and cytochrome c were detected by immunofluorescence.PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation and induced podocyte apoptosis. We investigated whether the two primary apoptosis signaling pathways (death receptor-mediated pathway and mitochondria-mediated pathway) were involved in the execution of PA-induced podocyte apoptosis, and found that the levels of FADD, caspase-8, and Bid did not significantly change during this process. Meanwhile, PA treatment induced an increase in Bax protein expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression, with Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Furthermore, PA treatment induced mitochondrial impairment, and triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, with a concomitant dose-dependent increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. Meanwhile, PA treatment increased mitochondrial production of ROS, and the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO significantly ameliorated PA-induced podocyte apoptosis.Our findings indicated that PA induced caspase-dependent podocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and mitochondrial ROS production participated in this process, thus potentially contributing to podocyte injury.© 2018 The Author(s).

This study aimed to evaluate the roles of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 in the TPN-induced loss of intestinal   and liver disease.A rodent model of TPN was used to analyze the roles of SB203580 in TPN-associated complications.Intestinal   was evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability in Caco-2 cells. The  (PA) was used to induce hepatic lipoapoptosis in vitro. The lipoapoptosis was detected using Caspase-3/7 and lipid staining.In the present study, we showed that SB203580 treatment significantly suppressed TPN-mediated intestinal permeability in rats. SB203580 treatment significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced an increase in tight junction permeability of Caco-2 cells via repressing the p38/ATF-2 signaling. Unexpectedly, SB203580 treatment enhanced hepatic lipoapoptosis in the model of TPN.  (PA)-induced hepatic lipoapoptosis in human liver cells was significantly augmented by the SB203580 treatment.We demonstrate that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203508 ameliorates intestinal   but promotes hepatic lipoapoptosis in model of TPN.© 2017 The Author(s)Published by S.

The stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of mammal epidermis, is mainly responsible for the skin impermeability. The SC is formed by corneocytes embedded in a lipid matrix, which is mostly constituted of ceramides (Cer), free fatty acids (FFA), and cholesterol (Chol), organized in two coexisting crystalline lamellar phases. This arrangement of lipids is crucial to skin  . The aim of this paper is to determine the impact of FFA chain length on the phase behavior of SC model lipid membranes using solid-state deuterium NMR and IR spectroscopy. We studied ternary mixtures of N-lignoceroyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (Cer24), cholesterol, and  (FFA16) or lignoceric (FFA24)  in an equimolar ratio. This proportion replicates the lipid composition found in the SC lipid matrix. Our studies revealed that the phase behavior of Cer24/FFA/Chol ternary mixtures is strongly affected by the length of the FFA. We found the formation of phase-separated crystalline lipid domains when using  whereas the use of lignoceric  results in a more homogeneous mixture. In addition, it was observed that mixtures with lignoceric  form a gel phase, a very unusual feature for SC model mixtures.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28181698>Calcium Uptake via Mitochondrial Uniporter Contributes to -Induced Apoptosis in Mouse Podocytes.</a></h2><p>Podocytes are component cells of the glomerular filtration , and their loss by apoptosis is the main cause of proteinuria that leads to diabetic nephropathy (DN). Therefore, insights into podocyte apoptosis mechanism would allow a better understanding of DN pathogenesis and thus help develop adequate therapeutic strategies. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of -inhibited cell death in mouse podocytes, and found that  increased cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  induces apoptosis in podocytes through upregulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca , mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), cytochrome c release, and depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca . The intracellular calcium chelator, 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N, N'-tetraacetic  tetrakis acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), partially prevented this upregulation whereas 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) inhibitor; dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor (RyR) inhibitor; and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostibene-2,2'-disulfonic  (DIDS), an anion exchange inhibitor, had no effect. Interestingly, ruthenium red and Ru360, both inhibitors of the mitochondrial Ca uniporter (MCU), blocked -induced mitochondrial Ca elevation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol, and apoptosis. siRNA to MCU markedly reduced -induced apoptosis. These data indicate that Ca uptake via mitochondrial uniporter contributes to -induced apoptosis in mouse podocytes. J. Cell.

We tested whether PAHSAs protect against colitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease driven predominantly by defects in the innate mucosal  and adaptive immune system. There is an unmet clinical need for safe and well tolerated oral therapeutics with direct anti-inflammatory effects. Wild-type mice were pretreated orally with vehicle or 5-PAHSA (10 mg/kg) and 9-PAHSA (5 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days, followed by 10 days of either 0% or 2% dextran sulfate sodium water with continued vehicle or PAHSA treatment. The colon was collected for histopathology, gene expression, and flow cytometry. Intestinal crypt fractions were prepared for ex vivo bactericidal assays. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells pretreated with vehicle or PAHSA and splenic CD4 T cells from syngeneic mice were co-cultured to assess antigen presentation and T cell activation in response to LPS. PAHSA treatment prevented weight loss, improved colitis scores (stool consistency, hematochezia, and mouse appearance), and augmented intestinal crypt Paneth cell bactericidal potency via a mechanism that may involve GPR120. In vitro, PAHSAs attenuated dendritic cell activation and subsequent T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. The anti-inflammatory effects of PAHSAs in vivo resulted in reduced colonic T cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. These anti-inflammatory effects appear to be partially GPR120-dependent. We conclude that PAHSA treatment regulates innate and adaptive immune responses to prevent mucosal damage and protect against colitis. Thus, PAHSAs may be a novel treatment for colitis and related inflammation-driven diseases.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28258156>Maternal metabolic stress may affect oviduct gatekeeper .</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that elevated non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) modify  bovine oviduct epithelial cell (BOEC) metabolism and  . Hereto, BOECs were studied in a polarized system with 24-h treatments at Day 9: (1) control (0 µM NEFA + 0% EtOH), (2) solvent control (0 µM NEFA + 0.45% EtOH), (3) basal NEFA (720 µM NEFA + 0.45% EtOH in the basal compartment) and (4) apical NEFA (720 µM NEFA + 0.45% EtOH in the apical compartment). FITC-albumin was used for monolayer permeability assessment and related to transepithelial electric resistance (TER). Fatty  (FA), glucose, lactate and pyruvate concentrations were measured in spent medium. Intracellular lipid droplets (LD) and FA uptake were studied using Bodipy 493/503 and immunolabelling of FA transporters (FAT/CD36, FABP3 and CAV1). BOEC-mRNA was retrieved for qRT-PCR. Results revealed that apical NEFA reduced relative TER increase (46.85%) during treatment and increased FITC-albumin flux (27.59%) compared to other treatments. In basal NEFA, FAs were transferred to the apical compartment as free FAs: mostly  and oleic  increased respectively 56.0 and 33.5% of initial FA concentrations. Apical NEFA allowed no FA transfer, but induced LD accumulation and upregulated FA transporter expression (↑CD36, ↑FABP3 and ↑CAV1). Gene expression in apical NEFA indicated increased anti-apoptotic (↑) and anti-oxidative (↑) capacity, upregulated lipid metabolism (↑ ↑ and ↓) and FA uptake (↑). All treatments had similar carbohydrate metabolism and oviduct -specific gene expression (,  and ). Overall, elevated NEFAs affected BOEC metabolism and   differently depending on NEFA exposure side. Data substantiate the concept of the oviduct as a gatekeeper that may actively alter early embryonic developmental conditions.© 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28154307>Molecular Interaction between Intercellular Lipids in the Stratum Corneum and l-Menthol, as Analyzed by Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction.</a></h2><p>l-Menthol increases drug partitioning on the surface of skin, diffusion of drugs in the skin, and lipid fluidity in the stratum corneum and alters the rigidly arranged lipid structure of intercellular lipids. However, l-menthol is a solid at room temperature, and it is difficult to determine the effects of l-menthol alone. In this study, we vaporized l-menthol in order to avoid the effects of solvents. The vaporized l-menthol was applied to the stratum corneum or lipid models comprising composed of ceramides (CER) [EOS], the longest lipid acyl chain of the ceramides in the stratum corneum lipids that is associated with the   of the skin; CER [NS], the shorter lipid acyl chain of the ceramides, and the most components in the stratum corneum of the intercellular lipids that is associated with water retention in the intercellular lipid structure of the stratum corneum; cholesterol; and . Synchrotron X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed that the lipid models were composed of hexagonal packing and orthorhombic packing structures of different lamellar periods. Taken together, our results revealed that l-menthol strongly affected the lipid model composed of CER [EOS]. Therefore, l-menthol facilitated the permeation of drugs through the skin by liquid crystallization of the longer lamellar structure. Importantly, these simple lipid models are useful for investigating microstructure of the intercellular lipids in the stratum corneum.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25795389>Improving the physical and moisture  properties of Lepidium perfoliatum seed gum biodegradable film with stearic and  acids.</a></h2><p>Stearic and  fatty acids (10%, 20% and 30%, W/W gum) were used to improve the  properties of Lepidium perfoliatum seed gum (LPSG) film. The impact of the incorporation of fatty acids into the film matrix was studied by investigating the physical, mechanical, and  properties of the films. Addition of stearic and  fatty acids to LPSG films reduced their water vapor permeability (WVP), moisture content, water solubility and water adsorption. Increasing fatty  concentration from 10% to 30%, reduced the elongation at break (EB). Lower values of tensile strength (TS) and elastic modulus (EM) were obtained in the presence of higher fatty acids concentrations. Incorporation of fatty acids led to production of opaque films and the opacity increased as  of fatty acids concentration. Results showed that moisture content, water solubility and WVP decreased as the chain length of fatty  increased. Therefore, LPSG-fatty acids composite film could be used for packaging in which a low affinity toward water is needed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AgNP exposure can increase amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in neuronal cells to potentially induce Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, the mechanism through which AgNPs alter BBB permeability in endothelial cells and subsequently lead to AD progression remains unclear. This study investigated whether AgNPs disrupt the tight junction proteins of brain endothelial cells, and alter the proteomic metabolism of neuronal cells underlying AD progression in a triple cell coculture model constructed using mouse brain endothelial (bEnd.3) cells, mouse brain astrocytes (ALT), and mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2a) cells. The results showed that AgNPs accumulated in ALT and N2a cells because of the disruption of tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and ZO-1, in bEnd.3 cells. The proteomic profiling of N2a cells after AgNP exposure identified 298 differentially expressed proteins related to fatty  metabolism. Particularly, AgNP-induced  production was observed in N2a cells, which might promote Aβ generation. Moreover, AgNP exposure increased the protein expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ generation-related secretases, PSEN1, PSEN2, and β-site APP cleaving enzyme for APP cleavage in ALT and N2a cells, stimulated Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion in the culture medium, and attenuated the gene expression of Aβ clearance-related receptors, P-gp and LRP-1, in bEnd.3 cells. Increased Aβ might further aggregate on the neuronal cell surface to enhance the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, MCP-1 and IL-6, thus inducing apoptosis in N2a cells. This study suggested that AgNP exposure might cause Aβ deposition and inflammation for subsequent neuronal cell apoptosis to potentially induce AD progression.© The Author 2017.

Dietary fatty acids, which cross the blood-brain , may regulate the transcription of lipogenic enzymes through activation of transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). The PPARs form the transcription complex with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) that are activated by 9-cis retinoic , a metabolite of vitamin A (VA). The study examines whether challenge of astrocytes with VA, prior 24-h treatment with  (PA), alpha-linolenic  (ALA) or docosahexaenoic  (DHA) has the effect on the FADS2 expression. RT-qPCR showed that in astrocytes not challenged with VA, PA increased fads2 gene expression and DHA decreased it. However, in VA-primed astrocytes, PA doubled the FADS2 mRNA levels, while DHA increased fads2 gene expression, oppositely to non-primed cells. Furthermore, similar changes were seen in VA-primed astrocytes with regard to delta6-desaturase protein levels following PA and DHA treatment. ALA did not have any effect on the FADS2 mRNA and protein levels in either VA-primed or non-primed astrocytes. These findings indicate that in the presence of vitamin A, DHA upregulates fads2 gene expression in astrocytes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25801844>Palmitoylethanolamide Regulates Production of Pro-Angiogenic Mediators in a Model of β Amyloid-Induced Astrogliosis In Vitro.</a></h2><p>Aβ-induced astrogliosis can worsen the eziopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) by the release of proinflammatory and pro-oxidant mediators. Activated glial cells may release also pro-angiogenic molecules. The role of angiogenesis in AD is still controversial: although angiogenesis brings oxygen and nutrients to injured tissue, it may also exacerbate reactive gliosis. Moreover, by altering blood-brain  permeability pro-angiogenic mediators promote passage of inflammatory/immune-competent cells into the brain, thereby exacerbating gliosis. The release of proangiogenic factors during astrogliosis may thus be a key-step in controlling AD progression. The endogenous fatty  amide, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), is a pleiotropic mediator exerting anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antiangiogenic effects in several in vitro and in vivo models of chronic-degenerative disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of PEA in AD angiogenesis and neuroinflammation by using conditioned medium from untreated and Aβ-treated C6 rat astroglioma cells and HUVEC human endothelial cells. PEA (10<sup>-8</sup>-10<sup>-6</sup> M) concentration-dependently reduced expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic markers in Aβ (1 μg/mL)-stimulated C6 cells. Moreover, culture medium from PEA-treated C6 cells reduced HUVEC cell proliferation as compared to cells treated with conditioned medium from Aβ-treated C6 cells. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that PEA treatment inhibited nuclear levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (the main pro-angiogenic pathway) and cytoplasmic vascular endothelial growth factor in HUVEC cells receiving C6 conditioned medium. Finally, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha inhibitor GW6471, added to Aβ-treated C6 cells blocked all PEA effects in this model, suggesting that PEA acts through a proliferator-activated receptor alpha-dependent mechanism on astroglial cells.

Resistance to FHB is highly complex and quantitative in nature, and is most often classified as resistance to spikelet infection and resistance to spread of pathogen through the rachis. In the present study, a resistant (CI9831) and a susceptible (H106-371) two-row barley genotypes, with contrasting levels of spikelet resistance to FHB, pathogen or mock-inoculated, were profiled for metabolites based on liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry. The key resistance-related (RR) metabolites belonging to fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified. The free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and  acids were among the highest fold change RR induced (RRI) metabolites. These FFAs are deposited as cutin monomers and oligomers to reinforce the cuticle, which acts as a  to pathogen entry. Quantitative real-time PCR studies revealed higher expressions of KAS2, CYP86A2, CYP89A2, LACS2 and WAX INDUCER1 (HvWIN1) transcription factor in the pathogen-inoculated resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype. Knockdown of HvWIN1 by virus-induced genes silencing (VIGS) in resistant genotype upon pathogen inoculation increased the disease severity and fungal biomass, and decreased the abundance of FFAs like linoleic and  acids. Notably, the expression of CYP86A2, CYP89A2 and LAC2 genes was also suppressed, proving the link of HvWIN1 in regulating these genes in cuticle biosynthesis as a defense response.© The Author 2016.

This non-familiar form could be a consequence of metabolic syndrome, characterized by obesity and the development of a brain-specific insulin resistance known as type III diabetes. This work demonstrates the development of a significant AD-like neuropathology due to these metabolic alterations.C57BL/6J mice strain were divided into two groups, one fed with a diet rich in  (high-fat diet, HFD) since their weaning until 16 months of age, and another group used as a control with a regular diet. The analyses were carried out in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus using a Thioflavin-S stain and immunofluorescence assays.The most significant finding of the present research was that HFD induced the deposition of the βA peptide. Moreover, the diet also caused alterations in different cell processes, such as increased inflammatory reactions that lead to a decrease in the neuronal precursor cells. In addition, the results show that there were also dysregulations in normal autophagy and apoptosis, mechanisms related to βA formation.The present findings confirm that HFD favors the formation of βA depositions in the brain, a key feature of AD, supporting the metabolic hypothesis of sporadic AD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In addition, rat pups underwent oral administration of oil (palm, rapeseed, or sunflower oil) or water (10 μL/g body weight, postnatal days 10-15). Subsequently, colon goblet cells were studied by Western blotting, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry and colonic transmucosal electrical resistance was measured by using Ussing chambers.In vitro,  enhanced MUC2 production (140% of control) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α expression, whereas oleic, linoleic, γ-linolenic, α-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids reduced MUC2 expression (at least -50% of control). All unsaturated LCFAs decreased the expression of human atonal homolog 1, a transcription factor controlling goblet cell differentiation (at least -31% vs. control). In vivo, rats fed palm oil had higher  concentrations (3-fold) in their colonic contents and increased mucus granule surfaces in their goblet cells (>2-fold) than did all other groups. Palm oil also increased colonic transmucosal electrical resistance (245% of control), yet had no effect on occludin and zonula occludens-1 expression. In contrast, sunflower and rapeseed oils decreased goblet cell number when compared with control (at least -10%) and palm oil (at least -14%) groups.Palm oil in rat pups and  in HT29-MTX cells increase the production of MUC2 and strengthen the intestinal .

A parsimonious mechanism involves leakage of albumin-bound nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) across the damaged glomerular filtration  and subsequent reabsorption by the downstream proximal tubule, causing lipoapoptosis. We sought to identify the apical proximal tubule transporter that mediates NEFA uptake and cytotoxicity. We observed transporter-mediated uptake of fluorescently labeled NEFA in cultured proximal tubule cells and microperfused rat proximal tubules, with greater uptake from the apical surface than from the basolateral surface. Protein and mRNA expression analyses revealed that kidney proximal tubules express transmembrane fatty  transporter-2 (FATP2), encoded by , but not the other candidate transporters CD36 and free fatty  receptor 1. Kidney FATP2 localized exclusively to proximal tubule epithelial cells along the apical but not the basolateral membrane. Treatment of mice with lipidated albumin to induce proteinuria caused a decrease in the proportion of tubular epithelial cells and an increase in the proportion of interstitial space in kidneys from wild-type but not  mice.  microperfusion and  experiments with NEFA-bound albumin at concentrations that mimic apical proximal tubule exposure during glomerular injury revealed significantly reduced NEFA uptake and palmitate-induced apoptosis in microperfused  proximal tubules and  or FATP2 shRNA-treated proximal tubule cell lines compared with wild-type or scrambled oligonucleotide-treated cells, respectively.

In BM cells, the OXPHOS/metabolism dysfunction provoked by the loss of AIF was counterbalanced by the augmentation of the mitochondrial biogenesis and a shift towards anaerobic glycolysis. Nevertheless, in a caspase-independent process, the resulting excess of reactive oxygen species compromised the viability of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitors. This led to the progressive exhaustion of the HSC pool, a reduced capacity of the BM progenitors to differentiate into colonies in methylcellulose assays, and the absence of cell-autonomous HSC repopulating potential in vivo. In contrast to BM cells, AIF thymocytes compensated for the OXPHOS breakdown by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation. By over-expressing CPT1, ACADL and PDK4, three key enzymes facilitating fatty  β-oxidation (e.g.,  assimilation), the AIF thymocytes retrieved the ATP levels of the AIF  cells. As a consequence, it was possible to significantly reestablish AIF thymopoiesis in vivo by feeding the animals with a high-fat diet complemented with an antioxidant. Overall, our data reveal that the mitochondrial signals regulated by AIF are critical to hematopoietic decision-making. Emerging as a link between mitochondrial metabolism and hematopoietic cell fate, AIF-mediated OXPHOS regulation represents a target for the development of new immunomodulatory therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26545114>Renal Lipotoxicity-Associated Inflammation and Insulin Resistance Affects Actin Cytoskeleton Organization in Podocytes.</a></h2><p>In the last few decades a change in lifestyle has led to an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity and obesity-associated complications. Obese patients are at increased risk of developing hypertension, heart disease, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes and renal disease. The excess calories are stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue, but also may accumulate ectopically in other organs, including the kidney, which contributes to the damage through a toxic process named lipotoxicity. Recently, the evidence suggests that renal lipid accumulation leads to glomerular damage and, more specifically, produces dysfunction in podocytes, key cells that compose and maintain the glomerular filtration . Our aim was to analyze the early mechanisms underlying the development of renal disease associated with the process of lipotoxicity in podocytes. Our results show that treatment of podocytes with  produced intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. This was accompanied by the development of inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance. We found specific rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and slit diaphragm proteins (Nephrin, P-Cadherin, Vimentin) associated with this insulin resistance in -treated podocytes. We conclude that lipotoxicity accelerates glomerular disease through lipid accumulation and inflammation. Moreover, saturated fatty acids specifically promote insulin resistance by disturbing the cytoarchitecture of podocytes. These data suggest that renal lipid metabolism and cytoskeleton rearrangements may serve as a target for specific therapies aimed at slowing the progression of podocyte failure during metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28994119>Naturally occurring ω-Hydroxyacids.</a></h2><p>ω-Hydroxyacids are fatty acids bearing a hydroxyl group on the terminal carbon. They are found in mammals and higher plants and are often involved in providing a permeability , the primary purpose of which is to reduce water loss. Some ω-hydroxyacid derivatives may be involved in waterproofing and signalling. The purpose of this review was to survey the known natural sources of ω-hydroxyacids. ω-Hydroxyacids are produced by two different P450-dependent mechanisms. The longer (30-34 carbons) ω-hydroxyacids are produced by chain extension from  until the chain extends across the membrane in which the extension is taking place, and then the terminal carbon is hydroxylated. Shorter fatty acids can be hydroxylated directly to produce C16 and C18 ω-hydroxyacids found in plants and 20-eicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) by a different P450. The C16 and C18 ω-hydroxyacids are components of polymers in plants. The long-chain ω-hydroxyacids are found in epidermal sphingolipids, in giant-ring lactones from the sebum of members of the equidae, as a component of meibum and in carnauba wax and wool wax.© 2017 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26165742>Metabolomic profiles reveal key metabolic changes in heat stress-treated mouse Sertoli cells.</a></h2><p>Heat stress (HS) is a potential harmful factor for male reproduction. However, the effect of HS on Sertoli cells is largely unknown. In this study, the metabolic changes in Sertoli cell line were analyzed after HS treatment. Metabolomic analysis revealed that carnitine, 2-hydroxy , nicotinic , niacinamide, adenosine monophosphate, glutamine and creatine were the key changed metabolites. We found the expression levels of BTB factors (Connexin43, ZO-1, Vimentin, Claudin1, Claudin5) were disrupted in TM-4 cells after HS treatment, which were recovered by the addition of carnitine. RT-PCR indicated that the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6) were increased after HS treatment, and their related miRNAs (miR-132, miR-431, miR-543) levels were decreased. Our metabolomic data provided a novel understanding of metabolic changes in male reproductive cells after HS treatment and revealed that HS-induced changes of BTB factors and inflammatory status might be caused by the decreased carnitine after HS treatment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Immunohistochemistry was used to analyse the macrophage subsets. Human peripheral blood monocytes were differentiated in the presence of either supernatant from human SZ95 sebocytes or major sebum lipid components and activated with Propionibacterium acnes. Macrophage surface markers and their capacity to uptake fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated P. acnes were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting measurements. Cytokine protein levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis.Sebaceous gland-rich skin had an increased dermal lipid content vs. sebaceous gland-poor skin to which all the tested sebum component lipids could contribute by penetrating the dermoepidermal . Of the lipids, oleic  and linoleic  promoted monocyte differentiation into alternatively activated macrophages. Moreover, linoleic  also had an anti-inflammatory effect in P. acnes-activated macrophages, inhibiting the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Squalene, , stearic  and oleic  augmented the secretion of IL-1β, even in the absence of P. acnes, whereas oleic  had a selective effect of inducing IL-1β but downregulating IL-6 and TNF-α secretion.Our results suggest a role for sebaceous glands in modulating innate immune responses via their secreted lipids that are of possible pathological and therapeutic relevance.© 2017 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853818>Effects of elevated growth temperature and heat shock on the lipid composition of the inner and outer membranes of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.</a></h2><p>Differences in the distribution of individual phospholipids between the inner (IM) and outer membranes (OM) of gram-negative bacteria have been detected in mesophilic Escherichia, Erwinia and Salmonella species but have never been investigated in the psychrotrophic Yersinia genus. Therefore, the influence of an elevated growth temperature and heat shock on the phospholipid and fatty  (FA) compositions of the fractionated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis envelope was investigated. The shift of the growth temperature from 8 °C to 37 °C to mimic the switch from saprophytic to parasitic growth of this bacteria and the exposure of the cells to heat shock, which was induced by a sharp increase in the temperature from 8 °C to 45 °C, increased the lysophosphatidylethanolamine content from zero and 1% to 6% and 10% in the IM and OM, respectively. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content and a drastic increase (up to 3-fold higher) in the phosphatidylglycerol (PG) level in the OM of the bacteria, which increases the net negative charge of the cell envelope. The levels of the predominant saturated  (16:0) and cyclopropane FAs were approximately 1.5- and 7.5-fold higher, respectively, but the content of the predominant unsaturated palmitoleic (16:1n-7) and cis-vaccenic (18:1n-7) FAs was approximately 10-30-fold lower in both membranes that were isolated from the cells grown at elevated temperatures. Due to these changes, reflecting the process of "homeoviscous adaptation", the ratio between the unsaturated and saturated FAs decreased but remained higher in the IM than that in the OM. Simultaneously, no significant changes were observed in the FA composition of cells subjected to heat shock, demonstrating a difference between the responses of the heat-shocked and heat-adapted Y. pseudotuberculosis. The unique ability of Y. pseudotuberculosis to reciprocally regulate the ratio of anionic PG and net neutral PE and therefore adjust the negative charge of the OM may be a common strategy used by pathogenic bacteria to promote the   of the OM.Copyright © 2016.

(PA) is the most abundant type of saturated fatty  in human body. PA is bound with albumin in plasma and could not pass through endothelial  freely. Albumin-bound PA has to be transported across monolayer endothelial cells through intracellular transcytosis, but not intercellular diffusion. In the present study, we discovered that TNF-α might stimulate PA transcytosis across cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, which further impaired the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by cardiomyocytes and promoted insulin resistance. In this process, TNF-α-stimulated endothelial autophagy and NF-κB signaling crosstalk with each other and orchestrate the whole event, ultimately result in increased expression of fatty  transporter protein 4 (FATP4) in endothelial cells and mediate the increased PA transcytosis across microvascular endothelial cells. Hopefully the present study discovered a novel missing link between low grade systemic inflammation and insulin resistance.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29413957>2-Chlorohexadecanoic  induces ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Peripheral leukocytes induce blood-brain  (BBB) dysfunction through the release of cytotoxic mediators. These include hypochlorous  (HOCl) that is formed via the myeloperoxidase-HO-chloride system of activated phagocytes. HOCl targets the endogenous pool of ether phospholipids (plasmalogens) generating chlorinated inflammatory mediators like e.g. 2-chlorohexadecanal and its conversion product 2-chlorohexadecanoic  (2-ClHA). In the cerebrovasculature these compounds inflict damage to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) that form the morphological basis of the BBB. To follow subcellular trafficking of 2-ClHA we synthesized a 'clickable' alkyne derivative (2-ClHyA) that phenocopied the biological activity of the parent compound. Confocal and superresolution structured illumination microscopy revealed accumulation of 2-ClHyA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria of human BMVEC (hCMEC/D3 cell line). 2-ClHA and its alkyne analogue interfered with protein palmitoylation, induced ER-stress markers, reduced the ER ATP content, and activated transcription and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 as well as IL-8. 2-ClHA disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) inhibitor GSK2606414 suppressed 2-ClHA-mediated activating transcription factor 4 synthesis and IL-6/8 secretion, but showed no effect on endothelial  dysfunction and cleavage of procaspase-3. Our data indicate that 2-ClHA induces potent lipotoxic responses in brain endothelial cells and could have implications in inflammation-induced BBB dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The position of proline relative to other residues being post-translationally modified has been previously reported as being important. We determined that proline is statistically enriched around cysteines known to be S-palmitoylated. The goal of this work was to determine how the position of proline influences the palmitoylation of the cysteine residue. We established a mass spectrometry-based approach to investigate time- and temperature-dependent kinetics of autopalmitoylation in vitro and to derive the thermodynamic parameters of the transition state associated with palmitoylation; to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study the kinetics and activation properties of the palmitoylation process. We then used these thermochemical parameters to determine if the position of proline relative to the modified cysteine is important for palmitoylation. Our results show that peptides with proline at the -1 position of cysteine in their sequence (PC) have lower enthalpic barriers and higher entropic barriers in comparison to the same peptides with proline at the +1 position of cysteine (CP); interestingly, the free-energy barriers for both pairs are almost identical. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the flexibility of the cysteine backbone in the PC-containing peptide when compared to the CP-containing peptide explains the increased entropic  and decreased enthalpic  observed experimentally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698466>Profiling of epidermal lipids in a mouse model of dermatitis: Identification of potential biomarkers.</a></h2><p>Lipids are important structural and functional components of the skin. Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with inflammation and can affect the   of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient cpdm mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in cpdm epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the Fasn gene which encodes fatty  synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs). Tentative attribution of the most significant transitions was confirmed by product ion scan (MS/MS), and the MRM-profiling linear intensity response was validated with a C17-ceramide lipid standard. Relative quantification of sphingosine ceramides CerAS(d18:1/24:0)2OH, CerAS(d18:1/16:0)2OH and CerNS(d18:1/16:0) discriminated between the two groups with 100% accuracy, while the free fatty acids cerotic , 16-hydroxy , and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) had 96.4% of accuracy. Validation by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the above-mentioned ceramides was in agreement with MRM-profiling results. Identification and rapid monitoring of these lipids represent a tool to assess therapeutic outcomes in SHARPIN-deficient mice and other mouse models of dermatitis and may have diagnostic utility in atopic dermatitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28225005>Autophagy Protects against -Induced Apoptosis in Podocytes in vitro.</a></h2><p>Autophagy is a highly conserved degradation process that is involved in the clearance of proteins and damaged organelles to maintain intracellular homeostasis and cell integrity. Type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by dyslipidemia with elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Podocytes, as an important component of the filtration , are susceptible to lipid disorders. The loss of podocytes causes proteinuria, which is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In the present study, we demonstrated that  (PA) promoted autophagy in podocytes. We further found that PA increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in podocytes and that NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine), a potent antioxidant, significantly eliminated the excessive ROS and suppressed autophagy, indicating that the increased generation of ROS was associated with the -induced autophagy in podocytes. Moreover, we also found that PA stimulation decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential in podocytes and induced podocyte apoptosis, while the inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) enhanced -induced apoptosis accompanied by increased ROS generation, and the stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin (Rap) remarkably suppressed -induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Taken together, these in vitro findings suggest that PA-induced autophagy in podocytes is mediated by ROS production and that autophagy plays a protective role against PA-induced podocyte apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29930468>Dynamic alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolome during the development of methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>To investigate changes in gut microbiota and metabolism during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development in mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet.Twenty-four male C57BL/6J mice were equally divided into four groups and fed a methionine-choline-sufficient diet for 2 wk (Control 2w group,  = 6) or 4 wk (Control 4w group,  = 6) or the MCD diet for 2 wk (MCD 2w group,  = 6) or 4 wk (MCD 4w group,  = 6).

These differences lead to an altered SC lipid organization and thereby a reduced   compared to human skin. In this study, we aimed to improve the SC FA composition and, consequently, the SC lipid organization of the Leiden epidermal model (LEM) by specific medium supplements. The standard FA mixture (consisting of , linoleic and arachidonic acids) supplemented to the medium was modified, by replacing protonated  with deuterated  or by the addition of deuterated arachidic  to the mixture, to determine whether FAs are taken up from the medium and are incorporated into SC of LEM. Furthermore, supplementation of the total FA mixture or that of  alone was increased four times to examine whether this improves the SC FA composition and lipid organization of LEM. The results demonstrate that the deuterated FAs are taken up into LEMs and are subsequently elongated and incorporated in their SC. However, a fourfold increase in  supplementation does not change the SC FA composition or lipid organization of LEM. Increasing the concentration of the total FA mixture in the medium resulted in a decreased level of very long chain FAs and an increased level of mono-unsaturated FAs, which lead to deteriorated SC lipid properties. These results indicate that SC lipid properties can be modulated by specific medium supplements.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

They differ by their structure, presence in the skin, and mode of application in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics compounding. These FAs are also known as chemical penetration enhancers, but their mechanisms of penetration enhancement and effect on  characteristics of the skin require additional study. In this study, the authors conducted an ex vivo analysis of the distribution of lipid components in the epidermis and dermis of human skin after applying individual FAs. The goal was to elucidate possible mechanisms of penetration enhancement and FA effects on  characteristics of the skin. FA penetration studies were conducted ex vivo on human skin and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) bioimaging analysis was performed to visualize and analyze distribution of FAs in skin sections. The current study demonstrated that TOF-SIMS imaging was effective in visualizing the distribution of linoleic, oleic, palmitoleic, , and stearic  in the human skin ex vivo after the skin penetration experiment of individual FAs. The integration of the obtained TOF-SIMS images allowed a semiquantitative comparison of the effects induced by individual FA applications on the human skin ex vivo. FAs showed varying abilities to penetrate the skin and disorder the FAs within the skin, based on their structures and physicochemical properties. Linoleic  penetrated the skin and changed the distribution of all the analyzed FAs. Skin treatment with palmitoleic or oleic  increased the amounts of singular FAs in the skin. Penetration of saturated FAs was low, but it increased the detected amounts of linoleic  in both skin layers. The results indicate that application of FAs on the skin surface induce redistribution of native FAs not only in the stratum corneum layer of epidermis but also in the lipid content of full epidermis and dermis layers. The results indicate that topically applied pharmaceutical products should be evaluated for potential chemical penetration enhancement and lipid component redistribution effects during formulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167411>2-Chlorofatty acids induce Weibel-Palade body mobilization.</a></h2><p>Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of multiple inflammatory diseases. Leukocyte interactions with the endothelium have significant effects on vascular wall biology and pathophysiology. Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived oxidant products released from leukocytes are potential mediators of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. 2-Chlorofatty acids (2-ClFAs) are produced as a result of MPO-derived HOCl targeting plasmalogen phospholipids. Chlorinated lipids have been shown to be associated with multiple inflammatory diseases, but their impact on surrounding endothelial cells has not been examined. This study tested the biological properties of the 2-ClFA molecular species 2-chlorohexadecanoic  (2-ClHA) on endothelial cells. A synthetic alkyne analog of 2-ClHA, 2-chlorohexadec-15-ynoic  (2-ClHyA), was used to examine the subcellular localization of 2-ClFA in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Click chemistry experiments revealed that 2-ClHyA localizes to Weibel-Palade bodies. 2-ClHA and 2-ClHyA promote the release of P-selectin, von Willebrand factor, and angiopoietin-2 from endothelial cells. Functionally, 2-ClHA and 2-ClHyA cause neutrophils to adhere to and platelets to aggregate on the endothelium, as well as increase permeability of the endothelial  which has been tied to the release of angiopoietin-2. These findings suggest that 2-ClFAs promote endothelial cell dysfunction, which may lead to broad implications in inflammation, thrombosis, and blood vessel stability.Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29426257>Lipid-based nanocarrier efficiently delivers highly water soluble drug across the blood-brain  into brain.</a></h2><p>Delivering highly water soluble drugs across blood-brain  (BBB) is a crucial challenge for the formulation scientists. A successful therapeutic intervention by developing a suitable drug delivery system may revolutionize treatment across BBB. Efforts were given here to unravel the capability of a newly developed fatty  combination (stearic :oleic : = 8.08:4.13:1) (ML) as fundamental component of nanocarrier to deliver highly water soluble zidovudine (AZT) as a model drug into brain across BBB. A comparison was made with an experimentally developed standard phospholipid-based nanocarrier containing AZT. Both the formulations had nanosize spherical unilamellar vesicular structure with highly negative zeta potential along with sustained drug release profiles. Gamma scintigraphic images showed both the radiolabeled formulations successfully crossed BBB, but longer retention in brain was observed for ML-based formulation (MGF) as compared to soya lecithin (SL)-based drug carrier (SYF). Plasma and brain pharmacokinetic data showed less clearance, prolonged residence time, more bioavailability and sustained release of AZT from MGF in rats compared to those data of the rats treated with SYF/AZT suspension. Thus, ML may be utilized to successfully develop drug nanocarrier to deliver drug into brain across BBB, in a sustained manner for a prolong period of time and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for many diseases of brain. Further, many anti-HIV drugs cannot cross BBB sufficiently. Hence, the developed formulation may be a suitable option to carry those drugs into brain for better therapeutic management of HIV.</p></html>
