We demonstrated that  enters the yeast cell, is sorted to mitochondria, resides in both mitochondrial membranes, changes the relative concentrations of different membrane phospholipids, triggers changes in the concentrations of many mitochondrial proteins, and alters some key aspects of mitochondrial functionality. We hypothesized that the -driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome may have a causal role in the remodeling of mitochondrial proteome, which may in turn alter the functional state of mitochondria to create a mitochondrial pattern that delays yeast chronological aging. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating how the ups1Δ, ups2Δ and psd1Δ mutations that eliminate enzymes involved in mitochondrial phospholipid  influence the mitochondrial lipidome. We also assessed how these mutations affect the mitochondrial proteome, influence mitochondrial functionality and impinge on the efficiency of aging delay by . Our findings provide evidence that 1)  initially creates a distinct pro-longevity pattern of mitochondrial lipidome by proportionally decreasing phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin concentrations to maintain equimolar concentrations of these phospholipids, and by increasing phosphatidic  concentration; 2) this pattern of mitochondrial lipidome allows to establish a specific, aging-delaying pattern of mitochondrial proteome; and 3) this pattern of mitochondrial proteome plays an essential role in creating a distinctive, geroprotective pattern of mitochondrial functionality.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26642860>Caffeine protects against experimental acute pancreatitis by inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca2+ release.</a></h2><p>Caffeine reduces toxic Ca signals in pancreatic acinar cells via inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IPR)-mediated signalling, but effects of other xanthines have not been evaluated, nor effects of xanthines on experimental acute pancreatitis (AP). We have determined effects of caffeine and its xanthine metabolites on pancreatic acinar IPR-mediated Ca signalling and experimental AP.Isolated pancreatic acinar cells were exposed to secretagogues, uncaged IP or toxins that induce AP and effects of xanthines, non-xanthine phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cAMP/cGMP) determined. The intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca]), mitochondrial depolarisation and necrosis were assessed by confocal microscopy. Effects of xanthines were evaluated in caerulein-induced AP (CER-AP), taurolithocholic  3-sulfate-induced AP (TLCS-AP) or palmitoleic  plus ethanol-induced AP (fatty  ethyl ester AP (FAEE-AP)). Serum xanthines were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.Caffeine, dimethylxanthines and non-xanthine PDE inhibitors blocked IP-mediated Ca oscillations, while monomethylxanthines had little effect. Caffeine and dimethylxanthines inhibited uncaged IP-induced Ca rises, toxin-induced Ca release, mitochondrial depolarisation and necrotic cell death pathway activation; cAMP/cGMP did not inhibit toxin-induced Ca rises. Caffeine significantly ameliorated CER-AP with most effect at 25 mg/kg (seven injections hourly); paraxanthine or theophylline did not. Caffeine at 25 mg/kg significantly ameliorated TLCS-AP and FAEE-AP. Mean total serum levels of dimethylxanthines and trimethylxanthines peaked at >2 mM with 25 mg/kg caffeine but at <100 µM with 25 mg/kg paraxanthine or theophylline.Caffeine and its dimethylxanthine metabolites reduced pathological IPR-mediated pancreatic acinar Ca signals but only caffeine ameliorated experimental AP. Caffeine is a suitable starting point for medicinal chemistry.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to show that LCA alters the age-related dynamics of changes in levels of many mitochondrial proteins, as well as numerous proteins in cellular locations outside of mitochondria. These proteins belong to 2 regulons, each modulated by a different mitochondrial dysfunction; we call them a partial mitochondrial dysfunction regulon and an oxidative stress regulon. We found that proteins constituting these regulons (1) can be divided into several "clusters", each of which denotes a distinct type of partial mitochondrial dysfunction that elicits a different signaling pathway mediated by a discrete set of transcription factors; (2) exhibit 3 different patterns of the age-related dynamics of changes in their cellular levels; and (3) are encoded by genes whose expression is regulated by the transcription factors Rtg1p/Rtg2p/Rtg3p, Sfp1p, Aft1p, Yap1p, Msn2p/Msn4p, Skn7p and Hog1p, each of which is essential for longevity extension by LCA. Our findings suggest that LCA-driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and functionality, thereby enabling mitochondria to operate as signaling organelles that orchestrate an establishment of an anti-aging transcriptional program for many longevity-defining nuclear genes. Based on these findings, we propose a model for how such LCA-driven changes early and late in life of chronologically aging yeast cause a stepwise development of an anti-aging cellular pattern and its maintenance throughout lifespan.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318299>: a new emergent protector of intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</a></h2><p>LCA and 1,25(OH)D are vitamin D receptor ligands with different binding affinity. The secosteroid stimulates intestinal Ca absorption. Whether LCA alters this process remains unknown. The aim of our work was to determine the effect of LCA on intestinal Ca absorption in the absence or presence of NaDOC, bile  that inhibits the cation transport. The data show that LCA by itself did not alter intestinal Ca absorption, but prevented the inhibitory effect of NaDOC. The concomitant administration of LCA avoided the reduction of intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity caused by NaDOC. In addition, LCA blocked a decrease caused by NaDOC on gene and protein expression of molecules involved in the transcellular pathway of intestinal Ca absorption. The oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC were abrogated by LCA co-treatment. In conclusion, LCA placed in the intestinal lumen protects intestinal Ca absorption against the inhibitory effects caused by NaDOC. LCA avoids the reduction of the transcellular Ca movement, apparently by blocking the oxidative stress and apoptosis triggered by NaDOC, normalizing the gene and protein expression of molecules involved in Ca movement. Therefore, LCA might become a possible treatment to improve intestinal calcium absorption under oxidant conditions.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709472>Activation of TGR5 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>Impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis has been associated with vascular pathophysiology. The G-protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) is an important mediator of bile  signaling and glucose . However, the effects of TGR5 on mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells remain elusive. In this study, we found that activation of TGR5 using its specific agonist taurolithocholic  (TLCA) promoted the expression of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Additionally, activation of TGR5 increased the expression of PGC-1α target genes, such as NRF1 and TFAM. Indeed, we found that TLCA treatment promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial-to-nuclear DNA (mtDNA/nDNA), COX-Ⅰ expression, and cytochrome c oxidase activity in HAECs. Notably, our results displayed that activation of TGR5 resulted in a functional gain in mitochondria by increasing the rate of respiration and ATP production. Mechanistically, we found that TLCA treatment activated the transcriptional factor CREB by inducing the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133. Using the PKA/CREB inhibitor H89 abolished the effects of TLCA on PGC-1α, NRF1 and TFAM expression as well as the increase in mtDNA/nDNA and ATP production. These findings suggest that activation of TGR5 promoted mitochondrial biogenesis in endothelial cells, which is mediated by the CREB/PGC-1α signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Their capability to induce cell death was studied on C6 rat glioma cells, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol was used as positive cytotoxic control. The highest cytotoxicity was observed with  and chenodeoxicholic  derivatives (23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α-hydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1a), and 23-(4-methylfuran-2,5-dione)-3α,7α-dihydroxy-24-nor-5β-cholane (compound 1b), respectively), which induce a non-apoptotic mode of cell death associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species overproduction. No cells with condensed and/or fragmented nuclei, no PARP degradation and no cleaved-caspase-3, which are apoptotic criteria, were observed. Similar effects were found with 7β-hydroxycholesterol. The cell clonogenic survival assay showed that compound 1b was more cytotoxic than compound 1a and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Compound 1b and 7β-hydroxycholesterol also induce cell cycle modifications. In addition, compounds 1a and 1b, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol favour the formation of large acidic vacuoles revealed by staining with acridine orange and monodansylcadaverine evocating autophagic vacuoles; they also induce an increased ratio of [LC3-II / LC3-I], and modify the expression of mTOR, Beclin-1, Atg12, and Atg5-Atg12 which is are autophagic criteria. The ratio [LC3-II / LC3-I] is also strongly modified by bafilomycin acting on the autophagic flux. Rapamycin, an autophagic inducer, and 3-methyladenine, an autophagic inhibitor, reduce and increase 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death, respectively, supporting that 7β-hydroxycholesterol induces survival autophagy. Alpha-tocopherol also strongly attenuates 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced cell death. However, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, and α-tocopherol have no effect on compounds 1a and 1b-induced cell death. It is concluded that these compounds trigger a non apoptotic mode of cell death, involving the mitochondria and associated with several characteristics of autophagy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TRO40303 pharmacokinetics were assessed in cerulein-induced AP and therapeutic efficacy in FAEE-AP induced with palmitoleic  and ethanol. Severity of AP was assessed by standard biomarkers and blinded histopathology.TRO40303 prevented loss of Δψm and necrosis induced by 100 μM palmitoleic  ethyl ester or 500 μM taurolithocholic -3-sulfate in murine and human PACs. Pharmacokinetic analysis found TRO40303 accumulated in the pancreas. A single dose of 3 mg/kg TRO40303 significantly reduced serum amylase (P = 0.043), pancreatic trypsin (P = 0.018), and histopathology scores (P = 0.0058) in FAEE-AP.TRO40303 protects mitochondria and prevents necrotic cell death pathway activation in murine and human PACs, ameliorates the severity of FAEE-AP, and is a candidate drug for human AP.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28593023>Mechanisms Underlying the Essential Role of Mitochondrial Membrane Lipids in Yeast Chronological Aging.</a></h2><p>The functional state of mitochondria is vital to cellular and organismal aging in eukaryotes across phyla. Studies in the yeast  have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids is one of the key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast chronological aging. We demonstrated that exogenously added  bile  can delay chronological aging in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast chronological aging by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern. In this review, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the essential role of mitochondrial membrane lipids in yeast chronological aging.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27729629>Decreased C-reactive protein induces abnormal vascular structure in a rat model of liver dysfunction induced by bile duct ligation.</a></h2><p>Chronic liver disease leads to liver fibrosis, and although the liver does have a certain regenerative capacity, this disease is associated with dysfunction of the liver vessels. C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced in the liver and circulated from there for . CRP was recently shown to inhibit angiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell dysfunction. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of CRP levels on angiogenesis in a rat model of liver dysfunction induced by bile duct ligation (BDL).The diameter of the hepatic vein was analyzed in rat liver tissues using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The expression levels of angiogenic factors, albumin, and CRP were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. A tube formation assay was performed to confirm the effect of CRP on angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with  (LCA) and siRNA-CRP.The diameter of the hepatic portal vein increased significantly with the progression of cirrhosis. The expression levels of angiogenic factors were increased in the cirrhotic liver. In contrast, the expression levels of albumin and CRP were significantly lower in the liver tissue obtained from the BDL rat model than in the normal liver. The CRP level was correlated with the expression of albumin in hepatocytes treated with LCA and siRNA-CRP. Tube formation was significantly decreased in HUVECs when they were treated with LCA or a combination of LCA and siRNA-CRP.CRP seems to be involved in the abnormal formation of vessels in hepatic disease, and so it could be a useful diagnostic marker for hepatic disease.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25878403>Effects of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone in murine acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Although oxidative stress has been strongly implicated in the development of acute pancreatitis (AP), antioxidant therapy in patients has so far been discouraging. The aim of this study was to assess potential protective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, in experimental AP using in vitro and in vivo approaches. MitoQ blocked H2O2-induced intracellular ROS responses in murine pancreatic acinar cells, an action not shared by the control analogue dTPP. MitoQ did not reduce mitochondrial depolarisation induced by either cholecystokinin (CCK) or bile  TLCS, and at 10 µM caused depolarisation per se. Both MitoQ and dTPP increased basal and CCK-induced cell death in a plate-reader assay. In a TLCS-induced AP model MitoQ treatment was not protective. In AP induced by caerulein hyperstimulation (CER-AP), MitoQ exerted mixed effects. Thus, partial amelioration of histopathology scores was observed, actions shared by dTPP, but without reduction of the biochemical markers pancreatic trypsin or serum amylase. Interestingly, lung myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 were concurrently increased by MitoQ in CER-AP. MitoQ caused biphasic effects on ROS production in isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, inhibiting an acute increase but elevating later levels. Our results suggest that MitoQ would be inappropriate for AP therapy, consistent with prior antioxidant evaluations in this disease.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29512691>Effect of  on biologically active α,β-unsaturated aldehydes induced by H2O2 in glioma mitochondria for use in glioma treatment.</a></h2><p> (LCA) is known to kill glioma cells while sparing normal neuronal cells. However, the anti-glioma mechanism of LCA is unclear at present. Although malondialdehyde (MDA) is not specific to detect tumors, biologically active α,β-unsaturated aldehydes can be used to detect the outcome of gliomas, especially the mitochondria, as a research tool. The purpose of this research was to determine the optimum conditions for a  peroxidation model, according to changes in the aldehydes formed from the reaction between 2-thiobarbituric  and biologically active α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Experimental methods and procedures were successfully established for a model of  peroxidation induced by H2O2 in glioma mitochondria for glioma treatment and optimum conditions for LCA treatment were determined. The optimal conditions for the model were a glioma mitochondrial concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, H2O2 concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, duration of action of 30 min, and addition of 4.0 ml of 46 mM thiobarbituric . The effect of LCA, as determined by changes in the UV peaks at 450, 495, and 532 nm, was optimal at a concentration of 100 µM, a duration of action of 15 min, and in an acidic microenvironment. The study concluded that a suitable concentration of LCA has anti-glioma effects as determined by the effect on changes in the UV peaks at 450, 495 and 532 nm and the mitochondrial model developed should be conducive to further in-depth research.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28522903>Oxidative stress, antioxidants and intestinal calcium absorption.</a></h2><p>The disequilibrium between the production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species and their elimination by protective mechanisms leads to oxidative stress.  are the main source of ROS as by-products of electron transport chain. Most of the time the intestine responds adequately against the oxidative stress, but with aging or under conditions that exacerbate the ROS and/or RNS production, the defenses are not enough and contribute to developing intestinal pathologies. The endogenous antioxidant defense system in gut includes glutathione (GSH) and GSH-dependent enzymes as major components. When the ROS and/or RNS production is exacerbated, oxidative stress occurs and the intestinal Ca absorption is inhibited. GSH depleting drugs such as DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, menadione and sodium deoxycholate inhibit the Ca transport from lumen to blood by alteration in the protein expression and/or activity of molecules involved in the Ca transcellular and paracellular pathways through mechanisms of oxidative stress, apoptosis and/or autophagy. Quercetin, melatonin,  and ursodeoxycholic acids block the effect of those drugs in experimental animals by their antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and/or anti-autophagic properties. Therefore, they may become drugs of choice for treatment of deteriorated intestinal Ca absorption under oxidant conditions such as aging, diabetes, gut inflammation and other intestinal disorders.</p><p>Keyword: mitochondria</p></html>
