The chemoattractant hepoxilin A3, an eicosanoid secreted from intestinal epithelial cells by the apically restricted efflux pump multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), mediates this neutrophil influx. Information about a possible counterbalance pathway that could signal the lack of or resolution of an apical  signal, however, has yet to be described. We now report a system with such hallmarks. Specifically, we identify endocannabinoids as the first known endogenous substrates of the apically restricted multidrug resistance transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and reveal a mechanism, which we believe is novel, for endocannabinoid secretion into the intestinal lumen. Knockdown or inhibition of P-gp reduced luminal secretion levels of N-acyl -type endocannabinoids, which correlated with increased neutrophil transmigration in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, loss of CB2, the peripheral cannabinoid receptor, led to increased pathology and neutrophil influx in models of acute intestinal inflammation. These results define a key role for epithelial cells in balancing the constitutive secretion of antiinflammatory lipids with the stimulated secretion of proinflammatory lipids via surface efflux pumps in order to control neutrophil infiltration into the intestinal lumen and maintain homeostasis in the healthy intestine.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28431755>Fever induced by mesalazine.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281321>Complex Bacterial Consortia Reprogram the Colitogenic Activity of  in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model of Chronic, Immune-Mediated Colitis.</a></h2><p> (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear.  is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of  as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of  isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10 mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the  utilization () locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of  genes, deletion of  utilization (Δ) had no impact on  colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10 mice. However, replacement of the  wild type bacteria by a Δ mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10 mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of   utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand  gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type  cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10 mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms  gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in  monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of  genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking  enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that   metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen  toward a protective function.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27219328>Palmitoylethanolamide Modulates Inflammation-Associated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Signaling via the Akt/mTOR Pathway in a Selective Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha (PPAR-α)-Dependent Manner.</a></h2><p>Angiogenesis is emerging as a pivotal process in chronic  pathologies, promoting immune infiltration and prompting carcinogenesis. Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's  (CD) represent paradigmatic examples of intestinal chronic  conditions in which the process of neovascularization correlates with the severity and progression of the . Molecules able to target the angiogenesis have thus the potential to synergistically affect the  course. Beyond its anti- effect, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is able to reduce angiogenesis in several chronic  conditions, but no data about its anti-angiogenic activity in colitis have been produced, yet.The effects of PEA on inflammation-associated angiogenesis in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and in patients with UC were assessed. The release of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), the hemoglobin tissue content, the expression of CD31 and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis were all evaluated in the presence of different concentrations of PEA and concomitant administration of PPAR-α and -γ antagonists.Our results demonstrated that PEA, in a selective peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α dependent mechanism, inhibits colitis-associated angiogenesis, decreasing VEGF release and new vessels formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mTOR/Akt axis regulates, at least partly, the angiogenic process in IBD and that PEA directly affects this pathway.Our results suggest that PEA may improve inflammation-driven angiogenesis in colonic mucosa, thus reducing the mucosal damage and potentially affecting  progression and the shift towards the carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616543>Loss of intestinal sympathetic innervation elicits an innate immune driven colitis.</a></h2><p>Both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system exert control over innate immune responses. In , sympathetic innervation in intestinal mucosa is reduced. Our aim was to investigate the role of sympathetic innervation to the intestine on regulation of the innate immune responses.In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, we evaluated the effect of adrenergic receptor activation on cytokine production and metabolic profile. In vivo, the effect of sympathetic denervation on mucosal innate immune responses using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or using surgical transection of the superior mesenteric nerve (sympathectomy) was tested in Rag1 mice that lack T- and B-lymphocytes.In murine macrophages, adrenergic β2 receptor activation elicited a dose-dependent reduction of LPS-induced cytokines, reduced LPS-induced glycolysis and increased maximum respiration. Sympathectomy led to a significantly decreased norepinephrine concentration in intestinal tissue. Within 14 days after sympathectomy, mice developed clinical signs of colitis, colon oedema and excess colonic cytokine production. Both 6-OHDA and sympathectomy led to prominent goblet cell depletion and histological damage of colonic mucosa.We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system plays a regulatory role in constraining innate immune cell reactivity towards microbial challenges, likely via the adrenergic β2 receptor.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27625036>Adelmidrol, a Palmitoylethanolamide Analogue, as a New Pharmacological Treatment for the Management of .</a></h2><p>Leukocyte infiltration, improved levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and oxidative stress in the colon are the principal factors in . The goal of the current study was to explore the effects of adelmidrol, an analog of the anti- fatty acid amide signaling molecule palmitoylethanolamide, in mice subjected to experimental colitis. Additionally, to clarify whether the protective action of adelmidrol is dependent on the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we investigated the effects of a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662, on adelmidrol action. Adelmidrol (10 mg/kg daily, o.s.) was tested in a murine experimental model of colitis induced by intracolonic administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, were significantly increased in colon tissues after dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid administration. Immunohistochemical staining for ICAM-1, P-selectin, nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP)ribose showed a positive staining in the inflamed colon. Treatment with adelmidrol decreased diarrhea, body weight loss, and myeloperoxidase activity. Adelmidrol treatment, moreover, reduced nuclear factor-κB translocation, cyclooxygenase-2, and phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase expression; proinflammatory cytokine release; and the incidence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP)ribose in the colon. It also decreased the upregulation of ICAM-1 and P-selectin. Adelmidrol treatment produced a reduction of Bax and an intensification of Bcl-2 expression. This study clearly demonstrates that adelmidrol exerts important anti- effects that are partly dependent on PPARγ, suggesting that this molecule may represent a new pharmacologic approach for  treatment.Copyright © 2016 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737507>Leukotrienes and sex: strange bedfellows?</a></h2><p>Leukotrienes are proinflammatory lipid mediators that have been shown to be upregulated in several , including asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory  (AERD), , and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

At the same time, a dysbiotic gut microbiota associated with  is altered in structure and function, and often characterized by a decrease in species richness and proliferation of pathogenic bacterial taxa. As a shared substrate between the host and the gut microbiota, diet significantly impacts the health and  states of the host both directly and through gut microbial metabolite production. This is demonstrated in the examples of short-chain fatty acid and trimethylamine production via bacterial metabolism of dietary complex carbohydrates and choline, respectively. In disorders related to mucosal immune dysregulation such as , the dysbiotic gut microbiota and diet contribute to its pathogenesis. Reversal of dysbiosis through fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary interventions may thus represent important strategies to modify the gut microbiota and its metabolite production for health maintenance as well as  prevention and management.© 2017 Nestec Ltd., Vevey/S.

The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric microbiota composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and , ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable  syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative , such as Parkinson , Alzheimer's  etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota, this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain, obesity and central nervous system . A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of  (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut microbiota, is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable  syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain, microbiota and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system .Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27609529>Faecal and Serum Metabolomics in Paediatric .</a></h2><p> [IBD] is considered to result from the interplay between host and intestinal microbiota but its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in body fluid metabolomics, there are only few studies in children. Hence, this prospective study addressed the faecal and serum metabolomics in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD.Paediatric patients with IBD undergoing diagnostic endoscopies and controls also with endoscopy but no signs of inflammation provided blood and stool samples in a tertiary care hospital. Blood  markers and faecal calprotectin levels were determined. The serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.Serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric IBD patients were different from healthy controls and categorized Crohn's  and ulcerative colitis [UC] patients into separate groups. In serum, amino acid metabolism, folate biosynthesis and signalling pathways were perturbed in Crohn's ; in UC also sphingolipid metabolic pathways were perturbed when compared to controls. In faecal samples, there was an increased level of several metabolites in UC in contrast to low or intermediate levels in Crohn's . There was a clear correlation with the level of inflammation, i.e. faecal calprotectin levels and the profile of various biologically important metabolites [carnosine, ribose and, most significantly, choline].Characterization of  pattern using metabolomics analysis is a promising tool for better understanding  pathogenesis of paediatric IBD.Copyright © 2016 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty acid conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty acid conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic acid (PA-5-HT), stearic acid (SA-5-HT) and oleic acid (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro- mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response. Our findings may be of relevance in relation to intestinal   like Crohn's  and Ulcerative colitis.Copyright © 2017.

Among these, the  conjugate of the n-3 poly unsaturated long chain fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) (DHA) was shown to possess strong anti- properties. Previously, we identified the serotonin conjugate of DHA, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), in intestinal tissues and showed that its levels are markedly influenced by intake of n-3 PUFAs.

Here, we show that DHA-5-HT possesses potent anti- properties by attenuating the IL-23-IL-17 signaling cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA-5-HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes, particularly those involved in generating a CD4+ Th17 response. Hence, levels of PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving the activation of pathogenic Th17 cells in a concerted way, were found to be significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100-500nM DHA-5-HT. Furthermore, DHA-5-HT inhibited the ability of RAW264.7 cells to migrate and downregulated chemokines like MCP-1, CCL-20, and gene-expression of CCL-22 and of several metalloproteinases.

The actions of PEA are terminated following hydrolysis by 2 enzymes: fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and the less-studied N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA). This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for  (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the colitis-related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration. This is the first report of an anti- effect of a systemically administered NAAA inhibitor. Because NAAA is the enzyme responsible for the control of PEA levels in the colon, we put forth this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammation in general and IBD in particular.© FASEB.</p><p>Keyword: inflammatory bowel disease</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210147>Drug exposure and the risk of multiple sclerosis: A systematic review.</a></h2><p>Several environmental and lifestyle factors have been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) risk, including some pharmacological treatments.
