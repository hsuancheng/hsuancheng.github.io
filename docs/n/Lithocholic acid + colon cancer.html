Male F344 rats were treated with two doses of AOM (15 mg/kg) at 7 days apart and fed either basal MF or MF plus 0.4% of cholic (CA), deoxycholic (DCA), chenodeoxycholic (CDCA),  (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic (UDCA)  mixed diets for 8 weeks after the first AOM dose. The mean number of ACF/ of the rats fed CA, DCA, CDCA and LCA were higher than that of MF-fed group and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.005). But the mean number of ACFs/ was significantly (P < 0.005) lower in UDCA diet-fed rats compared to MF. UDCA-fed rats also showed a significant decrease in average crypt multiplicity (number of crypts/focus) of ACF compared to MF alone. The mean number of ACF with > or =5 crypts was about 2.5-3.7 times higher in case of CA, DCA, CDCA and LCA and about 8.2 times lower in UDCA compared to the control MF diet group. In a parallel study, feeding for 18 weeks of the same BAs mixed diets without AOM administration did not significantly induce ACF. Therefore, these data suggest that dietary BAs by themselves do not induce ACF in F344 rats but enhance or, in the case of UDCA, suppress the development and growth of AOM-induced ACF.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14707397>Does ursodeoxycholic  change the proliferation of the colorectal mucosa?.

To explain this, a reduced proliferation of the colorectal mucosal proliferation was suggested. We, therefore, examined the influence of UDCA on the proliferation of normal colorectal mucosa in humans.Following endoscopic polypectomy, 20 patients with colorectal adenomas were randomized to receive either UDCA (750 mg/day, n = 10, group A) or placebo (n = 10, group B) for 6 months in a double-blinded way. Colorectal biopsies were sampled before and at the end of the medication by total colonoscopy. Colorectal mucosal proliferation was measured by FACScan analysis of propidium iodine labeling. Serum was sampled, and serum bile acids were analyzed by gas chromatography.The proliferation rates at the end of the study were similar in both groups (median 15.4%; range 12.0-20.9 in group A; median 16.0%, 14.0-20.2 in group B, p = 0.41). Serum  levels at the end of the study were significantly higher in group A (1.3 micromol/l, 0.9-1.8) than in group B (0.7 micromol/l, 0-1.7, p < 0.02), whereas serum deoxycholic  levels were similar in both groups.In this study, UDCA treatment for 6 months does not seem to induce changes in the proliferative behavior of the colorectal mucosa in patients with adenomas. It seems likely that a putative chemopreventive effect of UDCA in humans is not exerted by a reduction of the colorectal proliferation.Copyright 2003 S.

Bile  has been reported to be associated with induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene. Because the human liver-specific organic anion transporter-2 (LST-2/OATP8/OATP1B3) is expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and might transport bile acids to the intracellular space, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which bile acids induce the transcription of COX-2, and the role of LST-2 in  cell lines.Transcriptional activity of COX-2 was measured using a human COX-2 promoter-luciferase assay under various concentrations of bile acids. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) for peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE) were performed.The COX-2 promoter was induced by  (LCA), deoxycholic  (DCA), and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA). Deletion and site-directed mutation analyses showed that CRE is the responsive element for LCA. An adenovirus expression system revealed that LST-2 is responsible for induction of COX-2. By EMSA using oligonucleotides of CRE, we observed formation of a specific protein-DNA complex, which was inhibited by a specific antibody against PPARalpha and CRE. A PPARalpha-specific agonist induced transcription of COX-2.These results indicate that COX-2 is transcriptionally activated by the addition of LCA, CDCA, and DCA and that LST-2 plays an important role by transporting bile  to the intracellular space. Moreover, LCA-dependent COX-2 gene activation consists of a transcriptional complex including PPARalpha and CRE-binding protein. Thus, this induction of COX-2 may participate in carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal  cells.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic  metabolism by gut microbes and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat. Saturated fat induces increased bile secretion into the intestine. Increased bile secretion selects for populations of gut microbes capable of altering the bile  pool, generating tumor-promoting secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic  and . Epidemiological evidence suggests CRC is associated with increased levels of DCA in serum, bile, and stool. Mechanisms by which secondary bile acids promote CRC are explored. Furthermore, in humans bile  conjugation can vary by diet. Vegetarian diets favor glycine conjugation while diets high in animal protein favor taurine conjugation. Metabolism of taurine conjugated bile acids by gut microbes generates hydrogen sulfide, a genotoxic compound. Thus, taurocholic  has the potential to stimulate intestinal bacteria capable of converting taurine and cholic  to hydrogen sulfide and deoxycholic , a genotoxin and tumor-promoter, respectively.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19711910>Consumption of some polyphenols reduces fecal deoxycholic  and , the secondary bile acids of risk factors of .</a></h2><p>This study was performed to examine the effect of dietary polyphenols on fecal secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic  and , the risk factors of , in rats fed a high-fat diet.

This study was designed to investigate BA metabolism in continuous cultures of mixed fecal bacteria to get further insights into the mechanisms of this inhibition. Fermentation vessels were fed with media containing cholic (0.6 g/l) and chenodeoxycholic  (0.4 g/l). Cultures were either starch-free or enriched with starch (10 g/l). pH was controlled and adjusted to 7.0 or 6.0.

At pH 6, significantly more primary BA remained in the media and less secondary BA were produced. Total BA concentrations were lower at pH7. SCFA concentrations were higher in the vessels supplemented with starch. Starch was completely fermented and not present in significant amounts in any fermentation vial after the first week. These data indicate that bacterial breakdown of primary to secondary BA is inhibited when starch is simultaneously fermented.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a receptor for the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and mediates vitamin D regulation of specific target gene expression. The secondary bile  , which is produced by intestinal bacteria, is another natural VDR ligand. VDR signaling has been suggested to be involved in reciprocal communication between intestinal cells, including immune and epithelial cells, and intestinal microflora. In addition to epidemiological studies on vitamin D status, genome-wide analyses and cellular and animal experiments have shown that VDR is involved in the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). VDR deletion in mice exaggerates colitis and colon tumorigenesis in experimental models, and treatment of mice with synthetic vitamin D analogues ameliorates pathological changes in these diseases. Several VDR ligands are less active in increasing serum calcium levels, showing higher therapeutic efficiency than the natural hormone 1,25(OH)2D3. VDR plays a role in intestinal homeostasis and in protection against IBD and CRC. The development of VDR ligands with reduced or no calcemic activity will be necessary to expand clinical application of VDRtargeting therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27464459>Combination of soya pulp and Bacillus coagulans lilac-01 improves intestinal bile  metabolism without impairing the effects of prebiotics in rats fed a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria are involved in bile  (BA) deconjugation and/or dehydroxylation and are responsible for the production of secondary BA. However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal microbiota due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced  and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as deoxycholic  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion.

Animal model studies have shown that diets which are high in omega-6 fatty acids increase  tumor promotion, whereas diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids have no such enhancing effect. The mechanisms by which the high fat content of the diet promotes  carcinogenesis may include the production of secondary bile acids in the  and the modulation of  luminal bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase that is involved in generating secondary bile acids, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and mucosal PI-PLC, as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase and protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we investigated the effect of high-fat diets that are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids on cecal bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase and PI-PLC, fecal secondary bile acids, and  mucosal DAG kinase and PKC activities during different stages of  carcinogenesis in male F344 rats. At 5 weeks of age, groups of animals were fed a low-fat diet containing 5% corn oil (LFCO). Beginning at 7 weeks of age, all animals, except those intended as vehicle controls, received azoxymethane (AOM) s.c. once weekly for 2 weeks at a dose rate of 15 mg/kg body weight. Vehicle-treated groups received s.c. injections of normal saline. One day after the second AOM or saline treatment, the experimental groups of animals were transferred to a high-fat diet containing 23.5% corn oil (HFCO) or 20.5% fish oil + 3% corn oil (HFFO). One group continued on the LFCO diet. Animals were sacrificed at weeks 1, 12, and 36 after the AOM or saline treatment.  mucosa were harvested at weeks 1, 12, or 36, and the  tumor tissues were examined for PKC and DAG kinase activities. Contents of the cecum were analyzed for bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase and PI-PLC activities. Stool samples collected at week 12 were analyzed for bile acids. High corn oil content of the diet significantly increased the cecal bacterial 7 alpha-dehydroxylase and PI-PLC activities as compared to the diets with high fish oil or low corn oil content. Animals fed the HFCO diet excreted higher levels of secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic  and , than those fed the LFCO or HFFO diets. Carcinogen treatment significantly enhanced the activities of DAG kinase and total membrane PKC activities in  mucosa compared to saline treatment in all dietary groups. Animals treated with saline or AOM and fed HFCO showed increased levels of DAG kinase and membrane PKC activities in the  mucosa when compared to LFCO and HFFO groups. DAG kinase and membrane PKC activities were higher in  tumors than in the surrounding  mucosa, and also increased levels of these enzyme activities were found in the HFCO diet group. These results indicate that the modifying effect of dietary fat on  bacterial enzymes, secondary bile acids,  mucosal and tumor DAG kinase, and PKC that may play a role in  carcinogenesis depends on the types and amount of fat given. The  tumor-enhancing effect of a HFCO diet in contrast to the high dietary fish oil may be, in part, explained on the basis of its modulating effect on these bacterial and  mucosal enzymes and  secondary bile acids relevant to  tumor promotion.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1314747>Effect of dietary fiber on  bacterial enzymes and bile acids in relation to .</a></h2><p>Because of the potential significance of  bacteria and secondary bile acids in the pathogenesis of , the present study investigated the effect of different types of dietary fiber on fecal bacterial enzymes, namely, beta-glucuronidase, 7 alpha-dehydroxylase, nitroreductase, and azoreductase, and on bile acids and neutral sterols in premenopausal women.

Dietary wheat bran decreased the concentrations of fecal deoxycholic , , 12-ketolithocholic , and neutral sterols and the activities of all bacterial enzymes. Oat bran had no effect on secondary bile acids and 7 alpha-dehydroxylase but decreased beta-glucuronidase, nitroreductase, and azoreductase levels. Dietary corn bran increased 7 alpha-dehydroxylase, , and cholesterol levels and decreased deoxycholic  coprostanol, cholestenone, nitroreductase, and azoreductase levels.

Divalent cations reversed this LCA-induced switch to chaining and biofilm formation. Experimental evolution in the presence of LCA yielded mutations in the essential two-component kinase yycG/walK and three-component response regulator liaR that locked VRE in diplococcal mode, impaired biofilm formation, and increased susceptibility to the antibiotic daptomycin. These mutant VRE strains were deficient in host colonization because of their inability to compete with intestinal microbiota. This morphotype switch presents a potential non-bactericidal therapeutic target that may help clear VRE from the intestines of dominated patients, as occurs frequently during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the role of these amphiphiles for cytotoxic activities against  cells and their membrane interactions by varying charge, hydration and hydrophobicity. The singly charged cationic  based amphiphile (LCA-TMA1) is most cytotoxic, whereas the triply charged cationic Cholic  based amphiphile (CA-TMA3) is least cytotoxic. Light microscopy and Annexin-FITC assay revealed that these facial amphiphiles caused late apoptosis. In addition, we studied the interactions of these amphiphiles with model membrane systems by Prodan-based hydration, DPH-based anisotropy, and differential scanning calorimetry. LCA-TMA1 is most hydrophobic with a hard charge causing efficient dehydration and maximum perturbations of membranes thereby facilitating translocation and high cytotoxicity against  cells. In contrast, the highly hydrated and multiple charged CA-TMA3 caused least membrane perturbations leading to low translocation and less cytotoxicity. As expected, Chenodeoxycholic  and Deoxycholic  based amphiphiles (CDCA-TMA2, DCA-TMA2) featuring two charged head groups showed intermediate behavior. Thus, we deciphered that charge, hydration, and hydrophobicity of these amphiphiles govern membrane interactions, translocation, and resulting cytoxicity against  cells.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the effect of a common FokI restriction site polymorphism (F/f) in the human VDR gene as well as the effect of anti-tumorigenic 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D) and pro-tumorigenic  (LCA) VDR ligands on beta-catenin transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the influence of a major regulatory protein of beta-catenin, the APC tumor suppressor gene, on VDR-dependent inhibition of beta-catenin activity was examined. We report herein that beta-catenin-mediated transcription is most effectively suppressed by the VDR FokI variant F/M4 when 1,25D is limiting. Using Caco-2 colorectal  (CRC) cells, it was observed that VDR ligands, 1,25D and LCA, both suppress beta-catenin transcriptional activity, though 1,25D exhibited significantly greater inhibition. Moreover, 1,25D, but not LCA, suppressed endogenous expression of the beta-catenin target gene DKK-4 independent of VDR DNA-binding activity. These results support beta-catenin sequestration away from endogenous gene targets by 1,25D-VDR. This activity is most efficiently mediated by the FokI gene variant F/M4, a VDR allele previously associated with protection against CRC. Interestingly, we found the inhibition of beta-catenin activity by 1,25D-VDR was significantly enhanced by wild-type APC. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for 1,25D-VDR in APC/beta-catenin cross talk. Collectively, these findings strengthen evidence favoring a direct effect on the Wnt-signaling molecule beta-catenin as one anti- target of 1,25D-VDR action in the colorectum.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3244045>Promoter function of carrageenan on development of  tumors induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats.</a></h2><p>In order to understand the function of carrageenan, an indigestible polysaccharide, as a promoter of  tumors induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), molecular weight distribution of fecal carrageenan and amounts of fecal bile acids in rats given carrageenan and DMH treatment were examined. Gel filtration pattern on Sephacryl S-300 of fecal carrageenan was very similar to that of feeding carrageenan, and carrageenan ingested was quantitatively excreted in feces. Hexafluoroisopropyl ester-trifluoroacetyl derivatives of fecal bile acids were analyzed by gas chromatography on QF-1. Although there was a decreased concentration of deoxycholic  and total bile acids in carrageenan-fed rats compared to control rats, no difference in the daily output was found because carrageenan ingestion increases fecal output. Significant increased concentration and daily output of , a tumor-promoter, by feeding carrageenan were found.

The expression of human ABCB1 has recently been reported to be under the control of nuclear receptor NR1I subfamily members, pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3). Here, we have investigated the involvement of another NR1I member, vitamin D receptor (VDR, NR1I1), in ABCB1 expression. In the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, which abundantly expresses VDR, both 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD3) and  (LCA) increased ABCB1 mRNA levels. Reporter gene assays in LS174T cells with constructs containing various lengths of the ABCB1 regulatory region revealed that the region containing multiple nuclear receptor binding motifs located at -7.8 kilobases [termed nuclear receptor-responsive module (NURREM)], to which PXR and CAR also bind, is essential for the VDR-mediated ABCB1 transactivation. Further reporter assays with constructs containing truncated NURREM and gel shift assays suggested simultaneous binding of multiple VDR/retinoid X receptor alpha heterodimers to NURREM. Furthermore, knockdown of VDR expression in LS174T cells blocked the LCA- and the 1,25-VD3-induced transcription of ABCB1 reporter genes. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, in contrast with LS174T cells, 1,25-VD3 activated the ABCB1 transcription only in the presence of ectopically expressed VDR. These results suggest that the NR1I subfamily members regulate the ABCB1 expression sharing the binding sites within NURREM and that the physiologically produced LCA and 1,25-VD3 may modulate the ABCB1 expression in human intestines, possibly associated with interindividual variations of ABCB1 expression.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27908290>Bile : a potential inducer of colon cancer stem cells.</a></h2><p>Although the unconjugated secondary bile acids, specifically deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), are considered to be risk factors for colorectal cancer, the precise mechanism(s) by which they regulate carcinogenesis is poorly understood.

The expression of CSC markers was measured by real-time qPCR. Flow cytometry was used to isolate CSCs. T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) luciferase assay was employed to examine the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Downregulation of muscarinic 3 receptor (M3R) was achieved through transfection of corresponding siRNA.We found DCA/LCA to induce CSCs in normal human colonic epithelial cells, as evidenced by the increased proportion of CSCs, elevated levels of several CSC markers, as well as a number of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers together with increased colonosphere formation, drug exclusion, ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression, and induction of M3R, p-EGFR, matrix metallopeptidases, and c-Myc. Inhibition of M3R signaling greatly suppressed DCA/LCA induction of the CSC marker ALDHA1 and also c-Myc mRNA expression as well as transcriptional activation of TCF/LEF.Our results suggest that bile acids, specifically DCA and LCA, induce cancer stemness in colonic epithelial cells by modulating M3R and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and thus could be considered promoters of colon cancer.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3920099>Fecal bile  profiles of Japanese patients with adenomatous polyps of the large bowel: special reference to distribution, multiplicity, size and degree of dysplasia of the polyps.</a></h2><p>Bile acids have been implicated in carcinogenesis of the large bowel, and since epidemiological, clinical and histopathological studies suggest a link between adenomatous polyps and  of the large bowel, fecal bile  profiles were studied in 33 patients with adenomatous polyps of the large bowel and these data were analyzed with particular reference to the distribution, multiplicity, size and degree of dysplasia of the polyps.

Seventy-two healthy individuals consuming high-fat/moderately low-fiber diets were screened for fecal mutagenic activity using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium/microsomal assay system. Twenty-one of them were found to excrete high levels of mutagens, and 19 of them were recruited for the diet intervention study. All participants provided two 24-h stool specimens and a 4-day food record while consuming their normal (control) diet. They were then asked to consume the control diet plus 10 g of dietary fiber from wheat bran, oat fiber, or cellulose for 5 wk. After each fiber period, they were asked to consume their control diet. At the end of each fiber and control diet period, each subject provided two 24-h stool specimens. Stool samples were analyzed for bile acids and mutagens using the Ames strains TA98 and TA100 with or without S9 (microsomal) activation. The concentrations of fecal secondary bile acids (deoxycholic , , and 12-ketolithocholic ) and of fecal mutagenic activity in TA98 and TA100 with and without S9 activation were significantly lower during the wheat bran and cellulose supplementation periods. Oat fiber supplementation had no such effect on these fecal constituents.

The study was designed as a single stage crossover. Both cultures were inoculated and treated in an identical manner except that whilst one fermenter was subject to pH control the other was not and vice versa. Complex bacterial populations were maintained for 23 days and many of the metabolic functions carried out by the micro-organisms in vivo were demonstrated in vitro. The predominant organisms belonged to the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium with abundant levels of anaerobic Gram-positive rods. The redox potential in each fermenter showed considerable variation with maximum values of below -300 eV being attained. An indication of the stability of the bacterial communities was the production of short-chain volatile fatty acids; during steady-state conditions the mean ratio of the major acids acetic, propionic and butyric being 3.90:0.69:1.00 and 3.65:0.76:1.00 in each fermenter, respectively. During steady-state conditions, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  was maintained at a constant rate with  representing over 85% of total steroid. Addition of the soluble fibre lactulose to the cultures had a profound effect on many of the parameters tested. Without pH control the culture pH dropped to below 5.0 and this coincided with a substantial decrease in total anaerobes, especially Bacteroides spp., an increase in Lactobacillus spp. (concomitant with an increase in lactic ), a decrease in the concentration of short-chain volatile fatty acids and a substantial decrease in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic . These results show that it is possible to maintain viable intestinal bacteria in vitro using a continuous culture chemostat and that the cultures respond to changing conditions as evinced by the inhibition of 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic  on addition of lactulose.

The mean regression rate for peptide-labeled rapamycin micelles was significantly greater than that for plain rapamycin micelles, P<0.01. On immunohistochemistry, we observed a significant reduction in phospho-S6 but not β-catenin expression and reduced tumor cell proliferation, suggesting greater inhibition of downstream mTOR signaling.

The major bile acids detected in fecal extracts were  (LCA) and deoxycholic  (DCA). The major sterol of animal origin was cholesterol and its bacterial metabolite coprostanol, whereas the major plant sterols were beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, and their corresponding bacterial metabolites. CRC patients excreted higher amounts of total major bile acids (LCA and DCA) than did the control group, but this difference was not significant. However, the LCA-to-DCA ratio was much higher in the CRC group [(1.43, p less than 0.01) compared with the control group (0.72)]. The control group excreted significantly higher amounts of total neutral sterols (p less than 0.001), sterols of animal origin (p less than 0.001), and plant sterols (p less than 0.001) compared with the CRC group; the plant sterols represented a much lower proportion of excreted total neutral sterols in the CRC group (p greater than 0.001) compared with the control group. We propose the following hypotheses. The LCA-to-DCA ratio may be an important discriminant market for CRC susceptibility. The fecal LCA-to-DCA ratio may depend on the differential hepatic synthesis of their respective precursors chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) and cholic . Hepatic synthesis of CDCA may be increased by more efficient conservation of dietary cholesterol because it has been shown that cholesterol of exogenous origin is the main precursor of this bile .(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19782465> upregulates uPAR and cell invasiveness via MAPK and AP-1 signaling in  cells.</a></h2><p>The secondary bile   (LCA) induced expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and enhanced cell invasiveness in  cells.

Bile acids are hormones that regulate their own synthesis, transport, in addition to glucose and lipid homeostasis, and energy balance. The gut microbial community through their capacity to produce bile  metabolites distinct from the liver can be thought of as an "endocrine organ" with potential to alter host physiology, perhaps to their own favor. We propose the term "sterolbiome" to describe the genetic potential of the gut microbiome to produce endocrine molecules from endogenous and exogenous steroids in the mammalian gut.

TJs are responsible for paracellular permeability and integrity of the barrier function. Occludin is one of the main proteins responsible for TJ structure. This study tested the effects of physiological levels of phenol, ammonia, primary bile acids (cholic , CA, and chenodeoxycholic , CDCA), and secondary bile acids (, LCA, and deoxycholic , DCA) on paracellular permeability using a Caco-2 cell model. Paracellular permeability of Caco-2 monolayers was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and the apical to basolateral flux of [14C]-mannitol. Secondary, but not primary, bile acids increased permeability as reflected by significantly decreased TER and increased mannitol flux. Both phenol and ammonia also increased permeability. The primary bile  CA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas CDCA had no significant effect on occludin expression as compared to the negative control. The secondary bile acids DCA and LCA significantly increased occludin expression (P < 0.05), whereas phenol had no significant effect on the protein expression as compared to the negative control. This suggests that the increased permeability observed with LCA, DCA, phenol, and ammonia was not related to an effect on occludin expression. In conclusion, phenol, ammonia, and secondary bile acids were shown to increase paracellular permeability and reduce epithelial barrier function at doses typical of levels found in fecal samples.

Fecal bile  profiles were determined in 12 healthy Finnish women who included in their normal diets for 2-week periods in turn three different types of bread, 200-300 g/day. The breads contained either low-fiber wheat, whole-meal wheat, or whole-grain rye. During consumption of rye bread, the total mean concentration of fecal free bile acids was 4.77 +/- 0.90 mumol/g of dry feces (mean +/- SEM), which was much lower than with the normal omnivorous diet (8.05 +/- 1.56 mumol/g) or during administration of the low-fiber wheat bread (8.83 +/- 1.56 mumol/g) or the whole-meal wheat bread (7.88 +/- 1.34 mumol/g) (P less than 0.05). This decrease was mainly caused by increased proportions of saponifiable bile acids (P less than 0.01). During intake of the whole-grain rye bread, 46% +/- 3% of the fecal bile acids were in their saponifiable forms; this percentage was 30% +/- 3% during the control period, 30% +/- 4% during the low-fiber wheat bread period, and 27% +/- 4% during the whole-meal wheat bread period.

Epidemiologic studies reveal that the major dietary constituents implicated in the disease process are fat/red meat (causative) and fibre (protective). From this standpoint, toxicologists have evaluated a plethora of dietary and intestinal biochemical characteristics and steroids; the bile acids especially have received a great deal of attention. Formerly, bile acids and their bacterial metabolites were implicated, as either mutagens and/or carcinogens, but this was not proven. In recent times, based mainly on animal model systems, opinion favours that if bile acids and their metabolites have a role to play in  carcinogenesis, they act at the promotion stages of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence-the secondary bile acids deoxycholic and  acids being of major importance here. From this standpoint, studies have been designed either to lower total bile  concentration or at least to reduce dehydroxylation of the primary bile acids via high fibre dietary regimes.The prebiotics lactulose and lactitol (non-digestible dietary fibres) appear to have potential here, and so the effect of lactulose on fermentation by intestinal bacteria in a continuous culture model of the human  was studied. Lactulose reduced dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic  to the potentially toxic secondary bile   by over 90%.

Because fecal secondary bile acids [particularly deoxycholic  (DCA)] are considered to promote formation of  adenomas and , we have now attempted to find a relationship between polyp reduction and fecal secondary bile acids after feeding UDCA to these rats. We examined the fecal bile acids in rats with polyps and compared them with fecal bile acids in control rats and also determined the bile  composition in fecal aqueous phase, which is in direct contact with the  epithelium and may be physiologically more active. Treatment with azoxymethane did not significantly alter fecal bile  composition in the rats. Cholic  feeding resulted in greatly increased proportions of DCA (82% of total bile acids versus 18% in control rats). On the other hand, UDCA feeding significantly reduced the proportion of fecal DCA (2% in control rats fed UDCA and 3% in rats also treated with azoxymethane). In control rats, 96% of the bile acids were present in the water-insoluble fraction and 4% in the water-soluble fraction. The major insoluble bile acids included DCA and hyodeoxycholic  (73% of total bile acids). In contrast, the muricholic acids were concentrated in the soluble fraction (37%). When 0.4% UDCA was added to the diet,  increased in the insoluble fraction (40 versus 1%), but the hydrophilic UDCA and muricholic acids were enriched in the water-soluble fraction (37 and 43%, respectively). Thus, the hydrophobic bile acids were distributed predominantly in the water-insoluble fraction, whereas the hydrophilic bile acids were distributed preferentially in the water-soluble fraction. These data suggest that UDCA may prevent  tumors and polyps by countering the toxic effect of DCA and enhancing the possible cytoprotective effects of UDCA and muricholic acids in the water-soluble fraction in the feces of rat.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/689337>Effect of bile acids and dietary fat on large bowel carcinogenesis in animal models.</a></h2><p>Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that dietary fk actors, particularly high intake of fat and animal protein, and high concentration of bile acids and neutral sterols of the large bowel lumen are strongly associated with large bowel carcinogenesis.

Results indicated that the high-fat fiber-free diet significantly elevated the fecal β-glucuronidase and mucinase activities and total bile  concentration and decreased cecal SCFA contents, as compared with its normal-fat counterpart. The incorporation of KGM, as well as inulin, into the high-fat fiber-free diet beneficially reduced the fecal β-glucuronidase and mucinase activities and  (secondary bile ) concentration. Although KGM elevated the daily fecal total bile  excretion, the change was due to the primary, instead of the secondary, bile acids.

LCA stimulated apoptosis [AI = 1.2 +/- 0.3% (all values are the mean +/- SEM) versus control 0.5 +/- 0.1%, P < 0. 05], as did DMH (4.3 +/- 0.8%, P < 0.02). DMH increased apoptosis at the base of the crypt nearly 50-fold, with no effect at the lumenal third. In mice receiving DMH, LCA suppressed apoptosis almost completely (0.1 +/- 0.03%); this suppression was complete at the lower two-thirds of the crypt (AI = 0) and 60% at the lumenal third.

Confirming previous findings, a clear increase in elution rate was observed at both alkaline and neutral pH. The extent of the increase was very similar at the two pHs. However, an increased elution rate could be observed only when lysing the nuclei at high ionic strength and low detergent concentration (2 M NaCl + 0.2% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt).

In addition, a slight effect could be observed using a method for the evaluation of DNA unwinding in alkali. After termination of the incubation with LCA, the DNA alteration observed with DNA elution disappeared very rapidly both in intact cells and nuclei, even when the incubation buffer was totally unsuitable for the repair of the type of DNA damage induced by typical genotoxic agents. The effect of LCA on DNA was apparently not mediated through an inhibition of topoisomerase II. Only the intact chromatin of nuclei was responsive, not the quasinaked DNA of nuclei lysed at high ionic strength.

Placebo milk products (calcium, 3 mM) were compared with regular milk products (calcium, 30 mm). In each 1-week period, the habitual diet was recorded, and urine and feces were collected for 1 and 3 days, respectively. Milk calcium significantly increased fecal pH and fecal excretion of phosphate (132%), total fat (139%), free fatty acids (195%), and bile acids (141%), indicating intestinal complexation. In fecal water, the concentrations of long-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids (deoxycholic and ), neutral sterols, and phospholipids were about halved (P <0.05). Consistent with these changes in soluble hydrophobic surfactants, calcium decreased the cytotoxicity of fecal water from 68 +/- 9 to 28 +/- 12% (P < 0.005).

Dietary factors have been shown to influence colorectal  risk and to modulate both fecal mutagenicity and fecapentaene concentrations. Therefore, in this study, excretion of fecapentaenes is determined in humans consuming either vegetarian or omnivorous diets. The results show that the most predominant fecapentaene forms are excreted in higher concentrations by vegetarians. Consumption of cereal fiber, calcium and carotene as well as fecal concentrations of iso- were found to correlate positively with excreted concentrations of one or more fecapentaene analogues. On average, 22% of excreted fecapentaene concentrations was found to be related to nutrient intake in stepwise regression models. Dietary calcium intake was found to be the most significant factor positively correlating with excreted fecapentaene concentrations. Intake of mono-unsaturated fatty acids or fiber from vegetables and fruit could be shown to correlate with fecapentaene excretion to a lesser degree. Despite high fecapentaene concentrations in fecal dichloromethane extracts, only 1 out of 20 samples revealed significant mutagenic activity in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100. Further, aqueous extracts of feces from omnivores appeared to be equally mutagenic as feces from vegetarians and contained non-detectable concentrations of fecapentaenes. It is concluded that dietary factors do affect excreted fecapentaene levels, but only to a relatively minor extent. Since vegetarians at low risk for colorectal  excrete higher concentrations of fecapentaenes, it could be hypothesized that relatively increased fecapentaene excretion in combination with antimutagenic compounds in feces represents  prevention.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16139803>Bile -induced proliferation of a human  cell line is mediated by transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptors.</a></h2><p>Although epidemiological studies indicate an association between elevations in fecal bile acids and the development of colorectal , the cellular mechanism for the proliferative actions of bile acids is not clear.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of bile acids on cell signaling and proliferation of a human  cell line (H508 cells) that abundantly expresses M3R and EGFR. Treatment with taurine and glycine conjugates of  and deoxycholic acids stimulated reversible activation of the p44/42 MAP kinase signaling cascade and proliferation of H508 cells. Bile acids did not stimulate proliferation of SNU-C4  cells that express EGFR but not muscarinic receptors. Atropine, a muscarinic receptor inverse agonist, blocked bile -induced H508 cell proliferation. At concentrations that stimulate cell proliferation, conjugated bile acids did not activate caspase-3, a key mediator of apoptosis. Conjugated bile acids stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr992, thereby implicating EGFR transactivation in the cellular mechanism underlying their proliferative actions. This was confirmed by observing that inhibitors of EGFR activation and antibodies to the ligand-binding domain of EGFR blocked both the signaling and proliferative actions of bile acids.

We found that LCA treatment increased VDR levels, mimicking the effect of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). LCA pretreatment inhibited the IL-1beta-induced IkappaBalpha degradation and decreased the NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation.

Among the 12 bile acids tested, our results showed that unconjugated CDCA and LCA and the glycine and taurine conjugates of LCA (g-LCA, t-LCA) were able to bind covalently with naked DNA in vitro without intervention of any catalyst. It was also shown that bile  alone did not give any spot on TLC. These binding reactions depended on the bile  concentration in a linear manner. The data on the extent of binding at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml showed values of 28.5 (t-LCA), 23.7 (g-LCA), 3.47 (LCA) and 1.32 (CDCA) adducts per 10(8) nucleotides. These reactive bile acids were also incubated with COLO 205 human  carcinoma cells and Hep G2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells for 24 h, but no specific DNA adduct was formed.

While enzyme inhibition has been demonstrated in vitro, it is unclear whether feeding bile acids modulates  GST and UGT in vivo.

After 5 weeks,  tissue was harvested and used for enzyme and cell proliferation measurements. The response to bile acids varied with the enzyme measured and appeared isoenzyme specific. GST-alpha activity was lower in the bile  fed groups compared with CON. While GST-mu was lower in the LCA-fed group, GST-pi was lower in the DCA-, CHA- and UDCA-fed groups. Unlike GST, both UGT and NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (CYC) activities were increased by bile acids.

Thus, LCA can induce its own catabolism through the VDR. We have now found that LCA can substitute for vitamin D in the elevation of serum calcium in vitamin D-deficient rats. Further, LCA in the diet will also replace vitamin D in the mobilization of calcium from bone. Further, LCA induces CYP24-hydroxylase mRNA gene expression in the kidney of vitamin D-deficient rats.

Surprisingly, the CAR-mediated protection is not attributable to the expected and previously characterized CYP3A pathway; rather, it is associated with a robust induction of SULT gene expression and increased LCA sulfation. We have also provided direct evidence that CAR regulates SULT expression by binding to the CAR response elements found within the SULT gene promoters. Interestingly, activation of CAR was also associated with an increased expression of the 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthetase 2 (PAPSS2), an enzyme responsible for generating the sulfate donor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

Recently, the secondary bile , lithocholate (LCA), was recognized as a novel VDR ligand. Using reporter gene and mammalian two-hybrid systems, immunoblotting, competitive ligand displacement and quantitative real-time PCR, we identified curcumin (CM), a turmeric-derived bioactive polyphenol, as a likely additional novel ligand for VDR. CM (10(-5) M) activated transcription of a luciferase plasmid containing the distal vitamin D responsive element (VDRE) from the human CYP3A4 gene at levels comparable to 1,25D (10(-8) M) in transfected human  cells (Caco-2). While CM also activated transcription via a retinoid X receptor (RXR) responsive element, activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by CM was negligible. Competition binding assays with radiolabeled 1,25D confirmed that CM binds directly to VDR. In mammalian two-hybrid assays employing transfected Caco-2 cells, CM (10(-5) M) increased the ability of VDR to recruit its heterodimeric partner, RXR, and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). Real-time PCR studies revealed that CM-bound VDR can activate VDR target genes CYP3A4, CYP24, p21 and TRPV6 in Caco-2 cells. Numerous studies have shown chemoprotection by CM against intestinal cancers via a variety of mechanisms.

Understanding the mechanisms of bile  toxicity and apoptosis, which could include nonspecific detergent effects and/or specific receptor activation, has potential therapeutic significance. In this report we investigate the ability of synthetic enantiomers of  (ent-LCA), chenodeoxycholic  (ent-CDCA), and deoxycholic  (ent-DCA) to induce toxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Natural bile acids were found to induce more apoptotic nuclear morphology, cause increased cellular detachment, and lead to greater capase-3 and -9 cleavage compared with enantiomeric bile acids in both cell lines. In contrast, natural and enantiomeric bile acids showed similar effects on cellular proliferation. These data show that bile -induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells is enantiospecific, hence correlated with the absolute configuration of the bile steroid rather than its detergent properties. The mechanism of LCA- and ent-LCA-induced apoptosis was also investigated in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. These bile acids differentially activate initiator caspases-2 and -8 and induce cleavage of full-length Bid. LCA and ent-LCA mediated apoptosis was inhibited by both pan-caspase and selective caspase-8 inhibitors, whereas a selective caspase-2 inhibitor provided no protection. LCA also induced increased CD95 localization to the plasma membrane and generated increased reactive oxygen species compared with ent-LCA. This suggests that LCA/ent-LCA induce apoptosis enantioselectively through CD95 activation, likely because of increased reactive oxygen species generation, with resulting procaspase-8 cleavage.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10527930>Sulphation of  in the -carcinoma cell line CaCo-2.</a></h2><p>High levels of bile acids in the  may correlate with an increased risk of , but the underlying mechanisms are not known.

The nitrosamides (MNNG, DNC) were very genotoxic in human  cells. MNNG was more genotoxic in human than in rat  cells. In contrast, the rat  carcinogens PhIP and IQ were not genotoxic in human  cells. PhIP did induce DNA damage in rat  cells, which correlates to its capacity of inducing tumors in this animal tissue.

For example, murine knock-out approaches have revealed a role for the VDR in controlling mammary gland growth and function. These actions appear widespread, as the enzymes responsible for 1alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol generation and degradation, and the VDR itself, are all functionally present in a wide range of epithelial and haematopoietic cell types. These findings, combined with epidemiological and functional data, support the concept that local, autocrine and paracrine VDR signalling exerts control over cell-fate decisions in multiple cell types. Furthermore, the recent identification of bile   as a VDR ligand underscores the environmental sensing role for the VDR. In vitro and in vivo dissection of VDR signalling in cancers (e.g. breast, prostate and ) supports a role for targeting the VDR in either chemoprevention or chemotherapy settings. As with other potential therapeutics, it has become clear that  cells display de novo and acquired genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of resistance to these actions. Consequently, a range of experimental and clinical options are being developed to bring about more targeted actions, overcome resistance and enhance the efficacy of VDR-centred therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15578590>Molecular and functional comparison of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and the novel vitamin D receptor ligand, , in activating transcription of cytochrome P450 3A4.</a></h2><p>The vitamin D receptor (VDR) binds to and mediates the effects of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) hormone to alter gene transcription. A newly recognized VDR ligand is the carcinogenic bile ,  (LCA). We demonstrate that, in HT-29  cells, both LCA and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) induce expression of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), an enzyme involved in cellular detoxification. We also show that LCA-VDR stimulates transcription of gene reporter constructs containing DR3 and ER6 vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) from the human CYP3A4 gene. Utilizing gel mobility shift, pulldown, and mammalian two-hybrid assays, we observe that: (i) 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) enhances retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimerization with VDR more effectively than LCA, (ii) the 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-liganded VDR-RXR heterodimer recruits full-length SRC-1 coactivator, whereas this interaction is minimal with LCA unless LXXLL-containing fragments of SRC-1 are employed, and (iii) both 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and LCA enhance the binding of VDR to DRIP205/mediator, but unlike 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-VDR, LCA-VDR does not interact detectably with NCoA-62 or TRIP1/SUG1, suggesting a different pattern of LCA-VDR comodulator association. Finally, residues in the human VDR (hVDR) ligand binding domain (LBD) were altered to create mutants unresponsive to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)- and/or LCA-stimulated transactivation, identifying S237 and S225/S278 as critical for 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and LCA action, respectively. Therefore, these two VDR ligands contact distinct residues in the binding pocket, perhaps generating unique receptor conformations that determine the degree of RXR and comodulator binding.

To uncover the mechanism by which BAs exert carcinogenic effects, both human liver and  cells as well as mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with BAs and assayed for viability, genotoxic stress, and transcriptional response. BAs induced both Nur77 (NR4A1) and proinflammatory gene expression. The intracellular location of BA-induced Nur77 was time dependent; short-term (1-3 hours) exposure induced nuclear Nur77, whereas longer (1-2 days) exposure also increased cytosolic Nur77 expression and apoptosis. Inhibiting Nur77 nuclear export with leptomycin B decreased  (LCA)-induced apoptosis. Extended (7 days) treatment with BA generated resistance to BA with increased nuclear Nur77, viability, and mobility. While, knockdown of Nur77 in BA-resistant cells increased cellular susceptibility to LCA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in vivo mouse xenograft experiments demonstrated that BA-resistant cells form larger tumors with elevated Nur77 expression compared with parental controls. DNA-binding and gene expression assays identified multiple survival genes (CDK4, CCND2, MAP4K5, STAT5A, and RBBP8) and a proapoptosis gene (BID) as Nur77 targets. Consistently, BA-induced upregulation of the aforementioned genes was abrogated by a lack of Nur77. Importantly, Nur77 was overexpressed in high percentage of human  and liver  specimens, and the intracellular location of Nur77 correlated with elevated serum total BA levels in patients with . These data show for the first time that BAs via Nur77 have a dual role in modulating cell survival and death.These findings establish a direct link between Nur77 and the carcinogenic effect of BAs.©2014 American Association for  Research.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12935318>Effect of sun-dried raisins on bile  excretion, intestinal transit time, and fecal weight: a dose-response study.</a></h2><p>The effect of increasing doses of sun-dried raisins (SDR) on intestinal transit time (TT), fecal weight (FW), and fecal bile acids (FBA) was investigated in 16 healthy adults (6 men and 10 women).

This observation prompted us to examine the action of bile acids on two human  cell lines: H508, which expresses M3 receptors, and SNU-C4, which does not. Cellular proliferation was determined using a colorimetric assay. Interaction with muscarinic receptors was determined by measuring inhibition of muscarinic radioligand binding and changes in cellular inositol phosphate (IP) formation. Lithocholyltaurine (LCT) caused a dose-dependent increase in H508 cell proliferation that was not observed in SNU-C4 cells. After a 6-day incubation with 300 microM LCT, H508 cell proliferation increased by 200% compared to control. Moreover, in H508 cells, LCT caused a dose-dependent inhibition of radioligand binding and an increase in IP formation. LCT did not alter the rate of apoptosis in H508 or SNU-C4 cells. These data indicate that, at concentrations achievable in the gut, LA derivatives interact with M3 muscarinic receptors on H508 human  cells, thereby causing an increase in IP formation and cell proliferation.

The high-dose fiber effect at 9 months of supplementation was statistically significant with respect to virtually all geometric mean fecal bile  concentrations and excretion rates.

The principal agents are the secondary bile acids,  and deoxycholic acids, the vitamin K group and ferrous iron complexes. These metabolites may interact to subvert the normal free radical generating mechanisms involved in mucosal defence. Diets high in fat and red meat and low in fibre support a Bacteroides-dominated  microflora, which both synthesis and utilises vitamin K2 isoprenalogues or menaquinones as enzyme co-factors. Iron(II) complexes such as haemin from the breakdown of dietary haemoglobin and myoglobin also serve as growth factors for these bacteria and provide a rich source of haem-iron for intestinal uptake. Biliary secretion is stimulated by dietary fat and bile acids are essential for the intestinal uptake of vitamin K and possibly of iron complexes such as haemin. In the mature colonocyte, vitamin K and haemin may initiate redox cycling reactions which liberate superoxide (O2-.). Bile acids can activate the membrane bound phospholipase to liberate arachidonate and diacylglycerol. This leads in turn to the production of more O2-. which can enter the microcirculation and acts as a potent chemoattractant for the neutrophils that line the lamina propria. The released diacylglycerol can activate protein kinase C in the neutrophil membrane to switch on the respiratory burst oxidase system generating yet more O2-. and may stimulate the proliferation of transformed stem cells by a similar protein kinase C mediated mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24343899>Intestinal CYP3A4 protects against -induced hepatotoxicity in intestine-specific VDR-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates vitamin D signaling involved in bone metabolism, cellular growth and differentiation, cardiovascular function, and bile  regulation. Mice with an intestine-specific disruption of VDR (Vdr(ΔIEpC)) have abnormal body size,  structure, and imbalance of bile  metabolism.  (LCA), a secondary bile  that activates VDR, is among the most toxic of the bile acids that when overaccumulated in the liver causes hepatotoxicity. Because cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a target gene of VDR-involved bile  metabolism, the role of CYP3A4 in VDR biology and bile  metabolism was investigated. The CYP3A4 gene was inserted into Vdr(ΔIEpC) mice to produce the Vdr(ΔIEpC)/3A4 line. LCA was administered to control, transgenic-CYP3A4, Vdr(ΔIEpC), and Vdr(ΔIEpC)/3A4 mice, and hepatic toxicity and bile  levels in the liver, intestine, bile, and urine were measured. VDR deficiency in the intestine of the Vdr(ΔIEpC) mice exacerbates LCA-induced hepatotoxicity manifested by increased necrosis and inflammation, due in part to over-accumulation of hepatic bile acids including taurocholic  and taurodeoxycholic . Intestinal expression of CYP3A4 in the Vdr(ΔIEpC)/3A4 mouse line reduces LCA-induced hepatotoxicity through elevation of LCA metabolism and detoxification, and suppression of bile  transporter expression in the small intestine. This study reveals that intestinal CYP3A4 protects against LCA hepatotoxicity.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1868444>Effect of starch malabsorption on fecal bile acids and neutral sterols in humans: possible implications for  carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological and experimental studies indicate a strong association between an elevated  risk and increased fecal excretion of secondary bile acids, neutral sterols, and prolonged gastrointestinal transit time. Starch malabsorption, on the other hand, has been reported to be a possible protective factor in  carcinogenesis. To study the impact of starch malabsorption on these parameters, 12 healthy volunteers consumed a diet rich in starch for two 4-week periods. During a double-blind crossover trial they received the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose (BAY g 5421) in one of the study periods and placebo in the other. During acarbose treatment stool wet weight increased by 68%, stool dry weight by 57%, and gastrointestinal mean transit time by 30%. Fecal concentrations (mg/g dry weight) of the neutral sterols coprostanol, coprostanone, campesterol, 4-cholesten-3-one, and beta-sitosterol decreased by 36.8, 48.7, 42.1, 34.6, and 39.4%, respectively, under acarbose. Concentrations of the major secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and , decreased by 59.9 and 52.2%, respectively. In spite of an increased stool weight, also daily excretion (mg/day) of these two bile acids was lower under acarbose (47.9 and 36.6%, respectively) compared to placebo, whereas excretion of the main primary bile , cholic , rose from 22.58 mg/day to 379.80 mg/day during the acarbose period. The changes in fecal bile  and neutral sterol excretion found during acarbose treatment may explain a protective effect of starch malabsorption on  development.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2585788>[The role of bile acids with physiological concentration in  carcinogenesis].</a></h2><p>The promoting effect of bile acids in physiological concentration in  carcinogenesis was studied using male Wistar rats with defunctioned .

In E. coli PQ37, a test organism used for the assessment of genotoxicity, lacZ, the beta-galactosidase gene is placed under the control of sfiA, one of the SOS genes through an operon fusion. The induction of beta-galactosidase activity, when the organism is exposed to genotoxic agents, is an indirect measure of the genotoxic activity of the test compound. Incubation of E. coli PQ37 with either 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO) or one of the fecal mutagens, fecapentaene-12 or -14 (F-12 or F-14) in the presence of sodium taurocholate or sodium deoxycholate resulted in a significant enhancement of induction of beta-galactosidase activity. The molecular mechanisms of 4-NQO-induced mutagenesis in E. coli are similar to those of the effects of UV light in which both replication-dependent and repair-dependent pathways of mutagenesis exist. Since E. coli PQ37 is excision-repair-deficient, alternate pathways are involved in this system. Bile salts by themselves do not trigger the SOS response, and hence their role in enhancing the SOS-inducing potency of mutagens may involve the potentiation of the cleavage-inactivation of lexA (repressor of SOS) by the protein product of the SOS-controlled gene, recA. The potentiating effect of bile salts on the fecal mutagens, F-12 and F-14, has implications in their suspected role in  carcinogenesis associated with high-fat, low-fiber diets.</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8401174>Bile  inhibition of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes is a factor in the mechanism of  carcinogenesis: tests of aspects of the concept with glucuronosyltransferase.</a></h2><p>A factor in  carcinogenesis might be the partial defeat in  epithelial cells of the protective enzymic barrier against xenobiotics, via bile  inhibition of enzymes that detoxify mutagens. The applicability of aspects of this concept to glucuronosyltransferase, a phenol detoxification enzyme, was tested in a  cell line. Inhibition of glucuronidation of the test substrate, 4-methylumbelliferone, occurred at bile  concentrations found in faecal water, and depended on pH for some bile acids. Lithocholate was the most inhibitory: the concentration causing 50% inhibition of the initial rate of glucuronidation (IC50) was about 3 microM at pH 7.4 and at pH 6.2. The inhibitory potency of deoxycholate and chenodeoxycholate increased when pH decreased, but still remained less than that of lithocholate: the IC50 for deoxycholate was 88.5 microM at pH 7.4, and 14.8 microM at pH 6.2, and for chenodeoxycholate the IC50 was 67.4 microM at pH 7.4, and 21.7 microM at pH 6.2. Cholate did not cause appreciable inhibition. The inhibitory effects were additive when lithocholate was present together with either deoxycholate or chenodeoxycholate. The results provide a mechanism for the comutagenicity of bile acids, a feature of which is the inter-relation of bile  comutagenicity specifically with mutagens that are inactivated by a bile -inhibitable enzyme. The results are also in accord with the view that high concentrations of bile acids in solution in faecal water, especially lithocholate, are a risk factor for .</p><p>Keyword: colon cancer</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1004055>[Current concepts on dietary fibers.
