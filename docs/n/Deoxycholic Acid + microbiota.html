<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27003186>Taurocholic  metabolism by gut microbes and colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death worldwide and is associated with adoption of a diet high in animal protein and saturated fat. Saturated fat induces increased bile secretion into the intestine. Increased bile secretion selects for populations of gut microbes capable of altering the bile  pool, generating tumor-promoting secondary bile acids such as  and lithocholic . Epidemiological evidence suggests CRC is associated with increased levels of DCA in serum, bile, and stool. Mechanisms by which secondary bile acids promote CRC are explored. Furthermore, in humans bile  conjugation can vary by diet. Vegetarian diets favor glycine conjugation while diets high in animal protein favor taurine conjugation. Metabolism of taurine conjugated bile acids by gut microbes generates hydrogen sulfide, a genotoxic compound. Thus, taurocholic  has the potential to stimulate intestinal bacteria capable of converting taurine and cholic  to hydrogen sulfide and , a genotoxin and tumor-promoter, respectively.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213609>Gut microbial profile is altered in primary biliary cholangitis and partially restored after UDCA therapy.</a></h2><p>A close relationship between gut  and some chronic liver disorders has recently been described. Herein, we systematically performed a comparative analysis of the gut microbiome in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and healthy controls.We first conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) treatment-naïve patients with PBC and 80 matched healthy controls. Second, an independent cohort composed of 19 treatment-naïve patients and 34 controls was used to validate the results. Finally, a prospective study was performed in a subgroup of 37 patients with PBC who underwent analysis before and after 6 months of UDCA treatment. Faecal samples were collected, and microbiomes were analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.A significant reduction of within-individual microbial diversity was noted in PBC (p=0.03). A signature defined by decreased abundance of four genera and increased abundance of eight genera strongly correlated with PBC (area under curve=0.86, 0.84 in exploration and validation data, respectively). Notably, the abundance of six PBC-associated genera was reversed after 6 months of UDCA treatment. In particular, , enriched in controls, was further decreased in gp210-positive than gp210-negative patients (p=0.002). Of interest was the finding that the increased capacity for the inferred pathway, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells in PBC, highly correlated with the abundance of bacteria belonging to .This study presents a comprehensive landscape of gut  in PBC. Dysbiosis was found in the gut microbiome in PBC and partially relieved by UDCA. Our study suggests that gut  is a potential therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker for PBC.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Agarose is hydrolyzed easily to yield oligosaccharides, designated as agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO). This study evaluated the effects of AGO on obese phenotype and gut microbial composition in mice. Mice were administered AGO in drinking water (AGO-receiving mice). 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses revealed their fecal  profiles. Serum bile acids were ascertained using a LC-MS/MS system. Compared to the control group, AGO administration significantly reduced epididymal adipose tissue weights and serum non-esterified fatty  concentrations, but the cecal content weights were increased. Data from the serum bile  profile show that concentrations of primary bile acids (cholic  and chenodeoxycholic ), but not those of secondary bile acids (, lithocholic , and ursodeoxycholic ), tended to increase in AGO-receiving mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed that the relative abundances of 15 taxa differed significantly in AGO-receiving mice. Of these, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae were found to be positively correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight. The relative abundances of Bacteroides and Ruminococcus were correlated negatively with epididymal adipose tissue weight. Although the definitive role of gut microbes of AGO-received mice is still unknown, our data demonstrate the possibility that AGO administration affects the gut microbial composition and inhibits obesity in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30144429>FXR-Dependent Modulation of the Human Small Intestinal Microbiome by the Bile  Derivative Obeticholic .</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria can modify the composition of bile acids and bile acids, which are regulated by the farnesoid X receptor, affect the survival and growth of gut bacteria. We studied the effects of obeticholic  (OCA), a bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist, on the intestinal microbiomes of humans and mice.We performed a phase I study in 24 healthy volunteers given OCA (5, 10, or 25 mg/d for 17 days). Fecal and plasma specimens were collected at baseline (day 0) and on days 17 (end of dosing) and 37 (end of study). The fecal specimens were analyzed by shotgun meta-genomic sequencing. A Uniref90 high-stringency genomic analysis was used to assign specific genes to the taxonomic signature of bacteria whose abundance was associated with OCA. Male C57BL/6 mice were gavage fed daily with water, vehicle, or OCA (10 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Small intestine luminal contents were collected by flushing with saline and fecal pellets were collected at baseline and day 14. Mouse samples were analyzed by 16S-tagged sequencing. Culture experiments were performed to determine the taxonomic-specific effects of bile acids and OCA on bacterial growth.Suppression of endogenous bile  synthesis by OCA in subjects led to a reversible induction of gram-positive bacteria that are found in the small intestine and are components of the diet and oral . We found that bile acids decreased proliferation of these bacteria in minimum inhibitory concentration assays. In these organisms, there was an increase in the representation of microbial genomic pathways involved in DNA synthesis and amino  metabolism with OCA treatment of subjects. Consistent with these findings, mice fed OCA had lower endogenous bile  levels and an increased proportion of Firmicutes, specifically in the small intestine, compared with mice fed water or vehicle.In studying the effects of OCA in humans and mice, we found evidence for interactions between bile acids and features of the small intestinal microbiome. These findings indicate that farnesoid X receptor activation alters the intestinal  and could provide opportunities for microbiome biomarker discovery or new approaches to engineering the human microbiome.

Bile  7α-dehydroxylating gut bacteria generate the toxic bile acids  and lithocholic  from host bile acids. The ability of these bacteria to remove the 7-hydroxyl group is partially dependent on 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDH) activity, which reduces 7-oxo-bile acids generated by other gut bacteria. 3α-HSDH has an important enzymatic activity in the bile  7α-dehydroxylation pathway. 12α-HSDH activity has been reported for the low-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacterium ; however, this activity has not been reported for high-activity bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria, such as , , and  Here, we demonstrate that these strains express bile  12α-HSDH. The recombinant enzymes were characterized from each species and shown to preferentially reduce 12-oxolithocholic  to , with low activity against 12-oxochenodeoxycholic  and reduced activity when bile acids were conjugated to taurine or glycine. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that 12α-HSDH is widespread among ,  in the  family, and human gut  12α-HSDH activity has been established in the medically important bile  7α-dehydroxylating bacteria , , and  Experiments with recombinant 12α-HSDHs from these strains are consistent with culture-based experiments that show a robust preference for 12-oxolithocholic  over 12-oxochenodeoxycholic . Phylogenetic analysis identified novel members of the gut microbiome encoding 12α-HSDH. Future reengineering of 12α-HSDH enzymes to preferentially oxidize cholic  may provide a means to industrially produce the therapeutic bile  ursodeoxycholic .

Recent data suggest that faecal  transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from metabolic syndrome donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with metabolic syndrome (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal  composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased lithocholic,  and (iso)lithocholic  after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal  taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in metabolic syndrome recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of dysbiosis, and increased levels of the secondary bile acids, lithocholic and . Physiologic levels of these bile acids inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile acids during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved  structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile acids. Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28436439>Discovery of tauroursodeoxycholic  biotransformation enzymes from the gut microbiome of black bears using metagenomics.</a></h2><p>Tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA) has been used to treat many diseases effectively. 7α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7α-HSDH) and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7β-HSDH) are two key enzymes that drive the efficient biosynthesis of TUDCA from taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA) in vitro. In this study, a metagenomic approach was used to isolate 7α- and 7β-HSDHs from fecal samples of black bears. Five new 7α-HSDHs and one new 7β-HSDH enzyme were discovered and identified from the gut  of black bears, and four of them presented good enzymatic properties. Our data also suggest cooperation in the biotransformation of TUDCA by the gut  in black bears. In conclusion, this work expands the natural enzyme bank of HSDHs, provides promising candidate enzymes for application in the biosynthesis TUDCA and the epimerization reaction of bile acids at the C-7 position, and provides a data set for the discovery of novel enzymes in the gut micriobiome of black bears.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846721>Determination of free and conjugated bile acids in serum of Apoe(-/-) mice fed different lingonberry fractions by UHPLC-MS.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are known to be involved in cholesterol metabolism but interactions between the diet, BA profiles, gut  and lipid metabolism have not been extensively explored. In the present study, primary and secondary BAs including their glycine and taurine-conjugated forms were quantified in serum of Apoe-/- mice by protein precipitation followed by reversed phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and QTOF mass spectrometry. The mice were fed different lingonberry fractions (whole, insoluble and soluble) in a high-fat setting or cellulose in a high and low-fat setting. Serum concentrations of BAs in mice fed cellulose were higher with the high-fat diet compared to the low-fat diet (20-70%). Among the lingonberry diets, the diet containing whole lingonberries had the highest concentration of chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), tauro-ursodeoxycholic  (T-UDCA), α and ω-muricholic acids (MCA) and tauro-α-MCA (T-α-MCA), and the lowest concentration of tauro-cholic  (T-CA),  (DCA) and tauro- (T-DCA). The glycine-conjugated BAs were very similar with all diets.

Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a control diet (CTL), high-fat diet (HF), high-fat diet supplemented with voglibose (VO), and high fat diet pair-fed group (PF). After 12 weeks, the following characteristics were investigated: serum lipid and glucose levels, serum polar metabolite profiles, and expression levels of genes involved in lipid and bile  metabolism. In addition, pyrosequencing was used to analyze the composition of gut  found in feces. Total body weight gain was significantly lower in the VO group than in the CTL, HF, and PF groups. The VO group exhibited improved metabolic profiles including those of blood glucose, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels. The 12-week voglibose administration decreased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes found in feces. Circulating levels of taurocholic and cholic  were significantly higher in the VO group than in the HF and CTL groups.  levels tended to be higher in the VO group than in the HF group. Voglibose administration downregulated expression levels of CYP8B1 and HNF4α genes and upregulated those of PGC1α, whereas FXRα was not affected. Voglibose administration elicits changes in the composition of the intestinal  and circulating metabolites, which ultimately has systemic effects on body weight and lipid metabolism in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27464459>Combination of soya pulp and Bacillus coagulans lilac-01 improves intestinal bile  metabolism without impairing the effects of prebiotics in rats fed a cholic -supplemented diet.</a></h2><p>Intestinal bacteria are involved in bile  (BA) deconjugation and/or dehydroxylation and are responsible for the production of secondary BA. However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal  due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced obesity and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28115375>Ursodeoxycholic  and Its Taurine- or Glycine-Conjugated Species Reduce Colitogenic Dysbiosis and Equally Suppress Experimental Colitis in Mice.</a></h2><p>The promising results seen in studies of secondary bile acids in experimental colitis suggest that they may represent an attractive and safe class of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

Daily oral administration of UDCA, tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), or glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) equally lowered the severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice, as evidenced by reduced body weight loss, colonic shortening, and expression of inflammatory cytokines.

However, bile  therapy normalized the colitis-associated increased ratio of  to  Interestingly, administration of bile acids prevented the loss of  cluster XIVa and increased the abundance of , bacterial species known to be particularly decreased in IBD patients. We conclude that UDCA, which is an FDA-approved drug for cholestatic liver disorders, could be an attractive treatment option to reduce dysbiosis and ameliorate inflammation in human IBD. Secondary bile acids are emerging as attractive candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Although bile acids may affect the intestinal microbial community structure, which significantly contributes to the course of these inflammatory disorders, the impact of bile  therapy on the fecal  during colitis has not yet been considered. Here, we studied the alterations in the fecal microbial abundance in colitic mice following the administration of secondary bile acids. Our results show that secondary bile acids reduce the severity of colitis and ameliorate colitis-associated fecal dysbiosis at the phylum level.

High-fat diet-induced dysbiosis of gut  and bile  dysregulation may be involved in the pathology of steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenolic catechin in green tea, has been widely investigated for its inhibitory or preventive effects against fatty liver. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of EGCG on the abundance of gut  and the composition of serum bile acids in high-fat diet-fed mice and determine the specific bacterial genera that can improve the serum bile  dysregulation associated with EGCG anti-hepatic steatosis action. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed with the control diet, high-fat diet, or high-fat diet + EGCG at a concentration of 0.32% for 8 weeks. EGCG significantly inhibited the increases in weight, the area of fatty lesions, and the triglyceride content in the liver induced by the high-fat diet.

Dietary habits are one of the main causative factors for metabolic syndrome, CVD and type 2 diabetes. The human gut  is emerging as an important player in the interaction between diet and metabolic health. Gut microbial communities contribute to human metabolism through fermentation of dietary fibre and the result of intestinal saccharolytic fermentation is production of SCFA. Acetate, propionate and butyrate positively influence satiety, endocrine system, glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, lipid oxidation, thermoregulation, hepatic gluconeogenesis, endothelial function and gut barrier integrity, and these mechanisms have all been linked to protection from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular health. The gut  is also involved in bile  metabolism and regulating their cell signalling potential, which has also been shown to modify pathways involved in metabolic health. Similarly, the gut  renders recalcitrant plant polyphenols into biologically active small phenolic compounds which then act systemically to reduce metabolic disease risk. This review summarises how dietary patterns, specific foods and a healthy lifestyle may modulate metabolic health through the gut  and their molecular cross-talk with the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29941869>Magnesium lithospermate B improves the gut microbiome and bile  metabolic profiles in a mouse model of diabetic nephropathy.</a></h2><p>Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) is a new drug marketed in China to treat angina, but its low oral bioavailability limits its clinical application to the intravenous route. Paradoxically, orally administered low-dose MLB was found to alleviate kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In recent years, the kidney-gut axis has been suspected to be involved in kidney damage pathogenesis, potentially representing a non-classical pathway for pharmacologic intervention. To ascertain whether MLB targets the kidney-gut axis, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were prepared as a mouse model of DN. The STZ mice were treated with MLB (50 mg kg d, p.o.) for 8 weeks. Twenty-four-hour urinary albumin was detected to mirror kidney function. At week 4, 6, 8, feces were collected; bile acids (BAs) were quantified to examine the alterations in the BA metabolic profiles, and bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were sequenced to identify alterations in gut microbial composition. In STZ mice, 24-h urinary albumin levels and total fecal BAs, especially cholic acids (CAs) and  acids (DCAs) were greatly increased, and the gut microbiome was dramatically shifted compared with control mice. Oral administration of MLB significantly decreased 24-h urinary albumin levels and total BAs, CAs and DCAs, and reversed CA:TCA (taurocholic ) and DCA:CA ratios. It also changed the microbiome composition in STZ mice based on operational units. Thus the therapeutic effect of MLB on kidney injury might be attributed (at least partially) to its ability to modulate the disordered gut microbiome and BA metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192599>A biosynthetic pathway for a prominent class of -derived bile acids.</a></h2><p>The gut bile  pool is millimolar in concentration, varies widely in composition among individuals and is linked to metabolic disease and cancer.

The authors propose to describe the key microbiora using term 'phylometabolic core of intestinal microbioca which more accurately reflects the functional importance of metabolically active . Phylometabolic core includes functional groups of microorganisms that perform similar metabolic functions: butyrate-producing bacteria, propionate-producing bacteria, acetate-produc- ing bacteria (acerogens), hydrogenosrophic microorganisms (reductive acetogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogens), lactate-producing and lactate-utilizing bacteria, bacteria involved in bile acids metabolism, bacteria that metabolize proteins and amino acids, vitamin-producing microorganisms, oxalate-degrading bacteria and others. The hypothesis that disturbance of microbial metabolism is the root of many human diseases is discussed. The microbial dysmexabo- lism leads to the metabolic dysbiosis (a particular form of dysbiosis) that is primarily characterized by metabolic abnormalities (e.g. serum, urinary, fetal or exhaled air). Metabolic dysbiosis is not necessarily accompanied by appreciable quantitative and/or qualitative changes in microbiora composition that called taxonomic dysbiosis. Since in the metabolic dysbiosis metabolic pathways can be switched only, it means the need for completely different approaches to its assessment using metabolomics (metabolic fingerprinting, metabolic profiling, meta-metabolomics). Metabolites concentrations in colon (feces, biopsy samples), blood (serum, plasma), urine or exhaled air, as well as metabolic profiles of examined substrates can serve as biomarkers. The main clinical variants of metabolic dysbiosis are due to the disturbances in microbial synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (primarily butyrate and propionate) and due to increasing bacterial production of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia and secondary bile acids (particularly ). These kinds of metabolic dysbiosis can eventually lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer (CRC). The metabolic dysbiosis due to bacterial choline dysmetabolism followed by overproduction of trimethylamine (TMA), arherogenic precursor of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), is associated with atherogenesis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dysmetabolism of aromatic amino acids leads to changes in the microbial production of phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives (phenyl carboxylic , p-cresol) and tryptophan indole derivatives (indole carboxylic , indole) and contributes to pathogenesis in lBS. IBD, CRC, chronic liver and kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autism and schizophrenia.

Recently, metformin was reported to alter the gut  community in humans, suggesting that the hyperglycemia-lowering action of the drug could be the result of modulating the population of gut . However, the critical microbial signaling metabolites and the host targets associated with the metabolic benefits of metformin remained elusive. Here, we performed metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of samples from individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) naively treated with metformin for 3 d, which revealed that Bacteroides fragilis was decreased and the bile  glycoursodeoxycholic  (GUDCA) was increased in the gut. These changes were accompanied by inhibition of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling. We further found that high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed mice colonized with B. fragilis were predisposed to more severe glucose intolerance, and the metabolic benefits of metformin treatment on glucose intolerance were abrogated. GUDCA was further identified as an intestinal FXR antagonist that improved various metabolic endpoints in mice with established obesity. Thus, we conclude that metformin acts in part through a B. fragilis-GUDCA-intestinal FXR axis to improve metabolic dysfunction, including hyperglycemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621728>Effects of theabrownin on serum metabolites and gut microbiome in rats with a high-sugar diet.</a></h2><p>Evidence has proven that the gut  is an important environmental factor contributing to obesity by altering host energy harvest and storage. We performed a high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing association study and serum metabolomics profiling in rats with a high-sugar diet. Our studies revealed that the high sugar diet reduced the diversity of cecal microorganisms, while the combination of theabrownin and the high sugar diet increased the diversity of cecal microorganisms and promoted reproduction of Alloprevotella, Coprostanoligenes_group, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Desulfovibrio, Intestinimonas, Alistipes, Bifidobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 and Staphylococcus. The combination also inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus, Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group and Tyzzerella. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio can be significantly reduced after the intervention of theabrownin in high sugar diet rats, and the reproduction of Bacteroides acidifaciens (BA) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus can be promoted. We found that the obesity-associated gut microbial species were linked to the changes in circulating metabolites. Serum levels of , cholic , 1H-indole-3-acetic , 3-indole acrylic  and melatonin were negatively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but positively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum and Gut_metagenome. 2-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-3-carboxylic , l-homoserine, and 1,7-dimethylxanthine were positively correlated with BA and Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, but negatively correlated with Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, and Gut_metagenome. In a high sugar diet mode, theabrownin reduced the body weight and triglycerides and improved insulin resistance mainly by targeting the reproduction of intestinal microorganisms such as BA, Staphylococcus saprophyticus subsp. saprophyticus, Lactobacillus murinus, Leptum, Gut_metagenome and so on. A strong correlation between cecal microorganisms and serum metabolites, obesity and insulin resistance was observed. Theabrownin has high potential in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29897551>Aflatoxin B1 Disrupts Gut-Microbial Metabolisms of Short-Chain Fatty Acids, Long-Chain Fatty Acids, and Bile Acids in Male F344 Rats.</a></h2><p>In this study, male F344 rats were orally exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) at 0, 5, 25, and 75 μg/kg for 4 weeks. Rat feces were collected from 2 to 4 weeks following exposure and were assessed for gut--dependent metabolites. Gut--related organic acids were quantitated in the feces using 2-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatization coupled HPLC-profiling method which was validated and showed good reliability, accuracy and sensitivity. After 2-week exposure, AFB1 significantly reduced the levels of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with an over 70% reduction in the high-dose group (75 μg/kg). Mixed-effects model revealed an inverse correlation between AFB1 dose and fecal levels of SCFAs, but no significant time effect was found. When compared with the control, oral exposure to middle-dose AFB1 (25 μg/kg) resulted in remarkable elevations of fecal cholic  (2.18-fold), linoleic  (cis-9, cis-12-18:2) (11.3-fold), pentadecanoic  (15: 0) (3.68-fold), pyruvic  (4.56-fold), and 3-phenyllactic  (3.74-fold), but  level was reduced by 41% in the low-dose group (5 μg/kg). These results demonstrated the disruptions of several important gut- metabolic pathways, including the synthesis of SCFAs, pyruvic  related pathways, metabolisms of amino acids, bile acids and long-chain fatty acids, which may further affect host digestive efficiency, energy supply, intestinal immunity, production of neurotransmitters, and enterohepatic cross-talk. Our study suggests that the impairment of gut--dependent metabolism may contribute to pathological mechanisms of AFB1-induced adverse health effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774887>Suppressed hepatic bile  signalling despite elevated production of primary and secondary bile acids in NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Bile acids are regulators of lipid and glucose metabolism, and modulate inflammation in the liver and other tissues. Primary bile acids such as cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) are produced in the liver, and converted into secondary bile acids such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  by gut . Here we investigated the possible roles of bile acids in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis and the impact of the gut microbiome on bile  signalling in NAFLD.Serum bile  levels and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), liver gene expression profiles and gut microbiome compositions were determined in patients with NAFLD, high-fat diet-fed rats and their controls.Serum concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids were increased in patients with NAFLD. In per cent, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonistic DCA was increased, while the agonistic CDCA was decreased in NAFLD. Increased mRNA expression for cytochrome P450 7A1, Na-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and paraoxonase 1, no change in mRNA expression for small heterodimer partner and bile salt export pump, and reduced serum FGF19 were evidence of impaired FXR and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)-mediated signalling in NAFLD. Taurine and glycine metabolising bacteria were increased in the gut of patients with NAFLD, reflecting increased secondary bile  production. Similar changes in liver gene expression and the gut microbiome were observed in high-fat diet-fed rats.The serum bile  profile, the hepatic gene expression pattern and the gut microbiome composition consistently support an elevated bile  production in NAFLD. The increased proportion of FXR antagonistic bile  explains, at least in part, the suppression of hepatic FXR-mediated and FGFR4-mediated signalling. Our study suggests that future NAFLD intervention may target the components of FXR signalling, including the bile  converting gut microbiome.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

To distinguish these opposing effects of DCA and butyrate (two major metabolites in colon lumen), we examined the effects of physiologically relevant doses of butyrate (0.5-2 mmol/l) and DCA (0.05-0.3 mmol/l) on colon cell proliferation. We hypothesize that butyrate and DCA each modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis via common and distinct cellular signaling targets. In this study, we demonstrated that both butyrate and DCA inhibited cell proliferation by up to 89% and 92% and increased cell apoptosis rate by up to 3.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. Cell cycle analyses revealed that butyrate led to an increase in G1 and G2 fractions with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction, but DCA induced an increase in only G1 fraction with a concomitant drop in the S-phase fraction when compared with the untreated cells. The examination of early cellular signaling revealed that DCA but not butyrate increased intracellular reactive oxygen species, genomic DNA breakage, the activation of ERK1/2, caspase-3 and PARP. In contrast, DCA decreased activated Rb protein level, and butyrate but not DCA increased p21 expression. Collectively, although both butyrate and DCA inhibit colonic cell proliferation, butyrate increases tumor suppressor gene expression, whereas DCA decreases tumor suppressor activation in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26767984>Protective effect of agaro-oligosaccharides on gut dysbiosis and colon tumorigenesis in high-fat diet-fed mice.</a></h2><p>High-fat diet (HFD)-induced alteration in the gut microbial composition, known as dysbiosis, is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for various diseases, including colon cancer. This report describes a comprehensive investigation of the effect of agaro-oligosaccharides (AGO) on HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, including alterations in short-chain fatty  contents and bile  metabolism in mice. C57BL/6N mice were fed a control diet or HFD, with or without AGO. Terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis produced their fecal  profiles. Profiles of cecal organic acids and serum bile acids were determined, respectively, using HPLC and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry systems. T-RFLP analyses showed that an HFD changed the gut  significantly. Changes in the  composition induced by an HFD were characterized by a decrease in the order Lactobacillales and by an increase in the Clostridium subcluster XIVa. These changes of the  community generated by HFD treatment were suppressed by AGO supplementation. As supported by the data of the proportion of Lactobacillales order, the concentration of lactic  increased in the HFD + AGO group. Data from the serum bile  profile showed that the level of , a carcinogenic secondary bile  produced by gut bacteria, was increased in HFD-receiving mice. The upregulation tended to be suppressed by AGO supplementation. Finally, results show that AGO supplementation suppressed the azoxymethane-induced generation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon derived from HFD-treated mice. Our results suggest that oral intake of AGO prevents HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, thereby inhibiting colon carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30025704>Inhibiting Growth of Clostridioides difficile by Restoring Valerate, Produced by the Intestinal .</a></h2><p>Fecal  transplantation (FMT) is effective for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), but there are concerns about its long-term safety. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of FMT could help us design safer, targeted therapies. We aimed to identify microbial metabolites that are important for C difficile growth.We used a CDI chemostat model as a tool to study the effects of FMT in vitro. The following analyses were performed: C difficile plate counts, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry bile  profiling. FMT mixtures were prepared using fresh fecal samples provided by donors enrolled in an FMT program in the United Kingdom. Results from chemostat experiments were validated using human stool samples, C difficile batch cultures, and C57BL/6 mice with CDI. Human stool samples were collected from 16 patients with recurrent CDI and healthy donors (n = 5) participating in an FMT trial in Canada.In the CDI chemostat model, clindamycin decreased valerate and  concentrations and increased C difficile total viable counts and valerate precursors, taurocholic , and succinate concentrations. After we stopped adding clindamycin, levels of bile acids and succinate recovered, whereas levels of valerate and valerate precursors did not. In the CDI chemostat model, FMT increased valerate concentrations and decreased C difficile total viable counts (94% decrease), spore counts (86% decrease), and valerate precursor concentrations; concentrations of bile acids were unchanged. In stool samples from patients with CDI, valerate was depleted before FMT but restored after FMT. Clostridioides difficile batch cultures confirmed that valerate decreased vegetative growth, and that taurocholic  was required for germination but had no effect on vegetative growth. Clostridioides difficile total viable counts were decreased by 95% in mice with CDI given glycerol trivalerate compared with phosphate buffered saline.We identified valerate as a metabolite that is depleted with clindamycin and only recovered with FMT. Valerate is a target for a rationally designed recurrent CDI therapy.Copyright © 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD).Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing.In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic  [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, , and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of :CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study.

However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the action mechanisms underlying the protective effects of UDCA and vitamin E against liver dysfunction using metabolomics and metagenomic analysis. In this study, we analysed blood and urine samples from patients with obesity and liver dysfunction. Nine patients were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (300 mg twice daily), and 10 subjects received vitamin E (400 IU twice daily) for 8 weeks. UDCA significantly improved the liver function scores after 4 weeks of treatment and effectively reduced hepatic  and serum microRNA-122 levels. To better understand its protective mechanism, a global metabolomics study was conducted, and we found that UDCA regulated uremic toxins (hippuric , p-cresol sulphate, and indole-derived metabolites), antioxidants (ascorbate sulphate and N-acetyl-L-cysteine), and the phenylalanine/tyrosine pathway. Furthermore, microbiome involvement, particularly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, was demonstrated through metagenomic analysis of bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles. Meanwhile, vitamin E treatment did not result in such alterations, except that it reduced uremic toxins and liver dysfunction. Our findings suggested that both treatments were effective in improving liver function, albeit via different mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470195>Microbiome: the bacterial tightrope.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007075>Differences in Fecal Gut , Short-Chain Fatty Acids and Bile Acids Link Colorectal Cancer Risk to Dietary Changes Associated with Urbanization Among Zimbabweans.</a></h2><p>The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is gradually rising in sub-Saharan Africa. This may be due to dietary changes associated with urbanization, which may induce tumor-promoting gut  composition and function.

It is unknown whether fecal bile  dysmetabolism occurs in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CE).To assess microbial dysbiosis, fecal unconjugated bile acids (fUBA), and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.Twenty-four healthy control dogs and 23 dogs with steroid-responsive CE.In this retrospective study, fUBA were measured and analyzed. Fecal  were assessed using a dysbiosis index. The canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index was used to evaluate remission of clinical signs. This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The dysbiosis index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P = .002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P = .049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3 months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P = 0.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile acids in dogs with CE. Additionally, resolution of clinical activity index in dogs with therapeutically managed CE and bile  dysmetabolism are likely correlated. However, subclinical disease (i.e., microbial dysbiosis) can persist in dogs with steroid-responsive CE.© 2019 The Authors.

Our focus revolves around the interaction of the gut  with liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. The bile  pool size has recently been shown to be a function of microbial metabolism of bile , and regulation of the  by bile acids is important in the development and progression of several liver diseases. Humans produce a large, conjugated hydrophilic bile  pool, maintained through positive-feedback antagonism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine and liver. Microbes use bile acids, and via FXR signaling this results in a smaller, unconjugated hydrophobic bile  pool. This equilibrium is critical to maintain health. The challenge is to examine the manifold functions of gut bile acids as modulators of antibiotic, probiotic, and disease progression in cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, and alcohol use. Recent studies have shown potential mechanisms explaining how perturbations in the microbiome affect bile  pool size and composition. With advancing liver disease and cirrhosis, there is dysbiosis in the fecal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, in addition to a decrease in bile  concentration in the intestine due to the liver problems. This results in a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa, and increasing production of . Alcohol intake speeds up these processes in the subjects with and without cirrhosis without significant FXR feedback. Taken together, these pathways can impact intestinal and systemic inflammation while worsening dysbiosis. The interaction between bile acids, alcohol, cirrhosis, and dysbiosis is an important relationship that influences intestinal and systemic inflammation, which in turn determines progression of the overall disease process. These interactions and the impact of commonly used therapies for liver disease can provide insight into the pathogenesis of inflammation in humans.2015 S.

We conducted a feeding experiment to investigate the influence of ad libitum feeding of pre-and post-weaned piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented diet on the gut microbiome, gut metabolomic profiles, bile  metabolism, proinflammatory cytokines and faecal consistency. Compared with piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pellet diet, piglets fed the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet had lower intestinal bacterial diversity (P > 0.05), higher intestinal fungal diversity (P > 0.05), more Firmicutes (P > 0.05), fewer Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (P > 0.05), higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropionic  (P < 0.05), orotic  (P < 0.05), interleukin-6 (P < 0.01), lactic  (P < 0.01),  (P > 0.05) and lithocholic  (P < 0.01) and a higher incidence of diarrhoea (P > 0.05).

This difference has a major impact on the gut microbiome, especially on anaerobic spore-forming bacteria. CA augments germination of spores in the terminal ileum. On the other hand, DCA curtails the number of germinated anaerobes entering the cecum from the terminal ileum. The control mechanism that exists in the adult cecum is absent in the young child and results in unrestrained proliferation of anaerobes, such as , in the cecum.

Therefore, it is possible that exogenous administration of inhibitory bile acids may be used directly as nonantibiotic therapeutics for this indication. The need for such a treatment alternative is especially significant in patients with refractory C. difficile-associated pouchitis, where the efficacy of FMT may be limited.We measured the ability of UDCA to suppress the germination and the vegetative growth of 11 clinical isolate strains of C. difficile from patients treated with FMT for RCDI. In addition, we used oral UDCA to treat a patient with RCDI pouchitis that proved refractory to multiple antibiotic treatments and FMT.UDCA was found to be inhibitory to the germination and the vegetative growth of all C. difficile strains tested. Fecal concentrations of UDCA from the patient with RCDI pouchitis exceeded levels necessary to inhibit the germination and the growth of C. difficile in vitro. The patient has remained infection free for over 10 months after the initiation of UDCA.UDCA can be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with C. difficile-associated pouchitis. Further studies need to be conducted to define the optimal dose and duration of such a treatment.

Bile salts that are secreted into the intestine may be biotransformed by enzymes produced by the gut bacteria. To date, bile  research at the host-microbe interface has primarily been directed toward effects on host metabolism. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of changes in gut microbial bile  metabolism on the solubilization capacity of bile salt micelles and consequently intraluminal drug solubility. First, the impact of bile  metabolism, mediated in vivo by the microbial enzymes bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and 7α-dehydroxylase, on drug solubility was assessed by comparing the solubilization capacity of (a) conjugated vs deconjugated and (b) primary vs secondary bile salts. A series of poorly water-soluble drugs (PWSDs) were selected as model solutes on the basis of an increased tendency to associate with bile micelles. Subsequently, PWSD solubility and dissolution was evaluated in conventional biorelevant simulated intestinal fluid containing host-derived bile acids, as well as in media modified to contain microbial bile  metabolites. The findings suggest that deconjugation of the bile  steroidal core, as dictated by BSH activity, influences micellar solubilization capacity for some PWSDs; however, these differences appear to be relatively minor. In contrast, the extent of bile  hydroxylation, regulated by microbial 7α-dehydroxylase, was found to significantly affect the solubilization capacity of bile salt micelles for all nine drugs studied (p < 0.05). Subsequent investigations in biorelevant media containing either the trihydroxy bile salt sodium taurocholate (TCA) or the dihydroxy bile salt sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCA) revealed altered drug solubility and dissolution. Observed differences in biorelevant media appeared to be both drug- and amphiphile (bile salt/lecithin) concentration-dependent. Our studies herein indicate that bile  modifications occurring at the host-microbe interface could lead to alterations in the capacity of intestinal bile salt micelles to solubilize drugs, providing impetus to consider the gut  in the drug absorption process. In the clinical setting, disruption of the gut microbial ecosystem, through disease or antibiotic treatment, could transform the bile  pool with potential implications for drug absorption and bioavailability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30828892>Interplay between bile acids and the gut  promotes intestinal carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>The gut  and the bile  pool play pivotal roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Bile acids are produced in the liver from cholesterol and metabolized in the intestine by the gut . Gut dysbiosis has been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer. However, the interplay between bile  metabolism and the gut  during intestinal carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles of bile acids and the gut  in the cholic  (CA; a primary bile )-induced intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence. Apc  mice, which spontaneously develop intestinal adenomas, were fed a diet supplemented with 0.4% CA for 12 weeks. Mice that were fed a normal diet were regarded as untreated controls. In CA-treated Apc  mice, the composition of the gut  was significantly altered, and CA was efficiently transformed into  (a secondary bile ) by the bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation reaction. The intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence was observed in CA-treated Apc  mice and was accompanied by an impaired intestinal barrier function and IL-6/STAT3-related low-grade inflammation. More importantly,  depletion using an antibiotic cocktail globally compromised CA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, suggesting a leading role for the  during this process. Overall, our data suggested that the crosstalk between bile acids and the gut  mediated intestinal carcinogenesis, which might provide novel therapeutic strategies against intestinal tumor development.© 2019 The Authors.

Compared with control, the elevated components in the GTP-treated groups include niacin (8.61-fold), 3-phenyllactic  (2.20-fold), galactose (3.13-fold), mannose (2.05-fold), pentadecanoic  (2.15-fold), lactic  (2.70-fold), and proline (2.15-fold); the reduced components include cholesterol (0.29-fold), cholic  (0.62-fold),  (0.41-fold), trehalose (0.14-fold), glucose (0.46-fold), fructose (0.12-fold), and alanine (0.61-fold). These results were in line with the genomic alterations of gut-microbiome previously discovered by metagenomics analysis. The alterations of these metabolites suggested the reduction of calorific carbohydrates, elevation of vitamin production, decreases of bile constituents, and modified metabolic pattern of amino acids in the GTP-treated animals. Changes in gut- associated metabolism may be a major contributor to the anti-obesity function of GTP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

It is known, that the composition of the intestinal bile  cocktail has a great impact on the susceptibility toward a  infection. However, the specific response of growing  cells to diverse bile acids on the molecular level has not been described yet. In this study, we recorded proteome signatures of shock and long-term (LT) stress with the four main bile acids cholic  (CA), chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA),  (DCA), and lithocholic  (LCA). A general overlapping response to all tested bile acids could be determined particularly in shock experiments which appears plausible in the light of their common steroid structure. However, during LT stress several proteins showed an altered abundance in the presence of only a single or a few of the bile acids indicating the existence of specific adaptation mechanisms. Our results point at a differential induction of the groEL and dnaKJgrpE chaperone systems, both belonging to the class I heat shock genes. Additionally, central metabolic pathways involving butyrate fermentation and the reductive Stickland fermentation of leucine were effected, although CA caused a proteome signature different from the other three bile acids. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics revealed a loss of flagellar proteins in LT stress with LCA. The absence of flagella could be substantiated by electron microscopy which also indicated less flagellated cells in the presence of DCA and CDCA and no influence on flagella formation by CA. Our data break down the bile  stress response of  into a general and a specific adaptation. The latter cannot simply be divided into a response to primary and secondary bile acids, but rather reflects a complex and variable adaptation process enabling  to survive and to cause an infection in the intestinal tract.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29515780>Bile  metabolism regulated by the gut  promotes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.</a></h2><p>Gut  plays a significant role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, understanding of the precise mechanism of this process remains incomplete. A new class steatohepatitis-inducing high-fat diet (HFD), namely STHD-01, can promote the development of HCC without the administration of chemical carcinogens. Using this diet, we comprehensively analyzed changes in the gut  and its metabolic functions during the development of HCC in NASH. Mice fed the STHD-01 developed NASH within 9 weeks. NASH further progressed into HCC by 41 weeks. Treatment with antibiotics significantly attenuated liver pathology and suppressed tumor development, indicating the critical role of the gut  in tumor development in this model. Accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the liver and feces increased after feeding the mice with STHD-01. Treatment with antibiotics did not reverse these phenotypes. In contrast, accumulation of secondary bile acids was dramatically reduced after the treatment with antibiotics, suggesting the critical role of the gut  in the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids such as  activated the mTOR, pathway in hepatocytes. Activation of mTOR was observed in the liver of mice fed STHD-01, and the activation was reduced when mice were treated with antibiotics. Collectively, bile  metabolism by the gut  promotes HCC development in STHD-01-induced NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864445>Undernutrition Shapes the Gut  and Bile  Profile in Association with Altered Gut-Liver FXR Signaling in Weaning Pigs.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, synthesized in the liver and metabolized by , have emerged as important signaling molecules regulating immune responses and cell proliferation. However, the crosstalk among nutrition, , and bile acids remains unclear. Our study indicated that undernutrition in weaning piglets led to intestinal atrophy, increased colonic production, and systemic accumulation of lithocholic  (LCA),  (DCA), or their conjugated forms, which might be associated with decreased Lactobacillus abundance. Moreover, undernutrition led to increased portal fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19) level, upregulated hepatic heterodimer partner ( SHP), and downregulated cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase ( CYP7A1) expression. The detrimental effects of DCA and LCA on proliferation and barrier function were confirmed in porcine enterocytes, whereas their roles in weaning piglets warrant further research. In summary, undernutrition in weaning piglets led to increased secondary bile acids production, which might be related to altered gut microbiome and enhanced farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling while CYP7A1 expression was suppressed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29202273>Effects of barley variety, dietary fiber and β-glucan content on bile  composition in cecum of rats fed low- and high-fat diets.</a></h2><p>Diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance have been linked to changes in bile  (BA) profiles, which in turn are highly dependent on the dietary composition and activity of the gut . The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the type and level of fiber had an effect on cecal BA composition when included in low- and high-fat diets. Groups of rats were fed two barley varieties, which resulted in three test diets containing three levels of β-glucans and two levels of dietary fiber. BAs were preconcentrated using hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction and quantified by gas chromatography. The amount of the secondary BAs, lithocholic-, - and hyodexycholic acids was generally higher in groups fed high-fat diets compared with corresponding acids in groups fed low-fat diets (P<.05). In contrast, most of the primary and the secondary BAs, ursodeoxycholic  and β- and ω-muricholic acids, were two to five times higher (P<.05) in groups fed low-fat diets than in groups fed high-fat diets. This was particularly true for groups fed the highest level of β-glucans and in some cases also the medium level. The BA profile in the gut was strongly dependent on the amount and type of dietary fiber in the diet, which may be useful in the prevention/treatment of diseases associated with changes in BA profiles.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and  acids and depleted of lithocholic .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and metabolic activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism.

However, data are accumulating to suggest that other nonantibacterial effects may be involved in rifaximin efficacy.To explore the mechanisms of action of rifaximin that may underlie its clinical benefits in travellers' diarrhoea, hepatic encephalopathy and other cirrhosis complications, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea.Gastroenterology experts convened a round-table discussion to address clinical and pre-clinical rifaximin data pertaining to select GI diseases and the potential mechanisms of action that underlie rifaximin efficacy profiles. As preparation, the literature was searched for publications related to rifaximin, its mechanisms of action, and its efficacy in travellers' diarrhoea, hepatic encephalopathy and other cirrhosis-related complications, inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome.Gut  dysbiosis and proinflammatory activities are thought to significantly contribute to disease pathophysiology of these conditions. Rifaximin may resolve gut  dysbiosis by promoting GI colonisation of beneficial bacterial species without drastic alterations in overall diversity. Rifaximin-induced changes in the production and metabolism of bacteria-produced agents (e.g. , lipopolysaccharides) also may help preserve normal gut . Rifaximin may suppress local and systemic inflammatory processes by preserving epithelial function (e.g. limiting bacterial translocation), modulating bacterial virulence and reducing proinflammatory cytokine production.The commonality of pathological mechanisms underlying multiple GI diseases and the ability of rifaximin to modulate the gut microenvironment (i.e. gut microenvironment modulator) may explain its diverse efficacy profile.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28751127>Isolation of six novel 7-oxo- or urso-type secondary bile -producing bacteria from rat cecal contents.</a></h2><p>Understanding the dynamics of secondary bile  (SBA) formation in the gut by SBA-producing bacteria is important for host health, as SBAs have been shown to affect host pathophysiology and gut  composition. However, our knowledge of SBA producers is limited in light of the diversity of gut microbes. Here, we isolated six novel SBA-producing bacteria from rat cecal contents, all of which were members of known species of gut microbes. Anaerostipes caccae D10, Bacteroides nordii C5, Clostridioides difficile D7, and Clostridium cadaveris G11 were capable of oxidizing cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  into 7-oxo-derivatives with varying yields. B. nordii C5 and its type strain JCM 12987 had the highest molar yield, ∼90%. Clostridium disporicum F4 and Clostridium subterminale C4 epimerized cholic  into ursocholic  with yields of ∼85%; the corresponding type strains lacked epimerization activity. Furthermore, although not novel as an SBA producer, Clostridium scindens G10 that produced  from cholic  was isolated for the first time from rodents.

Elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promote barrier re-establishment; however, we found that persistently elevated PGE2 hinders subsequent repair phases. The bacterial metabolite deoxycholate (DCA) promotes transition through repair phases via PGE2 regulation. During barrier re-establishment, DCA levels are locally diminished in the wound, allowing enhanced PGE2 production and barrier re-establishment. However, during transition to the wound channel formation phase, DCA levels increase to inhibit PGE2 production and promote crypt regeneration. Altering DCA levels via antibiotic treatment enhances PGE2 levels but impairs wound repair, which is rescued with DCA treatment. DCA acts via its receptor, farnesoid X receptor, to inhibit the enzyme cPLA2 required for PGE2 synthesis. Thus, colonic wound repair requires temporally regulated signals from microbial metabolites to coordinate host-associated signaling cascades. VIDEO ABSTRACT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate this effect, rats were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% water extract from either the reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lingzhi) (WGL) or the auto-digested reishi G. lingzhi (AWGL) for three weeks. Both extracts markedly reduced fecal secondary bile acids, such as lithocholic  and  (colon carcinogens). These extracts reduced the numbers of Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum (secondary bile acids-producing bacteria) in a per g of cecal digesta. Fecal mucins and cecal propionate were significantly elevated by both extracts, and fecal IgA was significantly elevated by WGL, but not by AWGL.

Prenatal caloric restriction results in low birth weight, glucose intolerance, obesity, and reduced plasma bile acids (BAs) in offspring mice. Because BAs can regulate systemic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, we hypothesized that BA supplementation could prevent diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in this model of developmental programming. Pregnant dams were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5 to 18.5. Offspring of both undernourished (UN) and control (C) dams given unrestricted diets were weaned to high-fat diets with or without supplementation with 0.25% w/w ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), yielding four experimental groups: C, UN, C + UDCA, and UN + UDCA. Glucose homeostasis, BA composition, liver and intestinal gene expression, and  composition were analyzed in the four groups. Although UDCA supplementation ameliorated diet-induced obesity in C mice, there was no effect in UN mice. UDCA similarly lowered fasting insulin, and improved glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance, and liver steatosis in C, but not UN, animals. BA composition differed significantly, and liver and ileal expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Cyp7b1, Shp) were differentially induced by UDCA in C vs UN animals. Bacterial taxa in fecal  correlated with treatment groups and metabolic parameters. In conclusion, prenatal undernutrition alters responsiveness to the metabolic benefits of BA supplementation, with resistance to the weight-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of UDCA supplementation. Our findings suggest that BA metabolism may be a previously unrecognized contributor to developmentally programmed diabetes risk.Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483538>Morphine induces changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome in a morphine dependence model.</a></h2><p>Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed in the United States and worldwide. However, serious comorbidities, such as dependence, tolerance, immunosuppression and gastrointestinal disorders limit their long-term use. In the current study, a morphine-murine model was used to investigate the role of the gut microbiome and metabolome as a potential mechanism contributing to the negative consequences associated with opioid use. Results reveal a significant shift in the gut microbiome and metabolome within one day following morphine treatment compared to that observed after placebo. Morphine-induced gut microbial dysbiosis exhibited distinct characteristic signatures, including significant increase in communities associated with pathogenic function, decrease in communities associated with stress tolerance and significant impairment in bile acids and morphine-3-glucuronide/morphine biotransformation in the gut. Moreover, expansion of Enterococcus faecalis was strongly correlated with gut dysbiosis following morphine treatment, and alterations in  (DCA) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) were associated with opioid-induced metabolomic changes. Collectively, these results indicate that morphine induced distinct alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolome, contributing to negative consequences associated with opioid use.

Klb mice are refractory to metabolic FGF15 and FGF21 action and exhibit derepressed (increased) bile  (BA) synthesis. Here, we deeply phenotyped male Klb mice on a pure C57BL/6J genetic background, fed a chow diet focusing on metabolic aspects. This aims to better understand the physiological consequences of concomitant FGF15 and FGF21 signaling deficiency, in particular on the gut-liver axis. Klb mice present permanent growth restriction independent of adiposity and energy balance. Klb mice also exhibit few changes in carbohydrate metabolism, combining normal gluco-tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and fasting response with increased gluconeogenic capacity and decreased glycogen mobilization. Livers of Klb mice reveal pathologic features, including a proinflammatory status and initiation of fibrosis. These defects are associated to a massive shift in BA composition in the enterohepatic system and blood circulation featured by a large excess of -derived , classically known for its genotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, β-Klotho is a gatekeeper of hepatic integrity through direct action (mediating FGF21 anti-inflammatory signaling) and indirect mechanisms (mediating FGF15 signaling that maintains BA level and composition).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27315087>Molecular Properties of Guar Gum and Pectin Modify Cecal Bile Acids, , and Plasma Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein in Rats.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) act as signaling molecules in various physiological processes, and are related to colonic  composition as well as to different types of dietary fat and fiber. This study investigated whether guar gum and pectin-two fibers with distinct functional characteristics-affect BA profiles,  composition, and gut metabolites in rats. Low- (LM) or high-methoxylated (HM) pectin, and low-, medium-, or high-molecular-weight (MW) guar gum were administered to rats that were fed either low- or high-fat diets. Cecal BAs, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and  composition, and plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) levels were analyzed, by using novel methodologies based on gas chromatography (BAs and SCFAs) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Strong correlations were observed between cecal BA and SCFA levels,  composition, and portal plasma LBP levels in rats on a high-fat diet. Notably, guar gum consumption with medium-MW increased the cecal amounts of cholic-, chenodeoxycholic-, and ursodeoxycholic acids as well as α-, β-, and ω-muricholic acids to a greater extent than other types of guar gum or the fiber-free control diet. In contrast, the amounts of cecal - and hyodeoxycholic  were reduced with all types of guar gum independent of chain length. Differences in BA composition between pectin groups were less obvious, but cecal levels of α- and ω-muricholic acids were higher in rats fed LM as compared to HM pectin or the control diet. The inflammatory marker LBP was downregulated in rats fed medium-MW guar gum and HM pectin; these two fibers decreased the cecal abundance of Oscillospira and an unclassified genus in Ruminococcaceae, and increased that of an unclassified family in RF32. These results indicate that the molecular properties of guar gum and pectin are important for their ability to modulate cecal BA formation, gut  composition, and high-fat diet induced inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27900259>Dietary fat and gut  interactions determine diet-induced obesity in mice.</a></h2><p>Gut  may promote positive energy balance; however, germfree mice can be either resistant or susceptible to diet-induced obesity (DIO) depending on the type of dietary intervention. We here sought to identify the dietary constituents that determine the susceptibility to body fat accretion in germfree (GF) mice.GF and specific pathogen free (SPF) male C57BL/6N mice were fed high-fat diets either based on lard or palm oil for 4 wks. Mice were metabolically characterized at the end of the feeding trial. FT-ICR-MS and UPLC-TOF-MS were used for cecal as well as hepatic metabolite profiling and cecal bile acids quantification, respectively. Hepatic gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR and cecal gut  of SPF mice was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.GF mice, but not SPF mice, were completely DIO resistant when fed a cholesterol-rich lard-based high-fat diet, whereas on a cholesterol-free palm oil-based high-fat diet, DIO was independent of gut . In GF lard-fed mice, DIO resistance was conveyed by increased energy expenditure, preferential carbohydrate oxidation, and increased fecal fat and energy excretion. Cecal metabolite profiling revealed a shift in bile  and steroid metabolites in these lean mice, with a significant rise in 17β-estradiol, which is known to stimulate energy expenditure and interfere with bile  metabolism. Decreased cecal bile  levels were associated with decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in bile  synthesis. These metabolic adaptations were largely attenuated in GF mice fed the palm-oil based high-fat diet. We propose that an interaction of gut  and cholesterol metabolism is essential for fat accretion in normal SPF mice fed cholesterol-rich lard as the main dietary fat source. This is supported by a positive correlation between bile  levels and specific bacteria of the order  (phylum ) as a characteristic feature of normal SPF mice fed lard.In conclusion, our study identified dietary cholesterol as a candidate ingredient affecting the crosstalk between gut  and host metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28074537>Neuroblastoma causes alterations of the intestinal microbiome, gut hormones, inflammatory cytokines, and bile  composition.</a></h2><p>To assess the effect of neuroblastoma (NB) on the intestinal microbiome, metabolism, and inflammatory parameters in a murine model.Athymic Hsd:Fox1nu mice received subperitoneal implantation of human NB cells (MHH-NB11) (tumor group, TG) or culture medium (sham group). Following 10 weeks of tumor growth, all animals were sacrificed to collect total white adipose tissue (WAT). Luminex assays were performed for gut hormone and inflammation marker analysis. Bile acids were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in feces and serum. The microbiome of the ileal content was determined by 16S rDNA next-generation sequencing.At 10 weeks, tumors masses in the TG reached a mean weight of 1.10 g (interquartile range 3.45 g) associated with a significant reduction in WAT. Furthermore, in the TG, there was a marked reduction in leptin and an increase in glucagon-like peptide 1 serum levels. Moreover, the TG mice displayed a pro-inflammatory profile, with significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-10. Lithocholic , , and ursodeoxycholic  were significantly decreased in the stool of TG mice. Significant alterations of the intestinal microbiome were found in the ileal contents of the TG.The present study provides a first glimpse that human NB in a murine model induces tumor cachexia associated with alterations in metabolic and inflammatory parameters, as well as changes in the intestinal .

However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which obesity promotes HCC development are still unclear. Recent studies have shown that gut  may influence liver diseases by transferring its metabolites and components. Here, we show that the hepatic translocation of obesity-induced lipoteichoic  (LTA), a Gram-positive gut microbial component, promotes HCC development by creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, , to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E (PGE) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Moreover, COX2 overexpression and excess PGE production were detected in HSCs in human HCCs with noncirrhotic, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), indicating that a similar mechanism could function in humans. We showed the importance of the gut-liver axis in obesity-associated HCC. The gut -driven COX2 pathway produced the lipid mediator PGE in senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a pivotal role in suppressing antitumor immunity, suggesting that PGE and its receptor may be novel therapeutic targets for noncirrhotic NASH-associated HCC. .©2017 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29430336>Influence of Bile Acids on Colorectal Cancer Risk: Potential Mechanisms Mediated by Diet - Gut  Interactions.</a></h2><p>To review the evidence for the tumorigenic effects of food-stimulated bile acids on the colon and interaction with the gut .High-fat diets promote the hepatic synthesis of bile acids and increase their delivery to the colonic lumen. Here, they stimulate the growth and activity of 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria, which convert primary into secondary bile acids that show tumorigenic activity, especially  (DCA). Fecal levels of secondary bile acids correlate with mucosal and metabolic markers of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in high and low risk adult individuals and can be modified within a few weeks by dietary change. While gut bacteria regulate the bile  pool via complex microbial biotransformation, bile acids alter the gut  composition due to their antimicrobial properties. This mutual reaction induces altered bile  pools and dysbiotic compositions of the gut  that may show tumor-promoting activity of bile acids beyond their conversion to DCA.Bile acids act as tumor promoters in the colon. Diet and the gut  are most likely the key drivers that mediate and confer bile -associated tumorigenic activity.

A few 7α-dehydroxylating strains have been isolated, where bile -inducible () genes were organized in a gene cluster and encoded major enzymes involved. However, only little is known on diversity and abundance of intestinal bacteria catalysing DCA/LCA formation in the human gut . In this study, we took the opportunity to screen metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from sequence data of stool samples provided by two recent studies along with newly available gut-derived isolates for the presence of the  gene cluster. We revealed in total 765 and 620 MAGs encoding the potential to form DCA/LCA that grouped into 21 and 26 metagenomic species, respectively. The majority of MAGs (92.4 and 90.3%) were associated with a  clade that still lacks an isolate, whereas less MAGs belonged to  along with eight new isolates (n total = 11) that contained the  genes. Only a few MAGs were linked to . Signatures for horizontal transfer of  genes were observed. This study gives a comprehensive overview of the diversity of -exhibiting bacteria in the human gut highlighting the application of metagenomics to unravel potential functions hidden from current isolates.

Deconjugation activity was detected using a plate test, two-step enzymatic reaction and activity staining on a native polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, bile salt hydrolases from B. pseudocatenulatum and B. longum subsp. suis were purified using a two-step chromatographic procedure. Biochemical characterization of the bile salt hydrolases showed that the purified enzymes hydrolyzed all of the six major human bile salts under the pH and temperature conditions commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. Next, the dynamic rheometry was applied to monitor the gelation process of  under different conditions. The results showed that bile acids displayed aqueous media gelating properties. Finally, gel-forming abilities of bifidobacteria exhibiting bile salt hydrolase activity were analyzed. Our investigations have demonstrated that the release of deconjugated bile acids led to the gelation phenomenon of the enzymatic reaction solution containing purified BSH. The presented results suggest that bile salt hydrolase activity commonly found among intestinal  increases hydrogel-forming abilities of certain bile salts. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that bile salt hydrolase activity among Bifidobacterium is directly connected with the gelation process of bile salts. In our opinion, if such a phenomenon occurs in physiological conditions of human gut, it may improve bacterial ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract and their survival in this specific ecological niche.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30589376> and  characterization of  bile  transformations.</a></h2><p>The human gut hosts trillions of microorganisms that exert a profound influence on human biology. Gut bacteria communicate with their host by secreting small molecules that can signal to distant organs in the body. Bile acids are one class of these signaling molecules, synthesized by the host and chemically transformed by the gut . Among bile  metabolizers, bile  7-dehydroxylating bacteria are commensals of particular importance as they carry out the 7-dehydroxylation of liver-derived primary bile acids to 7-dehydroxylated bile acids. The latter represents a major fraction of the secondary bile  pool. The microbiology of this group of gut microorganisms is understudied and warrants more attention. Here, we detail the bile  transformations carried out by the 7-dehydroxylating bacterium  and  exhibits not only 7α-dehydroxylating capabilities but also, the ability to oxidize other hydroxyl groups and reduce ketone groups in primary and secondary bile acids. This study revealed 12-oxolithocholic  as a major transient product in the 7α-dehydroxylation of cholic .

Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to overcome them. Here we demonstrate that glycyrrhizic  (GA) prevents HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis through gut . GA reduced HFD-enhanced myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment, pro-metastatic protein S100A8/A9 expression and metastasis burden of 4T1 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma, accompanied by gut  alteration and colonic macrophage polarization far away the M1-like phenotype. These parameters were greatly decreased by treatment with antibiotics, recolonization of Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Clostridium sordellii, and administration of lipopolysaccharide or . Macrophage depletion attenuated HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis, but failed to further affect the effects of GA. Mechanistically, counteraction of HFD-enhanced gut  dysbiosis by GA inhibited Gr-1 myeloid cell migration and S100A8/A9 expression through decreasing the proportion of M1-like macrophages and their production of CCL2 and TNF-α in the colons via LPS/HMGB1/NF-κB signaling inactivation. Together, targeting the gut  by GA to modulate colonic macrophages could be a novel strategy for the prevention of HFD-enhanced pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388019>Gut -Mediated Bile  Transformations Alter the Cellular Response to Multidrug Resistant Transporter Substrates in Vitro: Focus on P-glycoprotein.</a></h2><p>Pharmacokinetic research at the host-microbe interface has been primarily directed toward effects on drug metabolism, with fewer investigations considering the absorption process. We previously demonstrated that the transcriptional expression of genes encoding intestinal transporters involved in lipid translocation are altered in germ-free and conventionalized mice possessing distinct bile  signatures. It was consequently hypothesized that microbial bile  metabolism, which is the deconjugation and dehydroxylation of the bile  steroid nucleus by gut bacteria, may impact upon drug transporter expression and/or activity and potentially alter drug disposition. Using a panel of three human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2, T84, and HT-29) that differ in basal transporter expression level, bile  conjugation-, and hydroxylation-status was shown to influence the transcription of genes encoding several major influx and efflux transporter proteins. We further investigated if these effects on transporter mRNA would translate to altered drug disposition and activity. The results demonstrated that the conjugation and hydroxylation status of the bile  steroid nucleus can influence the cellular response to multidrug resistance (MDR) substrates, a finding that did not directly correlate with directionality of gene or protein expression. In particular, we noted that the cytotoxicity of cyclosporine A was significantly augmented in the presence of the unconjugated bile acids  (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) in P-gp positive cell lines, as compared to their taurine/glycine-conjugated counterparts, implicating P-gp in the molecular response. Overall this work identifies a novel mechanism by which gut microbial metabolites may influence drug accumulation and suggests a potential role for the microbial bile -deconjugating enzyme bile salt hydrolase (BSH) in ameliorating multidrug resistance through the generation of bile  species with the capacity to access and inhibit P-gp ATPase. The physicochemical property of nonionization is suggested to underpin the preferential ability of unconjugated bile acids to attenuate the efflux of P-gp substrates and to sensitize tumorigenic cells to cytotoxic therapeutics in vitro. This work provides new impetus to investigate whether perturbation of the gut , and thereby the bile  component of the intestinal metabolome, could alter drug pharmacokinetics in vivo. These findings may additionally contribute to the development of less toxic P-gp modulators, which could overcome MDR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645370>Regulations of bile  metabolism in mouse models with hydrophobic bile  composition.</a></h2><p>The bile  (BA) composition in mice is substantially different from that in humans. Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28066726>Functional Intestinal Bile  7α-Dehydroxylation by  Associated with Protection from  Infection in a Gnotobiotic Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Bile acids, important mediators of lipid absorption, also act as hormone-like regulators and as antimicrobial molecules. In all these functions their potency is modulated by a variety of chemical modifications catalyzed by bacteria of the healthy gut , generating a complex variety of secondary bile acids. Intestinal commensal organisms are well-adapted to normal concentrations of bile acids in the gut. In contrast, physiological concentrations of the various intestinal bile  species play an important role in the resistance to intestinal colonization by pathogens such as . Antibiotic therapy can perturb the gut  and thereby impair the production of protective secondary bile acids. The most important bile  transformation is 7α-dehydroxylation, producing  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA). The enzymatic pathway carrying out 7α-dehydroxylation is restricted to a narrow phylogenetic group of commensal bacteria, the best-characterized of which is . Like many other intestinal commensal species, 7-dehydroxylating bacteria are understudied . Conventional animals contain variable and uncharacterized indigenous 7α-dehydroxylating organisms that cannot be selectively removed, making controlled colonization with a specific strain in the context of an undisturbed  unfeasible. In the present study, we used a recently established, standardized gnotobiotic mouse model that is stably associated with a simplified murine 12-species "oligo-mouse " (Oligo-MM). It is representative of the major murine intestinal bacterial phyla, but is deficient for 7α-dehydroxylation. We find that the Oligo-MM consortium carries out bile  deconjugation, a prerequisite for 7α-dehydroxylation, and confers no resistance to  infection (CDI). Amendment of Oligo-MM with  normalized the large intestinal bile  composition by reconstituting 7α-dehydroxylation. These changes had only minor effects on the composition of the native Oligo-MM, but significantly decreased early large intestinal  colonization and pathogenesis.

However, pharmacokinetic studies showed that berberine was poorly absorbed into the body so the levels of berberine in the blood and target tissues were far below the effective concentrations revealed. To probe the underlying mechanism, the effect of berberine on the biological system was studied on a high-fat-diet-induced hamster hyperlipidemia model. Our results showed that intragastrically-administered berberine was poorly absorbed into circulation and most berberine accumulated in gut content. Although the bioavailability of intragastrically administered berberine was much lower than that of intraperitoneally administered berberine, it had a stronger lipid-lowing effect, indicating that the gastrointestinal tract is a potential target for the hypolipidemic effect of berberine. A metabolomic study on both serum and gut content showed that orally administered berberine significantly regulated molecules involved in lipid metabolism, and increased the generation of bile acids in the hyperlipidemic model. DNA analysis revealed that the orally administered berberine modulated the gut , and berberine showed a significant inhibition of the 7α-dehydroxylation conversion of cholic  to , indicating a decreased elimination of bile acids in the gut. However, in model hamsters, elevated bile acids failed to downregulate the expression and function of CYP7A1 in a negative feedback loop. It was suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of orally administered berberine involves modulating the turnover of bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor signal pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26531326>The microbiome and its pharmacological targets: therapeutic avenues in cardiometabolic diseases.</a></h2><p>Consisting of trillions of non-pathogenic bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with their mammalian host, the gut  has emerged in the past decades as one of the key drivers for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). By degrading dietary substrates, the gut  produces several metabolites that bind human pharmacological targets, impact subsequent signalling networks and in fine modulate host's metabolism. In this review, we revisit the pharmacological relevance of four classes of gut microbial metabolites in CMD: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, methylamines and indoles.

However, evidence relating bile acids, intestinal  and tumorigenesis are limited. In our study, we investigated the effect of DCA on induction of intestinal dysbiosis and its roles in intestinal carcinogenesis. Alteration of the composition of the intestinal  was induced in DCA-treated APC mice, which was accompanied by impaired intestinal barrier, gut low grade inflammation and tumor progression. The transfer of fecal  from DCA-treated mice to another group of Apc mice increased tumor multiplicity, induced inflammation and recruited M2 phenotype tumor-associated macrophages. Importantly, the fecal  transplantation activated the tumor-associated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Moreover,  depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block DCA-induced intestinal carcinogenesis, further suggesting the role of dysbiosis in tumor development.

Approximately one-third of the world's population is overweight or obese, and in the United States alone, obesity affects one in six children. Meta-analysis studies suggest that obesity increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer, and with poorer outcomes, especially in children. The contribution of obesity to cancer risk requires a better understanding of the association between obesity-induced metabolic changes and its impact on genomic instability, which is a major driving force of tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss how molecular changes during adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage. This represents one of the many critical steps connecting obesity and cancer since oxidative DNA lesions can result in cancer-associated genetic instability. In addition, the by-products of the oxidative degradation of lipids (e.g., malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and acrolein), and gut -mediated secondary bile  metabolites (e.g.,  and lithocholic ), can function as genotoxic agents and tumor promoters. We also discuss how obesity can impact DNA repair efficiency, potentially contributing to cancer initiation and progression. Finally, we outline obesity-related epigenetic changes and identify the gaps in knowledge to be addressed for the development of better therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862015>Secondary Bile Acids and Short Chain Fatty Acids in the Colon: A Focus on Colonic Microbiome, Cell Proliferation, Inflammation, and Cancer.</a></h2><p>Secondary bile acids (BAs) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), two major types of bacterial metabolites in the colon, cause opposing effects on colonic inflammation at chronically high physiological levels. Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed that there is a strong link between obesity and some common cancers. However, the exact molecular mechanisms linking obesity and cancer are not fully understood yet. Recently, we have reported that dietary or genetic obesity provokes alterations of gut  profile, thereby increasing the levels of  (DCA), a secondary bile  produced solely by the 7α-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids carried out by gut bacteria. The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes DNA damage and consequent cellular senescence in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which, in turn, secrete various inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Interestingly, signs of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, implying that a similar pathway is likely to contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well.

Klb-/- mice are refractory to beneficial action of pharmacological FGF21 treatment including stimulation of glucose utilization and thermogenesis. Here, we investigated the energy homeostasis in Klb-/- mice on high-fat diet in order to better understand the consequences of abrogating both endogenous FGF15/19 and FGF21 signaling during caloric overload. Surprisingly, Klb-/- mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO) owing to enhanced energy expenditure and BAT activity. Klb-/- mice exhibited not only an increase but also a shift in bile  (BA) composition featured by activation of the classical (neutral) BA synthesis pathway at the expense of the alternative (acidic) pathway. High hepatic production of cholic  (CA) results in a large excess of -derived  (DCA). DCA is specifically responsible for activating the TGR5 receptor that stimulates BAT thermogenic activity. In fact, combined gene deletion of Klb and Tgr5 or antibiotic treatment abrogating bacterial conversion of CA into DCA both abolish DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice. These results suggested that DIO resistance in Klb-/- mice is caused by high levels of DCA, signaling through the TGR5 receptor. These data also demonstrated that gut  can regulate host thermogenesis via conversion of primary into secondary BA.

The modulation of gut , bile acids and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) axis is correlated with obesity-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mice. However, the interactions among the gut , bile acids and FXR in metabolic disorders remained largely unexplored in hamsters. In the current study, hamsters fed a 60% high-fat diet (HFD) were administered vehicle or an antibiotic cocktail by gavage twice a week for four weeks. Antibiotic treatment alleviated HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation accompanied with decreased hepatic lipogenesis and elevated thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT). In the livers of antibiotic-treated hamsters, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily B member 1 (CYP7B1) in the alternative bile  synthesis pathway was upregulated, contributing to a more hydrophilic bile  profile with increased tauro--muricholic  (TMCA).

In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, controlled design trial, 11 healthy adults consumed for 5 days each a control diet (animal-based diet plus 30 g/day placebo powder) and a cranberry diet (animal-based diet plus 30 g/day freeze-dried whole cranberry powder). The animal-based diet included meats, dairy products, and simple sugars. Stool, urine, and blood samples were obtained before and after each intervention phase. As compared to the pre-control diet, control diet modified 46 taxonomic clades, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes. Moreover, it increased bacteria-derived  and decreased acetate and butyrate in stool. As compared to the post-intervention phase of control diet, the cranberry diet modified 9 taxonomic clades, including a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes. Further, the cranberry diet attenuated control diet-induced increase in secondary bile acids and decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and increased urinary anthocyanins and bacterially derived phenolic acids. No changes were found in fecal trimethylamine and plasma cytokines. In conclusion, an animal-based diet altered the  composition to a less favorable profile, increased carcinogenic bile acids, and decreased beneficial SCFA.

The decreased concentrations of chenodeoxycholic ,  and cholic  were significantly associated with dyslipidemia in ESRD patients. Subgroup analyses revealed that the significantly increased concentrations of taurocholic , taurochenodeoxycholic , taurohyocholic  and tauro α-muricholic  were correlated to the poor prognosis of ESRD patients.The serum bile  profile of ESRD patients differed significantly from that of healthy controls.

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes,  profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice.  transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

In vitro fermentation resulted in the formation of vaccenic  (C18:1t11, 32.1 ± 3.2 % FAME; fatty  methyl ester) and conjugated linoleic  (c9,t11 CLA, 2.4 ± 0.7 % FAME) exclusively in fermented walnut samples. Concentrations of secondary BA -/iso- (6.8-24.1-fold/4.9-10.9-fold, respectively) and levels of MDA (1.3-fold) were significantly reduced in fermented nut samples compared to the control.This is the first study that demonstrates the ability of the human fecal  to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids from walnuts to c9,t11 CLA as a potential chemopreventive metabolite. In addition, the production of butyrate and reduction in potential carcinogens such as secondary BA and lipid peroxidation products might contribute to the protective effects of nuts regarding colon cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555>Tauroursodeoxycholic  inhibits intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile -based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and  composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut  was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses, obesity and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut  composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal  composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29408609>-Derived Metabolic Factors Reduce Campylobacteriosis in Mice.</a></h2><p>Campylobacter jejuni, a prevalent foodborne bacterial pathogen, exploits the host innate response to induce colitis.

HFD was fed for 12 weeks. At the end of two-week HFD, FMT was carried out for two weeks. The gastrointestinal transit, serotonin concentration, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), and the levels of bile acids in intestinal contents were examined.Compared with the control group, the gastrointestinal transit and small intestinal serotonin concentration of HFD-fed rats were increased. In HFD-fed rats, TPH1 protein expression was increased significantly, while SERT protein expression was decreased, but not significant. The levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also significantly increased in HFD-fed rats compared with the control group. After HFD-fed rats receiving FMT treatment, the gastrointestinal transit, small intestinal serotonin concentration, and TPH1 expression were decreased, while SERT expression was not affected. Moreover, the levels of CA and DCA in intestinal contents were also decreased.FMT could alleviate small intestinal transit in the HFD-fed rats by regulating the serotonin biosynthesis.

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary fat content on BA profiles and associated gut , and their correlates with cardiometabolic risk factors.In a randomized controlled-feeding trial, healthy young adults were assigned to one of the three diets: a lower-fat diet (fat 20%, carbohydrate 66% and protein 14%), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30%, carbohydrate 56% and protein 14%) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40%, carbohydrate 46% and protein 14%) for 6 months. All the foods were provided during the entire intervention period. The BA profiles, associated gut  and markers of cardiometabolic risk factors were determined before and after intervention.The higher-fat diet resulted in an elevated concentration of total BAs (p < 0.001), and unconjugated BAs (p = 0.03) compared with lower-fat diet. Secondary BAs, such as  (DCA), taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA), 12ketolithocholic  (12keto-LCA), 3β-DCA and taurolithocholic  (TLCA) (p < 0.05 after FDR correction) were significantly increased in the higher-fat diet group after the 6-month intervention. Consistently, the abundances of gut bacteria (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) which affect bile salt hydrolase gene expression were significantly increased after higher-fat consumption. The change of DCA was positively associated with the relative abundance of Bacteroides (r = 0.31, p = 0.08 after FDR correction). In addition, the changes of fecal concentrations of DCA and 12keto-LCA were positively associated with serum total cholesterol (r > 0.3, p = 0.02 and p = 0.008 after FDR correction, respectively). In line with these findings, serum fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) was marginally significantly elevated in the higher-fat group after intervention (p = 0.05).The higher-fat diet resulted in an alteration of BAs, especially unconjugated BAs and secondary BAs, most likely through actions of gut .

Our primary aim was to examine how the host adapts to the stress of microbe-derived secondary BAs by P450-mediated oxidative modifications on the steroid nucleus. Five unconjugated tri-hydroxyl BAs that were structurally and/or biologically associated with deoxycholate (DCA) were determined in human biologic samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in combination with enzyme-digestion techniques. They were identified as DCA-19-ol, DCA-6-ol, DCA-5-ol, DCA-6-ol, DCA-1-ol, and DCA-4-ol based on matching in-laboratory synthesized standards. Metabolic inhibition assays in human liver microsomes and recombinant P450 assays revealed that CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 were responsible for the regioselective oxidations of both DCA and its conjugated forms, glycodeoxycholate (GDCA) and taurodeoxycholate (TDCA). The modification of secondary BAs to tertiary BAs defines a host liver (primary BAs)-gut  (secondary BAs)-host liver (tertiary BAs) axis. The regioselective oxidations of DCA, GDCA, and TDCA by CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 may help eliminate host-toxic DCA species.

First published March 30, 2017; doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00256.2016.-Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise a group of common and debilitating chronic intestinal disorders for which currently available therapies are often unsatisfactory. The naturally occurring secondary bile , ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), has well-established anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective actions and may therefore be effective in treating IBD. We aimed to investigate regulation of colonic inflammatory responses by UDCA and to determine the potential impact of bacterial metabolism on its therapeutic actions. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA, a nonmetabolizable analog, 6α-methyl-UDCA (6-MUDCA), and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic  (LCA) was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of mucosal injury. The effects of bile acids on cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, Il-1β, and IFN-γ) release from cultured colonic epithelial cells and mouse colonic tissue in vivo were investigated. Luminal bile acids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. UDCA attenuated release of proinflammatory cytokines from colonic epithelial cells in vitro and was protective against the development of colonic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, although 6-MUDCA mimicked the effects of UDCA on epithelial cytokine release in vitro, it was ineffective in preventing inflammation in the DSS model. In UDCA-treated mice, LCA became the most common colonic bile . Finally, LCA treatment more potently inhibited epithelial cytokine release and protected against DSS-induced mucosal inflammation than did UDCA. These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, LCA, in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions. On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, the secondary bile  ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) has well-established uses in both traditional and Western medicine. We identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA, lithocholic , as a potent inhibitor of intestinal inflammatory responses, and we present data to suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective effects against colonic inflammation.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30142907>Electrochemical Oxidation of Primary Bile Acids: A Tool for Simulating Their Oxidative Metabolism?</a></h2><p>Bile acids are a subgroup of sterols and important products of cholesterol catabolism in mammalian organisms. Modifications (e.g., oxidation and 7-dehydroxylation) are predominantly exerted by the intestinal . Bile acids can be found in almost all living organisms, and their concentration and metabolism can be used for the assessment of the pathological and nutritional status of an organism. Electrochemical oxidation is a rapid, relatively inexpensive approach to simulate natural metabolic redox processes in vitro. This technique further allows the identification of oxidative degradation pathways of individual substances, as well as the demonstration of binding studies of generated oxidation products with biologically relevant molecules. When coupling an electrochemical and a high-resolution mass spectrometric system, oxidation products can be generated and identified directly by non-targeted ESI-MS. Here, a method for the generation of oxidation products of the primary bile acids cholic  and chenodeoxycholic  was exemplarily developed. Most products and the highest intensities were observed at a pH value of 6. For cholic , a high potential of 3 V was necessary, while for chenodeoxycholic , a potential of 2.4 V led to a higher number of oxidation products. In a second approach, a binding study with glutathione was performed to simulate phase II metabolism. It was possible to detect signals of free glutathione, free bile acids, and adducts of both reactants. As the resulting mass spectra also showed some new signals of the oxidized bile , which could not be observed without glutathione, it can be assumed that glutathione is able to bind reactive oxidation species before reacting with other products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29688473>Detection of Gut Dysbiosis due to Reduced Clostridium Subcluster XIVa Using the Fecal or Serum Bile  Profile.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis, especially a reduced Clostridium subcluster XIVa (XIVa), has been reported in several gastrointestinal diseases. Since XIVa is thought to be the main bacterial cluster that metabolizes bile acids (BAs) in the human intestine, we hypothesized that the BA profile in feces, and possibly in serum, could be a convenient biomarker for intestinal XIVa activity.First, blood and feces were collected from 26 healthy controls and 20 patients with gastrointestinal diseases, and the relationships among fecal microbiomes and fecal and serum BA compositions were studied. Second, serum BA compositions of 30 healthy controls and the remission and exacerbation states of 14 Crohn's disease (CD) and 12 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were compared. Fecal microbiomes were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and BA compositions were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS.The highest positive correlation was observed between the fecal XIVa proportion and fecal unconjugated  (DCA)/(DCA+unconjugated cholic  [CA]) (r = 0.77, P < 0.0001) or serum DCA/(DCA+CA) (r = 0.52, P < 0.001). Diurnal variation in serum XIVa candidate markers also showed that DCA/(DCA+CA) was most stable and not affected by the contraction of the gallbladder. Serum DCA/(DCA+CA) was not significantly different between remission and exacerbation states in either CD or UC patients, but was significantly reduced in those in the remission state of CD and the remission and exacerbation states of UC compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05).Decreased XIVa exhibits a strong correlation with reduced intestinal BA metabolism. Fecal and serum DCA/(DCA+CA) could be useful surrogate markers for the intestinal proportion of XIVa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29922256> Modeling of Bile  Processing by the Human Fecal .</a></h2><p>Bile acids, the products of concerted host and gut bacterial metabolism, have important signaling functions within the mammalian metabolic system and a key role in digestion. Given the complexity of the mega-variate bacterial community residing in the gastrointestinal tract, studying associations between individual bacterial genera and bile  processing remains a challenge. Here, we present a novel  approach to determine the bacterial genera associated with the metabolism of different primary bile acids and their potential to contribute to inter-individual variation in this processing. Anaerobic, pH-controlled batch cultures were inoculated with human fecal  and treated with individual conjugated primary bile acids (500 μg/ml) to serve as the sole substrate for 24 h. Samples were collected throughout the experiment (0, 5, 10, and 24 h) and the bacterial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the bile  signatures were characterized using a targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) approach. Data fusion techniques were used to identify statistical bacterial-metabolic linkages. An increase in gut bacteria associated bile acids was observed over 24 h with variation in the rate of bile  metabolism across the volunteers ( = 7). Correlation analysis identified a significant association between the  genus and the deconjugation of glycine conjugated bile acids while the deconjugation of taurocholic  was associated with bacteria from the  and  genera.

Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut  alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations. Our study also showed a significantly increased cell proliferation in BA treated normal human hepatic cell lines and a down-regulated expression of tumor suppressor gene CEBPα in TCDCA treated HepG2 cell line, suggesting that several hydrophobic BAs may collaboratively promote liver carcinogenesis.© 2016 UICC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29726951>Walnut Consumption Alters the Gastrointestinal , Microbially Derived Secondary Bile Acids, and Health Markers in Healthy Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>Epidemiologic data suggest that diets rich in nuts have beneficial health effects, including reducing total and cause-specific mortality from cancer and heart disease.

Its pathogenesis remains largely unknown, although frequent concomitant IBD hints towards common factors underlying gut and bile duct inflammation. Considering the mounting evidence on the involvement of the intestinal  in initiating and determining IBD phenotype, we investigated intestinal  composition in patients with PSC.Stool samples were collected from 147 individuals (52 patients with PSC, 52 age, gender and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers, 13 UC and 30 patients with Crohn's disease). An independent validation cohort of 14 PSC and 14 matched controls was recruited. 16S rDNA sequencing of faecal DNA was performed (Illumina MiSeq).The  of patients with PSC was characterised by decreased  diversity, and a significant overrepresentation of Enterococcus (p=3.76e-05), Fusobacterium (p=3.76e-05) and Lactobacillus (p=0.0002) genera. This dysbiosis was present in patients with PSC with and without concomitant IBD and was distinct from IBD, and independent of treatment with ursodeoxycholic . A decision tree based on abundances of these three genera allowed reliable classification in the validation cohort. In particular, one operational taxonomic unit belonging to the Enterococcus genus was associated with increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (p=0.048), a marker of disease severity.We here present the first report of PSC-associated faecal dysbiosis, independent from IBD signatures, suggesting the intestinal  could be a contributing factor in PSC pathogenesis.

However, there are still some doubts about TCM because of the questionable TCM theories and unclear biological active compounds. In recent years, gut  has emerged as an important frontier to understand the development and progress of diseases. Together with this trend, an increasing number of studies have indicated that drug molecules can interact with gut  after oral administration. In this context, more and more studies pertaining to TCM have paid attention to gut  and have yield rich information for understanding TCM. After oral administration, TCM can interact with gut : (1) TCM can modulate the composition of gut ; (2) TCM can modulate the metabolism of gut ; (3) gut  can transform TCM compounds. During the interactions, two types of metabolites can be produced: gut  metabolites (of food and host origin) and gut  transformed TCM compounds. In this review, we summarized the interactions between TCM and gut , and the pharmacological effects and features of metabolites produced during interactions between TCM and gut . Then, focusing on gut  and metabolites, we summarized the aspects in which gut  has facilitated our understanding of TCM.

We investigated the long-term effects of the farnesoid X receptor agonist, obeticholic , on gut bacterial translocation, intestinal  composition, barrier integrity and inflammation in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis with ascites.Cirrhotic rats received a 2-week course of obeticholic  or vehicle starting once ascites developed. We then determined: bacterial translocation by mesenteric lymph node culture, ileum expression of antimicrobial peptides and tight junction proteins by qPCR, fecal albumin loss, enteric bacterial load and  composition by qPCR and pyrosequencing of ileum mucosa-attached contents, and intestinal inflammation by cytometry of the inflammatory infiltrate.Obeticholic  reduced bacterial translocation from 78.3% to 33.3% (p<0.01) and upregulated the expression of the farnesoid X receptor-associated gene small heterodimer partner. Treatment improved ileum expression of antimicrobial peptides, angiogenin-1 and alpha-5-defensin, tight junction proteins zonulin-1 and occludin, and reduced fecal albumin loss and liver fibrosis. Enteric bacterial load normalized, and the distinctive mucosal  of cirrhosis was reduced. Gut immune cell infiltration was reduced and inflammatory cytokine and Toll-like receptor 4 expression normalized.In ascitic cirrhotic rats, obeticholic  reduces gut bacterial translocation via several complementary mechanisms at the intestinal level.

In the current study, we aim to elucidate the roles of bile acids and their associations with gut  during obesity development, employing high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in a rat model. We collected feces and plasma, liver tissues, and segments of intestinal tissues and a developed bile acids quantification method by employing an ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-MS) strategy. We then assessed bile acids fluxes in the biological matrixes collected. We found that, irrespective of dietary regimes, taurine-conjugated bile acids were the dominant species in the liver whereas unconjugated bile acids were in plasma. However, HFD caused slight increases in the total bile acids pool and particularly the increases in the levels of  (DCA) (138.67 ± 37.225 nmol/L in control group, 242.61 ± 43.16 nmol/L in HFD group, p = 0.014) and taurodeoxycholic  (TDCA) (2.8 ± 0.247 nmol/g in control group, 4.5 ± 0.386 nmol/g in HFD group, p = 0.0018) in plasma and liver tissues, respectively, which were consistent with the increased levels of DCA in intestinal tissues and feces. These changes are correlated to an increase in abundance of genera Blautia, Coprococcus, Intestinimonas, Lactococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus. Our investigation revealed the fluxes of bile acids and their association with gut  during obesity development and explicated unfavorable impact of HFD on health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550982>The association between gut  development and maturation of intestinal bile  metabolism in the first 3 y of healthy Japanese infants.</a></h2><p>The gut microbial community greatly changes in early life, influencing infant health and subsequent host physiology, notably through its collective metabolism, including host- interplay of bile  (BA) metabolism. However, little is known regarding how the development of the intestinal microbial community is associated with maturation of intestinal BA metabolism. To address this, we monitored the succession of gut bacterial community and its association with fecal BA profile in the first 3 y of ten healthy Japanese infants. The BA profiles were classified into four types, defined by high content of conjugated primary BA (Con type), unconjugated primary BA (chenodeoxycholic  and cholic ) (Pri type), ursodeoxycholic  (Urs type), and  and lithocholic  (Sec type). Most subjects begun with Con type or Pri type profiles during lactation and eventually transited to Sec type through Urs type after the start of solid food intake. Con type and Pri type were associated with -dominant  corresponding to the neonatal type or -dominant  corresponding to lactation type, respectively. Urs type subjects were strongly associated with  colonization, mostly occurring between Pri type and Sec type. Sec type was associated with adult-type complex  dominated by a variety of  and  species. Addressing the link of the common developmental passage of intestinal BA metabolism with infant's health and subsequent host physiology requires further study.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608185>Bile acids regulate intestinal cell proliferation by modulating EGFR and FXR signaling.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are synthesized in the liver and secreted into the intestine. In the lumen, enteric bacteria metabolize BAs from conjugated, primary forms into more toxic unconjugated, secondary metabolites. Secondary BAs can be injurious to the intestine and may contribute to disease. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are known to interact with BAs. In this study we examined the effects of BAs on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and investigated the possible roles for EGFR and FXR in these effects. We report that taurine-conjugated cholic  (TCA) induced proliferation, while its unconjugated secondary counterpart  (DCA) inhibited proliferation. TCA stimulated phosphorylation of Src, EGFR, and ERK 1/2. Pharmacological blockade of any of these pathways or genetic ablation of EGFR abrogated TCA-stimulated proliferation. Interestingly, Src or EGFR inhibitors eliminated TCA-induced phosphorylation of both molecules, suggesting that their activation is interdependent. In contrast to TCA, DCA exposure diminished EGFR phosphorylation, and pharmacological or siRNA blockade of FXR abolished DCA-induced inhibition of proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that TCA induces intestinal cell proliferation via Src, EGFR, and ERK activation. In contrast, DCA inhibits proliferation via an FXR-dependent mechanism that may include downstream inactivation of the EGFR/Src/ERK pathway. Since elevated secondary BA levels are the result of specific bacterial modification, this may provide a mechanism through which an altered  contributes to normal or abnormal intestinal epithelial cell proliferation.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279683>Dietary Bile Salt Types Influence the Composition of Biliary Bile Acids and Gut  in Grass Carp.</a></h2><p>Lipid metabolism can influence host's health. There is increasing evidence for interplay between two key regulating factors in lipid metabolism: bile acids (BAs) and gut . However, very little is known about how types of different diet-supplemented bile salts (BS) influence this interaction . We sought to explore these relationships using grass carp (), which often suffers functional disorder of liver and gallbladder. We studied fluctuations of BAs in the gall and changes of microbial communities in the gut in response to seven different diets: five different BS, chelating BS agent, and control. The BS comprised two primary BS [sodium taurochololate (TCAS) and sodium taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDCAS)], sodium tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCAS), and two secondary BS [sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDCAS) and sodium taurolithocholate (TLCAS)]. Supplementation of primary BS caused a more significant fluctuation of biliary BAs than secondary BS, and TCAS caused a more prominent increase than TCDCAS and TUDCAS. For the gut , primary BS tended to increase their diversity and induce community succession, secondary BS resulted in a higher firmicutes/bacteroidetes ratio, while TUDCAS had no significant effects. Changes of the gut  triggered by different types of BS caused alteration in BAs biotransformation. Two-obesity-associated families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were positively correlated with biliary cholic  (CA), taurochenodeoxycholic  (TCDCA), and  (DCA). As both primary and secondary BS resulted in increased synthesis of toxic secondary Bas by the gut , future studies should pay closer attention to gut  when considering BA treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30483776>Roles of the inflammasome in the gut‑liver axis (Review).</a></h2><p>The gut‑liver axis connects the liver with the intestine via bile  metabolism. Bile  dysregulation leads to intestinal dysbiosis, that allows enterogenous pathogenic bacteria, including Gram‑negative bacteria and their products lipopolysaccharide (LPS), into the liver via the portal vein, triggering inflammation in the liver. The inflammasome serves as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects pathogens or danger signals and mediates innate immunity in the liver or gut. Specifically, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains‑containing protein (NLRP)6 inflammasome maintains intestinal microbial balance, by promoting interleukin (IL)‑18‑dependent antimicrobial peptide synthesis and mucus secretion from goblet cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome, in contrast, primarily induces IL‑1β and aggravates inflammatory liver injury. Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflammasome affects the epithelial integrity of cholangiocytes by inducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines. In addition, bile acids, including  and chenodeoxycholic , are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages; however, bile acids have the potential to exert the opposite role by interacting with the membrane‑bound Takeda G‑protein receptor 5 or by activating nuclear farnesoid‑X receptor. Therefore, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammasome, involved in the gut‑liver axis, may provide important insights into the identification of a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of liver and gut diseases. The present review discusses the roles of the inflammasome in the gut‑liver axis, and the emerging associations between the inflammasome and the intestinal  or the bile acids in the gut‑liver axis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25677572>Binding of bile acids by pastry products containing bioactive substances during in vitro digestion.</a></h2><p>The modern day consumer tends to choose products with health enhancing properties, enriched in bioactive substances. One such bioactive food component is dietary fibre, which shows a number of physiological properties including the binding of bile acids. Dietary fibre should be contained in everyday, easily accessible food products. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine sorption capacities of primary bile  (cholic  - CA) and secondary bile acids ( - DCA and lithocholic acids - LCA) by muffins (BM) and cookies (BC) with bioactive substances and control muffins (CM) and cookies (CC) in two sections of the in vitro gastrointestinal tract. Variations in gut flora were also analysed in the process of in vitro digestion of pastry products in a bioreactor. Enzymes: pepsin, pancreatin and bile salts: cholic ,  and lithocholic  were added to the culture. Faecal bacteria, isolated from human large intestine, were added in the section of large intestine. The influence of dietary fibre content in cookies and concentration of bile acids in two stages of digestion were analysed. Generally, pastry goods with bioactive substances were characterized by a higher content of total fibre compared with the control samples. These products also differ in the profile of dietary fibre fractions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the bile  profile after two stages of digestion depends on the quality and quantity of fibre. The bile  profile after digestion of BM and BC forms one cluster, and with the CM and CC forms a separate cluster. High concentration of H (hemicellulose) is positively correlated with LCA (low binding effect) and negatively correlated with CA and DCA contents. The relative content of bile acids in the second stage of digestion was in some cases above the content in the control sample, particularly LCA. This means that the bacteria introduced in the 2nd stage of digestion synthesize the LCA.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874313>New therapeutic perspectives in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is focused on restitution of metabolic derangement, weight loss and drugs able to improve steatosis, ballooning and fibrosis.
