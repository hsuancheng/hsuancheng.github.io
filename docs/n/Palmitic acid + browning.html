<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26213005>Effects of roasting temperature and duration on fatty  composition, phenolic composition, Maillard reaction degree and antioxidant attribute of almond (Prunus dulcis) kernel.</a></h2><p>Roasting treatment increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, oleic and elaidic acids) as well as saturated fatty acids ( and stearic acids) in almond (Prunus dulcis) kernel oils with temperature (150 or 180 °C) and duration (5, 10 or 20 min). Nonetheless, higher temperature (200 °C) and longer duration (10 or 20 min) roasting might result in breakdown of fatty acids especially for unsaturated fatty acids. Phenolic components (total phenols, flavonoids, condensed tannins and phenolic acids) of almond kernels substantially lost in the initial phase; afterward these components gradually increased with roasting temperature and duration. Similar results also observed for their antioxidant activities (scavenging DPPH and ABTS(+) radicals and ferric reducing power). The changes of phenolic  and flavonoid compositions were also determined by HPLC. Maillard reaction products (estimated with non-enzymatic browning index) also increased with roasting temperature and duration; they might also contribute to enhancing the antioxidant attributes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Activation of G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) can promote the browning of white . 9-PAHSA, an endogenous mammalian , which is acting as the ligand of GPR120 to enhance glucose uptake and exert anti-inflammatory effect. In the study, we would like to investigate the biological effects of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning. Here, we show that 9-PAHSA induces browning of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via enhanced expression of brown  specific genes. 9-PAHSA-induced browning in white adipocytes of WT mice and ob/ob mice was investigated by determining expression levels of brown adipocyte-specific genes/proteins by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunoblot analysis and immunochemical staining. The effects of 9-PAHSA on brown  markers in 3T3-L1 cells were decreased when GPR120 gene was silenced. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 9-PAHSA on adipocyte browning, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model was conducted. 9-PAHSA treatment abolished LPS-induced NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. But these anti-inflammatory effects of 9-PAHSA were attenuated by GPR120 knockdown. Our finding demonstrated that the browning of adipocyte was induced by 9-PAHSA through activating GPR120 and inhibiting the LPS/NF-κB pathway. This promising result will help to reveal the potential pathogenesis of obesity.Copyright © 2018.

Recently, it was reported that irisin serum levels are associated with intrahepatic triglyceride content, suggesting that it might have an important role in the liver. The aim of this study was to determine the role of irisin in hepatocytes. Specifically, the effect of recombinant irisin on  (PA)-induced lipogenesis and its related signal pathways were examined in AML12 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. In the present study, we observed the presence of irisin inside the cells in response to the treatment of recombinant irisin by flow cytometry and cell imaging technique. Recombinant irisin significantly inhibited the PA-induced increase in lipogenic markers ACC and FAS at the mRNA and protein levels, and prevented the PA-induced  accumulation in hepatocytes. Additionally, irisin inhibited the PA-induced increase in the expression, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activities of the master regulators of lipogenesis (LXRα and SREBP-1c). Moreover, irisin attenuated PA-induced oxidative stress, which was confirmed by measuring the expression of inflammatory markers (NFκB, COX-2, p38 MAPK, TNF, IL-6) and superoxide indicator (dihydroethidium). The preventive effects of irisin against lipogenesis and oxidative stress were mediated by the inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase-3 (PRMT3). These findings suggested that irisin might have a beneficial role in the prevention of hepatic steatosis by altering the expression of lipogenic genes and attenuating oxidative stress in a PRMT3 dependent manner.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Emerging evidence indicates that the crosstalk between adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is critical in maintaining insulin sensitivity and lipid homeostasis. The current study was designed to investigate whether myricanol improves insulin sensitivity and alleviates adiposity through modulating skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk.The therapeutic effect of myricanol was evaluated on  (PA)-treated C2C12 myotubes and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The crosstalk between myotubes and adipocytes was evaluated using Transwell assay. The cellular lipid content was examined by Nile red staining. The mitochondrial content was assessed by MitoTracker Green staining and citrate synthase activity, and the mitochondrial function was examined by Seahorse assay. Expression of mitochondria-related and insulin signalling pathway proteins was analysed by Western blot, and the irisin level was determined by elisa kit.Myricanol increased mitochondrial quantity and function through activating AMP-activated protein kinase, resulting in reduced lipid accumulation and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, in PA-treated C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, myricanol stimulated irisin production and secretion from myotubes to reduce lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In HFD-fed mice, myricanol treatment alleviated adiposity and insulin resistance through enhancing lipid utilization and irisin production in skeletal muscle and inducing  of inguinal fat.Myricanol modulates skeletal muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk, to stimulate  of adipose tissue and improve insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Myricanol might be a potential candidate for treating insulin resistance and obesity.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: browning</p></html>
