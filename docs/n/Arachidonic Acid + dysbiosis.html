<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22970191>Analysis of candidate colitis genes in the Gdac1 locus of mice deficient in glutathione peroxidase-1 and -2.</a></h2><p>Mice that are deficient for glutathione peroxidases 1 and 2 (GPX) show large variations in the penetrance and severity of colitis in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ backgrounds. We mapped a locus contributing to this difference to distal chromosome 2 (∼119-133 mbp) and named it glutathione peroxidase-deficiency-associated colitis 1 (Gdac1). The aim of this study was to identify the best gene candidates within the Gdac1 locus contributing to the murine colitis phenotype.We refined the boundaries of Gdac1 to 118-125 mbp (95% confidence interval) by increasing sample size and marker density across the interval. The narrowed region contains 128 well-annotated protein coding genes but it excludes Fermt1, a human inflammatory bowel disease candidate that was within the original boundaries of Gdac1. The locus we identified may be the Cdcs3 locus mapped by others studying IL10-knockout mice. Using in silico analysis of the 128 genes, based on published colon expression data, the relevance of pathways to colitis, gene mutations, presence of non-synonymous-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and whether the nsSNPs are predicted to have an impact on protein function or expression, we excluded 42 genes. Based on a similar analysis, twenty-five genes from the remaining 86 genes were analyzed for expression-quantitative-trait loci, and another 15 genes were excluded.Among the remaining 10 genes, we identified Pla2g4f and Duox2 as the most likely colitis gene candidates, because GPX metabolizes PLA2G4F and DUOX2 products. Pla2g4f is a phospholipase A2 that has three potentially significant nsSNP variants and showed expression differences across mouse strains. PLA2G4F produces , which is a substrate for lipoxygenases and, in turn, for GPXs. DUOX2 produces H(2)O(2) and may control microbial populations. DUOX-1 and -2 control microbial populations in mammalian lung and in the gut of several insects and zebrafish. Dysbiosis is a phenotype that differentiates 129S1/SvImJ from C57BL/6J and may be due to strain differences in DUOX2 activity.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30186272>Butyrate Protects Mice Against Methionine-Choline-Deficient Diet-Induced Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis by Improving Gut Barrier Function, Attenuating Inflammation and Reducing Endotoxin Levels.</a></h2><p>Butyrate exerts protective effects against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut  and metabolism in NASH development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , oleic , linoleic , squalene, and , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut  and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against NASH development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate. This study thus provides new insights into NASH prevention.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513935>Dysbiotic Subgingival Microbial Communities in Periodontally Healthy Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>Studies that demonstrate an association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and dysbiotic oral microbiomes are often confounded by the presence of extensive periodontitis in these individuals. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of RA in modulating the periodontal microbiome by comparing periodontally healthy individuals with RA to those without RA.Subgingival plaque was collected from periodontally healthy individuals (22 with RA and 19 without RA), and the 16S gene was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial biodiversity and co-occurrence patterns were examined using the QIIME and PhyloToAST pipelines.The subgingival microbiomes differed significantly between patients with RA and controls based on both community membership and the abundance of lineages, with 41.9% of the community differing in abundance and 19% in membership. In contrast to the sparse and predominantly congeneric co-occurrence networks seen in controls, RA patients revealed a highly connected grid containing a large intergeneric hub anchored by known periodontal pathogens. Predictive metagenomic analysis (PICRUSt) demonstrated that  and ester lipid metabolism pathways might partly explain the robustness of this clustering. As expected from a periodontally healthy cohort, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were not significantly different between groups; however, Cryptobacterium curtum, another organism capable of producing large amounts of citrulline, emerged as a robust discriminant of the microbiome in individuals with RA.Our data demonstrate that the oral microbiome in RA is enriched for inflammophilic and citrulline-producing organisms, which may play a role in the production of autoantigenic citrullinated peptides in RA.© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556989>Gut  and host metabolism in liver cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>The gut  has the capacity to produce a diverse range of compounds that play a major role in regulating the activity of distal organs and the liver is strategically positioned downstream of the gut. Gut  linked compounds such as short chain fatty acids, bile acids, choline metabolites, indole derivatives, vitamins, polyamines, lipids, neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones have many biological functions. This review focuses on the gut  and host metabolism in liver cirrhosis. Dysbiosis in liver cirrhosis causes serious complications, such as bacteremia and hepatic encephalopathy, accompanied by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability. Gut dysbiosis in cirrhosis and intervention with probiotics and synbiotics in a clinical setting is reviewed and evaluated. Recent studies have revealed the relationship between gut  and host metabolism in chronic metabolic liver disease, especially, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, and with the gut  metabolic interactions in dysbiosis related metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Recently, our understanding of the relationship between the gut and liver and how this regulates systemic metabolic changes in liver cirrhosis has increased. The serum lipid levels of phospholipids, free fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially, eicosapentaenoic , , and docosahexaenoic  have significant correlations with specific fecal flora in liver cirrhosis. Many clinical and experimental reports support the relationship between fatty  metabolism and gut-. Various blood metabolome such as cytokines, amino acids, and vitamins are correlated with gut  in probiotics-treated liver cirrhosis patients. The future evaluation of the gut--liver metabolic network and the intervention of these relationships using probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics, with sufficient nutrition could aid the development of treatments and prevention for liver cirrhosis patients.</p><p>Keyword: dysbiosis</p></html>
