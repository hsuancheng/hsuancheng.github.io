An experiment was conducted to analyze the serum concentrations (SC) of free AA in pigs exposed to diurnal variations in AT. Six pigs (27.1 ±1.3kg ) implanted with a thermometer to register the  temperature (BT) at 15-min intervals were used. Blood samples were collected on the last 3 d of the 14-d study, at 0700h (lowest AT), 1200h (mild HS), and 1600h (severe HS). The pigs received 1.2kg/d of an AA-supplemented, wheat-soybean meal diet, in two equal meals (0700 and 1900h). The AT and BT, recorded at 0700, 1200, and 1600h was: 30.6, 38.6, 41.1°C, and 38.2, 39.5, 40.3°C, respectively. The BT was significantly correlated (P < 0.001) with the AT. The SC (μM/mL) of Ile, , Met, Val, Ala, , and Pro were higher (P ≤ 0.01); Arg, Phe, , and  tended to be higher (P ≤ 0.10); but Cys was lower (P < 0.05) at 1200h than at 0700h.  was higher, Cys and  were lower (P < 0.05), and Ile and Val tended to be higher (P ≤ 0.10) at 1600h than at 0700h. Serum Arg, Ile, Phe, Ala, , Gln, Pro, Ser, and  were lower (P < 0.05), and Leu and Val tended to be lower at 1600h than at 1200h. These data demonstrate that AT directly alters the BT of pigs, and that diurnal variations in AT differently affect their SC and availability of AA for growth.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Human platelet factor 4 consists of identical subunits containing 70 amino acids, each with a molecular  of 7,756. The molecule contains no methionine, phenylalanine or tryptophan. The proposed amino acid sequence of PF4 is: -Ala---Asp-Gly-Asp-Leu-Gln-Cys-Leu-Cys-Val--Thr-Thr-Ser- Gln-Val-Arg-Pro-Arg-His-Ile-Thr-Ser-Leu--Val-Ile--Ala-Gly-Pro-His-Cys-Pro-Thr-Ala-Gin- Leu-Ile-Ala-Thr-Leu---Gly-Arg--Ile-Cys-Leu-Asp-Leu-Gln-Ala-Pro-Leu---- Ile-Ile---Leu-Leu--Ser. From consideration of the homology with p-thromboglobulin, disulphide bonds between residues 10 and 36 and between residues 12 and 52 can be inferred.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26506550>Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages.</a></h2><p>Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤ 6d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular  (MW) ≤ 3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), --Asp--Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg--Leu (VRYL), -Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro- (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.Copyright © 2016 American Dairy Science Association.
