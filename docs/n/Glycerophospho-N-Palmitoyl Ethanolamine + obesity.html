Prefilled epinephrine auto-injectors are designed for simplicity of use and safety. Auto-injectors are primarily used by patients in an unsupervised setting in cases of anaphylaxis. There are weight-appropriate doses of epinephrine available with auto-injectors that are prefilled, to prevent dosing errors, with 0.15, 0.30, and 0.50 mg amounts. In addition, needle lengths vary from 1.17 to 2.50 cm. The recommended needle lengths differ between adults and pediatric patients. In addition, the needle lengths differ between devices as well. There are concerns that the needle length may be too short in select obese patients. Yet, there are also concerns that the needle length may be too long in some patients. Factors that affect the depth of the injection, and therefore the pharmacokinetics of the drug, include not only the needle length but also the BMI, , compression of soft tissue, and propulsion.Epinephrine auto-injectors have different needle lengths. Using the right device with appropriate needle length based on BMI, , and employing the proper technique can improve the outcome in an anaphylactic event.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26653760>Intermittent Fasting Promotes Fat Loss With Lean Mass Retention, Increased Hypothalamic Norepinephrine Content, and Increased Neuropeptide Y Gene Expression in Diet-Induced Obese Male Mice.</a></h2><p>Clinical studies indicate alternate-day, intermittent fasting (IMF) protocols result in meaningful weight loss in obese individuals. To further understand the mechanisms sustaining weight loss by IMF, we investigated the metabolic and neural alterations of IMF in obese mice. Male C57/BL6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat) ad libitum for 8 weeks to promote an obese phenotype. Mice were divided into four groups and either maintained on ad libitum HFD, received alternate-day access to HFD (IMF-HFD), and switched to ad libitum low-fat diet (LFD; 10% fat) or received IMF of LFD (IMF-LFD). After 4 weeks, IMF-HFD (∼13%) and IMF-LFD (∼18%) had significantly lower body weights than the HFD. Body fat was also lower (∼40%-52%) in all diet interventions. Lean mass was increased in the IMF-LFD (∼12%-13%) compared with the HFD and IMF-HFD groups. Oral glucose tolerance area under the curve was lower in the IMF-HFD (∼50%), whereas the insulin tolerance area under the curve was reduced in all diet interventions (∼22%-42%). HPLC measurements of hypothalamic tissue homogenates indicated higher (∼55%-60%) norepinephrine (NE) content in the anterior regions of the medial hypothalamus of IMF compared with the ad libitum-fed groups, whereas NE content was higher (∼19%-32%) in posterior regions in the IMF-LFD group only. Relative gene expression of Npy in the arcuate nucleus was increased (∼65%-75%) in IMF groups. Our novel findings indicate that intermittent fasting produces alterations in hypothalamic NE and neuropeptide Y, suggesting the counterregulatory processes of short-term weight loss are associated with an IMF dietary strategy.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590214>Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with insulin clearance in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Impaired insulin clearance contributes to the hyperinsulinemia of , yet relatively little is known concerning the pathophysiological determinants of insulin clearance in obese populations.To examine the cross-sectional relationship between insulin clearance and resting sympathetic nervous system activity in a cohort of obese subjects with metabolic syndrome.Unmedicated, nonsmoking subjects (31 male, 27 female; aged 56 ± 1 year; body mass index 33.7 ± 0.6 kg/m(2)) underwent euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine insulin sensitivity (M) and insulin clearance, assessment of norepinephrine kinetics, peripheral arterial tonometry, Doppler echocardiography, and oral glucose tolerance test.Univariate correlation analyses showed inverse associations between insulin clearance and arterial norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.44, P = .0006), calculated norepinephrine spillover rate (r = -0.33, P = .01), augmentation index (AI, r = -0.37, P = .005), and positive associations with M (r = 0.30, P = .02), Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (r = 0.27, P = .04), and cardiac output (r = 0.27, P = .04). Insulin clearance and sensitivity did not differ between genders, however females had higher AI compared to males (35 ± 3% versus 14 ± 2%, P < .001). In age and gender adjusted stepwise regression analyses, arterial norepinephrine concentration alone explained 19% of the variance in insulin clearance. When all significant variables were entered into the regression model, arterial norepinephrine, AI, gender, and M were independent predictors of insulin clearance, together explaining 41% of the variance.Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with whole-body insulin clearance rate in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome. Prospective studies are needed to determine the direction of causality and the chronology of interactions between insulin clearance and sympathetic neural activity.ClinicalTrials.gov  .</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256679>Improved glucose homeostasis in male obese Zucker rats coincides with enhanced baroreflexes and activation of the nucleus tractus solitarius.</a></h2><p>Young adult male obese Zucker rats (OZR) develop insulin resistance and hypertension with impaired baroreflex-mediated bradycardia and activation of nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but insulin was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28414329>Alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize catecholamines or contribute to adipose tissue adaptive thermogenesis.</a></h2><p>Adaptive thermogenesis is the process of heat generation in response to cold stimulation. It is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, whose chief effector is the catecholamine norepinephrine (NE). NE enhances thermogenesis through β3-adrenergic receptors to activate brown adipose tissue and by 'browning' white adipose tissue. Recent studies have reported that alternative activation of macrophages in response to interleukin (IL)-4 stimulation induces the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway, and that this activation provides an alternative source of locally produced catecholamines during the thermogenic process. Here we report that the deletion of Th in hematopoietic cells of adult mice neither alters energy expenditure upon cold exposure nor reduces browning in inguinal adipose tissue. Bone marrow-derived macrophages did not release NE in response to stimulation with IL-4, and conditioned media from IL-4-stimulated macrophages failed to induce expression of thermogenic genes, such as uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), in adipocytes cultured with the conditioned media. Furthermore, chronic treatment with IL-4 failed to increase energy expenditure in wild-type, Ucp1 and interleukin-4 receptor-α double-negative (Il4ra) mice. In agreement with these findings, adipose-tissue-resident macrophages did not express TH. Thus, we conclude that alternatively activated macrophages do not synthesize relevant amounts of catecholamines, and hence, are not likely to have a direct role in adipocyte metabolism or adaptive thermogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30283093>Evaluation of Hypoglycaemia with Non-Invasive Sensors in People with Type 1 Diabetes and Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycaemia.</a></h2><p>People with type 1 diabetes and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) are prone to severe hypoglycaemia. Previous attempts to develop non-invasive hypoglycaemia alarm systems have shown promising results, but it is not known if such alarms can detect severe hypoglycaemia in people with IAH. We aimed to explore whether a combination of non-invasive sensors could reliably evaluate hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose (PG) minimum 2.5 mmol/L) in people with IAH. Twenty participants with type 1 diabetes and IAH underwent randomly ordered, single blinded hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemic clamps. Sweating, skin temperature, ECG, counterregulatory hormones and symptoms of hypoglycaemia were assessed. Overall, we were not able to detect clamp-induced hypoglycaemia with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for further clinical use. As a post-hoc analysis, we stratified participants according to their ability to identify hypoglycaemic symptoms during hypoglycaemic clamps. Five out of 20 participants could identify such symptoms. These participants had a significantly higher adrenaline response to hypoglycaemia (p < 0.001) and were reliably identified by sensors. Based on our observations, a non-invasive alarm system based on measurement of sweating responses and ECG changes during hypoglycaemia might provide an alert at a plasma glucose concentration around 2.5 mmol/L if an adequate sympatho-adrenal reaction is elicited.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556104>Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β suppresses cold-induced thermogenesis in adipocytes.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a typical proinflammatory cytokine on the β-adrenoreceptor-stimulated induction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression in adipocytes. IL-1β mRNA expression levels were upregulated in white adipose tissues of obese mice and in RAW264.7 macrophages under conditions designed to mimic obese adipose tissue. Isoproterenol-stimulated induction of UCP1 mRNA expression was significantly inhibited in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes by conditioned medium from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in comparison with control conditioned medium. This inhibition was significantly attenuated in the presence of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-1β antibody, suggesting that activated macrophage-derived IL-1β is an important cytokine for inhibition of β-adrenoreceptor-stimulated UCP1 induction in adipocytes. IL-1β suppressed isoproterenol-induced UCP1 mRNA expression in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes, and this effect was partially but significantly abrogated by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). IL-1β also suppressed the isoproterenol-induced activation of the UCP1 promoter and transcription factors binding to the cAMP response element. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of IL-1β suppressed cold-induced UCP1 expression in adipose tissues. These findings suggest that IL-1β upregulated in obese adipose tissues suppresses β-adrenoreceptor-stimulated induction of UCP1 expression through ERK activation in adipocytes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, patients with cirrhosis have increased bacteremia, increased blood levels of lipopolysaccharide, and increased intestinal permeability. Patients with cirrhosis have bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. Selective intestinal decontamination with antibiotics is beneficial for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In experimental models of chronic liver injury with fibrosis, several toll-like receptors (TLR) are required to make mice sensitive to liver fibrosis. The presumed ligand for the TLRs are bacterial products derived from the gut microbiome, and TLR knockout mice are resistant to liver inflammation and fibrosis. We and others have characterized the association between preclinical models of liver disease in mice with the microbial diversity in their gut microbiome. In each model, including intragastric alcohol, bile duct ligation, chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), administration, and genetic , there is a significant change in the gut microbiome from normal control mice. However, there is not a single clear bacterial strain or pattern that distinguish mice with liver injury from controlled mice. So how can the gut microbiota affect liver disease? We can identify at least 6 changes that would result in liver injury, inflammation, and/or fibrosis. These include: (1) changes in caloric yield of diet; (2) regulation of gut permeability to release bacterial products; (3) modulation of choline metabolism; (4) production of endogenous ethanol; (5) regulation of bile acid metabolism; and (6) regulation in lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126873>Dual role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in the progression and reversion of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and . We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).NASH features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with NASH, and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited NASH, NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced NASH. Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted NASH compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during NASH only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In NASH patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in NASH progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The effect of prolonged caloric restriction on ECs in relation to fat distribution and cardiac function is still unknown. Therefore, our aim was to investigate this relationship in obese T2D patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).In a prospective intervention study, obese T2D patients with CAD (n = 27) followed a 16 week very low calorie diet (VLCD; 450-1000 kcal/day). Cardiac function and fat accumulation were assessed with MRI and spectroscopy. Plasma levels of lipid species, including ECs, were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.VLCD decreased plasma levels of virtually all measured lipid species of the class of N-acylethanolamines including the EC anandamide (AEA; -15%, p = 0.016), without decreasing monoacylglycerols including the EC 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Baseline plasma AEA levels strongly correlated with the volume of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT; R = 0.44, p < 0.001). VLCD decreased the volume of SAT (-53%, p < 0.001), visceral white adipose tissue (VAT) (-52%, p < 0.001), epicardial white adipose tissue (-15%, p < 0.001) and paracardial white adipose tissue (-28%, p < 0.001). VLCD also decreased hepatic (-86%, p < 0.001) and myocardial (-33%, p < 0.001) fat content. These effects were accompanied by an increased left ventricular ejection fraction (54.8 ± 8.7-56.2 ± 7.9%, p = 0.016).Caloric restriction in T2D patients with CAD decreases AEA levels, but not 2-AG levels, which is paralleled by decreased lipid accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and heart, and improved cardiovascular function. Interestingly, baseline AEA levels strongly correlated with SAT volume. We anticipate that dietary interventions are worthwhile strategies in advanced T2D, and that reduction in AEA may contribute to the improved cardiometabolic phenotype induced by weight loss.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26049402>Contribution of brown adipose tissue activity to the control of energy balance by GLP-1 receptor signalling in mice.</a></h2><p>We assessed the contribution of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) signalling to thermogenesis induced by high-fat diet (HFD) consumption. Furthermore, we determined whether brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity contributes to weight loss induced by chronic subcutaneous treatment with the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, in a model of diet-induced .Metabolic phenotyping was performed using indirect calorimetry in wild-type (WT) and Glp1r-knockout (KO) mice during chow and HFD feeding at room temperature and at thermoneutrality. In a separate study, we investigated the contribution of BAT thermogenic capacity to the weight lowering effect induced by GLP-1 mimetics by administering liraglutide (10 or 30 nmol kg(-1) day(-1) s.c.) to diet-induced obese (DIO) mice for 6 or 4 weeks, respectively. In both studies, animals were subjected to a noradrenaline (norepinephrine)-stimulated oxygen consumption [Formula: see text] test.At thermoneutrality, HFD-fed Glp1r-KO mice had similar energy expenditure (EE) compared with HFD-fed WT controls. However, HFD-fed Glp1r-KO mice exhibited relatively less EE when housed at a cooler standard room temperature, and had relatively lower [Formula: see text] in response to a noradrenaline challenge, which is consistent with impaired BAT thermogenic capacity. In contrast to the loss of function model, chronic peripheral liraglutide treatment did not increase BAT activity as determined by noradrenaline-stimulated [Formula: see text] and BAT gene expression.These data suggest that although endogenous GLP-1R signalling contributes to increased BAT thermogenesis, this mechanism does not play a significant role in the food intake-independent body weight lowering effect of the GLP-1 mimetic liraglutide in DIO mice.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29172946>Postprandial gut microbiota-driven choline metabolism links dietary cues to adipose tissue dysfunction.</a></h2><p>The human body is an integrated circuit between microbial symbionts and our Homo sapien genome, which communicate bi-directionally to maintain homeostasis within the human meta-organism. There is now strong evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of  and associated cardiometabolic disorders. In fact, gut microbes represent a filter of our greatest environmental exposure - the foods we consume. It is now clear that we each experience a given meal differently, based on our unique gut microbial communities. Biologically active gut microbe-derived metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), are now uniquely recognized as contributors to  and related cardiometabolic disorders. However, mechanistic insights into how microbe-derived metabolites promote  are largely unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that the meta-organismal production of the bacterial co-metabolite TMAO is linked to suppression of beiging of white adipose tissue in mice and humans. Furthermore, the TMAO pathway is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target in -associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease.

Here we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of choline supplementation on metabolically altered Pcyt2(+/-) mice. In Pcyt2(+/-) mice, the membrane phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) turnover is reduced and the formation of fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides (TAG) increased, resulting in hypertriglyceridemia, liver steatosis and . One month of choline supplementation reduced the incorporation of FA into TAG and facilitated TAG degradation in Pcyt2(+/-) adipocytes, plasma and liver. Choline particularly stimulated adipocyte and liver TAG lipolysis by specific lipases (ATGL, LPL and HSL) and inhibited TAG formation by DGAT1 and DGAT2. Choline also activated the liver AMPK and mitochondrial FA oxidation gene PPARα and reduced the FA synthesis genes SREBP1, SCD1 and FAS. Liver (HPLC) and plasma (tandem mass spectroscopy and (1)H-NMR) metabolite profiling established that Pcyt2(+/-) mice have reduced membrane cholesterol/sphingomyelin ratio and the homocysteine/methionine cycle that were improved by choline supplementation.

Here we identify sympathetic neuron-associated macrophages (SAMs) as a population of cells that mediate clearance of NE via expression of solute carrier family 6 member 2 (SLC6A2), an NE transporter, and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a degradation enzyme. Optogenetic activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) upregulates NE uptake by SAMs and shifts the SAM profile to a more proinflammatory state. NE uptake by SAMs is prevented by genetic deletion of Slc6a2 or inhibition of the encoded transporter. We also observed an increased proportion of SAMs in the SNS of two mouse models of . Genetic ablation of Slc6a2 in SAMs increases brown adipose tissue (BAT) content, causes browning of white fat, increases thermogenesis, and leads to substantial and sustained weight loss in obese mice. We further show that this pathway is conserved, as human sympathetic ganglia also contain SAMs expressing the analogous molecular machinery for NE clearance, which thus constitutes a potential target for  treatment.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359371>N-substituted phenylbenzamides of the niclosamide chemotype attenuate  related changes in high fat diet fed mice.</a></h2><p> and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced  characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible.

After accounting for BMI, HOMA-IR, systolic BP, age, gender, and correction for multiple comparisons, these associations were significant (p < 0.05): NE with ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine and free cholesterol; NEFA with mono- di- and trihexosylceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, alkyl- and alkenylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol; HR marginally (p = or <0.1>0.05) with ceramide, G ganglioside, sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylinositol and free cholesterol. Multiple subspecies of these lipids significantly associated with NE and NEFA.

Weight-based dosing may increase drug exposure and the risk of adverse effects in obese patients. The objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of weight-based norepinephrine dosing using actual body weight in the morbidly obese compared with normal weight patients.This was a single centre, retrospective study of adult patients admitted with septic shock requiring norepinephrine for at least 12hours. The primary endpoint was the incidence of tachycardia within 48hours after norepinephrine initiation. Secondary endpoints included timing and dosing of norepinephrine when adjunctive agents were added.The incidence of tachycardia was similar between groups. Total norepinephrine exposure was significantly greater in obese patients on day 1 (p=0.02). Obese patients were more likely to be started on vasopressin (p<0.001) and steroids at a lower weight-based norepinephrine dose (p=0.016).Weight-based norepinephrine dosing using actual body weight did not result in more tachycardia in the morbidly obese compared to normal weight patients, despite greater total exposure. These results were limited by the low doses used and a small cohort. However, use of actual body weight in morbidly obese patients appears to be safe.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This article highlights current literature suggesting the contributory role of intestinal phospholipid metabolism toward cardiometabolic disease manifestation.Group 1b phospholipase A2 (PLA2g1b) catalyzes phospholipid hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen. The digestive product lysophospholipid, particularly lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), has a direct role in mediating chylomicron assembly and secretion. The LPC in the digestive tract is further catabolized into lysophosphatidic acid and choline via autotaxin-mediated and autotaxin-independent mechanisms. The LPC and lysophosphatidic acid absorbed through the digestive tract and transported to the plasma directly promote systemic inflammation and cell dysfunction, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and /diabetes. The choline moiety generated in the digestive tract can also be used by gut bacteria to generate trimethylamine, which is subsequently transported to the liver and oxidized into trimethylamine-N-oxide that also enhances atherosclerosis and cardiovascular abnormalities.Products of phospholipid metabolism in the intestine through PLA2g1b and autotaxin-mediated pathways directly contribute to cardiometabolic diseases through multiple mechanisms. The implication of these studies is that therapeutic inhibition of PLA2g1b and autotaxin in the digestive tract may be a viable approach for cardiovascular and metabolic disease intervention.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25702040>Sleep restriction increases free fatty acids in healthy men.</a></h2><p>Sleep loss is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, yet underlying mechanisms are not understood. Elevation of circulating non-esterified (i.e. free) fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations can lead to insulin resistance and plays a central role in the development of metabolic diseases. Circulating NEFA in healthy individuals shows a marked diurnal variation with maximum levels occurring at night, yet the impact of sleep loss on NEFA levels across the 24 h cycle remains unknown. We hypothesised that sleep restriction would alter hormones that are known to stimulate lipolysis and lead to an increase in NEFA levels.We studied 19 healthy young men under controlled laboratory conditions with four consecutive nights of 8.5 h in bed (normal sleep) and 4.5 h in bed (sleep restriction) in randomised order. The 24 h blood profiles of NEFA, growth hormone (GH), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cortisol, glucose and insulin were simultaneously assessed. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.Sleep restriction relative to normal sleep resulted in increased NEFA levels during the nocturnal and early-morning hours. The elevation in NEFA was related to prolonged nocturnal GH secretion and higher early-morning noradrenaline levels. Insulin sensitivity was decreased after sleep restriction and the reduction in insulin sensitivity was correlated with the increase in nocturnal NEFA levels.Sleep restriction in healthy men results in increased nocturnal and early-morning NEFA levels, which may partly contribute to insulin resistance and the elevated diabetes risk associated with sleep loss.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370417>Altered glycolipid and glycerophospholipid signaling drive inflammatory cascades in adrenomyeloneuropathy.</a></h2><p>X-linked adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder caused by malfunction of the ABCD1 gene, characterized by slowly progressing spastic paraplegia affecting corticospinal tracts, and adrenal insufficiency. AMN is the most common phenotypic manifestation of adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). In some cases, an inflammatory cerebral demyelination occurs associated to poor prognosis in cerebral AMN (cAMN). Though ABCD1 codes for a peroxisomal transporter of very long-chain fatty acids, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease onset and progression, or its transformation to a cerebral, inflammatory demyelinating form, remain largely unknown. Here we used an integrated -omics approach to identify novel biomarkers and altered network dynamic characteristic of, and possibly driving, the disease. We combined an untargeted metabolome assay of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of AMN patients, which used liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF), with a functional genomics analysis of spinal cords of Abcd1(-) mouse. The results uncovered altered nodes in lipid-driven proinflammatory cascades, such as glycosphingolipid and glycerophospholipid synthesis, governed by the β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (B4GALT6), the phospholipase 2γ (PLA2G4C) and the choline/ phosphotransferase (CEPT1) enzymes. Confirmatory investigations revealed a non-classic, inflammatory profile, consisting on the one hand of raised plasma levels of several eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid through PLA2G4C activity, together with also the proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, MCP-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α. In contrast, we detected a more protective, Th2-shifted response in PBMC. Thus, our findings illustrate a previously unreported connection between ABCD1 dysfunction, glyco- and glycerolipid-driven inflammatory signaling and a fine-tuned inflammatory response underlying a disease considered non-inflammatory.© The Author 2015.

The pungent component of mustard, allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), activates the extreme cold receptor transient receptor potential channel, subfamily A, member 1 and may thus induce energy expenditure and metabolic changes. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential of mustard AITC to induce thermogenesis (primary outcome) and alter body temperature, cold and hunger sensations, plasma metabolic parameters, and energy intake (secondary outcomes). Energy expenditure in mice was measured after subcutaneous injection with vehicle, 1 mg norepinephrine/kg, or 5 mg AITC/kg. In our human crossover study, 11 healthy subjects were studied under temperature-controlled conditions after an overnight fast. After ingestion of 10 g of capsulated mustard or uncapsulated mustard or a capsulated placebo mixture, measurements of energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, and plasma parameters were repeated every 30 min during a 150-min period. Subjects were randomly selected for the placebo and capsulated mustard intervention; 9 of 11 subjects received the uncapsulated mustard as the final intervention because this could not be blinded. After the experiments, energy intake was measured with the universal eating monitor in a test meal. In mice, AITC administration induced a 32% increase in energy expenditure compared with vehicle (17.5 ± 4.9 J · min · mouse compared with 12.5 ± 1.2 J · min · mouse,  = 0.03). Of the 11 randomly selected participants, 1 was excluded because of intercurrent illness after the first visit and 1 withdrew after the second visit. Energy expenditure did not increase after ingestion of capsulated or uncapsulated mustard compared with placebo. No differences in substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, or plasma parameters were found, nor was the energy intake at the end of the experiment different between the 3 conditions. The highest tolerable dose of mustard we were able to use did not elicit a relevant thermogenic response in humans.

Combined inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long‑acting β2‑agonist (LABA) inhalers are one of the available maintenance treatment options. OBJECTIVES    This prospective observational study aimed to assess asthma control in patients treated with ICS/LABA inhalers and to identify factors related to optimal asthma control. PATIENTS AND METHODS    The study included 5789 asthmatic patients from Poland, treated with one of the following ICS/LABA inhalers at clinically appropriate doses: beclomethasone/formoterol, fluticasone/ salmeterol, or budesonide/formoterol. The follow‑up lasted 6 months (4 visits in total). The outcomes were physician-reported and patient‑reported asthma control and occurrence of adverse drug reactions. A retrospective logistic regression analysis was performed to identify a potential association between age, , and smoking and the level of disease control. RESULTS    A total of 4469 patients completed the study. Throughout the study period, the rate of patient‑reported control of asthma increased from 24.8% to 67.7%, while physician‑reported control increased from 22.6% to 66.4%. The incidence of exacerbations decreased from 23.4% to 1.9%. Less than 0.1% of the patients reported adverse drug reactions. Age,  (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2), and smoking were confirmed as factors negatively affecting disease control, with combined ICS/LABA inhalers potentially reducing their effect. CONCLUSION    Our results confirm the efficacy and safety of combined ICS/LABA inhalers in a real‑life clinical setting. They also corroborate the finding that , older age, and smoking are risk factors for poor asthma control.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25816612>The effect of N-stearoylethanolamine on cholesterol content, fatty acid composition and protein carbonylation level in rats with alimentary -induced insulin resistance.</a></h2><p>The effect of N-stearoylethanolamine (NSE) on liver free fatty acid composition, cholesterol content and carbonylated protein level in rats with -induced insulin resistance (IR) was studied in the work. The experimental insulin resistance was induced by prolonged high fat diet (58% of energy derived from fat) for 6 months combined with one injection of low-dose (15 mg/kg) of streptozotocin. The lipid assay showed a rise in liver free cholesterol content anda significant reduction in cholesterol esters level. Analyzing liver fatty acid composition, a decrease in polyunsaturated of fatty acid (PUFA) level and an increase in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content was found. Fatty acid imbalance with high content of MUFA was associated with elevated level ofprotein carbonylation. The NSE administration (50 mg/kg of body weight) for 2 weeks decreased free cholesterol content, increased cholesterol esters level and reduced free oleic fatty acid content in the liver of rats with IR. The effect of NSE on lipid imbalance led to a decrease in protein carbonylation level that may result in improvement of transmembrane protein function under -induced insulin resistance state.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825046>Dietary choline and betaine intakes and risk of total and lethal prostate cancer in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.</a></h2><p>Two prior cohort studies suggested that choline, but not betaine intake, is associated with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Given that evidence remains limited, we evaluated whether intakes of choline and derivative betaine are associated with total and lethal PCa risk and PCa death in men with PCa.We included 6,528 men (24.4% African American) without a cancer diagnosis at baseline (1987-1989) followed through 2012. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire coupled with a nutrient database. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of total and lethal PCa risk overall and by race.Choline intake was not associated with total (n = 811) or lethal (n = 95) PCa risk overall or by race. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal (tertile 3 vs 1, HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-1.00, p trend = 0.04), but not total PCa risk; patterns for lethal PCa were similar by race. Neither nutrient was associated with PCa death in men with PCa.Choline intake was not associated with total or lethal PCa or with PCa death in men with PCa. Betaine intake was inversely associated with lethal, but not total PCa risk or with PCa death in men with PCa.

Recent studies have revealed the plasticity of WAT, where white adipocytes can be induced into 'brown-like' heat-producing adipocytes (BRITE or beige adipocytes). Recruiting and activating BRITE adipocytes in WAT (so-called 'browning') is believed to provide new avenues for the treatment of -related diseases.

Salusin-β is a bioactive peptide with potential roles in mediating cardiovascular activity. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that salusin-β in the PVN can modulate sympathetic activity and blood pressure in OH. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to induce OH by a 12-week feeding of a high-fat diet (42% kcal as fat). Microinjection of salusin-β into the PVN increased the renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas salusin-β antibody elicited significant decreases in RSNA, MAP and HR, and abolished the effects of salusin-β only in the OH rats. As expected, the OH rats had a higher norepinephrine level, which was further increased by salusin-β. Furthermore, salusin-β in the PVN accelerated the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) and the degradation of IKB-α (an endogenous inhibitor of NF-KB). Pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (an exogenous inhibitor of NF-KB) decreased RSNA, MAP and HR, and abolished the effects of salusin-β in the PVN in the OH rats.

Whilst weight loss is known to enhance insulin clearance, there is a paucity of data concerning the underlying mechanisms.

We first examined whether SNS activity toward discrete adipose depots changes in response to a weight loss diet in mice. We found that SNS activity toward each adipose depot is unique in timing, pattern of activation, and habituation with the most dramatic contrast between visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots. Sympathetic drive toward visceral epididymal adipose is more than doubled early in weight loss and then suppressed later in the diet when weight loss plateaued. Coincident with the decline in SNS activity toward visceral adipose is an increase in activity toward subcutaneous depots indicating a switch in lipolytic sources. In response to calorie restriction, SNS activity toward retroperitoneal and brown adipose depots is unaffected. Finally, pharmacological blockage of sympathetic activity on adipose tissue using the β3-adrenergic receptor antagonist, SR59230a, suppressed loss of visceral adipose mass in response to diet. These findings indicate that SNS activity toward discrete adipose depots is dynamic and potentially hierarchical. This pattern of sympathetic activation is required for energy liberation and loss of adipose tissue in response to calorie-restricted diet.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26429664>Effects and mechanisms of auricular vagus nerve stimulation on high-fat-diet--induced obese rats.</a></h2><p> is a major public health problem.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AVNS and its mechanisms on  in obese rats.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet for 8 wk. Qualified HFD rats were randomly divided into three groups: the HFD group, the AVNS group, and the sham group for 6 wk treatment. Body weight and daily energy intake were recorded weekly. The rats were sacrificed for measurement of weight of bilateral perirenal, epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT), dorsal brown adipose tissue (BAT), and gastric emptying. Serum cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY3 to 36 (PYY3-36) and norepinephrine (NE) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the mRNA expressions of CCK subtype receptor a (CCKa) in the antrum, PYY3-36 receptor in the distal ileum, β3-adrenoceptor, and uncoupling protein gene 1 (UCP1) in the BAT.Compared with HFD group, AVNS significantly reduced body weight and epididymal WAT and increased BAT weight, serum NE, mRNA expressions of β3-adrenoceptors, and UCP1 of the BAT, but had no effect on daily energy intake, perirenal WAT weight, gastric emptying, serum levels of CCK and PYY, or mRNA expressions of CCKa receptor and PYY3-36 receptor in the relevant tissues. The sham group, as a comparison group for AVNS, saw less effect in any of the indexes compared with the HFD group. AVNS had more effect on weight loss, reduction of perirenal WAT, and increase of NE, β3-adrenoceptor, and UCP1 than sham.AVNS was more effective in reducing body weight and causing visceral fat loss. Biochemical tests found more NE released in the serum and more β3-adrenoceptor and UCP1 expression in the BAT.

The 6-month changes (Δ) in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine levels after the intervention were calculated.Greater decreases in choline and L-carnitine were significantly (p<0.05) associated with greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly related to 2-year improvements in glucose and insulin resistance. We found significant linkages between dietary fat intake and ΔTMAO for changes in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (p <0.05); a greater increase in TMAO was related to lesser improvements in the outcomes among participants who consumed a high-fat diet. In addition, ΔL-carnitine and Δcholine were significantly related to changes in amino acids (including branched-chain and aromatic amino acids). Interestingly, the associations of ΔTMAO, Δcholine and ΔL-carnitine with diabetes-related traits were independent of the changes in amino acids.Our findings underscore the importance of changes in TMAO, choline and L-carnitine in improving insulin sensitivity during a weight-loss intervention for obese patients.

Whether and how overnutrition increases appetite through the adipose-to-brain axis is unclear. O-linked beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) couples nutrient cues to O-GlcNAcylation of intracellular proteins at serine/threonine residues. Chronic dysregulation of O-GlcNAc signaling contributes to metabolic diseases. Here we show that adipocyte OGT is essential for high fat diet-induced hyperphagia, but is dispensable for baseline food intake. Adipocyte OGT stimulates hyperphagia by transcriptional activation of de novo lipid desaturation and accumulation of N-arachidonyl  (AEA), an endogenous appetite-inducing cannabinoid (CB). Pharmacological manipulation of peripheral CB1 signaling regulates hyperphagia in an adipocyte OGT-dependent manner. These findings define adipocyte OGT as a fat sensor that regulates peripheral lipid signals, and uncover an unexpected adipose-to-brain axis to induce hyperphagia and .</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28205455>Impact of Norepinephrine Weight-Based Dosing Compared With Non-Weight-Based Dosing in Achieving Time to Goal Mean Arterial Pressure in Obese Patients With Septic Shock.</a></h2><p> presents a growing challenge in critically ill patients because of variable medication pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Vasopressors used in the treatment of septic shock, including norepinephrine, are dosed using weight-based (WB) or non-weight-based (NWB) strategies. Retrospective research has evaluated the effect of total body weight and body mass index on vasopressor requirements, consequently finding that obese patients require less total vasopressor per kilogram to obtain clinical end points such as mean arterial pressure. Although this effect is not completely understood, this may suggest that a NWB dosing strategy is preferred over a WB strategy in obese patients to minimize potential for error.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26362189>Curcumin promotes browning of white adipose tissue in a norepinephrine-dependent way.</a></h2><p>Brown adipose tissue converts energy from food into heat via the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1, defending against cold. In some conditions, inducible 'brown-like' adipocytes, also known as beige adipocytes, can develop within white adipose tissue (WAT). These beige adipocytes have characteristics similar to classical brown adipocytes and thus can burn lipids to produce heat. In the current study, we demonstrated that curcumin (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) decreased bodyweight and fat mass without affecting food intake in mice. We further demonstrated that curcumin improves cold tolerance in mice. This effect was possibly mediated by the emergence of beige adipocytes and the increase of thermogenic gene expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in inguinal WAT. In addition, curcumin promotes β3AR gene expression in inguinal WAT and elevates the levels of plasma norepinephrine, a hormone that can induce WAT browning. Taken together, our data suggest that curcumin can potentially prevent  by inducing browning of inguinal WAT via the norepinephrine-β3AR pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We sought to determine the effects of intraduodenal glucose infusion, bypassing gastric emptying, on BP, heart rate (HR), and noradrenaline responses in obese and healthy control subjects. 12 obese subjects (age 36.6 ± 3.9 years, body mass index (BMI) 36.1 ± 1.3 kg/m ) and 23 controls (age 27.8 ± 2.4 years, BMI 22.4 ± 0.5 kg/m ) received intraduodenal infusions of glucose at 1 or 3 kcal/min, or saline, for 60 min (t = 0-60 min), followed by intraduodenal saline (t = 60-120 min). BP and HR were measured with an automatic cuff, and blood samples collected for measurement of plasma noradrenaline. Intraduodenal glucose at 1 kcal/min was associated with a fall in diastolic BP in the control subjects only (P < 0.01), with no change in systolic BP, HR or noradrenaline in either group. In both groups, intraduodenal glucose at 3 kcal/min was associated with a fall in diastolic (P < 0.01), but not systolic, BP, and rises in HR (P < 0.001) and plasma noradrenaline (P < 0.01), with no difference in responses between the groups. We conclude that cardiovascular and sympathetic responses to intraduodenal glucose infusion are comparable between obese and control subjects, and dependent on the rate of glucose delivery.© 2018 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the kinetics of metabolic and inflammatory liver dysfunction induced by a high-refined carbohydrate-containing (HC) diet and to determine how platelet-activating factor (PAF) modulates the liver lipid content of mice. BALB/c mice were fed a chow or HC diet for the following experimental periods: 1 and 3 days, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks. Wild-type (WT) and PAF receptor-deficient (PAFR(-/-)) mice were fed the same diets for 8 weeks. Mice fed with HC diet showed higher triglycerides and cholesterol levels, fibrosis and inflammation in the liver. The number of neutrophils migrating into the liver was also increased in mice fed with HC diet. However, transaminase levels did not change. PAFR(-/-) mice fed with HC diet showed more steatosis, oxidative stress and higher transaminases levels associated with lower inflammation than WT mice. The consumption of HC diet altered the metabolic and inflammatory response in the liver and was worse in PAFR(-/-) mice. We suggest that PAF regulates liver lipid content and dyslipidemia, protecting the mice from lipotoxicity and liver damage.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, evidence in humans is scarce. We aim to investigate the association between serum choline and betaine levels with body composition in general population.This is an observational cross-sectional study performed in 1081 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study. Serum choline and betaine levels were measured based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry technology. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry following a 12-hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses.Significantly inverse correlations were found between serum betaine levels and all  measurements in males (r ranged from -0.12 to -0.23, and p<0.01 for all) but not in females. Serum choline was negatively associated with total percent body fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (r ranged from -0.11 to -0.19, and p<0.05 for all) in males and positively associated with weight, BMI and WC (r ranged from 0.09 to 0.10, and p<0.05 for all) in females.

Lipid overload induces insulin resistance in muscle and alters the composition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). To test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle phospholipid metabolism regulates systemic glucose metabolism, we perturbed choline/ phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1), the terminal enzyme in the Kennedy pathway of phospholipid synthesis. In C2C12 cells, CEPT1 knockdown altered SR phospholipid composition and calcium flux. In mice, diet-induced , which decreases insulin sensitivity, increased muscle CEPT1 expression. In high-fat diet-fed mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of CEPT1, systemic and muscle-based approaches demonstrated increased muscle insulin sensitivity. In CEPT1-deficient muscles, an altered SR phospholipid milieu decreased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase-dependent calcium uptake, activating calcium-signaling pathways known to improve insulin sensitivity. Altered muscle SR calcium handling also rendered these mice exercise intolerant. In obese humans, surgery-induced weight loss increased insulin sensitivity and decreased skeletal muscle CEPT1 protein. In obese humans spanning a spectrum of metabolic health, muscle CEPT1 mRNA was inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. These results suggest that high-fat feeding and  induce CEPT1, which remodels the SR to preserve contractile function at the expense of insulin sensitivity.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

In normal weight healthy subjects, we found that before hedonic eating, plasma levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were higher than before nonhedonic eating, and although they progressively decreased after food ingestion in both eating conditions, they were significantly higher in hedonic eating. Plasma levels of anandamide (AEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), instead, progressively decreased in both eating conditions without significant differences. In this study, we investigated the responses of AEA, 2-AG, OEA and PEA to hedonic eating in obese individuals.Peripheral levels of AEA, 2-AG, OEA and PEA were measured in 14 obese patients after eating favourite (hedonic eating) and non-favourite (nonhedonic eating) foods in conditions of no homeostatic needs.Plasma levels of 2-AG increased after eating the favourite food, whereas they decreased after eating the non-favourite food, with the production of the endocannabinoid being significantly enhanced in hedonic eating. Plasma levels of AEA decreased progressively in nonhedonic eating, whereas they showed a decrease after the exposure to the favourite food followed by a return to baseline values after eating it.

However, how circulating FAE levels are influenced by FA intake in humans remains unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the response of six major circulating FAE to various dietary oil treatments in a five-period, cross-over, randomised, double-blind, clinical study in volunteers with abdominal . The treatment oils (60 g/12 552 kJ per d (60 g/3000 kcal per d)) provided for 30 d were as follows: conventional canola oil, high oleic canola oil, high oleic canola oil enriched with DHA, flax/safflower oil blend and corn/safflower oil blend. Two SNP associated with FAE degradation and synthesis were studied. Post-treatment results showed overall that plasma FAE levels were modulated by dietary FA and were positively correlated with corresponding plasma FA levels; minor allele (A) carriers of SNP rs324420 in gene fatty acid amide hydrolase produced higher circulating oleoylethanolamide (OEA) (P=0·0209) and docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA) levels (P=0·0002). In addition, elevated plasma DHEA levels in response to DHA intake tended to be associated with lower plasma OEA levels and an increased gynoid fat mass. In summary, data suggest that the metabolic and physiological responses to dietary FA may be influenced via circulating FAE.

The overfeeding diets contained 200% of energy requirements and varied macronutrient proportions: (1) standard (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 30% fat); (2) 75% carbohydrate; (3) 60% fat; and (4) 3% protein.Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (EE) and macronutrient oxidation rates were measured in an indirect calorimeter during the dietary interventions, with concomitant measurement of urinary catecholamines and free cortisol.EE decreased with fasting (-7.7% ± 4.8%; P < 0.0001) and increased with overfeeding. The smallest increase occurred during consumption of the diet with 3% protein (2.7% ± 4.5%; P = 0.001) and the greatest during the diet with 75% carbohydrate (13.8 ± 5.7%; P < 0.0001). Approximately 60% of macronutrient oxidation was determined by diet and 20% by intrinsic factors (P < 0.0001). Only urinary epinephrine differed between fasting and overfeeding diets (Δ = 2.25 ± 2.9 µg/24h; P < 0.0001). During fasting, higher urinary epinephrine concentrations correlated with smaller reductions in EE (ρ = 0.34; P = 0.01).Independent from dietary macronutrient proportions, there is a strong individual contribution to fuel preference that remains consistent across diets.

Our novel study characterised the expression of ADAM28 in mice with the metabolic syndrome and used molecular inhibition approaches to investigate the functional role of ADAM28 in the pathogenesis of high fat diet-induced . We identified that ADAM28 mRNA and protein expression was markedly increased in the livers of mice with the metabolic syndrome. In addition, noradrenaline, the major neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system, results in elevated  mRNA expression in human monocytes. Downregulation of ADAM28 with siRNA technology resulted in a lack of weight gain, promotion of insulin sensitivity/glucose tolerance and decreased liver tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in our diet-induced  mouse model as well as reduced blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. In addition, we show that ADAM28 knock-out mice also displayed reduced body weight, elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and reductions in blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase.

The contribution of BK channel function to control of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and vascular function/structure was determined in wild-type and BK channel β1-subunit knockout mice fed a high-fat or control diet.After 24 weeks of high-fat diet, wild-type and BK β1-knockout mice were obese, diabetic, but normotensive. High-fat-BK β1-knockout mice had decreased HR, while high-fat-wild-type mice had increased HR compared with mice on the control diet. Ganglion blockade caused a greater fall in BP and HR in mice on a high-fat diet than in mice on the control diet. β1-adrenergic receptor blockade reduced BP and HR equally in all groups. α1-adrenergic receptor blockade decreased BP in high-fat-BK β1-knockout mice only. Echocardiographic evaluation revealed left ventricular hypertrophy in high-fat-BK β1-knockout mice. Although under anaesthesia, mice on a high-fat diet had higher absolute stroke volume and cardiac output, these measures were similar to control mice when adjusted for body weight. Mesenteric arteries from high-fat-BK β1-knockout mice had higher norepinephrine reactivity, greater wall thickness and collagen accumulation than high-fat-wild-type mesenteric arteries.

Prejunctional α-adrenergic receptors (αARs) provide negative feedback to norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves through inhibition of N-type Ca channels. Increased neuronal norepinephrine release in DOCA-salt and -related hypertension occurs through impaired αAR signaling; however, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Mesenteric arteries are resistance arteries that receive sympathetic innervation from the superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia (SMCG). We tested the hypothesis that macrophages impair αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca channels in SMCG neurons from DOCA-salt and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hypertensive rats. Whole cell patch-clamp methods were used to record Ca currents from SMCG neurons maintained in primary culture. We found that DOCA-salt, but not HFD-induced, hypertension caused macrophage accumulation in mesenteric arteries, increased SMCG mRNA levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, and impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons. αAR dysfunction did not involve changes in αAR expression, desensitization, or downstream signaling factors. Oxidative stress impaired αAR-mediated inhibition of Ca currents in SMCG neurons and resulted in receptor internalization in human embryonic kidney-293T cells. Systemic clodronate-induced macrophage depletion preserved αAR function and lowered blood pressure in DOCA-salt rats. HFD caused hypertension without  in Sprague-Dawley rats and hypertension with  in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. HFD-induced hypertension was not associated with inflammation in SMCG and mesenteric arteries or αAR dysfunction in SMCG neurons. These results suggest that macrophage-mediated αAR dysfunction in the mesenteric circulation may only be relevant to mineralocorticoid-salt excess. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we identify a contribution of macrophages to hypertension development through impaired α-adrenergic receptor (αAR)-mediated inhibition of sympathetic nerve terminal Ca channels in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Impaired αAR function may involve oxidative stress-induced receptor internalization. αAR dysfunction may be unique to mineralocorticoid-salt excess, as it does not occur in -related hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25849890>Green tea catechins enhance norepinephrine-induced lipolysis via a protein kinase A-dependent pathway in adipocytes.</a></h2><p>Green tea catechins have been shown to attenuate  in animals and humans. The catechins activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and thereby increase fatty acid oxidation in liver and skeletal muscles. Green tea catechins have also been shown to reduce body fat in humans. However, the effect of the catechins on lipolysis in adipose tissue has not been fully understood. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of green tea catechins on lipolysis in adipocytes and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Differentiated mouse adipocyte cell line (3T3-L1) was stimulated with green tea catechins in the presence or absence of norepinephrine. Glycerol and free fatty acids in the media were measured. Phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) was determined by Western blotting, and the mRNA expression levels of HSL, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), and perilipin were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The cells were treated with inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase G (PKG), or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to determine the responsible pathway. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with green tea catechins increased the level of glycerol and free fatty acids released into the media in the presence, but not absence, of norepinephrine, and increased the level of phosphorylated HSL in the cells. The catechins also increased mRNA and protein levels of HSL and ATGL. PKA inhibitor (H89) attenuated the catechin-induced increase in glycerol release and HSL phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that green tea catechins enhance lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine via a PKA-dependent pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, providing a potential mechanism by which green tea catechins could reduce body fat.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Before BS, and at 4 and 12 months postoperatively, the body mass index (BMI), 24-h ambulatory BP, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS: plasma rennin activity, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and angiotensin converting enzyme), sympathetic nervous system (SNS: metanephrines, normetanephrines, and norepinephrine) components, leptin, insulin, and abdominal fat were measured.Before BS, HT-duration was 6±6 years, the BMI 45±5 kg/m2 and excess weight (EBW) was 53±12 kg. At 12 months, the excess BMI loss was 14 kg/m2 and the EBW loss was 70 %; HT remission was observed in 70%; 24-h (systolic 19±13/diastolic 7±9 mm Hg), day and night BP levels and aldosterone, norepinephrine, leptin, insulin, subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat (VAT) significantly decreased (P<.05). Mixed models for repeated measures revealed that HT-duration, baseline BP, BMI, and VAT area were the main variables associated with longitudinal changes in BP.These results demonstrate that the hypotensive response after weight loss in severely hypertensive obese patients is mainly regulated by HT-duration, baseline BP, BMI and VAT area, independently of suppression of hyperinsulinemia or changes in RAAS and SNS components.Copyright © 2015 American Society for Bariatric Surgery.

Hypertension developed in all swine (24-h BP: 169.5/128.3 ± 5.8/5.1 mmHg pre-RDN). RDN resulted in significant reductions in noradrenaline kidney tissue concentration by 63%. Significant BP reductions were documented at 45 days post-RDN in all defined interday epochs, except for the dark-h period.

It is often added to dietary supplements intended for weight loss and enhancement of sports performance, typically in the form of Citrus aurantium extracts and in many cases in combination with caffeine. The health risks of synephrine were evaluated on the basis of the available toxicological data and in accordance to the EFSA guidance on the safety assessment of botanicals and botanical preparations intended for use in food supplements. In animal studies, orally applied synephrine induced adrenergic effects on the cardiovascular system (increase of blood pressure, ventricular arrhythmias), which were enhanced by the concomitant application of caffeine as well as physical activity. Some human intervention studies investigating the acute effects of synephrine on blood pressure and heart rate of healthy, normotensive test persons indicate that synephrine can induce cardiovascular effects in humans. A series of published case reports of adverse cardiovascular effects (hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction) were associated with consumption of synephrine- and caffeine-containing dietary supplements. In conclusion, consumption of high amounts of synephrine, especially in combination with caffeine and physical exercise, is associated with an increased risk of adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. According to the assessment by the BfR (Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung), daily intake of synephrine through dietary supplements should not exceed the median intake from conventional foods.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30045336>The effect of nebivolol and ramipril on selected biochemical parameters, arterial stiffness, and circadian profile of blood pressure in young men with primary hypertension: A 12-week prospective randomized, open-label study trial.</a></h2><p>The pleiotropic effects of hypotensive drugs should always be taken into consideration.

Given the proposed contribution of microbiota alterations in  and type 2 diabetes (T2D), we investigated the potential impact of , lifestyle-induced weight loss, and bariatric surgery on plasma levels of TMAO, its microbiota-dependent intermediate γBB, and its diet-dependent precursors carnitine and choline.TMAO, γBB, carnitine, and choline were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in 34 obese individuals (17 with and 17 without T2D) undergoing bariatric surgery and 17 controls.TMAO was not elevated in obese patients or reduced by lifestyle interventions but increased approximately twofold after bariatric surgery. Similar to TMAO, plasma levels of γBB were not influenced by lifestyle interventions but increased moderately after bariatric surgery. In contrast, carnitine and choline, which are abundant in nutrients, such as in red meat and eggs, and not microbiota dependent, were reduced after lifestyle interventions and rebounded after bariatric surgery.The major increase in TMAO after bariatric surgery was unexpected because high TMAO levels have been linked to CVD, whereas bariatric surgery is known to reduce CVD risk.

There remains a lack of consensus regarding treatment strategies for mildly elevated BP, termed prehypertension, and the knowledge of pathophysiology and mechanisms of its clinical outcomes remains limited. Our primary aim was to investigate βAR-mediated inflammation control (BARIC) responses of blood monocytes to isoproterenol (Iso) in relation to BP and CVD risk factors, including , depressive mood, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels in the 64 prehypertensive compared to 84 individuals with normal BP. BARIC was determined by measuring the degree of inhibition in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated monocytic intracellular TNF production by ex vivo Iso treatment (10(-8)M). Depressive mood was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Fasting metabolic and lipid panels were assessed, and plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 were measured in a subset to confirm proinflammatory state of prehypertensive participants. Prehypertensive participants were older, heavier, included more men, and presented higher levels of fasting glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and plasma TNF compared to normotensive participants (p's<.05). BARIC was significantly attenuated in the prehypertensive compared to normotensive group (p<.05). BARIC was negatively associated with systolic BP, diastolic BP, age, BMI, fasting glucose, triglycerides, total and low density cholesterol levels, and somatic depressive symptoms in all participants (p's<.0001 to .05). However, among the prehypertensive individuals BARIC was positively associated with SBP even after controlling for the covariates (age, gender, race, BMI, glucose and lipid panel, somatic BDI scores) (p<.05). This differing nature of the BARIC-SBP relationship between the two BP groups may be attributed to moderating factors such as cardiorespiratory fitness or depressive symptoms that could not be clearly deciphered in this current study. Nonetheless, our findings indicate the associations between inflammation dysregulation mediated by sympathoadrenal activation and BP that is observable even among individuals with normal to mildly elevated BP. BARIC may be a useful and sensitive indicator of elevated risk for vascular inflammatory disease that can be detected even at lower BP levels, especially given its associations with traditional CVD risk factors and the critical role of monocytes in atherogenic processes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We report a straightforward and efficient protocol to generate functional human beige adipocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Without overexpression of exogenous adipogenic genes, our method recapitulates an adipogenic developmental pathway through successive mesodermal and adipogenic progenitor stages. hiPSC-derived adipocytes are insulin sensitive and display beige-specific markers and functional properties, including upregulation of thermogenic genes, increased mitochondrial content, and increased oxygen consumption upon activation with cAMP analogs. Engraftment of hiPSC-derived adipocytes in mice produces well-organized and vascularized adipose tissue, capable of β-adrenergic-responsive glucose uptake.

Is the reduced signalling of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of energy homeostasis in the heart, responsible for the reduced β-adrenergic responsiveness of the heart in ? What is the main finding and its importance? Inhibition of AMPK in isolated hearts prevented the reduced cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness of obese rats, which was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of AMPK, a proxy of AMPK activity. This suggests a direct functional link between β-adrenergic responsiveness and AMPK signalling in the heart, and it suggests that AMPK might be an important target to restore the β-adrenergic responsiveness in the heart in .The  epidemic impacts heavily on cardiovascular health, in part owing to changes in cardiac metabolism. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy homeostasis in the heart and is regulated by β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) in normal conditions. In , chronic sympathetic overactivation leads to impaired cardiac β-AR responsiveness, although it is unclear whether AMPK signalling, downstream of β-ARs, contributes to this dysfunction. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether reduced AMPK signalling is responsible for the reduced β-AR responsiveness in . In isolated hearts of lean and obese Zucker rats, we tested β-AR responsiveness to the β -AR agonist isoprenaline (ISO, 1 × 10 to 5 × 10  m) in the absence and presence of the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (CC, 10 μm). The β -AR expression and AMPK phosphorylation were assessed by Western blot. β-Adrenergic responsiveness was reduced in the hearts of obese rats (logEC of ISO-developed pressure dose-response curves: lean -8.53 ± 0.13 × 10  m versus obese -8.35 ± 0.10 × 10  m ; P < 0.05 lean versus obese, n = 6 per group). This difference was not apparent after AMPK inhibition (logEC of ISO-developed pressure curves: lean CC -8.19 ± 0.12 × 10  m versus obese CC 8.17 ± 0.13 × 10  m, P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). β -Adrenergic receptor expression and AMPK phosphorylation were reduced in hearts of obese rats (AMPK at Thr : lean 1.73 ± 0.17 a.u. versus lean CC 0.81 ± 0.13 a.u., and obese 1.18 ± 0.09 a.u. versus obese CC 0.81 ± 0.16 a.u., P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). Thus, a direct functional link between β-adrenergic responsiveness and AMPK signalling in the heart exists, and AMPK might be an important target to restore the reduced cardiac β-adrenergic responsiveness in .© 2018 The Authors.

DG is a precursor for phospholipids, thus phospholipid synthesis could be involved in regulating muscle DG. Little is known about the interaction between phospholipid and DG in muscle; therefore, we examined whether disrupting muscle phospholipid synthesis, specifically phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), would influence muscle DG content and insulin sensitivity. Muscle PtdEtn synthesis was disrupted by deleting CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ECT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the CDP- pathway, a major route for PtdEtn production. While PtdEtn was reduced in muscle-specific ECT knockout mice, intramyocellular and membrane-associated DG was markedly increased. Importantly, however, this was not associated with insulin resistance. Unexpectedly, mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle oxidative capacity were increased in muscle-specific ECT knockout mice and were accompanied by enhanced exercise performance. These findings highlight the importance of the CDP- pathway in regulating muscle DG content and challenge the DG-induced insulin resistance hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies from our laboratory revealed central neuroanatomical evidence of WAT sensory and BAT SNS crosstalk with double labeling of inguinal WAT (IWAT) sensory and interscapular BAT (IBAT) SNS neurons. We previously demonstrated that WAT lipolysis increases IBAT temperature, but this effect is absent when IWAT afferents are surgically denervated, which severs both sensory and SNS nerves. It is possible that WAT sensory feedback can regulate SNS drive to itself and other WAT and BAT depots, and thus contribute to the existence of differential SNS outflow to fat during different energy challenges. Here we selectively denervated IWAT sensory nerves in Siberian hamsters using capsaicin and measured norepinephrine turnover (NETO) i.e., SNS drive to WAT and BAT depots, IBAT uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, body mass, fat mass, blood glucose, and food consumed after a 24-h cold exposure. IWAT sensory denervation decreased both IWAT and IBAT NETO and IBAT UCP1 expression. IWAT sensory denervation, however, increased mesenteric WAT (MWAT) NETO after the 24-h cold exposure and did not modify epididymal WAT (EWAT) and retroperitoneal WAT (RWAT) NETO compared with respective controls. Body mass, fat mass, blood glucose, and food consumed were unchanged across groups. RWAT and EWAT mass decreased in capsaicin-injected hamsters, but did not in the vehicle hamsters. These results functionally demonstrate the existence of IWAT sensory and IBAT SNS crosstalk and that a disruption in this sensory-SNS feedback mechanism modifies SNS drive to IWAT, IBAT, and MWAT, but not EWAT and RWAT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We found multiple associations between urinary metabolites and BMI including urinary glycoproteins and N-acetyl neuraminate (related to renal function), trimethylamine, dimethylamine, 4-cresyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (gut microbial co-metabolites), succinate and citrate (tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates), ketoleucine and the ketoleucine/leucine ratio (linked to skeletal muscle mitochondria and branched-chain amino acid metabolism),  (skeletal muscle turnover), and 3-methylhistidine (skeletal muscle turnover and meat intake). We mapped the multiple BMI-metabolite relationships as part of an integrated systems network that describes the connectivities between the complex pathway and compartmental signatures of human adiposity.Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27512975>Interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light walking or simple resistance activities reduces resting blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline in type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>Prolonged sitting is increasingly recognized as a ubiquitous cardiometabolic risk factor, possibly distinct from lack of physical exercise. We examined whether interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light-intensity activity reduced blood pressure (BP) and plasma noradrenaline in type 2 diabetes (T2D).In a randomized crossover trial, 24 inactive overweight/obese adults with T2D (14 men; mean ± SD; 62 ± 6 years) consumed standardized meals during 3 × 8 h conditions: uninterrupted sitting (SIT); sitting + half-hourly bouts of walking (3.2 km/h for 3-min) (light-intensity walking); and sitting + half-hourly bouts of simple resistance activities for 3 min (SRAs), each separated by 6-14 days washout. Resting seated BP was measured hourly (mean of three recordings, ≥20-min postactivity). Plasma noradrenaline was measured at 30-min intervals for the first hour after meals and hourly thereafter.Compared with SIT, mean resting SBP and DBP were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) for both light-intensity walking (mean ± SEM; -14 ± 1/-8 ± 1 mmHg) and SRA (-16 ± 1/-10 ± 1 mmHg), with a more pronounced effect for SRA (P < 0.05 versus light-intensity walking). Similarly, mean plasma noradrenaline was significantly reduced for both light-intensity walking (-0.3 ± 0.1 nmol/l) and SRA (-0.6 ± 0.1 nmol/l) versus SIT, with SRA lower than light-intensity walking (P < 0.05). Mean resting heart rate was lowered by light-intensity walking (-3 ± 1 bpm; P < 0.05), but not SRA (-1 ± 1 bpm).Interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light-intensity walking or SRA reduces resting BP and plasma noradrenaline in adults with T2D, with SRA being more effective.

However, how circulating FABP4 level is modified by pharmacological agents remains unclear. We here examined the effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on serum FABP4 level. First, essential hypertensives were treated with ARBs: candesartan (8 mg day(-1); n=7) for 2 weeks, olmesartan (20 mg day(-1); n=9) for 12 weeks, and valsartan (80 mg day(-1); n=94) or telmisartan (40 mg day(-1); n=91) for 8 weeks added to amlodipine (5 mg day(-1)). Treatment with ARBs significantly decreased blood pressure and serum FABP4 concentrations by 8-20% without significant changes in adiposity or lipid variables, though the M value determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp, a sensitive index of insulin sensitivity, was significantly increased by candesartan. Next, alterations in FABP4 secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were examined under several agents. Lipolytic stimulation of the β-adrenoceptor in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by isoproterenol increased FABP4 secretion, and conversely, insulin suppressed FABP4 secretion. However, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with angiotensin II or ARBs for 2 h had no effect on gene expression or secretion of FABP4 regardless of β-adrenoceptor stimulation. In conclusion, treatment with structurally different ARBs similarly decreases circulating FABP4 concentrations in hypertensive patients as a class effect of ARBs, which is not attributable to blockade of the angiotensin II receptor in adipocytes. Reduction of FABP4 levels by ARBs might be involved in suppression of cardiovascular events.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29626526>Differential modulation of white adipose tissue endocannabinoid levels by n-3 fatty acids in obese mice and type 2 diabetic patients.</a></h2><p>n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) might regulate metabolism by lowering endocannabinoid levels. We examined time-dependent changes in adipose tissue levels of endocannabinoids as well as in parameters of glucose homeostasis induced by n-3 PUFA in dietary-obese mice, and compared these results with the effect of n-3 PUFA intervention in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8, 16 or 24 weeks a high-fat diet alone (cHF) or supplemented with n-3 PUFA (cHF + F). Overweight/obese, T2DM patients on metformin therapy were given for 24 weeks corn oil (Placebo; 5 g/day) or n-3 PUFA concentrate as above (Omega-3; 5 g/day). Endocannabinoids were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry. Compared to cHF-fed controls, the cHF + F mice consistently reduced 2-arachidonoylglycerol (up to ~2-fold at week 24) and anandamide (~2-fold) in adipose tissue, while the levels of endocannabinoid-related anti-inflammatory molecules N-eicosapentaenoyl  (EPEA) and N-docosahexaenoyl  (DHEA) increased more than ~10-fold and ~8-fold, respectively. At week 24, the cHF + F mice improved glucose tolerance and fasting blood glucose, the latter being positively correlated with adipose 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels only in obese cHF-fed controls, like fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. In the patients, n-3 PUFA failed to reduce 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide levels in adipose tissue and serum, but they increased both adipose tissue and serum levels of EPEA and DHEA. In conclusion, the inability of n-3 PUFA to reduce adipose tissue and serum levels of classical endocannabinoids might contribute to a lack of beneficial effects of these lipids on glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients.Copyright © 2018.

Brown adipocytes are responsible for performing non-shivering thermogenesis, which is exclusively mediated by uncoupling protein (UCP) -1 (a protein found in the inner mitochondrial membrane), the hallmark of BAT, responsible for the uncoupling of the proton leakage from the ATP production, therefore, generating heat (i.e. thermogenesis). Besides UCP1, other compounds are essential not only to thermogenesis, but also to the proliferation and differentiation of BAT, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, PPARgamma coactivator 1 (PGC1)-alpha, and PRD1-BF-1-RIZ1 homologous domain protein containing protein (PRDM) -16. The sympathetic nervous system centrally regulates thermogenesis through norepinephrine, which acts on the adrenergic receptors of BAT. This bound leads to the initialization of the many pathways that may activate thermogenesis in acute and/or chronic ways. In summary, this mini-review aims to demonstrate the latest advances in the knowledge of BAT.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In most cases, acute postoperative bleeding is mild and can be managed conservatively. Nonetheless, there are times when massive hemorrhage is encountered. Endoscopic treatment of these patients within 24 h of Roux-en-Y (RYGB) is controversial, due to fear of staple line dehiscence and/or perforation. Therefore, most surgeons prefer to undergo diagnostic laparoscopy for exploration and treatment. However, it has been reported that laparoscopic management of acute bleeding can be technically challenging with a high rate of morbidity as well as conversion to laparotomy. We herein present a multimedia video (6 min) demonstrating the management of acute massive hemorrhage after RYGB.A 46-year-old female with hemodynamic instability after massive hematemesis and melena underwent endoscopy. An overtube was utilized to allow removal of large blood clots which obstructed endoscopic visualization. Two bleeding points were noted, and these were successfully treated with adrenaline and endoscopic clips.The patient rapidly improved during her hospital stay and commenced oral intake on day 1. A surveillance endoscopy was performed on day 5, and no stigmata of recent bleeding was noted.

Anthropometric phenotypes (visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the ratio between VAT and SAT (VSR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)) and urinary and serum metabolite concentrations measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were measured in a population-based sample of 228 healthy adults. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models, corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, were used to associate anthropometric phenotypes with metabolites. We adjusted for potential confounding variables: age, sex, smoking, physical activity, menopausal status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary glucose, and fasting status. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model dichotomized for the absence or presence of quantifiable metabolite amounts, VAT, BMI and WC were inversely related to urinary choline (ß = -0.18, p = 2.73*10-3), glycolic acid (ß = -0.20, 0.02), and guanidinoacetic acid (ß = -0.12, p = 0.04), and positively related to  (ß = 0.18, p = 0.02) and dimethylamine (ß = 0.32, p = 0.02). BMI and WC were additionally inversely related to urinary glutamine and lactic acid. Moreover, WC was inversely associated with the detection of serine. VAT, but none of the other anthropometric parameters, was related to serum essential amino acids, such as valine, isoleucine, and phenylalanine among men. Compared to other adiposity measures, VAT demonstrated the strongest and most significant relations to urinary and serum metabolites.

Despite its worldwide prevalence, there are no effective drugs for the treatment of NASH. The progression of NASH is mainly accelerated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipotoxicity. The transcription factor known as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is pivotal for the elimination of ROS. Accordingly, activators of Nrf2 have been implicated as promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of NASH. Niclosamide ( salt; NEN), a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), is currently used as an anthelmintic drug for the treatment of parasitic infections. Recently, NEN was shown to improve hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. However, the underlying mechanism of its antioxidant function in NASH remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NEN induces AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of p62 at S351 that can lead to noncanonical Nrf2 activation. We also demonstrate that NEN protects cells and mouse liver from acute lipotoxic stress through activating p62-dependent Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Taken together, NEN can be used for clinical applications and has the potential to provide a new therapeutic option for NASH.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, very little is known about the effects of the number and the position of double bonds in LCFA with the same length on brown fat-specific gene expression. To determine the specificity of LCFA in the regulation of these genes in different adipocyte models, fully differentiated 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, murine, or porcine primary adipocytes (obtained from the subcutaneous fat pad of C57BL/6 mice or Landrace × Yorkshire × Duroc crossbred piglets) were treated with 50 μM of the following 18-carbon fatty acids: stearic acid (STA; 18:0), oleic acid (OLA; 18:1, Δ9), linoleic acid (LNA; 18:2, Δ9,12), α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3, Δ9,12,15), γ-linolenic acid (GLA; 18:3, Δ6,9,12), or pinolenic acid (PLA; 18:3, Δ5,9,12) for 24 h with or without 4-h norepinephrine (NE) treatment. Expression levels of thermoregulatory markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. LNA, ALA, GLA, and PLA upregulated Ucp1 expression and tended to upregulate Pgc1a expression in murine primary adipocytes, but not in 10T1/2, 3T3-L1, and porcine primary adipocytes. In murine primary adipocytes, NE induced a higher expression of Ucp1 and Pgc1a than non-NE-treated cells, and PLA augmented the NE effect. In 10T1/2 cells, NE upregulated Ucp1 and Pgc1a expression, but there was no fatty acid effect. However, 3T3-L1 cells were insensitive to both fatty acid and beta-adrenergic agonist stimulation.

Exercise and calorie intake control are recognized as the primary mechanisms for addressing excess body weight. Naturally occurring thermogenic plant constituents offer adjunct means for assisting in weight management. The controlling mechanisms for thermogenesis offer many intervention points. Thermogenic agents can act through stimulation of the central nervous system with associated adverse cardiovascular effects and through metabolic mechanisms that are non-stimulatory or a combination thereof. Examples of stimulatory thermogenic agents that will be discussed include ephedrine and caffeine. Examples of non-stimulatory thermogenic agents include p-synephrine (bitter orange extract), capsaicin, forskolin (Coleus root extract), and chlorogenic acid (green coffee bean extract). Green tea is an example of a thermogenic with the potential to produce mild but clinically insignificant undesirable stimulatory effects. The use of the aforementioned thermogenic agents in combination with other extracts such as those derived from Salacia reticulata, Sesamum indicum, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Cissus quadrangularis, and Moringa olifera, as well as the use of the carotenoids as lutein and fucoxanthin, and flavonoids as naringin and hesperidin can further facilitate energy metabolism and weight management as well as sports performance without adverse side effects.© 2016 The Authors Phytotherapy Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27587548>The effect of hypoxia and re-oxygenation on adipose tissue lipolysis in COPD patients.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29117176>Macrophages dispose of catecholamines in adipose tissue.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26467632>Hypothalamic POMC Deficiency Improves Glucose Tolerance Despite Insulin Resistance by Increasing Glycosuria.</a></h2><p>Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is essential for the physiological regulation of energy balance; however, its role in glucose homeostasis remains less clear. We show that hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Arc)POMC-deficient mice, which develop severe  and insulin resistance, unexpectedly exhibit improved glucose tolerance and remain protected from hyperglycemia. To explain these paradoxical phenotypes, we hypothesized that an insulin-independent pathway is responsible for the enhanced glucose tolerance. Indeed, the mutant mice demonstrated increased glucose effectiveness and exaggerated glycosuria relative to wild-type littermate controls at comparable blood glucose concentrations. Central administration of the melanocortin receptor agonist melanotan II in mutant mice reversed alterations in glucose tolerance and glycosuria, whereas, conversely, administration of the antagonist Agouti-related peptide (Agrp) to wild-type mice enhanced glucose tolerance. The glycosuria of ArcPOMC-deficient mice was due to decreased levels of renal GLUT 2 (rGLUT2) but not sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and was associated with reduced renal catecholamine content. Epinephrine treatment abolished the genotype differences in glucose tolerance and rGLUT2 levels, suggesting that reduced renal sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is the underlying mechanism for the observed glycosuria and improved glucose tolerance in ArcPOMC-deficient mice. Therefore, the ArcPOMC-SNS-rGLUT2 axis is potentially an insulin-independent therapeutic target to control diabetes.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

We hypothesized that a short-term, high-fat diet would increase fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of TMAO in response to a high-fat meal challenge. Following a 2-week eucaloric control diet, 10 nonobese men (18-30 years) consumed a eucaloric, high-fat diet (55% fat) for 5 days. Plasma TMAO was measured after a 12-hour fast and each hour after for 4 hours following a high-fat meal (63% fat) at baseline and after the high-fat diet using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. Fasting plasma TMAO did not increase significantly following the high-fat diet (1.83 ± 0.21 vs 1.6 ± 0.24 μmol/L). However, plasma TMAO was higher at hour 1 (2.15 ± 0.28 vs 1.7 ± 0.30 μmol/L), hour 2 (2.3 ± 0.29 vs 1.8 ± 0.32 μmol/L), hour 3 (2.4 ± 0.34 vs 1.58 ± 0.19 μmol/L), and hour 4 (2.51 ± 0.33 vs 1.5 ± 0.12 μmol/L) (all P < .05) following the high-fat diet as compared with the baseline postprandial response. In conclusion, a short-term, high-fat diet does not increase fasting plasma TMAO concentrations but appears to increase postprandial TMAO concentrations in healthy, nonobese, young men.

Here, we hypothesized that a combination of luteolin and l-theanine would synergistically act to improve memory function and glucose disturbances in rats infused with amyloid-β, and the mechanisms underlying these actions were investigated. Rats that received an amyloid-β(25-35) infusion into the CA1 region of the hippocampus were fed dextrin (AD-CON), 0.1% luteolin (AD-Lut), 0.2% l-theanine (AD-Thea), or both 0.05% luteolin and 0.1% l-theanine (AD-LuTh) in conjunction with a high-fat diet over 8 weeks. AD-LuTh improved memory function, as determined by water maze and passive avoidance tests, by potentiating the hippocampal insulin signaling and reducing inflammation: Luteolin mainly potentiated insulin signaling via the pAkt➔pGSK➔pTau pathway, and l-theanine primarily reduced tumor necrosis factor-α. In the metabolomics analysis of the hippocampus lysates, the concentration of proline, phenylpyruvic acid, and normetanephrine decreased in the AD-LuTh compared to AD-CON. Norepinephrine contents were lower in the AD-CON than non-AD rats with a high fat diet with 0.2% dextrin, whereas AD-Thea and AD-LuTh inhibited the decrease. Both the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh increased glucose infusion rates and decreased hepatic glucose output under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions, indicating improved whole-body and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Disturbances in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamp were most effectively corrected by the AD-Lut and AD-LuTh treatments. In conclusion, the hypothesis of the study was accepted. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine prevented Alzheimer disease-like symptom, possibly by improving hippocampal insulin signaling, norepinephrine metabolisms, and decreasing neuroinflammation. The combination of luteolin and l-theanine may be a useful therapeutic option for preventing and/or delaying the progression of memory dysfunction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Our results indicate that WD and ART interacted to induce endothelial dysfunction in mesenteric resistance arteries isolated from 7-week-old mice offspring. This was determined by presence of a reduced acetylcholine-induced dilation compared to controls. The arteries from these WD-ART mice also had greater wall cross-sectional areas and wall to lumen ratios indicative of vascular hypertrophic remodeling.

The rat model of diet-induced fetal-neonatal iron deficiency recapitulates the observed neurobehavioral deficits.We sought to establish molecular underpinnings for the persistent psychopathologic effects of early-life iron deficiency by determining whether it permanently reprograms the hippocampal transcriptome. We also assessed the effects of maternal dietary choline supplementation on the offspring's hippocampal transcriptome to identify pathways through which choline mitigates the emergence of long-term cognitive deficits.Male rat pups were made iron deficient (ID) by providing pregnant and nursing dams an ID diet (4 g Fe/kg) from gestational day (G) 2 through postnatal day (PND) 7 and an iron-sufficient (IS) diet (200 g Fe/kg) thereafter. Control pups were provided IS diet throughout. Choline (5 g/kg) was given to half the pregnant dams in each group from G11 to G18. PND65 hippocampal transcriptomes were assayed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and analyzed with the use of knowledge-based Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate a subset of altered genes.Formerly ID rats had altered hippocampal expression of 619 from >10,000 gene loci sequenced by NGS, many of which map onto molecular networks implicated in psychological disorders, including anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia. There were significant interactions between iron status and prenatal choline treatment in influencing gene expression. Choline supplementation reduced the effects of iron deficiency, including those on gene networks associated with autism and schizophrenia.Fetal-neonatal iron deficiency reprograms molecular networks associated with the pathogenesis of neurologic and psychological disorders in adult rats.

Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him.

Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder.

However, the contributions of gestational and early life influences on development of NAFLD and NASH remain poorly appreciated.Two independent studies were performed to examine whether maternal over-nutrition via exposure to high fat diet (HFD) leads to exacerbated hepatic responses to post-natal HFD and methionine choline deficient (MCD) diets in the offspring. Offspring of both control diet- and HFD-fed dams were weaned onto control and HFD, creating four groups.When compared to their control diet-fed littermates, offspring of HF-dams weaned onto HFD gained greater body weight; had increased relative liver weight and showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Similarly, this group revealed significantly greater immune response and pro-fibrogenic gene expression via RNA-seq. In parallel, 7-8 week old offspring were challenged with either control or MCD diets for 3 weeks. Responses to MCD diets were also exacerbated due to maternal HFD as seen by gene expression of classical pro-fibrogenic genes. Quantitative genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of over 1 million CpGs showed persistent epigenetic changes in key genes in tissue development and metabolism (Fgf21, Ppargc1β) with maternal HFD and in cell adhesion and communication (VWF, Ephb2) in the combination of maternal HFD and offspring MCD diets. Maternal HFD also influenced gut microbiome profiles in offspring leading to a decrease in α-diversity. Linear regression analysis revealed association between serum ALT levels and Coprococcus, Coriobacteriacae, Helicobacterioceae and Allobaculum.Our findings indicate that maternal HFD detrimentally alters epigenetic and gut microbiome pathways to favor development of fatty liver disease and its progressive sequelae.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28163318>Adrenal medullary dysfunction as a feature of .</a></h2><p>Although there is strong evidence linking  with increased sympathoneural activity, involvement of the adrenal medulla is less clear. We therefore investigated adrenal medullary function under fasting and feeding conditions in normal weight (NW, n=33), overweight (OW, n=28) and obese (OB, n=36) adults (59% women).Ninety-seven healthy adults participated in a cross-sectional study with recruitment stratified according to BMI.

Nevertheless, it is not clear whether these invertebrate counterparts of norepinephrine are important regulators of metabolic and life history traits. We show that flies (Drosophila melanogaster) lacking OA are more resistant to starvation, while their overall life span is substantially reduced compared with control flies. In addition, these animals have increased body fat deposits, reduced physical activity and a reduced metabolic resting rate. Increasing the release of OA from internal stores induced the opposite effects. Flies devoid of both OA and TA had normal body fat and metabolic rates, suggesting that OA and TA act antagonistically. Moreover, OA-deficient flies show increased insulin release rates. We inferred that the OA-mediated control of insulin release accounts for a substantial proportion of the alterations observed in these flies. Apparently, OA levels control the balance between thrifty and expenditure metabolic modes. Thus, changes in OA levels in response to external and internal signals orchestrate behaviour and metabolic processes to meet physiological needs.

Namely, we estimated the effect of NSE on inflammatory cytokines mRNA level (leukemia cells L1210), cytokines content (serum and LPS-stimulated macrophages) and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (peritoneal macrophages LPS-stimulated and isolated from rats with -induced insulin resistance). The results indicated that NSE dose-dependently inhibits the IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA level in L1210 cells.

Endocannabinoid-mediated signaling modulates brain functions, such as pain, mood, memory, and feeding behavior. The activation of the ECS is associated with overeating and ; however, the expression of components of this system has been only partially studied in the hypothalamus, a critical region implicated in feeding behavior. Within this brain region, anorexigenic, and orexigenic neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) are in close contact with tanycytes, glial radial-like cells that line the lateral walls and floor of the third ventricle (3V). The specific function of tanycytes and the effects of metabolic signals generated by them on adjacent neurons is starting to be elucidated. We have proposed that the ECS within tanycytes modulates ARC neurons, thus modifying food intake. Here, we evaluated the expression and the loss of function of the 2-AG-producing enzyme, diacylglycerol lipase-alpha (DAGLα). Using Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses in basal hypothalamus sections of adult rats under several glycemic conditions, we confirm that DAGLα is strongly expressed at the basal hypothalamus in glial and neuronal cells, increasing further in response to greater extracellular glucose levels. Using a DAGLα-inhibiting adenovirus (shRNA), suppression of DAGLα expression in tanycytes altered the usual response to intracerebroventricular glucose in terms of neuropeptides produced by neurons of the ARC. Thus, these results strongly suggest that the tanycytes could generate 2-AG, which modulates the function of anorexigenic and orexigenic neurons.Copyright © 2019 Palma-Chavez, Konar-Nié, Órdenes, Maurelia, Elizondo-Vega, Oyarce, López, Rojas, Steinberg, García-Robles and Sepúlveda.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25767284>The sympathetic nervous system alterations in human hypertension.</a></h2><p>Several articles have dealt with the importance and mechanisms of the sympathetic nervous system alterations in experimental animal models of hypertension.

Genome wide deletion of Ptp1b, increases leptin sensitivity, protects mice from  and diabetes, but alters cardiovascular function by increasing blood pressure (BP). Leptin-control of metabolism is centrally mediated and involves proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Whether these neurons contribute to leptin-mediated increases in BP remain unclear. We hypothesized that increasing leptin signaling in POMC neurons with Ptp1b deletion will sensitize the cardiovascular system to leptin and enhance neurogenic control of BP. We analyzed the cardiovascular phenotype of Ptp1b+/+ and POMC-Ptp1b-/- mice, at baseline and after 7 days of leptin infusion or sympatho-activation with phenylephrine. POMCPtp1b deletion did not alter baseline cardiovascular hemodynamics (BP, heart rate) but reduced BP response to ganglionic blockade and plasma catecholamine levels that suggests a decreased neurogenic control of BP. In contrast, POMC-Ptp1b deletion increased vascular adrenergic reactivity and aortic α-adrenergic receptors expression. Chronic leptin treatment reduced vascular adrenergic reactivity and blunted diastolic and mean BP increases in POMC-Ptp1b-/- mice only. Similarly POMC-Ptp1b-/- mice exhibited a blunted increased in diastolic and mean BP accompanied by a gradual reduction in adrenergic reactivity in response to chronic vascular sympatho-activation with phenylephrine.

Citrate is imported from the circulation across the plasma membrane into liver cells mainly by the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (NaCT; SLC13A5). Deletion of NaCT from mice led to metabolic changes similar to caloric restriction; therefore, NaCT has been proposed as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of  and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we expressed mouse and human NaCT into Xenopus oocytes and examined some basic functional properties of those transporters. Interestingly, striking differences were found between mouse and human NaCT with respect to their sensitivities to citric acid cycle intermediates as substrates for these transporters. Mouse NaCT had at least 20- to 800-fold higher affinity for these intermediates than human NaCT. Mouse NaCT is fully active at physiologic plasma levels of citrate, but its human counterpart is not. Replacement of extracellular sodium by other monovalent cations revealed that human NaCT was markedly less dependent on extracellular sodium than mouse NaCT. The low sensitivity of human NaCT for citrate raises questions about the translatability of this target from the mouse to the human situation and raises doubts about the validity of this transporter as a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases in humans.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30249323>Effect of Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit on methionine and choline-deficiency diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Phyllanthus emblica L. fruit contains abundant bioactive components and exhibits a variety of biological activities.

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a purified control diet (CON) or purified control diet supplemented with 1% CLA (of total fat), a purified high fat (HF) diet (45%kcal from fat) and a purified HF diet supplemented with 1% CLA (of total fat) (HFCLA). All dams were fed ad libitum throughout pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were fed a standard chow diet from weaning (day 21) until the end of the study (day 150).

An overall effect of a maternal HF diet was observed in adult male vessels with a reduced vasoconstrictor response to phenylephrine and blunted vasodilatory response to acetylcholine (ACh). Furthermore, HF and HFCLA offspring displayed a reduction in nitric oxide pathway function and an increased compensatory EDHF function when compared to CON and CLA groups.

In this review, we summarized the most recent advances in gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms, as well as gut microbiota-targeted therapies on NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274505>Age-related regulation of bone formation by the sympathetic cannabinoid CB1 receptor.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) system, including its receptors, ligands, and their metabolizing enzymes, plays an important role in bone physiology. Skeletal cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor signaling transmits retrograde signals that restrain norepinephrine (NE) release, thus transiently stimulating bone formation following an acute challenge, suggesting a feedback circuit between sympathetic nerve terminals and osteoblasts. To assess the effect of chronic in vivo occurrence of this circuit, we characterized the skeletal phenotype of mice with a conditional deletion of the CB1 receptor in adrenergic/noradrenergic cells, including sympathetic nerves. Whereas the deletion of the CB1 receptor did not affect bone mass accrual in the distal femoral metaphysis and in vertebral bodies of young, 12-week-old mice, it substantially increased bone mass in aged, 35-week-old mutant mice as compared to wild-type controls. Contrary to our expectations, specific deficiency of the CB1 receptor in sympathetic neurons led to a markedly increased bone mass phenotype, associated with an enhanced bone formation rate and reduced osteoclastogenesis. Mechanistically, the reduced skeletal eCB 'tone' in the null mice did not reflect in increased sympathetic tone and reduced bone formation, suggesting that constitutive genetic inactivation of sympathetic CB1 receptor disrupts the negative feedback loop between eCBs and NE signaling in bone.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While it is well-accepted that inflammation is central to NAFLD pathogenesis, the immune pathway(s) orchestrating disease progression are poorly defined. Notably, IL-17RA signaling, via IL-17A, plays an important role in -driven NAFLD pathogenesis. However, the role of the IL-17F, another IL-17RA ligand, in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been examined. Further, the cell types expressing IL-17RA and producing IL-17RA ligands in the pathogenesis of NAFLD have not been defined. Here, IL-17RA-/-, IL-17A-/-, IL-17F-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were fed either standard chow diet or methionine and choline deficient diet (MCDD)--a diet known to induce steatosis and hepatic inflammation through beta-oxidation dysfunction--and hepatic inflammation and NAFLD progression were subsequently quantified. MCDD feeding augmented hepatic IL-17RA expression and significantly increased hepatic infiltration of macrophages and IL-17A and IL-17F producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in WT mice. In contrast, IL-17RA-/-, IL-17A-/-, and IL-17F-/- mice, despite increased steatosis, exhibited significant protection from hepatocellular damage compared to WT controls. Protection from hepatocellular damage correlated with decreased levels of hepatic T-cell and macrophage infiltration and decreased expression of inflammatory mediators associated with NAFLD. In sum, our results indicate that the IL-17 axis also plays a role in a MCDD-induced model of NAFLD pathogenesis. Further, we show for the first time that IL-17F, and not only IL-17A, plays an important role in NAFLD driven inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27323669>The necroptosis-inducing kinase RIPK3 dampens adipose tissue inflammation and glucose intolerance.</a></h2><p>Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) mediates necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that promotes inflammation in various pathological conditions, suggesting that it might be a privileged pharmacological target. However, its function in glucose homeostasis and  has been unknown. Here we show that RIPK3 is over expressed in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese mice fed with a choline-deficient high-fat diet. Genetic inactivation of Ripk3 promotes increased Caspase-8-dependent adipocyte apoptosis and WAT inflammation, associated with impaired insulin signalling in WAT as the basis for glucose intolerance. Similarly to mice, in visceral WAT of obese humans, RIPK3 is overexpressed and correlates with the body mass index and metabolic serum markers. Together, these findings provide evidence that RIPK3 in WAT maintains tissue homeostasis and suppresses inflammation and adipocyte apoptosis, suggesting that systemic targeting of necroptosis might be associated with the risk of promoting insulin resistance in obese patients.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30428553>Satiety Factors Oleoylethanolamide, Stearoylethanolamide, and Palmitoylethanolamide in Mother's Milk Are Strongly Associated with Infant Weight at Four Months of Age-Data from the Odense Child Cohort.</a></h2><p>Regulation of appetite and food intake is partly regulated by -acylethanolamine lipids oleoylethanolamide (OEA), stearoylethanolamide (SEA), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), which induce satiety through endogenous formation in the small intestine upon feeding, but also when orally or systemic administered. OEA, SEA, and PEA are present in human milk, and we hypothesized that the content of OEA, SEA, and PEA in mother's milk differed for infants being heavy (high weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ)) or light (low WAZ) at time of milk sample collection. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentration of OEA, SEA, and PEA in milk samples collected four months postpartum from mothers to high ( = 50) or low ( = 50) WAZ infants. Associations between OEA, SEA, and PEA concentration and infant anthropometry at four months of age as well as growth from birth were investigated using linear and logistic regression analyses, adjusted for birth weight, early infant formula supplementation, and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index. Mean OEA, SEA, and PEA concentrations were lower in the high compared to the low WAZ group (all  < 0.02), and a higher concentration of SEA was associated with lower anthropometric measures, e.g., triceps skinfold thickness (mm) (β = -2.235, 95% CI = -4.04, -0.43,  = 0.016), and weight gain per day since birth (g) (β = -8.169, 95% CI = -15.26, -1.08,  = 0.024).

In the present study, we investigated whether PAF/PAF receptor signaling contributed to chronic inflammation in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of PAF receptor-knockout (PAFR-KO) mice. Body and epididymal WAT weights were higher in PAFR-KO mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) than in wild-type (WT) mice. TNF-α mRNA expression levels in epididymal WAT and the infiltration of CD11c-positive macrophages into epididymal WAT, which led to chronic inflammation, were also elevated in HFD-fed PAFR-KO mice. HFD-fed PAFR-KO mice had higher levels of fasting serum glucose than HFD-fed WT mice as well as impaired glucose tolerance. Although PAF receptor signaling up-regulated the expression of TNF-α and lipopolysaccharide induced the expression of acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2) mRNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages, no significant differences were observed in the expression of LPCAT2 mRNA and PAF levels in epididymal WAT between HFD-fed mice and normal diet-fed mice. In addition to our previous finding in which energy expenditure in PAF receptor (PAFR)-deficient mice was low due to impaired brown adipose tissue function, the present study demonstrated that PAF/PAF receptor signaling up-regulated the expression of Ucp1 mRNA, which is essential for cellular thermogenesis, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We concluded that the marked accumulation of abdominal fat due to HFD feeding led to more severe chronic inflammation in WAT, which is associated with glucose metabolism disorders, in PAFR-KO mice than in WT mice, and PAF/PAF receptor signaling may regulate energy expenditure and adiposity.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Participants had heart rate (HR), blood pressure, resting energy expenditure (REE), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), perceptions about readiness to perform, cognitive function (Stroop Color-Word test), bench and leg press performance (2 sets of 10 repetitions at 70% of 1RM and 1 set to failure), and Wingate anaerobic capacity (WAC) sprint performance determined as well as donated blood samples prior to and/or following exercise/supplementation. Data were analyzed by MANOVA with repeated measures as well as mean changes from baseline with 95% confidence intervals (CI).No clinically significant differences were observed among treatments in HR, blood pressure, ECG, or general clinical blood panels. There was evidence that PWS and PWS + S ingestion promoted greater changes in REE responses. Participants reported higher perception of optimism about performance and vigor and energy with PWS and PWS + S ingestion and there was evidence that PWS and PWS + S improved changes in cognitive function scores from baseline to a greater degree than PLA after 1 or 2 h. However, the scores in the PWS + S treatment did not exceed PLA or PWS responses at any data point. No statistically significant differences were observed among treatments in total bench press lifting volume, leg press lifting volume or WAC sprint performance.Within the confines of this study, ingestion of PWS and/or PWS + S prior to exercise appears to be well-tolerated when consumed by young, healthy individuals. The primary effects appear to be to increase REE responses and improve perceptions about readiness to perform and cognitive function with limited to no effects on muscular endurance and WAC.

The patient was evaluated with [18F]-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography on three occasions: pre-therapy, during α-blockade and postoperatively. During surgery, biopsies of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were obtained and evaluated for brown adipose tissue. At diagnosis, brown adipose tissue glucose uptake, assessed by [18F]-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, was massively increased. [18F]-fludeoxyglucose uptake was confined to known locations for brown adipose tissue, with additional uptake in the visceral adipose tissue. As a result of increased thermogenesis, resting energy expenditure was doubled. After surgical removal of the tumour, antidiabetic medicine was no longer needed, despite an 8.2-kg weight gain.These results show that human visceral adipose tissue holds an unprecedented potential for brown adipogenic differentiation; however, a detrimental effect on glucose metabolism persisted despite massive brown adipose tissue activity, with a doubling of resting energy expenditure.© 2014 The Authors.

This study provides proof-of-concept patient-specific tissue models of human white adipose tissue to accommodate the variability in human samples. Our 3D tissue engineering approach established lipolytic responses and changes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake from small volumes of human lipoaspirate, making this methodology useful for patient specific sample source assessments of treatment strategies, drug responses, disease mechanisms, and other responses that vary between patients. Mature unilocular cells were maintained ex vivo in silk porous scaffolds for up to a month of culture and imaged non-invasively with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Interestingly, differences in responsiveness between tissues were observed in terms of magnitude of lipolysis, ability to suppress lipolysis, differences in glucose uptake, and lipid droplet size. Body mass index was not a factor in determining tissue responsiveness; rather, it is speculated that other unknown variables in the backgrounds of different patients (ethnicity, athleticism, disease history, lifestyle choices, etc.) likely had a more significant effect on the observed differences. This study reinforces the need to account for the variability in backgrounds and genetics within the human population to determine adipose tissue responsiveness. In the future, this tissue system could be used to inform individualized care strategies-enhancing therapeutic precision, improving patient outcomes, and reducing clinical costs.Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28215162>Gut-brain Axis: Role of Lipids in the Regulation of Inflammation, Pain and CNS Diseases.</a></h2><p>The human gut is a composite anaerobic environment with a large, diverse and dynamic enteric microbiota, represented by more than 100 trillion microorganisms, including at least 1000 distinct species. The discovery that a different microbial composition can influence behavior and cognition, and in turn the nervous system can indirectly influence enteric microbiota composition, has significantly contributed to establish the well-accepted concept of gut-brain axis. This hypothesis is supported by several evidence showing mutual mechanisms, which involve the vague nerve, the immune system, the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis modulation and the bacteria-derived metabolites. Many studies have focused on delineating a role for this axis in health and disease, ranging from stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson Disease, Alzheimer's Disease etc. Based on this background, and considering the relevance of alteration of the symbiotic state between host and microbiota, this review focuses on the role and the involvement of bioactive lipids, such as the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) family whose main members are N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoilethanolamide (OEA), and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, belonging to a large group of bioactive lipids able to modulate peripheral and central pathologic processes. Their effective role has been studied in inflammation, acute and chronic pain,  and central nervous system diseases. A possible correlation has been shown between these lipids and gut microbiota through different mechanisms. Indeed, systemic administration of specific bacteria can reduce abdominal pain through the involvement of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the rat; on the other hand, PEA reduces inflammation markers in a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and butyrate, producted by gut microbiota, is effective in reducing inflammation and pain in irritable bowel syndrome and IBD animal models. In this review, we underline the relationship among inflammation, pain, microbiota and the different lipids, focusing on a possible involvement of NAEs and SCFAs in the gut-brain axis and their role in the central nervous system diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27669020>Wild blueberry consumption attenuates local inflammation in the perivascular adipose tissue of obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has been shown to play important roles in regulating vascular tone and linking local and systemic vascular inflammation. We examined the impact of PVAT on phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction in the aorta of obese Zucker rats (OZR) and their lean littermates (LZR) by comparing aortic rings with or without PVAT. Subsequently we placed OZR and LZR on a control (C) or an 8% wild blueberry (WB) diet and evaluated the effect of WB consumption on such response. PVAT-released adipokine concentrations were also measured as a function of WB diet. Maximal constrictor force (Fmax) in aortic rings without PVAT was significantly lower in OZR-C compared with LZR-C (0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.06 g, respectively). Following WB diet, Fmax significantly increased in OZR (0.54 ± 0.06 g). In aortas with intact PVAT, Fmax was significantly lower in all groups (0.31 ± 0.06 OZR-C, 0.30 ± 0.05 OZR-WB, 0.29 ± 0.03 LZR-C, and 0.30 ± 0.04 g LZR-WB), but no difference was observed between treatments. PVAT concentrations of monocyte chemoactractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and adiponectin were significantly higher in OZR compared with LZR (+102%, +108%, and +45%, respectively). Following WB diet, PVAT concentrations of interleukin-8 were significantly lower in both OZR (-37%) and LZR (-30%), while adiponectin concentrations significantly increased in both OZR (+11%) and LZR (+16%). MCP-1 concentrations significantly decreased (-31%) in the PVAT of OZR with the WB diet.

However, it is not known whether amfepramone produces immediate vascular effects when applied in vitro to rat aortic rings and, if so, what mechanisms may be involved. We analyzed the effect of amfepramone on phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings with or without endothelium and the influence of inhibitors or blockers on this effect. Amfepramone produced a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings that was not affected by the vehicle, atropine, 4-AP, glibenclamide, indomethacin, clotrimazole, or cycloheximide. The vasorelaxant effect of amfepramone was significantly attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and tetraethylammonium (TEA), and was blocked by removal of the vascular endothelium.

Using a mouse model of maternal , we assessed the effect of maternal choline supplementation on preventing fetal overgrowth and restoring placental macronutrient homeostasis. C57BL/6J mice were fed either a high-fat (HF, 60% kcal from fat) diet or a normal (NF, 10% kcal from fat) diet with a drinking supply of either 25 mM choline chloride or control purified water, respectively, beginning 4 weeks prior to mating until gestational day 12.5. Fetal and placental weight, metabolites and gene expression were measured. HF feeding significantly (P<.05) increased placental and fetal weight in the HF-control (HFCO) versus NF-control (NFCO) animals, whereas the HF choline-supplemented (HFCS) group effectively normalized placental and fetal weight to the levels of the NFCO group. Compared to HFCO, the HFCS group had lower (P<.05) glucose transporter 1 and fatty acid transport protein 1 expression as well as lower accumulation of glycogen in the placenta. The HFCS group also had lower (P<.05) placental 4E-binding protein 1 and ribosomal protein s6 phosphorylation, which are indicators of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activation favoring macronutrient anabolism.

Under normal conditions, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β-adrenergic stimulation partly depends on increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we investigated the interplay between beta-adrenergic signaling, ROS and cardiac contractility using freshly isolated cardiomyocytes and whole hearts from two mouse models with the metabolic syndrome (high-fat diet and ob/ob mice). We hypothesized that cardiomyocytes of mice with the metabolic syndrome would experience excessive ROS levels that trigger cellular dysfunctions. Fluorescent dyes and confocal microscopy were used to assess mitochondrial ROS production, cellular Ca2+ handling and contractile function in freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescence, western blot and enzyme assay were used to study protein biochemistry. Unexpectedly, our results point towards decreased cardiac ROS signaling in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome because: β-adrenergic-induced increases in the amplitude of intracellular Ca2+ signals were insensitive to antioxidant treatment; mitochondrial ROS production showed decreased basal rate and smaller response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, control hearts and hearts with the metabolic syndrome showed similar basal levels of ROS-mediated protein modification, but only control hearts showed increases after β-adrenergic stimulation. In conclusion, in contrast to the situation in control hearts, the cardiomyocyte response to acute β-adrenergic stimulation does not involve increased mitochondrial ROS production in a stable, chronic phase of the metabolic syndrome.

Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that elevated NA signalling may be involved in the aetiology of major diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus. 2 The molecular pathways by which NA may cause the manifestation of disease remain poorly understood, although they may include G protein-coupled receptor modulation of the Ras/MAP kinase, Stat3 and PI3K pathways, among others. In both individual animals and humans, NA tone may be elevated largely due to genetics, but also because of the exposure to marked psychological stress or trauma, or other environmental factors. 3 As NA is involved in the 'fight or flight' response by the sympathetic nervous system, this transmitter may be elevated in a large number of organisms due to evolutionary selection of enhancing responses to immediate environmental dangers. Likewise, acetylcholine signalling by the parasympathetic ('rest and digest') nervous system may be relatively diminished. This putative autonomic imbalance may result in diminished engagement in homeostatic processes, resulting in the emergence and progression of a number of diseases throughout the body. 4 In this scenario, a large number of individuals may benefit from chronic use of pharmacological agents - such as clonidine, guanfacine, propranolol or prazosin - that diminish NA signalling throughout the body. If so, NA transmission lowering drugs may protect against a wide range of diseases.© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827058>Pioglitazone treatment enhances the sympathetic nervous system response to oral carbohydrate load in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance is associated with blunted sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response to carbohydrate ingestion which may contribute to postprandial hypotension and impaired body weight homeostasis.This study was conducted to examine the effects of pharmacological insulin sensitization on whole-body norepinephrine kinetics during a standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in obese, insulin resistant subjects with metabolic syndrome.Un-medicated individuals (n=42, mean age 56±0.8 yrs, body mass index 34±0.6 kg/m(2)) were randomised to 12-weeks pioglitazone (PIO, 15 mg for 6 weeks, then 30 mg daily) or placebo using a double-blind, parallel group design. Whole-body norepinephrine kinetics (arterial norepinephrine concentration, calculated spillover and clearance rates), spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate and blood pressure were measured at times 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes during OGTT. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (M) and Matsuda index.PIO increased clamp derived glucose utilisation by 35% (P<0.001) and there were concurrent reductions in inflammatory status and plasma triglycerides (P<0.05). Fasting norepinephrine kinetic parameters were unaltered. PIO treatment was associated with lower plasma insulin incursions, greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure and enhanced baroreflex sensitivity during OGTT (P all <0.05). The overall norepinephrine spillover response (AUC(0-120)) increased significantly in the PIO group (group × time interaction, P=0.04), with greatest increment at 30 minutes post-glucose (101±38 ng/min at baseline versus 241±48 ng/min post treatment, P=0.04) and correlated with percent improvement in M.PIO enhances the early postprandial SNS response to carbohydrate ingestion.ClinicalTrials.gov .Copyright © 2015.

It is associated with nausea, vomiting, and fetal acidosis. Previous research on phenylephrine excluded obese subjects. We compared the incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) in obese patients who received a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion vs those who received bolus dosing for the treatment of spinal-induced hypotension.In this multicentre, double-blinded randomized controlled trial, 160 obese women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion initiated at 50 μg·min (and titrated according to a predefined algorithm) or 100 μg phenylephrine boluses to treat hypotension. Maternal systolic blood pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline. The primary study outcome was the incidence of IONV.Intraoperative nausea and vomiting were significantly reduced in the infusion group compared to the bolus group (46% vs 75%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.80; P < 0.001). This was associated with significantly reduced need for intraoperative rescue antiemetics (26% vs 42%, respectively; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.97; P = 0.04), but no difference in the incidence of vomiting. Postoperative vomiting at two hours was reduced in the infusion group (11% vs 25%; RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.90; P = 0.02);however, there were no differences in the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea, need for rescue antiemetics at two hours and 24 hr, or the incidence of postoperative vomiting at 24 hr.In obese women undergoing Cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia, prophylactic phenylephrine infusion was associated with less intraoperative nausea, less need for rescue antiemetics, and reduced early postoperative vomiting.www.clinicaltrials.gov ().

Both are important to maintain health including adequate lipid metabolism. Supplementation of dietary choline and betaine increase muscle mass and reduce body fat in animals. However, little data is available regarding the role of dietary choline and betaine on body composition in humans.To investigate the association between dietary choline and betaine intakes with body composition in a large population based cross-sectional study.A total of 3214 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study were assessed. Dietary choline and betaine intakes were computed from the Willett Food Frequency questionnaire. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry following a 12-hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses.Significantly inverse correlations were found between dietary choline and betaine intakes, with all  measurements: total percent body fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), percent android fat (%AF), percent gynoid fat (%GF) and anthropometrics: weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio in both women and men (r range from -0.13 to -0.47 for choline and -0.09 to -0.26 for betaine, p<0.001 for all). Dietary choline intake had stronger association than betaine.

Vice versa, when subjects were ranked according to dietary choline and betaine intakes, subjects with the highest intake of both had the lowest %TF, %AF, %GF, %BF and highest %LM among the groups in both sexes.Our findings indicate that high dietary choline and betaine intakes are significantly associated with favorable body composition in humans.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120922>Induction of beige adipocytes by naturally occurring β3-adrenoceptor agonist p-synephrine.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of  and its associated diseases is increasing worldwide, and the therapeutic potential of increasing energy expenditure through differentiation or activation of beige adipocytes has attracted much interest. Therefore, we explored naturally occurring compounds that induce beige adipocytes by screening for activity to induce mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells cultured in beige adipocyte differentiation medium. Through screening, p-synephrine, a compound isolated from Citrus unshiu Marcov., was found to be an active compound that increased UCP1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner from a concentration of 3.12 µM, which induced morphological changes specific for beige adipocytes. Similar effects were also observed in SVF cells prepared from db/db obese mice. While investigating the underlying mechanism of p-synephrine-induced beige adipocyte differentiation, we found that the effects of p-synephrine were abolished by the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR58894. Intriguingly, p-synephrine increased UCP1 mRNA levels in SVF cells cultured in beige adipocyte differentiation medium lacking insulin to an extent different from those by the β-agonist isoprenaline. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 decreased isoprenaline-induced UCP1 mRNA levels in the early phase of beige adipocyte differentiation and p-synephrine-induced UCP1 mRNA levels in fully differentiated beige adipocytes. Thus, p-synephrine appears to elicit signals via β3-adrenoceptor combined with some part of the insulin signaling pathway, finally resulting in efficient stimulation of beige adipocyte differentiation with the support of certain beige adipocyte differentiation-inducing factors. The present results suggest the potential of p-synephrine for prophylaxis and treatment of  and its associated diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results of this work showed a rise in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1 n-9) and a reduction in the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (20:4 n-6) in plasma of rats with experimental IR. These findings are accompanied by the increased TNFα production and significant changes in plasma lipoprotein profile of rats with the fat overload. Particularly, a decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level and increased low-density (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol level were detected. The NSE administration to obese rats with IR restored the content of mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, increased HDL cholesterol content and reduced LDL cholesterol level. In addition, the IR rats treated with NSE showed normalization in the serum TNFα level. Our results showed the restoration of plasma lipid profile under NSE administration in rats with -induced IR.

Adenosine and A receptor (A2AR) agonism activate BAT in rodents, and endogenous adenosine is released locally in BAT as a by-product of noradrenaline, but physiological data from humans is lacking. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of exogenous adenosine on human BAT perfusion, and to determine the density of A2ARs in human BAT in vivo for the first time, using PET/CT imaging.Healthy, lean men (n = 10) participated in PET/CT imaging with two radioligands. Perfusion of BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle was quantified with [O]HO at baseline, during cold exposure and during intravenous administration of adenosine. A2AR density of the tissues was quantified with [C]TMSX at baseline and during cold exposure.Adenosine increased the perfusion of BAT even more than cold exposure (baseline 8.3 ± 4.5, cold 19.6 ± 9.3, adenosine 28.6 ± 7.9 ml/100 g/min, p < 0.01). Distribution volume of [C]TMSX in BAT was significantly lower during cold exposure compared to baseline. In cold, low [C]TMSX binding coincided with high concentrations of noradrenaline.Adenosine administration caused a maximal perfusion effect in human supraclavicular BAT, indicating increased oxidative metabolism. Cold exposure increased noradrenaline concentrations and decreased the density of A2AR available for radioligand binding in BAT, suggesting augmented release of endogenous adenosine. Our results show that adenosine and A2AR are relevant for activation of human BAT, and A2AR provides a future target for enhancing BAT metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875318>Influence of gut microbiota on the development and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, with or without fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH has increased with the  epidemic, but its etiology is multifactorial. The current studies suggest the role of gut microbiota in the development and progression of NASH. The aim is to review the studies that investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and NASH. These review also discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms and the influence of diet on the gut-liver axis.The available literature has proposed mechanisms for an association between gut microbiota and NASH, such as: modification energy homeostasis, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-endotoxemia, increased endogenous production of ethanol, and alteration in the metabolism of bile acid and choline. There is evidence to suggest that NASH patients have a higher prevalence of bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine and changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. However, there is still a controversy regarding the microbiome profile in this population. The abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum may be increased, decreased, or unaltered in NASH patients. There is an increase in the Escherichia and Bacteroides genus. There is depletion of certain taxa, such as Prevotella and Faecalibacterium.Although few studies have evaluated the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with NASH, it is observed that these individuals have a distinct gut microbiota, compared to the control groups, which explains, at least in part, the genesis and progression of the disease through multiple mechanisms. Modulation of the gut microbiota through diet control offers new challenges for future studies.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29996143>No Protective Effect of Constitutive Activation of AMPK in Endothelial Cells on Vascular Function in Aged Obese Mice but Augmented α1-Adrenergic Contractions in Renal Arteries Reversible by Weight Loss.</a></h2><p>Aging, , and diabetes favor vascular dysfunction.

In 14 obese female T2D subjects, or 14 obese non-T2D controls, glycerol concentration was measured in response to the α1,2,ß-agonist norepinephrine, the α1-agonist norfenefrine and the ß2-agonist terbutaline (each 10-4 M), using the microdialysis technique. After 60 minutes of stimulation, an intravenous glucose load (0.5 g/kg lean body mass) was given. Local blood flow was monitored by means of the ethanol technique. Norepinephrine and norfenefrine induced a four and three fold rise in glycerol dialysate concentration (p<0.001, each), with a similar pattern in adipose tissue. Following agonist stimulation and glucose infusion, endogenous insulin release inhibited lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine, which was more rapid and pronounced in healthy obese controls than in T2D subjects (p = 0.024 obese vs T2D subjects). Insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis in the presence of norfenefrine was similar in all study participants. In the presence of terbutaline the lipolysis rate increased two fold until the effect of endogenous insulin (p<0.001). A similar insulin-induced decrease in lipolysis was observed for each of the norfenefrine groups and the terbutaline groups, respectively. Adipose tissue blood flow remained unchanged after the iv-glucose load. Both norepinephrine and norfenefrine diminished blood flow slightly, but insulin reversed this response (p<0.001 over the entire time). Terbutaline alone and terbutaline plus increased endogenous insulin augmented local blood flow (p<0.001 over the entire time). In conclusion, a difference in insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis was observed in obese T2D subjects compared to obese healthy controls following modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity and is assumed to be due to ß1-adrenoceptor mediated stimulation by norepinephrine.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676800>Excess subcutaneous tissue may preclude intramuscular delivery when using adrenaline autoinjectors in patients with anaphylaxis.</a></h2><p>Intramuscular adrenaline is the gold standard treatment for anaphylaxis.

Dysregulation of these systems contributes to stress-related diseases such as human , but their interrelation remains unclear. The study was aimed to test for the first time in vivo whether central noradrenergic activity quantitatively indexed by the availability of the presynaptic NA transporter (NAT) is associated with HPA axis responsiveness as measured with the combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin releasing hormone stimulation (dex/CRH) test and copeptin as a surrogate marker of the serum AVP tone in highly obese, otherwise, healthy individuals compared to age- and sex-matched non-obese, healthy controls. In order to assess central NAT availability, positron emission tomography (PET) was applied using the NAT-selective radiotracer S,S-[C]O-methylreboxetine (MRB) and correlated with curve indicators derived from the dex/CRH test (maximum, MAX, and area under the curve, AUC, for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) as well as with copeptin. In non-obese controls, positive correlations were found between the NAT distribution volume ratios (DVR) of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala with the HPA response (OFC: ACTH r = 0.87, p = .001; cortisol r = 0.86, p = .002; amygdala: ACTH r = 0.86, p = .002; cortisol r = 0.79, p = .006), while in , the hypothalamic DVR correlated inversely with the HPA axis response (cortisol, r = -0.66, p = .04) and with copeptin (r = -0.71, p = .02). This association of central NAT availability with HPA axis responsiveness and copeptin suggests a mechanistic interaction between noradrenergic transmission with HPA axis activity and the serum AVP system that differs between non-obese individuals with prefrontal-limbic involvement and  with a hypothalamic-centered relationship.

Hepatocyte-specific Notch loss-of-function mouse models showed attenuated NASH-associated liver fibrosis, demonstrating causality to -induced liver pathology. Conversely, forced activation of hepatocyte Notch induced fibrosis in both chow- and NASH diet-fed mice by increasing Sox9-dependent Osteopontin (Opn) expression and secretion from hepatocytes, which activate resident hepatic stellate cells. In a cross-sectional study, we found that OPN explains the positive correlation between liver Notch activity and fibrosis stage in patients. Further, we developed a Notch inhibitor [ antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO)] that reduced fibrosis in NASH diet-fed mice.

All patients received 10 mg intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine coadministered with 10 μg fentanyl. Dermatomal levels were assessed at 5 and 25 minutes after SA, and at completion of surgery, using light touch and cold sensation in response to ethyl chloride. The primary outcomes were phenylephrine requirement in the first 30 minutes after SA, and maximum block height, measured by the sensation of touch and cold. Secondary outcomes were total phenylephrine dose required, changes in hand grip strength, and peak flow rate.There were no significant between-group differences in median block height as assessed by touch at 5 or 25 minutes or by temperature at 5 minutes. At 25 minutes, there was a 2-dermatome difference in median block height for loss of temperature sensation between group O and group N (T2 vs T4, 95% confidence interval [CI] of the difference in medians 0-2 dermatomes). No blocks extended to cervical dermatomes. The median (range) phenylephrine dose for the first 30 minutes was 150 µg (0-900 µg), and 100 µg (0-1250 µg) in group N and group O, respectively. The 95% CI for the difference between the 2 median doses was -150 µg to 100 µg. There were no differences in median percentage reductions in peak flow rate or median hand grip strength after SA. Mean surgical time was longer in group O than in group N (49.1 vs 39.4 min, 95% CI difference 1.7-17.7 min).

We used Kvβ1.1 knockout (KO) or wild-type (WT) mice and established that Kvβ1.1 preferentially binds with Kv4.2 and senses the pyridine nucleotide changes in the heart. The cellular action potential duration (APD) obtained from WT cardiomyocytes showed longer APDs with lactate perfusion, which increases intracellular NADH levels, while the APDs remained unaltered in the Kvβ1.1 KO. Ex vivo monophasic action potentials showed a similar response, in which the APDs were prolonged in WT mouse hearts with lactate perfusion; however, the Kvβ1.1 KO mouse hearts did not show APD changes upon lactate perfusion. COS-7 cells coexpressing Kv4.2 and Kvβ1.1 were used for whole cell patch-clamp recordings to evaluate changes caused by NADH (lactate). These data reveal that Kvβ1.1 is required in the mediated inactivation of Kv4.2 currents, when NADH (lactate) levels are increased. In vivo, isoproterenol infusion led to increased NADH in the heart along with QTc prolongation in wild-type mice; regardless of the approach, our data show that Kvβ1.1 recognizes NADH changes and modulates Kv4.2 currents affecting AP and QTc durations. Overall, this study uses multiple levels of investigation, including the heterologous overexpression system, cardiomyocyte, ex vivo, and ECG, and clearly depicts that Kvβ1.1 is an obligatory sensor of NADH/NAD changes in vivo, with a physiological role in the heart. Cardiac electrical activity is mediated by ion channels, and Kv4.2 plays a significant role, along with its binding partner, the Kvβ1.1 subunit. In the present study, we identify Kvβ1.1 as a sensor of pyridine nucleotide changes and as a modulator of Kv4.2 gating, action potential duration, and ECG in the mouse heart.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25716573>Excess intake of fat and sugar potentiates epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia in male rats.</a></h2><p>Over the past five decades, per capita caloric intake has increased significantly, and diet- and stress-related diseases are more prevalent.

Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused metabolic problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol. Together, our findings indicate that inflamed dysfunctional adipocytes are critical in NMS, supporting the development of anti-inflammatory agents as potential therapeutic drugs for treating NMS.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28075064>Efficacy of nebivolol-valsartan single-pill combination in obese and nonobese patients with hypertension.</a></h2><p>Antihypertensive efficacy of single-pill combinations (SPCs) consisting of a β -selective adrenergic blocker with vasodilatory properties via β -agonism (nebivolol) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) was demonstrated in an 8-week phase 3 trial ().

In phase 1, 1,264 participants aged 18 to 75 years with self-reported current wheeze and breathlessness were identified from a random population sample of 16,459. In phase 2, 451 participants attended for detailed assessment, including responsiveness to inhaled salbutamol and ipratropium bromide. In phase 3, 168 steroid-naive participants were enrolled in a 12-week trial of inhaled budesonide. Cluster analysis was performed in 389 participants who completed phase 2 with full data. Treatment responsiveness was compared between phenotypes.Cluster analysis identified 5 phenotypes: moderate-to-severe childhood-onset atopic asthma, asthma-COPD overlap, obese-comorbid, mild childhood-onset atopic asthma, and mild intermittent. Bronchodilation after salbutamol was equal to or greater than that after ipratropium for all phenotypes. The moderate-to-severe childhood-onset atopic asthma, asthma-COPD overlap, and obese-comorbid phenotypes had greater efficacy with inhaled corticosteroid treatment than the mild intermittent group.Cluster analysis of adults with symptomatic airflow obstruction identifies 5 disease phenotypes, including asthma-COPD overlap and obese-comorbid phenotypes, and provides evidence that patients with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome might benefit from inhaled corticosteroid therapy.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

ZF or lean rats received diet supplemented or not with Provinols for 8 weeks. Vasoconstriction in response to phenylephrine (Phe) was then assessed in small mesenteric arteries (SMA) and the aorta with emphasis on the contribution of cyclooxygenases (COX). Although no difference in vasoconstriction was observed between ZF and lean rats both in SMA and the aorta, Provinols affected the contribution of COX-derived vasoconstrictor agents. The nonselective COX inhibitor, indomethacin, reduced vasoconstriction in vessels from both groups; however, lower efficacy was observed in Provinols-treated rats. This was associated with a reduction in thromboxane-A2 and 8-isoprostane release. The selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS398, reduced to the same extent vasoconstriction in aortas from ZF and Provinols-treated ZF rats. However, NS398 reduced response to Phe only in SMA from ZF rats. This was associated with a reduction in 8-isoprostane and prostaglandin-E release. Paradoxically, Provinols decreased COX-2 expression in the aorta, while it increased its expression in SMA. We provide here evidence of a subtle and paradoxical regulation of COX pathway by Provinols vessels from obese rats to maintain vascular tone within a physiological range.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27672060>Disruption of beta3 adrenergic receptor increases susceptibility to DIO in mouse.</a></h2><p>The brown adipose tissue (BAT) mediates adaptive changes in metabolic rate by responding to the sympathetic nervous system through β-adrenergic receptors (AR). Here, we wished to define the role played by the ARβ isoform in this process. This study focused on the ARβ knockout mice (ARβKO), including responsiveness to cold exposure, diet-induced , intolerance to glucose, dyslipidaemia and lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT). ARβKO mice defend core temperature during cold exposure (4°C for 5 h), with faster BAT thermal response to norepinephrine (NE) infusion when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Despite normal BAT thermogenesis, ARβKO mice kept on a high-fat diet (HFD; 40% fat) for 8 weeks exhibited greater susceptibility to diet-induced , markedly increased epididymal adipocyte area with clear signs of inflammation. The HFD-induced glucose intolerance was similar in both groups but serum hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were less intense in ARβKO animals when compared with WT controls. Isoproterenol-induced lipolysis in isolated white adipocytes as assessed by glycerol release was significantly impaired in ARβKO animals despite normal expression of key proteins involved in lipid metabolism. In conclusion, ARβ inactivation does not affect BAT thermogenesis but increases susceptibility to diet-induced  by dampening WAT lipolytic response to adrenergic stimulation.© 2016 Society for Endocrinology.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26827989>-induced p53 activation in insulin-dependent and independent tissues is inhibited by beta-adrenergic agonist in diet-induced obese rats.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to assay the role of beta-adrenergic receptor signaling in the regulation of -induced p53 in high fat feeding obese rats.The role of beta-adrenergic receptor/cyclic AMP in the regulation of p53 and its downstream mediators was evaluated by western blot and real-time quantitative RT-PCR among diet induced rats.Beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, and an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, at a single dose significantly reduced insulin resistance consistent with a decrease in total and phospho-p53 levels in insulin and non-insulin metabolic target tissues. The decrease of p53 signaling was consistent with the elevation of AKT and subsequent activation. Obese rats exposed to fasting also exhibited improvement in insulin action despite a slight effect on p53 level.Results of the present study obviously showed that beta-adrenergic receptor agonist/cAMP prevented -induced p53 activation.

In addition, associations of several metabolic complications like insulin resistance, , dyslipidemia and psychological co-morbidities are well known in PCOS. One of the major factors influencing mood and the emotional state of mind is neurotransmitters. Also, these neurotransmitters are very crucial for GnRH release. Hence, the current study investigates the status of neurotransmitters in PCOS.A PCOS rat model was developed using testosterone. Twenty-one-day-old rats were subcutaneously injected with 10 mg/kg body weight of testosterone propionate (TP) for 35 days. The animals were validated for PCOS characteristics by monitoring estrus cyclicity, serum testosterone and estradiol levels and by histological examination of ovarian sections. Neurotransmitter estimation was carried out using fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods.TP-treated animals demonstrated increased serum testosterone levels with unaltered estradiol content, disturbed estrus cyclicity and many peripheral cysts in the ovary compared to control rats mimicking human PCOS. Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, serotonin, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and epinephrine levels were significantly low in TP-induced PCOS rats compared to control ones, whereas the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the PCOS brain was markedly elevated.Neurotransmitter alteration could be one of the reasons for disturbed gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, consequently directing the ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. Also, decrease in neurotransmitters, mainly NE, serotonin and dopamine (DA) attributes to mood disorders like depression and anxiety in PCOS.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28435500>Skin to Intramuscular Compartment Thigh Measurement by Ultrasound in Pediatric Population.</a></h2><p>Pediatric  threatens the efficacy of medications given intramuscularly.

Secreted FABP4 as a novel adipokine leads to insulin resistance via increased hepatic glucose production (HGP). Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors decrease blood glucose level via increased urinary glucose excretion, though HGP is enhanced. Here we investigated whether canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, modulates serum FABP4 level.Canagliflozin (100 mg/day) was administered to type 2 diabetic patients (n = 39) for 12 weeks. Serum FABP4 level was measured before and after treatment.At baseline, serum FABP4 level was correlated with adiposity, renal dysfunction and noradrenaline level. Treatment with canagliflozin significantly decreased adiposity and levels of fasting glucose and HbA1c but increased average serum FABP4 level by 10.3% (18.0 ± 1.0 vs. 19.8 ± 1.2 ng/ml, P = 0.008), though elevation of FABP4 level after treatment was observed in 26 (66.7%) out of 39 patients. Change in FABP4 level was positively correlated with change in levels of fasting glucose (r = 0.329, P = 0.044), HbA1c (r = 0.329, P = 0.044) and noradrenaline (r = 0.329, P = 0.041) but was not significantly correlated with change in adiposity or other variables.Canagliflozin paradoxically increases serum FABP4 level in some diabetic patients despite amelioration of glucose metabolism and adiposity reduction, possibly via induction of catecholamine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes. Increased FABP4 level by canagliflozin may undermine the improvement of glucose metabolism and might be a possible mechanism of increased HGP by inhibition of SGLT2.UMIN-CTR Clinical Trial UMIN000018151.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29127233>Vascular endothelial function masks increased sympathetic vasopressor activity in rats with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>Sympathetic hyperactivation, a common feature of  and metabolic syndrome, is a key trigger of hypertension. However, some obese subjects with autonomic imbalance present a dissociation between sympathetic activity-mediated vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Here, we aimed to determine in a rat model of metabolic syndrome whether the endothelium endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-NO pathway contributes to counteract the vasopressor effect of the sympathetic system. Rats were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 15 wk. Sympathovagal balance was evaluated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability and plasmatic catecholamine measurements. Blood pressure was measured in the presence or absence of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit the contribution of eNOS. Vascular reactivity was assessed on isolated aortic rings in response to α-adrenergic agonist. The HFS diet increased sympathetic tone, which is characterized by a higher low on the high-frequency spectral power ratio and a higher plasmatic concentration of epinephrine. Despite this, no change in blood pressure was observed. Interestingly, HFS rats exhibited vascular hyporeactivity (-23.6%) to α-adrenergic receptor stimulation that was abolished by endothelial removal or eNOS inhibition (l-NAME). In addition, eNOS phosphorylation (Ser) was increased in response to phenylephrine in HFS rats only. Accordingly, eNOS inhibition in vivo revealed higher blood pressure in HFS rats compared with control rats (147 vs. 126 mmHg for mean blood pressure, respectively). Restrain of adrenergic vasopressor action by endothelium eNOS is increased in HFS rats and contributes to maintained blood pressure in the physiological range. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite the fact that prohypertensive sympathetic nervous system activity is markedly increased in rats with early metabolic syndrome, they present with normal blood pressure. These observations appear to be explained by increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase response to adrenergic stimulation, which results in vascular hyporeactivity to α-adrenergic stimulation, and therefore blood pressure is preserved in the physiological range.

Inconsistencies in the association of plasma N-acylethanolamines with human  and cardiometabolic risk have emerged among previous studies, possibly caused by heterogeneous cohorts and designs, and by unstandardized N-acylethanolamine measurements. We aimed to characterize changes in the plasma profile, including N-acylethanolamine levels and ratios associated with , menopause in women, and ageing in men, and to define the significance of such a profile as a biomarker for metabolic imbalance.Adult, drug-free women (n = 103 premenopausal and n = 81 menopausal) and men (n = 144) were stratified according to the body mass index (BMI) into normal weight (NW; BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m), overweight (OW; BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m), and obese (OB; BMI ≥30.0 kg/m). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were determined. Validated blood processing and analytical procedures for N-acylethanolamine measurements were used. We investigated the effect of BMI and menopause in women, and BMI and age in men, as well as the BMI-independent influence of metabolic parameters on the N-acylethanolamine profile.BMI and waist circumference directly associated with AEA in women and men, and with PEA in premenopausal women and in men, while BMI directly associated with OEA in premenopausal women and in men. BMI, in both genders, and waist circumference, in women only, inversely associated with PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA. Menopause increased N-acylethanolamine levels, whereas ageing resulted in increasing OEA relative abundance in men. AEA and OEA abundances in premenopausal, and PEA and OEA abundances in lean menopausal women, were directly associated with hypertension. Conversely, PEA and OEA abundances lowered with hypertension in elderly men. Insulin resistance was associated with changes in N-acylethanolamine ratios specific for premenopausal (reduced PEA/AEA and OEA/AEA), menopausal (reduced OEA/AEA) women and men (reduced OEA/AEA and OEA/PEA). PEA and OEA levels increased with total cholesterol, and OEA abundance specifically increased with HDL-cholesterol. Elevated triglyceride levels were associated with increased N-acylethanolamine levels only in menopausal women.-related N-acylethanolamine hypertone is characterized by imbalanced N-acylethanolamine ratios. The profile given by a combination of N-acylethanolamine absolute levels and ratios enables imbalances to be identified in relationship with different metabolic parameters, with specific relevance according to gender, menopause and age, representing a useful means for monitoring metabolic health. Finally, N-acylethanolamine system appears a promising target for intervention strategies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Therefore, we developed and validated the first murine model of VSG that recapitulates the blood pressure-lowering effect of VSG using gold-standard radiotelemetry technology.

Oleuropein aglycone (OA) is a major phenolic compound in extra virgin olive oil and the absorbed form of oleuropein. We aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the nutritional effects of oleuropein and OA on interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) in rats with high-fat (HF) diet-induced  by examining the agonistic activity of oleuropein and OA toward the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HF (palm oil 30% wt:wt) diet alone or with oleuropein (HF-O, 1 g/kg diet) for 28 days. In rats fed HF-O compared to HF, urinary noradrenaline, adrenaline and UCP1 levels in IBAT were significantly higher, whereas plasma leptin levels and the total weight of the abdominal cavity adipose tissue were significantly lower. In anaesthetized 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, the OA (3.8 mg of intravenous injection)-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline secretion was suppressed by TRPA1 or TRPV1 antagonist and by a β2- or β3-adrenoceptor antagonist. Furthermore, OA-activated rat and human TRPV1s expressed on HEK293 cells at the same level as zingerone (pungent component in ginger). OA also activated humanTRPA1, and its potency was approximately 10-fold stronger than that for TRPV1. These findings suggest that OA is the agonist of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 and that OA enhances UCP1 expression in IBAT with a concomitant decrease in the visceral fat mass of HF-diet-induced obese rats through enhanced noradrenaline secretion via β-adrenergic action following TRPA1 and TRPV1 activation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Simultaneous measurements of intracellular Ca ([Ca]) and tension were performed in MA from OZR and compared to lean Zucker rats (LZR), and the effects of selective inhibitors of PI3K, ERK-MAPK kinase and PKC were assessed on the functional responses of VSM voltage-dependent L-type Ca channels (Ca1.2). Increases in [Ca] induced by α-adrenoceptor activation and high K depolarization were not different in arteries from LZR and OZR although vasoconstriction was enhanced in OZR. Blockade of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and of Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) markedly reduced depolarization-induced Ca responses in arteries from lean but not obese rats, suggesting impaired Ca-induced Ca release (CICR) from SR in arteries from OZR. Enhanced Ca influx after treatment with ryanodine was abolished by nifedipine and coupled to up-regulation of Ca1.2 channels in arteries from OZR. Increased activation of ERK-MAPK and up-regulation of PI3Kδ, PKCβ and δ isoforms were associated to larger inhibitory effects of PI3K, MAPK and PKC blockers on VSM L-type channel Ca entry in OZR.

We previously reported that ablation of the ghrelin receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS‐R), attenuates age‐associated  and insulin resistance. Ghrelin and obestatin are derived from the same preproghrelin gene. Here we showed that in brown adipocytes, ghrelin decreases the expression of thermogenic regulator but obestatin increases it, thus showing the opposite effects. We also found that during aging, plasma ghrelin and GHS‐R expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) are increased, but plasma obestatin is unchanged. Increased plasma ghrelin and unchanged obestatin during aging may lead to an imbalance of thermogenic regulation, which may in turn exacerbate thermogenic impairment in aging. Moreover, we found that GHS‐R ablation activates thermogenic signaling, enhances insulin activation, increases mitochondrial biogenesis, and improves mitochondrial dynamics of BAT. In addition, we detected increased norepinephrine in the circulation, and observed that GHS‐R knockdown in brown adipocytes directly stimulates thermogenic activity, suggesting that GHS‐R regulates thermogenesis via both central and peripheral mechanisms.Collectively, our studies demonstrate that ghrelin signaling is an important thermogenic regulator in aging. Antagonists of GHS‐R may serve as unique anti‐ agents, combating  by activating thermogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26831124>Differential effects of enalapril-felodipine versus enalapril-lercanidipine combination drug treatment on sympathetic nerve traffic and metabolic profile in -related hypertension.</a></h2><p>Scanty information is available on the effects of combination drug treatment based on an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker on the neurometabolic alterations characterizing -related hypertension (OHT).

Twenty-eight male Wistar rats were placed on high-fat diet or standard diet (HFD and Ctl groups, respectively) during 12 weeks whereafter half of each group was submitted to an exercise training period of 12 weeks (HFD + training and Ctl + training). Tissue levels of eCBs were measured by LC-MS while expressions of genes coding for CB1 and CB2 receptors were investigated by qPCR. High-fat diet induced an increase in anandamide (AEA) levels in soleus and EDL (p < 0.02).

PE synthesis from  and diacylglycerol is regulated primarily by CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2). Pcyt2(+/-) mice have reduced PE synthesis and, as a consequence, perturbed glucose and fatty acid metabolism, which gradually leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, , and insulin resistance. Glucose and fatty acid uptake and the corresponding transporters Glut4 and Cd36 are similarly impaired in male and female Pcyt2(+/-) hearts. These mice also have similarly reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt1 signaling and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the heart. However, only Pcyt2(+/-) males develop hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Pcyt2(+/-) males have upregulated heart AceI expression, heart phospholipids enriched in arachidonic acid and other n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and dramatically increased ROS production in the aorta. In contrast, Pcyt2(+/-) females have unmodified heart phospholipids but have reduced heart triglyceride levels and altered expression of the structural genes Acta (low) and Myh7 (high).

We hypothesise that this paradox could be inferred to modulation of the "endocannabinoid" system on systemic and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) inflammation. We designed a translational project including clinical and in vitro studies at Geneva University Hospital. Morbid obese subjects (n=11) were submitted to gastric bypass surgery (GBS) and followed up for one year (post-GBS). Insulin resistance and circulating and SAT levels of endocannabinoids, adipocytokines and CC chemokines were assessed pre- and post-GBS and compared to a control group of normal and overweight subjects (CTL) (n=20). In vitro cultures with 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to validate findings from clinical results. Morbid obese subjects had baseline lower insulin sensitivity and higher hs-CRP, leptin, CCL5 and anandamide (AEA) levels as compared to CTL. GBS induced a massive weight and fat mass loss, improved insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, decreased C-reactive protein, leptin, and CCL2 levels. In SAT, increased expression of resistin, CCL2, CCL5 and tumour necrosis factor and reduced MGLL were shown in morbid obese patients pre-GBS when compared to CTL. GBS increased all endocannabinoids and reduced adipocytokines and CC chemokines. In morbid obese SAT, inverse correlations independent of body mass index were shown between palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels and inflammatory molecules. In vitro, OEA inhibited CCL2 secretion from adipocytes via ERK1/2 activation.

This suggests that the microenvironment in post-ischemic and failing hearts compromises CSC regenerative potential. Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), are increased after infarction and in HF; whether they modulate CSC function is unknown. As the effects of TNF are specific to its two receptors (TNFRs), we tested the hypothesis that TNF differentially modulates CSC function in a TNFR-specific manner. CSCs were isolated from wild-type (WT), TNFR1-/-, and TNFR2-/- adult mouse hearts, expanded and evaluated for cell competence and differentiation in vitro in the absence and presence of TNF. Our results indicate that TNF signaling in murine CSCs is constitutively related primarily to TNFR1, with TNFR2 inducible after stress. TNFR1 signaling modestly diminished CSC proliferation, but, along with TNFR2, augmented CSC resistance to oxidant stress. Deficiency of either TNFR1 or TNFR2 did not impact CSC telomerase activity. Importantly, TNF, primarily via TNFR1, inhibited cardiomyogenic commitment during CSC differentiation, and instead promoted smooth muscle and endothelial fates. Moreover, TNF, via both TNFR1 and TNFR2, channeled an alternate CSC neuroadrenergic-like fate (capable of catecholamine synthesis) during differentiation. Our results suggest that elevated TNF in the heart restrains cardiomyocyte differentiation of resident CSCs and may enhance adrenergic activation, both effects that would reduce the effectiveness of endogenous cardiac repair and the response to exogenous stem cell therapy, while promoting adverse cardiac remodeling.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26465927>Probiotic supplementation and trimethylamine-N-oxide production following a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the multi-strain probiotic VSL#3 would attenuate the increase in fasting plasma concentrations of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) following a high-fat diet.Nineteen healthy, non-obese males (18-30 years) participated in the present study.

In this study, we showed that hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-specific ATF4 knockout (PAKO) mice are lean and have higher energy expenditure. Furthermore, PAKO mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced , glucose intolerance, and leptin resistance. Moreover, the expression of autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) was increased or decreased by ATF4 knockdown or overexpression, respectively, and ATF4 inhibited the transcription of ATG5 by binding to the basic zipper-containing protein sites on its promoter. Importantly, mice with double knockout of ATF4 and ATG5 in POMC neurons gained more fat mass and reduced energy expenditure compared with PAKO mice under a high-fat diet. Finally, the effect of ATF4 deletion in POMC neurons was possibly mediated via enhanced ATG5-dependent autophagy and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone production in the hypothalamus. Taken together, these results identify the beneficial role of hypothalamic ATF4/ATG5 axis in the regulation of energy expenditure, , and -related metabolic disorders, which suggests that ATF4/ATG5 axis in the hypothalamus may be a new potential therapeutic target for treating  and -related metabolic diseases.© 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29700799>Spinal anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in obese parturients: is this the best option?</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26569112>Increased Feeding Speed Is Associated with Higher Subsequent Sympathetic Activity in Dogs.</a></h2><p>Although the domestication process has altered the feeding behavior of dogs, some breeds still demonstrate a remarkable ability to gorge, and will eat exceptionally large quantities of food whenever it is available. Lesions in the ventromedial hypothalamus increase appetite and lead to , suggesting that the autonomic nervous system plays an important role in feeding. Focusing on the autonomic activities closely involved in food intake, we investigated sympathetic activities before and after feeding in dogs. The subjects were 56 healthy dogs of 21 different breeds (29 males and 27 females). Based on feeding habits, the 56 dogs were divided into three groups: Fast (n = 19), Slow (n = 24) and Leftover (n = 13). The feeding speed and the amount of food per mouthful of the Fast dogs were significantly greater than those of the Slow and the Leftover dogs. The plasma norepinephrine level in dogs of the Fast group was significantly increased after feeding, while those in the Slow and Leftover groups were significantly decreased after feeding, compared with the pre-feeding concentrations. The low frequency/high frequency ratio of heart rate variability is a good indicator of sympathetic activity and was also significantly higher in the Fast group than in the other groups. Delayed feeding using automatic feeding equipment decreased the plasma norepinephrine concentration and low frequency/high frequency ratio observed after feeding in dogs of the Fast group. In conclusion, dogs eating rapidly with less chewing, which indicates increased sympathetic activity during feeding, may benefit from delayed feeding. The slow eating may activate the parasympathetic nervous system after feeding, which could enhance the activity of the digestive system.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126894>Transient Overexpression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A in Adipose Tissue Promotes Energy Expenditure via Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</a></h2><p>Adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) stimulates functional blood vessel formation in obese fat pads, which in turn facilitates healthy expansion of the adipose tissue. However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A.

Differences in the function of brain reward circuits, including in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), have been shown in -prone vs. -resistant populations, leading many researchers to explore the role of striatal dopamine in . However, alterations in NE transmission also affect NAc mediated behaviors. Therefore, here we examined differences in striatal NE and the response to norepinephrine transporter blockers in -prone and -resistant rats. We found that striatal NE levels increase following systemic cocaine administration in -prone, but not -resistant rats. This could result from either blockade of striatal norepinephrine transporters (NET) by cocaine leading to reduced NE reuptake, or circuit-based responses following cocaine administration resulting in increased NE release. Retrodialysis of the NET inhibitor, desipramine, into the ventral striatum did not cause selective increases in striatal NE levels in -prone rats, suggesting that circuit-based mechanisms underlie NE increases following systemic cocaine administration. Consistent with this, systemic desipramine treatment decreased locomotor activity in -prone, but not -resistant rats. Furthermore, -prone rats were also more sensitive to desipramine-induced reductions in food intake compared to -resistant rats. Taken together, these data expand our understanding of differences in NE systems of -prone vs. resistant rats, and provide new insights into basal differences in striatal systems that may influence feeding behavior.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We found that casein kinase2 (CK2) activity is preferentially higher in white adipocytes than brown/beige adipocytes. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of CK2 in white adipocytes activates the thermogenic program in response to cAMP stimuli. Such activation is largely through reduced CK2-mediated phosphorylation of class I HDACs. Notably, inhibition of CK2 promotes beige adipocyte biogenesis and leads to an increase in whole-body energy expenditure and ameliorates diet-induced  and insulin resistance.

Paternal betaine intake was positively associated with paternal global DNA hydroxymethylation (0.028% per 100 mg betaine increase, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053, P=0.03) and cord blood global DNA methylation (0.679% per 100 mg betaine increase, 95% CI: 0.057, 1.302, P=0.03). Paternal methionine intake was positively associated with CpG1 (0.336% per 100 mg methionine increase, 95% CI: 0.103, 0.569, P=0.006), and mean CpG (0.201% per 100 mg methionine increase, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.402, P=0.049) methylation of the IGF2 DMR in cord blood. Further, a negative association between birth weight/birth weight-for-gestational age z-score and paternal betaine/methionine intake was found. In addition, a positive association between choline and birth weight/birth weight-for-gestational age z-score was also observed. Our data indicate a potential impact of paternal methyl-group donor intake on paternal global DNA hydroxymethylation, offspring global and IGF2 DMR DNA methylation, and prenatal growth.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320186>Higher dietary choline intake is associated with lower risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver in normal-weight Chinese women.</a></h2><p>Choline deficiency has been shown to induce liver fat accumulation in both rodent and human studies. However, it is unclear whether dietary choline intake is related to fatty liver in the general population.We examined the association between choline intake and nonalcoholic fatty liver.Participants included 56,195 Chinese women and men, 40-75 y of age, with no or negligible alcohol consumption and with no history of hepatitis, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. All participants reported undergoing liver ultrasonography. Fatty liver was defined by self-report of a physician diagnosis. Habitual dietary intakes were assessed via validated food-frequency questionnaires.The average total choline intakes were 289 ± 85 mg/d in women and 318 ± 92 mg/d in men. Major food sources were eggs, soy foods, red meat, fish, and vegetables. A higher choline intake was associated with lower risk of fatty liver; after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and other dietary intakes, the ORs (95% CIs) for the highest vs. the lowest quintiles of choline intake were 0.68 (0.59, 0.79) in women and 0.75 (0.60, 0.93) in men (both P-trend < 0.01). The inverse association was attenuated after further adjustment for history of metabolic disease and, in particular, BMI. The corresponding ORs (95% CIs) were 0.88 (0.75, 1.03) in women (P-trend = 0.05) and 0.85 (0.68, 1.06) in men (P-trend = 0.09). Stratified analyses suggested a potential effect modification by  status in women; the OR (95% CI) across extreme quintiles was 0.72 (0.57, 0.91) in normal-weight women vs. 1.05 (0.84, 1.31) in overweight or obese women (P-trend = 0.007 vs. 0.99, P-interaction < 0.0001).Higher dietary choline intake may be associated with lower risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver only in normal-weight Chinese women.© 2014 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25479337>Omentin functions to attenuate cardiac hypertrophic response.</a></h2><p>Cardiac hypertrophy occurs in many -related conditions. Omentin is an adipose-derived plasma protein that is downregulated under obese conditions. Here, we investigated whether omentin modulates cardiac hypertrophic responses in vivo and in vitro. Systemic administration of an adenoviral vector expressing human omentin (Ad-OMT) to wild-type (WT) mice led to the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and ERK phosphorylation induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) or angiotensin II infusion. In cultured cardiomyocytes, stimulation with phenylephrine (PE) led to an increase in myocyte size, which was prevented by pretreatment with human omentin protein. Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with omentin protein also reduced ERK phosphorylation in response to PE stimulation. Ad-OMT enhanced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the heart of WT mice after TAC operation. Blockade of AMPK activation by transduction with dominant-negative mutant forms of AMPK reversed the inhibitory effect of omentin on myocyte hypertrophy and ERK phosphorylation following PE stimulation. Moreover, fat-specific transgenic mice expressing human omentin showed reduced cardiac hypertrophy and ERK phosphorylation following TAC surgery compared to littermate controls. These data suggest that omentin functions to attenuate the pathological process of myocardial hypertrophy via the activation of AMPK in the heart, suggesting that omentin may represent a target molecule for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This has functional consequences with loss of vasodilator adipokine bioavailability. Part of the inflammatory response is mediated by increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can improve the anticontractile function of perivascular adipose tissue.Segments of rat mesenteric small artery were dissected and mounted in a wire myograph and contracted to incremental doses of norepinephrine in the presence and absence of perivascular adipose tissue and in conditions of normal oxygenation or after hypoxia and incubated with captopril or telmisartan.Vessels with perivascular adipose tissue contracted significantly less than arteries with perivascular adipose tissue removed under normal oxygenation conditions, indicating that perivascular adipose tissue exerts an anticontractile effect. Hypoxia induced a loss of this anticontractile effect which could be completely prevented with captopril or telmisartan.The in-vitro creation of a hypoxic environment can simulate the loss of anticontractile perivascular adipose tissue function seen in vivo in obese patients, and this can be prevented using inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin cascade.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845147>Dietary fatty acid composition impacts plasma fatty acid ethanolamide levels and body composition in golden Syrian hamsters.</a></h2><p>Fatty acid ethanolamides (FAEs) are a class of lipid amides that regulate numerous pathophysiological functions. To date, pharmacological research in this area has focused on the endocannabinoid system, metabolic pathways, and biological significance of FAEs; however, limited nutritional studies have been conducted to understand the actions of FAEs on food intake and their role on overall body composition. Therefore, the present study was designed with the hypothesis that high C18:1n9 will attenuate food consumption in golden Syrian male hamsters (n = 105). Moreover, the long-term (two months) effects of feeding hamsters various dietary oil blends, namely, C+S, 25:75 corn oil:n9 safflower oil; F+S, 25:75 flaxseed oil:n6 safflower oil; H+DHA, 85:15 high oleic canola oil:docosahexaenoic acid; H+EPA, 85:15 high oleic canola oil:eicosapentaenoic acid; HOCO, high oleic canola oil; OO, olive oil; and RC, regular canola oil, on the plasma levels of seven different FAEs and fatty acids (FAs) composition were investigated. A further objective was to characterize the actions of these diets on energy expenditure and overall body composition to determine if dietary fatty acid (DFA) composition affects diet-induced  (DIO). The results show that DFA directly influenced plasma FA and FAE levels, with marked increases (p < 0.05) observed in plasma C18:1n9 levels after HOCO and OO treatments. Correspondingly, the most elevated plasma oleoylethanolamide (OEA) levels were observed with HOCO and OO treatments, which also decreased (p < 0.05) food intake by ∼8% when compared with H+EPA dietary treatment when measured at the endpoint. Diminished food intake subsequent to HOCO and OO feeding may have resulted from increased OEA concentrations, demonstrating the anorexic properties of the high C18:1n9 dietary components. No differences were observed across OO, HOCO, and HOCO diets with omega-3 FA blends in terms of body composition, energy expenditure, plasma C18:1n9 levels, or OEA concentrations. Based on these findings, we conclude that the addition of HOCO to diets aids in the reduction of food intake, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy body weight.</p><p>Keyword: obesity</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29305401>Changes in Gut Microbiota-Related Metabolites and Long-term Successful Weight Loss in Response to Weight-Loss Diets: The POUNDS Lost Trial.</a></h2><p>Adiposity and the gut microbiota are both related to the risk of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to comprehensively examine how changes induced by a weight-loss diet intervention in gut microbiota-related metabolites, such as trimethylamine -oxide (TMAO) and its precursors (choline and l-carnitine), were associated with improvements in adiposity and regional fat deposition.This study included 510 overweight and obese individuals who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient intake. We examined associations of 6-month changes in blood metabolites (TMAO, choline, and l-carnitine) with improvements in body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), body fat composition, fat distribution, and resting energy expenditure (REE).Individuals with a greater reduction of choline ( < 0.0001) and l-carnitine ( < 0.01) rather than TMAO showed significant losses of BW and WC at 6 months. The reduction of choline was significantly predictive of decreases in body fat composition, fat distribution, and REE. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that the baseline diabetes risk status, such as the presence of hyperglycemia (31% of the total participants) and fasting glucose levels, did not modify the associations. Early changes in choline and l-carnitine were significantly predictive of weight loss over 2 years ( < 0.05 for all). Individuals with increases in choline or l-carnitine were 2.35-times (95% CI 1.38, 4.00) or 1.77-times (1.06, 2.95) more likely to fail to lose weight (-5% or more loss) at 2 years.Overweight and obese individuals who showed decreases in circulating choline or l-carnitine levels achieved greater improvements of adiposity and energy metabolism by eating a low-calorie weight-loss diet, suggesting that such metabolites are predictive of individuals' response to the treatment.

The mechanisms by which the  leads cardiac dysfunction are not fully elucidated and few studies have evaluated the relationship between  and proteins involved in myocardial β-adrenergic (βA) system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cardiac function and βA pathway components in myocardium of obese rats. Male Wistar rats were distributed into two groups: control (n = 17; standard diet) and obese (n = 17; saturated high-fat diet) fed for 33 weeks. Nutritional profile and comorbidities were assessed. Cardiac structure and function was evaluated by macroscopic postmortem, echocardiographic and isolated papillary muscle analyzes. Myocardial protein expression of β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, Gαs protein, adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) was performed by Western blot. Cardiac cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and PKA activity were assessed by ELISA Obese rats showed increased adiposity index (P < 0.001) and several comorbidities as hypertension, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia compared with control rats. Echocardiographic assessment revealed increased left atrium diameter (C: 4.98 ± 0.38 vs. Ob: 5.47 ± 0.53, P = 0.024) and posterior wall shortening velocity (C: 37.1 ± 3.6 vs. Ob: 41.8 ± 3.8, P = 0.007) in obese group. Papillary muscle evaluation indicated that baseline data and myocardial responsiveness to isoproterenol stimulation were similar between the groups. Protein expression of myocardial AC was higher in obese group than in the control (C: 1.00 ± 0.21 vs. Ob: 1.25 ± 0.10, P = 0.025), whereas the other components were unchanged. These results suggest that saturated high-fat diet-induced  was not effective in triggering cardiac dysfunction and impair the beta-adrenergic signaling.© 2016 The Authors.

Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an  mouse model.Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an  animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their metabolic parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile, insulin level time profile, insulin sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas insulin levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic syndrome in the  animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
