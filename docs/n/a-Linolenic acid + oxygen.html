Herein, we demonstrate alpha-ESA induced apoptosis and autophagy with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells. Treatment with alpha-ESA caused inhibition of phosphorylated (p)AKT and elongated the sub G1 phase in the cell cycle, indicating induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was also induced by alpha-ESA treatment, causing low pAKT and pP70S6K activities, increasing pERK1/2 and leading to a higher conversion rate of LC3 I to LC3 II compared to that of the control. The autophagy was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry through monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staining. It appears that the role of autophagy is a protective mechanism against cell death in alpha-ESA-treated HeLa cells. Subsequently, we found that treating HeLa cells with alpha-ESA induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The phosphorylation of P70S6K, downstream of mTOR signaling, and AKT were further reduced by pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, whereas the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II were further enhanced. As a result, the blocking of the action of ROS promoted alpha-ESA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, our results indicate that the generation of ROS by alpha-ESA treatment impedes the progress of apoptosis and excessive autophagy formation which takes part in cell death, thus impeding death promotion.Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Part 3: a lipid model for the prevention and treatment of keloid formations.</a></h2><p>In the third part of this study a basic lipid model (regarding phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and free fatty ) for keloids (n=20), compared with normal skin of keloid prone and non-keloid prone patients (n=20 of each), was constructed according to standard methods, to serve as a sound foundation for essential fatty  supplementation strategies in the prevention and treatment of keloid formations. Essential fatty  deficiency (EFAD) of the omega-6 series (linoleic  (LA), g-linolenic  (GLA), and dihomo-g-linolenic  (DGLA)) and the omega-3 series (  (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)), but enhanced arachidonic  (AA) levels, were prevalent in keloid formations. Enhanced AA, but a deficiency of AA precursors (LA, GLA and DGLA) and inflammatory competitors (DGLA and EPA), are inevitably responsible for the overproduction of pro-inflammatory metabolites (prostaglandin E(2)(PGE(2))) participating in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Of particular interest was the extremely high free oleic  (OA) levels present, apart from the high free AA levels, in the keloid formations. OA stimulates PKC activity which, in turn, activates PLA(2)activity for the release or further release of AA from membrane pools. Interactions between EFAs, eicosanoids, cytokines, growth factors and free radicals can modulate the immune response and the immune system in undoubtedly involved in keloid formation. The histopathology of keloids can be adequately explained by: persistence of inflammatory- and cytokine-mediated reactions in the keloid/dermal interface and peripheral areas, where fibroblast proliferation and continuous depletion of membrane linoleic  occur; microvascular regeneration and circulation of sufficient EFAs in the interface and peripheral areas, where maintenance of  active fibroblasts for collagen production occur; microvessel occlusion and hypoxia in the central areas, where deprivation of EFAs and oxygen with consequent fibroblast apoptosis occur, while excessive collagen remain. All these factors contribute to different fibroblast populations present in: the keloid / dermal interface and peripheral areas where increases in fibroblast proliferation and endogenous TGF-b occur, and these  active fibroblast populations are responsible for enhanced collagen production: the central areas where fibroblast populations under hypoxic conditions occur, and these fibroblasts are responsible for excessive collagen production. It was concluded that: fibroblast membrane EFAD of AA precursors and inflammatory competitors, but prevailing enhanced AA levels, can contribute to a chain of reactions eventually responsible for keloid formations.Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22609276>Beta-eleostearic  induce apoptosis in T24 human bladder cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated pathway.</a></h2><p>Beta-eleostearic  (β-ESA, 9E11E13E-18:3),   isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically active compound. Herein, we investigated effects of β-eleostearic  on T24 human bladder cancer cells. In this study, results showed that β-eleostearic  had strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in T24 cells. The cell viability assay results showed that incubation with β-eleostearic  concentrations of 10-80μmol/L caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease of T24 cell viability, and the IC(50) value was 21.2μmol/L at 24h and 13.1μmol/L at 48h. Annexin V/PI double staining was used to assess apoptosis with flow cytometry. Treatment with β-eleostearic  caused massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to activation of caspase-3 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 indicating induction of apoptosis. Subsequently, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and PEG-catalase effectively blocked the ROS elevated effect of β-eleostearic , which suggested that β-eleostearic -induced apoptosis involved ROS generated. Additionally, we found that treating T24 cells with β-eleostearic  induced activation of PPARγ. A PPARγ-activated protein kinase inhibitor was able to partially abrogate the effects of β-eleostearic . These results suggested that β-eleostearic  can induce T24 cells apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway which may be involved PPARγ activation.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

XO activity, determined by the spectrophotometric assay for urate generation over time, was completely inhibited in vitro by allopurinol at concentrations > or = 200 microM. Allopurinol's antioxidant activity was determined in vitro using   peroxidation (LAP) assay. Although the known antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene effectively inhibited LAP (80% inhibition of malondialdehyde generation at 10(1) microM), allopurinol (10(1)-10(3) microM) did not inhibit this LAP (p < .01). Rat serum obtained after oral administration of allopurinol (100 mg/kg x 2 doses) did not suppress LAP in vitro more than did control rat serum. Following oral administration of allopurinol (2-50 mg/kg x 2 doses), dose-dependent inhibition of XO activity was observed in the homogenates of the liver (to 5% of control level; p < .001) and the intestine (to 12% of control level; p < .001). We conclude that while 2-50 mg/kg of oral allopurinol effectively suppresses XO activity in the rat liver and intestine, antioxidant activity is not seen even in doses up to 100 mg/kg. The selective enzymatic inhibitory effect of allopurinol at these doses therefore should provide a useful tool to allow the discrimination of the effects of xanthine oxidase in particular from the effects of reactive oxygen metabolites in general.</p></html>
