Both  and madecassoside inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6. However,  more potently suppressed these inflammatory mediators than did madecassoside. Consistent with these observations,  inhibited the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2 at the protein level and of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 at the mRNA level in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells, as determined by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore,  suppressed the LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and this was associated with the abrogation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) degradation and with the subsequent blocking of p65 protein translocation to the nucleus. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of  are caused by iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 inhibition via the downregulation of NF-kappaB activation in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22069560>Targeting inflammatory pathways by triterpenoids for prevention and treatment of cancer.</a></h2><p>Traditional medicine and diet has served mankind through the ages for prevention and treatment of most chronic diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic  mediates most chronic diseases, including cancer. More than other transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 have emerged as major regulators of , cellular transformation, and tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Thus, agents that can inhibit NF-κB and STAT3 activation pathways have the potential to both prevent and treat cancer. In this review, we examine the potential of one group of compounds called triterpenes, derived from traditional medicine and diet for their ability to suppress inflammatory pathways linked to tumorigenesis. These triterpenes include avicins, betulinic acid, boswellic acid, celastrol, diosgenin, , maslinic acid, momordin, saikosaponins, platycodon, pristimerin, ursolic acid, and withanolide. This review thus supports the famous adage of Hippocrates, "Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food".</p></html>
