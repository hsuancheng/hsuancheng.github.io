Liver function tests abnormalities are a common therapy-related complication, thus configuring the so-called Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) or cholestasis (PNAC). Although the damage is frequently mild, and resolves after discontinuation of parenteral nutrition, in some cases it progresses into cirrhotic changes, especially in neonates and infants. We present a literature review focusing on the pathogenetic mechanisms-driven prevention and therapies for the cases where parenteral nutrition cannot be discontinued. Ursodeoxycholic  has been proposed in patients with cholestatic hepatopathy, but its efficacy needs to be better established. Little evidence is available on efficacy of anti-oxidants, antibiotics,  and anti TNFα. Lipid emulsions based on fish oil with a high content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ω-3 appear effective both in decreasing intrahepatic inflammation and in improving biliary flow. Most recent promising variations such as soybean/MCT/olive/fish oil emulsion [third generation lipid emulsion (SMOFlipid)] are under investigation. In conclusion, we remark the emergence of a number of novel pathomechanisms underlying the severe liver impairment damage (PNALD and PNAC) in patients treated with parenteral nutrition. Only few traditional and innovative therapeutic strategies have hitherto been shown promising.Copyright © 2015 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Gliclazide is a drug characterized by large inter-individual differences in therapeutic response; however, the causes of these differences are not fully explained and may be the outcome of microbial biotransformation. Recently, great attention has been paid to studies on bile  (BA) interactions with gut microflora and the role of BAs in the modification of drug transport through biological membranes.  Considering the assumption of gliclazide-probiotic-BAs interactions, the aim of the study was to investigate the transport and biotransformation of gliclazide in probiotic bacteria, as well as the effects of  (DCA) on gliclazide transport into bacterial cells.   were incubated with gliclazide with or without DCA for 24 h at 37°C. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were determined at seven time points by high-performance liquid chromatography. Gliclazide biotransformation by the enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria was examined using appropriate software packages.  During the 24 h incubation with probiotic bacteria, significantly lower extracellular concentrations of gliclazide were observed at all time points compared to controls, while in the group with DCA, the decrease in concentration was noticed only at 24 h. The total concentration of gliclazide throughout the whole period was significantly lower compared to control. Proposed pathways of gliclazide biotransformation by probiotic bacteria involve reactions of hydrolysis and hydroxylation.  Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that there are interactions of gliclazide--DCA, at both the level of active and passive transport into the cells, and at the level of drug biotransformation by enzymatic activity of probiotic bacteria. The effect of these interactions on the final therapeutic response of gliclazide should be further studied and confirmed in  conditions.Copyright © 2019 Ðanić, Stanimirov, Pavlović, Vukmirović, Lazić, Al-Salami and Mikov.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27826427>Effect of  subsp.  GCL2505 on the physiological function of intestine in a rat model.</a></h2><p> ssp.  GCL2505 has been shown to proliferate in the human intestine. The intestinal dynamics and physiological effects of GCL2505 as well as the mechanism underlying proliferation in the gut were investigated. GCL2505 showed markedly higher resistance to free bile acids (cholic and  acids) than other bifidobacterial species. The intestinal dynamics of GCL2505 and  ssp.  JCM1217 was compared. The level of  ssp.  in the GCL2505-administered group was remarkably higher than that of  in the JCM1217-administered group. The distribution of  ssp.  through the intestine of the GCL2505-administered group revealed that GCL2505 proliferated in the cecum. The physiological effects of GCL2505 and JCM 1217 were investigated. The cecal IgA level in the GCL2505-administered group was significantly higher than that in the nontreated control group. In contrast, the JCM 1217-administered group did not manifest any change in the cecal IgA level. Mucin excretion in the GCL2505-administered group was significantly higher than that in the JCM 1217-administered group. The thickness of the sulfomucin layer of the colon in the GCL2505-administered group tended to be higher than that in the JCM 1217-administered group. In a loperamide-induced constipation model, fecal excretion in the GCL2505-administered group was significantly increased compared with that in the loperamide-treated control group. Short-chain fatty  concentration in the GCL2505-administered group was significantly higher than that in the loperamide-treated control group. These results indicate that the level of proliferation of probiotics in the intestine correlates with the magnitude of host physiological responses, such as IgA production and mucin secretion, which possibly affect gastrointestinal functions such as bowel movement to counteract constipation. GCL2505 exhibits high tolerance to secondary bile acids, which partially explains its higher rate of proliferation in the large intestine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27063274>Current Pharmacologic Therapy for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Weight loss, regular exercise, and diet composition modification seem to improve biochemical and histologic abnormalities. Other therapies directed at insulin resistance, oxidative stress, cytoprotection, and fibrosis may also offer benefits. Insulin sensitizers and vitamin E seem to be the most promising; however, they cause side effects. A multifaceted approach of lifestyle modifications, weight loss, and pharmacotherapy can be used in combination, but no single treatment approach has proved universally applicable to the general population with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Continuous clinical and preclinical studies on existing and potential drugs are needed to improve treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, an increase in the production of secondary BA modulates the intestinal  due to the bactericidal effects and promotes cancer risk in the liver and colon. The ingestion of Bacillus coagulans improves constipation via the activation of bowel movement to promote defaecation in humans, which may alter BA metabolism in the intestinal contents. BA secretion is promoted with high-fat diet consumption, and the ratio of cholic  (CA):chenodeoxycholic  in primary BA increases with ageing. The dietary supplementation of CA mimics the BA environment in diet-induced obesity and ageing. We investigated whether B. coagulans lilac-01 and soya pulp influence both BA metabolism and the maintenance of host health in CA-supplemented diet-fed rats. In CA-fed rats, soya pulp significantly increased the production of secondary BA such as  and ω-muricholic acids, and soya pulp ingestion alleviated problems related to plasma adiponectin and gut permeability in rats fed the CA diet. The combination of B. coagulans and soya pulp successfully suppressed the increased production of secondary BA in CA-fed rats compared with soya pulp itself, without impairing the beneficial effects of soya pulp ingestion. In conclusion, it is possible that a combination of prebiotics and probiotics can be used to avoid an unnecessary increase in the production of secondary BA in the large intestine without impairing the beneficial functions of prebiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26466201>Childhood constipation: finally something is moving!</a></h2><p>Recent developments in the evaluation and treatment of childhood constipation are likely to influence the way we deal with pediatric defecation disorders in the near future. Innovations in both colonic and anorectal manometry are leading to novel insights into functional defecation disorders in children. Promising results have been achieved with innovative therapies such as electrical stimulation and new drugs with targets that differ from conventional pharmacological treatments. Also, new surgical approaches, guided by manometric findings, have led to improvement in patient outcome. Finally, utilization of non-pharmacological interventions such as fiber and probiotics has been a field of particular interest in recent years.

The primary endpoint was the effect of supplementation on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary endpoints were insulin sensitivity (assessed by glucose clamp), liver fat content, body composition, body fat distribution, faecal  composition and serum bile acids.Supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12 weeks did not affect HbA1c, liver steatosis, adiposity or  composition. Participants who received the highest dose of L. reuteri exhibited increases in insulin sensitivity index (ISI) and serum levels of the secondary bile   (DCA) compared with baseline, but these differences were not significant in the between-group analyses. Post hoc analysis showed that participants who responded with increased ISI after L. reuteri supplementation had higher microbial diversity at baseline, and increased serum levels of DCA after supplementation. In addition, increases in DCA levels correlated with improvement in insulin sensitivity in the probiotic recipients.Intake of L. reuteri DSM 17938 for 12 weeks did not affect HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy; however, L. reuteri improved insulin sensitivity in a subset of participants and we propose that high diversity of the gut  at baseline may be important.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26045267>Gut , cirrhosis, and alcohol regulate bile  metabolism in the gut.</a></h2><p>The understanding of the complex role of the bile -gut  axis in health and disease processes is evolving rapidly. Our focus revolves around the interaction of the gut  with liver diseases, especially cirrhosis. The bile  pool size has recently been shown to be a function of microbial metabolism of bile , and regulation of the  by bile acids is important in the development and progression of several liver diseases. Humans produce a large, conjugated hydrophilic bile  pool, maintained through positive-feedback antagonism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the intestine and liver. Microbes use bile acids, and via FXR signaling this results in a smaller, unconjugated hydrophobic bile  pool. This equilibrium is critical to maintain health. The challenge is to examine the manifold functions of gut bile acids as modulators of antibiotic, probiotic, and disease progression in cirrhosis, metabolic syndrome, and alcohol use. Recent studies have shown potential mechanisms explaining how perturbations in the  affect bile  pool size and composition. With advancing liver disease and cirrhosis, there is dysbiosis in the fecal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, in addition to a decrease in bile  concentration in the intestine due to the liver problems. This results in a dramatic shift toward the Firmicutes, particularly Clostridium cluster XIVa, and increasing production of . Alcohol intake speeds up these processes in the subjects with and without cirrhosis without significant FXR feedback. Taken together, these pathways can impact intestinal and systemic inflammation while worsening dysbiosis. The interaction between bile acids, alcohol, cirrhosis, and dysbiosis is an important relationship that influences intestinal and systemic inflammation, which in turn determines progression of the overall disease process. These interactions and the impact of commonly used therapies for liver disease can provide insight into the pathogenesis of inflammation in humans.2015 S.

We conducted a feeding experiment to investigate the influence of ad libitum feeding of pre-and post-weaned piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented diet on the gut , gut metabolomic profiles, bile  metabolism, proinflammatory cytokines and faecal consistency. Compared with piglets fed a Bacillus subtilis-supplemented pellet diet, piglets fed the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet had lower intestinal bacterial diversity (P > 0.05), higher intestinal fungal diversity (P > 0.05), more Firmicutes (P > 0.05), fewer Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (P > 0.05), higher concentrations of 3-hydroxypropionic  (P < 0.05), orotic  (P < 0.05), interleukin-6 (P < 0.01), lactic  (P < 0.01),  (P > 0.05) and lithocholic  (P < 0.01) and a higher incidence of diarrhoea (P > 0.05). The data show that ad libitum feeding of piglets with a Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet during the suckling and early post-weaning periods promotes the growth of lactic  bacteria, bile salt hydrolase-active bacteria and 7a-dehydroxylase-active bacteria in the intestinal lumen; disturbs the normal production of lactic , orotic  and unconjugated bile acids; and increases circulating interleukin-6 levels and diarrhoea incidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26914133>Docking-based preliminary study on the interactions of bile acids with drugs at the transporter level in intestinal bacteria.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to estimate the binding-affinities of different bile acids towards drug transporters in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum in order to predict the influence of bile acids and  interactions on drug pharmacokinetics.In order to study interactions of bile acids with transporters of intestinal bacteria, molecular-docking step was performed, using SwissDock web-service. For the purpose of comparison, two natural bile acids, cholic  (CA) and  (DCA), and one semi-synthetic bile , 12-monoketocholic  (MKC), were studied in parallel. The free-binding energy was used as the main criterion for ranking ligands.Studied bile acids exhibited different binding affinities towards bacterial transporters with MKC showing the most prominent effect. For the majority of studied transporters, the estimated affinities of bile acids decreased in the following order: MKC-CA-DCA. Namely, 38.7% of examined transport proteins gave the lowest free-binding energy with MKC. The weak inverse relationship between number of hydrogen bonds and estimated free-binding energies was revealed.The predominant effect of MKC for the majority of studied transport proteins suggests that keto group at carbon 12 of the steroid core has a significant influence on the properties of MKC and consequently, on interactions with membrane transporters. Present findings might have a role in the prediction of potential influence of bile acids and  on drug pharmacokinetics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26566892>Isolation, Identification and Partial Characterization of a Lactobacillus casei Strain with Bile Salt Hydrolase Activity from Pulque.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to isolate, from pulque, Lactobacillus spp. capable of survival in simulated gastrointestinal stress conditions. Nine Gram-positive rods were isolated; however, only one strain (J57) shared identity with Lactobacillus and was registered as Lactobacillus casei J57 (GenBank accession: JN182264). The other strains were identified as Bacillus spp. The most significant observation during the test of tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions (acidity, gastric juice and bile salts) was that L. casei J57 showed a rapid decrease (p ≤ 0.05) in the viable population at 0 h. Bile salts were the stress condition that most affected its survival, from which  and the mix of bile salts (oxgall) were the most toxic. L. casei J57 showed bile salt hydrolase activity over primary and secondary bile salts as follows: 44.91, 671.72, 45.27 and 61.57 U/mg to glycocholate, taurocholate, glycodeoxycholate and taurodeoxycholate. In contrast, the control strain (L. casei Shirota) only showed activity over tauroconjugates. These results suggest that L. casei J57 shows potential for probiotic applications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29494656>Bile  patterns in commercially available oxgall powders used for the evaluation of the bile tolerance ability of potential .</a></h2><p>This study aimed to analyze the bile  patterns in commercially available oxgall powders used for evaluation of the bile tolerance ability of probiotic bacteria. Qxgall powders purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Oxoid and BD Difco were dissolved in distilled water, and analyzed. Conjugated bile acids were profiled by ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), free bile acids were detected as their p-bromophenacyl ester derivatives using reversed-phase HPLC after extraction with acetic ether, and total bile acids were analyzed by enzymatic-colorimetric assay. The results showed that 9 individual bile acids (i.e., taurocholic , glycocholic , taurodeoxycholic , glycodeoxycholic , taurochenodeoxycholic , glycochenodeoxycholic , cholic , chenodeoxycholic , ) were present in each of the oxgall powders tested. The content of total bile  among the three oxgall powders was similar; however, the relative contents of the individual bile acids among these oxgall powders were significantly different (P < 0.001). The oxgall powder from Sigma-Aldrich was closer to human bile in the ratios of glycine-conjugated bile acids to taurine-conjugated bile acids, dihydroxy bile acids to trihydroxy bile acids, and free bile acids to conjugated bile acids than the other powders were. It was concluded that the oxgall powder from Sigma-Aldrich should be used instead of those from Oxoid and BD Difco to evaluate the bile tolerance ability of probiotic bacteria as human bile model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26531326>The  and its pharmacological targets: therapeutic avenues in cardiometabolic diseases.</a></h2><p>Consisting of trillions of non-pathogenic bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with their mammalian host, the gut  has emerged in the past decades as one of the key drivers for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). By degrading dietary substrates, the gut  produces several metabolites that bind human pharmacological targets, impact subsequent signalling networks and in fine modulate host's metabolism. In this review, we revisit the pharmacological relevance of four classes of gut microbial metabolites in CMD: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), bile acids, methylamines and indoles. Unravelling the signalling mechanisms of the microbial-mammalian metabolic axis adds one more layer of complexity to the physiopathology of CMD and opens new avenues for the development of -based pharmacological therapies.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes,  profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic β-muricholic  (β-MCA) and bacteria-generated  (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice.  transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic β-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic β-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

Inspired by the natural physiological process of spores, herein, an oral autonomous NPs generator is developed to overcome the spatially variable gastrointestinal tract environment and multibiological barriers. Spores modified with  (DA) and loaded with chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and sorafenib, DOX/SOR) serve as an autonomous production line of NPs, which can efficaciously protect the drugs passing through the rugged environment of the stomach and furthermore can be transported to the intestinal environment and colonized rapidly. Subsequently, the DOX/SOR/Spore-DA NPs are produced by the autonomous NPs generator in the intestinal regions based on the disintegrated hydrophobic protein and the hydrophilic DA, and they can efficiently penetrate the epithelial cells via the bile  pathway, increasing basolateral drug release. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that this biological nanogenerator can autonomously produce substantial NPs in the intestine, providing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
