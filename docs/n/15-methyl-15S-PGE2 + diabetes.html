Along with obesity,  and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

However, published data on DM outcomes after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation are sparse, inconsistent and individual studies are small with limited power. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare survival and adverse events post-LVAD in DM versus non-DM (NDM) patients. Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for studies comparing outcomes in DM and NDM patients who underwent LVAD implantation for advanced heart failure. Results were reported as random effect risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. We identified 5 retrospective cohort studies, at low risk of bias, reporting on 1,351 patients (n = 488 DM). There was increased 30-day mortality (RR 1.57 [1.00, 2.47]; p = 0.05; I = 0%) among DM versus NDM. The DM and NDM groups did not differ significantly in terms of 1-year mortality (RR 1.15 [0.98, 1.35]; p = 0.08; I = 39%), device-related infection (RR 1.05 [0.92, 1.19]; p = 0.88; I = 0%), ischemic stroke (RR 1.29 [0.91, 1.83]; p = 0.69; I = 0%), hemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.10 [0.42, 2.83]; p = 0.85; I = 69%), or bleeding (RR 1.06 [0.80, 1.40]; p = 0.70; I = 27%). After LVAD implantation, patients with DM, versus patients without, have a modestly elevated 30-day mortality rate. However, 1-year mortality and morbidity did not differ.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, there is a shared mechanism of pathogenesis between metabolic disorders and AD. Hence, the need for discivery of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Diastereomeric mixture of calophyllic acid and isocalophyllic acid (ISO) has been shown to stimulate glucose uptake through GLUT4- translocation. In this study, an attempt was made to investigate the effect of ISO on scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. ISO (5, 25 or 50 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.) was administered for 3 consecutive days. One hour post-treatment on day 3, scopolamine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was given before the animals were subjected to Y-maze, open field, novel object recognition (NOR) or Morris water maze (MWM; 5 consecutive days) paradigms. The mice were sacrificed 45 min after MWM test on day 8. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were rapidly isolated on ice for assay of biochemical markers of oxidative stress and acetylcholinesterase activity. Scopolamine reduced the percentage alternation behaviour in the Y-maze and discrimination index in NOR tests with no significant change in escape latency time in MWM task suggestive of deficit in learning and memory. However, the pretreatment of mice with ISO produced a dose-dependent improvement in learning and memory. Moreover, ISO administration attenuated scopolamine-induced increase in malondialdehyde/nitrite generation and acetylcholinesterase activity and deficit in antioxidant enzyme activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Findings from this study showed that the diastereomeric mixture of calophyllic acid and isocalophyllic acid possesses anti-amnesic effect through enhancement of antioxidant defense and cholinergic signaling pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657321>International Normalized Ratio (INR) Is Comparable to MELD in Predicting Mortality after Cholecystectomy.</a></h2><p>Guidelines suggest targeting a preoperative international normalized ratio (INR) < 1.5. We examined and compared the predictive value of INR relative to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). We reviewed the American College of Surgeons NSQIP from 2005 to 2016 for adult patients undergoing open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with a preoperative INR were stratified into groups: ≤1, >1 to ≤1.5, >1.5 to ≤2, and >2. Thirty day postoperative mortality was the primary outcome. Multivariable logistic regressions controlled for baseline differences. Of 58,177 cholecystectomy patients, 15.2 per cent had INR ≤ 1, 80.4 per cent had INR > 1 to ≤1.5, 3.7 per cent had INR > 1.5 to ≤2, and 0.7 per cent had INR > 2. Patients with INR > 2 were older and more likely to have  and hypertension ( < 0.001). Multivariable regression demonstrated a stepwise increase in mortality for INR > 1 to ≤1.5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.50 [1.10-2.05]), INR > 1.5 to ≤2 (OR = 2.96 [1.97-4.45]), and INR > 2 (OR = 3.21 [1.64-6.31]) relative to INR ≤ 1. C-statistic for INR (0.910) and MELD (0.906) models indicated a similar value in predicting mortality. INR groups also faced an incremental, increased risk of bleeding. Although unable to track preoperative correction of INR, this analysis identifies that INR remains an excellent predictor of postoperative mortality and bleeding after both open and laparoscopic cholecystectomies and is comparable to MELD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654984>Metabolite of the pesticide DDT and incident type 2  in urban India.</a></h2><p>Previous epidemiological studies, largely conducted in high-income countries and cross-sectional, have suggested a relatively strong association between exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), a metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and type 2 . DDT is widely used in India and the prevalence of type 2  there is increasing, but the association between these factors has not been explored to date.The objective was to estimate the association of the p,p' isomer of DDE with incident type 2  in India.A nested case-control study was conducted in a representative prospective cohort of adults from two cities in India. Participants were enrolled in 2010-11 (n = 12,271) and followed for annual assessment of chronic diseases including type 2 . Baseline plasma samples from incident cases of  (n = 193) and sex-city-matched controls (n = 323) were selected for analysis of p,p-DDE. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.At baseline, cases had higher p,p-DDE concentrations: geometric mean (95% CI) 330 (273-399) ng/g lipid compared to 223 (189-262) ng/g lipid among controls. Delhi participants had higher p,p-DDE concentrations: 579 (521-643) ng/g lipid compared to 122 (102-145) ng/g lipid in Chennai. In unadjusted models, being in the highest versus lowest quartile of p,p-DDE was associated with a more than doubling of the odds of : unadjusted OR (95% CI), 2.30 (1.19, 4.43). However, this effect was no longer significant after adjustment for age: adjusted (95% CI), 0.97 (0.46, 2.06).Results suggest that levels of p,p'-DDE in Delhi are exceptionally high, but we did not observe a significant association between p,p-DDE and incident type 2 . As this is the first study to evaluate this association in India, more studies are needed to inform our understanding of the association in this context, including potential routes of exposure.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, the effect of GoSlo-SR compounds on vascular smooth muscle has not been studied. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that GoSlo-SR compounds dilate arteries exclusively by activating BK channels.Experiments were performed on rat Gracilis muscle, saphenous, mesenteric and tail arteries using isobaric and isometric myography, sharp microelectrodes, digital droplet PCR and the patch-clamp technique.GoSlo-SR compounds dilated isobaric and relaxed and hyperpolarized isometric vessel preparations and their effects were abolished after (i) functionally eliminating K channels by pre-constriction with 50 mM KCl or (ii) blocking all K channels known to be expressed in vascular smooth muscle. However, these effects were not blocked when BK channels were inhibited. Surprisingly, the K 7 channel inhibitor XE991 reduced their effects considerably, but neither K 1 nor K 2 channel blockers altered the inhibitory effects of GoSlo-SR. However, the combined blockade of BK and K 7 channels abolished the GoSlo-SR-induced relaxation. GoSlo-SR compounds also activated K 7.4 and K 7.5 channels expressed in HEK 293 cells.This study shows that GoSlo-SR-compounds are effective relaxants in vascular smooth muscle and mediate their effects by a combined activation of BK and K 7.4/K 7.5 channels. Activation of K 1, K 2 or K 7.1 channels or other vasodilator pathways seem not to be involved.This article is protected by copyright.

There are several studies connecting sugar/sweetened beverages to the cardiovascular disease. Currently, many sweeteners have been extensively introduced into lifestyle to normalize blood glucose levels without altering the sweet taste. However, there is growing concern for their impact on metabolic health.Human endothelial cells were treated with Glucose, Fructose, Aspartame, Rebaudioside A, Stevioside, or Steviol. Morphological characteristics, in vitro angiogenesis and array gene expression were analyzed.High-glucose and fructose concentrations significantly decreased cell features such as angiogenic capability. Interestingly, non-caloric sweeteners did not significantly modified all cell characteristics and they did not compromised cell angiogenic ability. Array gene expression analysis revealed that the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and the enzyme transferase (HPRT1) were always significantly upregulated and downregulated respectively, after glucose and fructose treatments (P > .05), whereas they were non-differentially expressed with all the other sweeteners. Interestingly, both genes are considered as cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers. Specifically, upregulation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 occurs in the human placenta and serum levels of the ligand are associated with markers of insulin resistance in GDM.Differently from glucose and fructose, steviol glycosides do not damage endothelial cells. Prospective preclinical studies and clinical trials are warranted to confirm the long-term safety of such compounds.Copyright © 2018.

Increased cellular autophagy may kill the infected cell and terminate the infection without proper regulation. The mechanism of autophagy regulation during liver disease progression in HCV infection is unclear. The autophagy research has gained a lot of attention recently since autophagy impairment is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are three autophagy processes involved in the lysosomal degradation and extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes under excessive stress. Autophagy processes compensate for each other during extreme endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote host and microbe survival as well as HCC development in the highly stressed microenvironment of the cirrhotic liver. This review describes the molecular details of how excessive cellular stress generated during HCV infection activates CMA to improve cell survival. The pathological implications of stress-related CMA activation resulting in the loss of hepatic innate immunity and tumor suppressors, which are most often observed among cirrhotic patients with HCC, are discussed. The oncogenic cell programming through autophagy regulation initiated by a cytoplasmic virus may facilitate our understanding of HCC mechanisms related to non-viral etiologies and metabolic conditions such as uncontrolled type II . We propose that a better understanding of how excessive cellular stress leads to cancer through autophagy modulation may allow therapeutic development and early detection of HCC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657690>Type 2  and its Impact on the Immune System.</a></h2><p>Type 2  (T2D) is a major worldwide health problem. This metabolic disease is indicated by high blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. Inflammatory response occurs as a result of immune response to high blood glucose levels as well as the presence of inflammatory mediators produced by adipocytes and macrophages in fat tissue. This low and chronic inflammation leads to damage of the pancreatic beta cells and insufficient insulin production, which results in hyperglycemia.Hyperglycemia in  is thought to cause dysfunction of the immune response, which results in failure to control the spread of invading pathogens in diabetic subjects. Therefore, diabetic subjects are known to more susceptible to infections. The increased prevalence of T2D will increase the incidence of infectious diseases and related comorbidities.This review provides an overview of the immunological aspect of T2D and the possible mechanisms that result in increased infections in diabetics.A better understanding of how immune dysfunctions occur during hyperglycemia can lead to novel treatments and preventions for infectious diseases and T2D comorbidities, thus improving the outcome of infectious disease treatment in T2D patients.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657647>Inositol polyphosphate multikinase is a metformin target that regulates cell migration.</a></h2><p>Metformin has been shown to alter cell adhesion protein expression, which is thought to play a role in its observed antitumor properties. We found that metformin treatment down-regulated integrin β1 concomitant with the loss of inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) in murine myocytes, adipocytes, and hepatocytes. To determine if IPMK was upstream of integrin β1 expression, we examined IPMK mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and found that integrins β1 and β3 gene expression was reduced by half, relative to wild-type cells, whereas focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 protein levels were increased, resulting in migration defects. Using nanonet force microscopy, we determined that cell:extracellular matrix adhesion and cell contractility forces were decreased, confirming the functional relevance of integrin and Rho protein dysregulation. Pharmacological studies showed that inhibition of both FAK1 and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 partially restored integrin β1 expression, suggesting negative regulation of integrin β1 by FAK. Together our data indicate that IPMK participates in the regulation of cell migration and provides a potential link between metformin and wound healing impairment.-Tu-Sekine, B., Padhi, A., Jin, S., Kalyan, S., Singh, K., Apperson, M., Kapania, R., Hur, S.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the mitochondria-targeted methylglyoxal scavenger, MitoGamide, in an experimental model of spontaneous diabetic cardiomyopathy.Male 6-week-old Akita or wild type mice received daily oral gavage of MitoGamide or vehicle for 10 weeks. Several morphological and systemic parameters were assessed, as well as cardiac function by echocardiography.Akita mice were smaller in size than wild type counterparts in terms of body weight and tibial length. Akita mice exhibited elevated blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. Total heart and individual ventricles were all smaller in Akita mice. None of the aforementioned parameters was impacted by MitoGamide treatment. Echocardiographic analysis confirmed that cardiac dimensions were smaller in Akita hearts. Diastolic dysfunction was evident in Akita mice, and notably, MitoGamide treatment preferentially improved several of these markers, including e'/a' ratio and E/e' ratio.Our findings suggest that MitoGamide, a novel mitochondria-targeted approach, offers cardioprotection in experimental  and therefore may offer therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in patients with .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655535>Reliability and validity of Turkish version of  Distress Scale for type 2  and distress level of the participants.</a></h2><p>Studies have shown increased depression rate in patients with type 2  (T2DM) compared to normal population.

Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the week-specific rates of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity/mortality among women delivered iatrogenically versus those undergoing expectant management.For all women, the absolute risk of severe maternal morbidity/mortality was low, typically impacting less than 1% of women and there was no significant difference in gestational age-specific severe maternal morbidity/mortality between iatrogenic delivery and expectant management among women with any form of . Among women with gestational , iatrogenic delivery was associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity/mortality compared with expectant management at 36 and 37 weeks (76.7 and 27.8 excess cases per 1000 deliveries, respectively), and a lower risk of neonatal morbidity/mortality at 38, 39 and 40 weeks gestation (7.9, 27.3 and 15.9 fewer cases per 1000 deliveries, respectively). Increased risks of severe neonatal morbidity following iatrogenic delivery compared with expectant management were also observed for women with type 1  at 36 (98.3 excess cases per 1000 deliveries) and 37 weeks (44.5 excess cases per 1000 deliveries) and for women with type 2  at 36 (77.9 excess cases per 1000 deliveries) weeks.The clinical decision regarding timing of delivery is complex and contingent on maternal-fetal wellbeing, including adequate glycemic control.

Whereas lineage tracing studies demonstrated that glucagon-producing α cells can be reprogrammed into BH cells, the underlying dynamics of the conversion process remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the identities of pancreatic endocrine cells by genetic lineage tracing under diabetic conditions. When β-cell ablation was induced by alloxan (ALX), a time-dependent increase in BH cells was subsequently observed. Lineage tracing experiments demonstrated that BH cells originate from α cells, but not from β cells, in ALX-induced diabetic mice. Notably, supplemental insulin administration into diabetic mice resulted in a significant increase in α-cell-derived insulin-producing cells that did not express glucagon. Furthermore, lineage tracing in Ins2 diabetic mice demonstrated a significant induction of α-to-β conversion. Thus, adult α cells have plasticity, which enables them to be reprogrammed into insulin-producing cells under diabetic conditions, and this can be modulated by supplemental insulin administration.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Reduce Elevated LA Pressure in Patients With Heart Failure was a multicenter study of the safety and feasibility of IASD implantation. Sixty-four patients with EF ≥40% underwent device implantation along with baseline conventional echocardiograms, speckle tracking echocardiography, and resting and exercise hemodynamics. Higher LA compliance (-4.2%, p = 0.048) and right atrial reservoir strain (-0.8%, p = 0.005) were independently associated with a percent decrease in the systolic LA volume index from baseline to 6-months.

On the basis of free thriiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) serum levels patients were classified into one of the following four categories: as euthyroid subjects, as or patients affected by hypothyroidism, low T3 (LT3) syndrome or hyperthyroidism. During follow-up, death for all causes was assessed as primary end-point, whereas time to the first hospitalization for heart failure worsening was the secondary end-point analyzed.Among 762 patients, 190 patients were affected by hypothyroidism (Hypo). LT3 syndrome was diagnosed in 15 patients and 59 patients were affected by hyperthyroidism (Hyper). During a long term follow-up (5.1±3.7 years), 303 patients died. Patients with Hypo showed an increased risk of death as well as of hospitalization due to heart failure worsening at univariate regression analysis. At multivariate regression analysis Hypo remained associated with hospitalization after correction for age >75 years, ischemic aetiology, , therapy with ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, therapy with betablockers and with aldosterone antagonists, NYHA class 3, systolic arterial pressure <95 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min, hyponatremia and NT-proBNP>1000 pg/ml. At, multivariate analysis, the independent association with death was significant only for the subgroup of patients with TSH >10 mIU/L. LT3 was independently associated with both heart failure hospitalization and death, whereas Hyper was not associated with any of the two considered end-points.Hypo is associated with a worse prognosis over a long-term follow-up. The association with heart failure hospitalization is not dependent on the baseline TSH levels, whereas the association with death is significant only when TSH >10 mIU/L. Finally, Hyper does not have anly association with a worse prognosis.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656819>GLP-1 analogue liraglutide as adjunct treatment in  type 2 after failed bariatric/metabolic surgery.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654798>Ethnomedicinal survey and mutagenic studies of plants used in Accra metropolis, Ghana.</a></h2><p>Majority of people living in Ghana and many other developing countries rely on traditional medicinal plants for their primary healthcare.

Thirteen samples (52%) showed moderate to high mutagenicity in the TA 100 bacterial strain before and after metabolism with rat liver enzyme.The study showed that over half of the frequently used medicinal plants showed moderate to high mutagenicity before and after metabolism at the concentration of a 100 μg/mL. This may have implications for the safety of those who use them to manage diseases. These findings will suggest the need for an in-depth study of the mutagenic potentials of plants commonly used by indigenous people and more especially for those exhibiting high mutagenicity in this study.Copyright © 2019.

Due to the advantage the polyphenolic compounds enjoy in  and associated complications, we postulated that Taxifolin (TXF) a poly-phenolic flavanol could show anti-retinopathic and anti-cataract effect in  induced rats.TXF at a dose of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg was given by oral route to STZ mediated diabetic rats for time period of 10 weeks. The opacity of lens was studied after every 7 days of treatment till 10 weeks; evaluation of severity of cataract and changes in histology of lens as well as retina was done. Tissue homogenates of lens isolated after end of study were evaluated for markers of oxidative stress, levels of aldose reductase, p38MAPK, VEGF and ERK1/2 were done.Outcomes suggested that TXF improved retinopathy and cataract in  induced rats. The treatment of TXF also improved the status of oxidative stress and inhibited the levels of p38MAPK, VEGF and ERK1/2. The treatment also improved the lens opacity in diabetic rats. The results suggest that the protective effect of TXF against cataract and retinopathy may be due to the anti-oxidative potential of TXF and its inhibiting effect on VEGF, ERK1/2, p38MAPK and aldose reductase.The study confirms that TXF is potential candidate showing protective effect against diabetic induced retinopathy and cataract.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652909>From the Table to the Tumor: The Role of Mediterranean and Western Dietary Patterns in Shifting Microbial-Mediated Signaling to Impact Breast Cancer Risk.</a></h2><p>Diet is a modifiable component of lifestyle that could influence breast cancer development. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is considered one of the healthiest of all dietary patterns. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet protects against , cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Reported consumption of a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with lower breast cancer risk for women with all subtypes of breast cancer, and a Western diet pattern was associated with greater risk. In this review, we contrast the available epidemiological breast cancer data, comparing the impact of consuming a Mediterranean diet to the Western diet. Furthermore, we will review the preclinical data highlighting the anticancer molecular mechanism of Mediterranean diet consumption in both cancer prevention and therapeutic outcomes. Diet composition is a major constituent shaping the gut microbiome. Distinct patterns of gut microbiota composition are associated with the habitual consumption of animal fats, high-fiber diets, and vegetable-based diets. We will review the impact of Mediterranean diet on the gut microbiome and inflammation. Outside of the gut, we recently demonstrated that Mediterranean diet consumption led to distinct microbiota shifts in the mammary gland tissue, suggesting possible anticancer effects by diet on breast-specific microbiome.

Preoperatively, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m in all patients. Demographic, clinical, perioperative and renal functional parameters were compared between two groups. Age,  (DM), pathological tumor size, preoperative eGFR and WIT were used in multivariable analyses to investigate the independent predictors of de novo Stage 3 or greater CKD (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m) at postoperative period and at the last follow-up.Preoperative (p=0.009) and pathological (p=0.011) tumor size, PADUA (p=0.001) and R.E.N.A.L. Nephrometry (p=0.006) scores and operative time (p<0.001) were significantly higher in Group 2. Preoperative eGFR (86 vs. 88 mL/min/1.73 m, p=0.328) was similar between two groups. In postoperative period, compared to Group 1, decreased eGFR (86 vs. 62.5 mL/min/1.73 m, p<0.001) and percent preserved eGFR (97.2 vs. 77.2%, p<0.001) were found in Group 2.

In our previous study, we found that the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is significantly decreased in vitreous humor of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients, which indicated that RKIP might play a role in the development of PDR. To investigate the role of RKIP in PDR, stable overexpression and knockdown of RKIP in Human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) were generated by using lentivirus constructs. Then, the glucose-induced cell viability, migration, angiogenesis, and (endothelial to mesenchymal transition) EndMT were determined in the RKIP-wide type (WT), -knocking down (KD) and -overexpression (OE) HRCECs. The results showed that, compared with the RKIP-WT groups, the glucose-induced cell viabilities, migration and angiogenesis were significantly increased in the RKIP-KD groups, while significantly decreased in the RKIP-OE groups. Besides, compared with the control groups, CD31 and vWF were upregulated, while α-SMA was downregulated in the RKIP-KD groups, while CD31 and vWF were downregulated, while α-SMA was upregulated in the RKIP-OE groups induced by glucose. In conclusion, our results showed that RKIP negatively regulates glucose-induced cell viability, migration, angiogenesis, and EndMT in HRCECs, suggesting that the downregulation of RKIP in the vitreous humor of PDR patients might contribute to the development of DR.Copyright © 2019.

Due to the equimolar secretion, copeptin responds as rapidly as AVP to osmotic, hemodynamic and unspecific stress-related stimuli and both peptides show a very strong correlation. The physiological functions of AVP are homeostasis of fluid balance, vascular tonus and regulation of the endocrine stress response. In contrast, the exact function of copeptin remains unknown. Since copeptin, in contrast to AVP, can easily be measured with a sandwich immunoassay, its main function so far that it indirectly indicates the amount of AVP in the circulation. Copeptin has emerged as a useful measure in different diseases. On one hand, through its characteristics as a marker of stress, it provides a unique measure of the individual stress burden. As such, it is a prognostic marker in different acute diseases such as ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction. On the other side, it has emerged as a promising marker in the diagnosis of AVP-dependent fluid disorders. Copeptin reliably differentiates various entities of the polyuria polydipsia syndrome; baseline levels >20 pmol/L without prior fluid deprivation identify patients with nephrogenic , whereas levels measured upon osmotic stimulation with hypertonic saline or upon non-osmotic stimulation with arginine differentiate primary polydipsia from central . In patients with hyponatremia, low levels of copeptin together with low urine osmolality identify patients with primary polydipsia, but copeptin levels overlap in all other causes of hyponatremia, limiting its diagnostic use in hyponatremia. Copeptin has also been put forward as predictive marker for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and for , but more studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656993>The gut microbiota to the brain axis in the metabolic control.</a></h2><p>The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions.

The main mechanism of I/R injury is the release of high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) from injured tubular epithelial cells (TEC, TCMK-1 cell), which triggers TLR4 or RAGE signaling, leading to cell death. We evaluated whether the extracts of  would attenuate TEC death induced by H/R injury. We also evaluated which phlorotannin-dieckol (DK), phlorofucofuroeckol A (PFFA), pyrogallol phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PPB), or 2,7-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol (PHB)-would have the most potent effect in the context of H/R injury. We used for pre-hypoxia treatment, in which the phlorotannins from  extracts were added before the onset of hypoxia, and a post- hypoxia treatment, in which the phlorotannins were added before the start of reperfusion. PPB most effectively reduced HMGB1 release and the expression of TLR4 and RAGE induced by H/R injury in both pre- and post-hypoxia treatment. PPB also most effectively inhibited the expression of NF-kB and release of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in both models. PPB most effectively inhibited cell death and expression of cell death signaling molecules such as Erk/pErk, JNK/pJNK, and p38/pp38. These results suggest that PPB blocks the HGMB1-TLR4/RAGE signaling pathway and decreases TEC death induced by H/R and that PPB can be a novel target for renal H/R injury therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet lipid metabolism in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic acid (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced lipid accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduced lipid deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell lipid accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

But the association between serum total fatty acids (TFAs, free fatty acids plus esterified fatty acids) and T2D has not been reported.Serum esterified fatty acids were hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions, and serum TFAs were extracted after acidizing. Fourteen of serum TFAs in 1,828 serum samples, including 543 controls, 655 prediabetes, and 630 T2D patients, were simultaneously quantified based on the calibration curves of 8 fatty acids using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR MS).Correlation analysis revealed strong correlations among serum TFAs and ratios of the TFAs in T2D patients compared with controls or prediabetes both in males and females. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that a panel including fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1c, gamma-glutamyltransferase, triglyceride, C18:1, and C20:3, has an good capability to distinguish prediabetes from T2D, with the sensitivity of 87.0%, the specificity of 91.0%, and the area under curve (AUC) of 0.96.In this study, rapid, absolute, and simultaneous quantification of serum TFAs was performed using MALDI-FTICR MS.

However, the impact of SUA level on revascularization in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO), one of the highest risk subsets in coronary artery disease, is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of SUA level on target lesion revascularization (TLR) in contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO. A total of 165 patients who underwent successful PCI with new-generation drug-eluting stent for CTO under intravascular ultrasound guidance were included. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the tertiles of SUA level at baseline. Coronary angiography was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, and gray-scale intravascular ultrasound was also analyzed. The primary end point was TLR. The tertiles of SUA level were as follows: low tertile, ≤5.2 mg/dl; intermediate tertile, 5.3 to 6.4 mg/dl; and high tertile, ≥6.5 mg/dl. During a median follow-up of 34 months, TLR was observed in 5 patients (8.8%) in the low tertile, in 5 (9.4%) in the intermediate tertile, and in 14 (25.5%) in the high tertile (p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of TLR in patients with high tertile than the low and intermediate groups. Multivariable analysis showed SUA ≥6.5 mg/dl, , and longer CTO length as independent predictors of TLR. In conclusion, in patients who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent, elevated SUA level was associated with TLR after successful recanalization of CTO.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is frequently documented in chronic kidney disease, obesity,  and advanced age, all of which are risk factors for resistant hypertension. Sympathetic overactivity and chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system are salient features of resistant hypertension. Interestingly, recent data indicate that renal sympathetic overactivity can reduce the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the paraventricular nucleus. Reduced NO levels in the paraventricular nucleus can increase sympathetic outflow and this can create a vicious cycle contributing to resistant hypertension. Angiotensin II can reduce l-arginine transport and hence NO production. Reduced NO levels may reduce the formation of angiotensin 1-7 dampening the cardio-protective effects of the renin-angiotensin system contributing to resistant hypertension. In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is demonstrated to be independently associated with resistant hypertension, and IL-6 can reduce NO synthesis. Despite this, NO levels have not been quantified in resistant hypertension. Findings from a small proof of concept study indicate that NO donors can reduce blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension but more studies are required to validate these preliminary findings. In the present paper, we put forward the hypothesis that reduced NO bioavailability contributes substantially to the development of resistant hypertension.© 2019 The Author(s).

Silver/silver orthophosphate/graphene oxide composites (Ag/AgPO/GO) were prepared as sensing platform for capture-antibody (Ab) incubation. AgPO is a novel ECL donor whose emission could be remarkably enhanced by the synergetic assistance of GO with Ag NPs. Notably, GO presented excellent electrical conductivity and ultrahigh specific surface area to improve the loading capacity Ab and AgPO, and Ag NPs with fine biocompatibility and catalytic property could immobilize Ab via Ag-N bond and further hasten the electron transfer to catalyze the generation of SO radicals for boosting the ECL emission of donor. To establish a new ECL-RET system, Pd@Au core-shell nanoflower was prepared as a suitable ECL acceptor which could immobilize the detection-antibody (Ab). Due to the fine spectral overlap, Pd@Au nanoflower could significantly quench the ECL emission of AgPO, causing distinct decreases in ECL intensity.

The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.Copyright © 2019.

However, the effect of finerenone on renal and CV outcomes has not been investigated in long-term trials yet.The Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease -(FIDELIO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important renal and CV outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIDELIO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 5.5 years. FIDELIO-DKD randomized 5,734 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25-<75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30-≤5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death.FIDELIO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of renal and CV events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.© 2019 S.

Microbiota-derived metabolites act both as nutrients and as messenger molecules and can signal to distant organs in the body to shape host pathophysiology. In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut microbiota-derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy microbiome, specific functions of microbiota-derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new microbiota-based therapies to treat obesity and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the microbiota-host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646113>Epidemiology in  and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>As one of the leading causes of death in the USA,  (DM) has become an epidemic over the past few decades. Despite the high prevalence of diagnosed DM, close to half of all people with DM are unaware of their disease. The risk of type 2 DM is determined by interplay of genetic and metabolic factors. Patients with type 2 DM have a higher risk of death from cardiovascular causes compared with their nondiabetic counterparts, and the mortality rate of DM associated cardiovascular disease is different among ethnicity groups and sex groups. Because of its adverse effect on people's health, DM also imposes an economic burden on individuals and households affected, as well as on the healthcare system. Current guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention have focused on lifestyle management, blood pressure control, lipid control, blood glucose control, antiplatelet agent use, and tobacco use cessation.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Idiopathic (primary) hypertension accounts for approximately 85% of the diagnosed cases, and 15% of hypertensive patients have other contributing conditions leading to elevated blood pressure (secondary hypertension). Endocrine hypertension is a common secondary cause of hypertension. The most common causes of endocrine hypertension are excess production of mineralocorticoids (ie, primary hyperaldosteronism), glucocorticoids (Cushing syndrome), and catecholamines (pheochromocytoma). After biochemical confirmation of hormonal excess, appropriate use of imaging modalities, both functional and anatomic, should occur for the diagnostic workup of these patients and for location of the source of hormonal excess.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Traditionally, pancreatic islets are infused via the portal vein which are subsequently intended to engraft in the liver. Severe immunosuppressive treatments are necessary, however, to prevent rejection of the transplanted islets. Novel approaches therefore have focused on encapsulation of the islets in biomaterial implants which can protect the islets and offer an organ-like environment. Vascularization of the device's surface is a prerequisite for the survival and proper functioning of transplanted pancreatic islets. We are pursuing a prevascularization strategy by incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) loaded microspheres in 3D-printed poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based devices prior to their prospective loading with transplanted cells. Microspheres (∼ 50 μm) were based on poly(ε-caprolactone-PEG-ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(L-lactide) multi-block copolymers and were loaded with 10 μg VEGF/mg microspheres, and subsequently dispersed in a hyaluronic acid carrier liquid. In vitro release studies at 37°C demonstrated continuous release of fully bioactive VEGF for four weeks. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that incorporation of VEGF-releasing microspheres ensures adequate release of VEGF for a time window of four weeks, which is attractive in view of the vascularization of artificial pancreas implants.Copyright © 2019.

This study was carried out to determine some of the possible anti diabetic mechanisms of its action using in vitro cell culturing methods.'s effects on glucose uptake were tested using muscle cells (C2Cl2). Expression of glucose 4 transporters was determined by treating cell lines with plant extract. Total RNA was isolated and using RT-PCR, GLUT 4 expression levels were quantified. Translocation of GLUT 4 was assessed using FITC fluorescence measured by flow cytometry.Treatment of cells with plant extract significantly increased glucose uptake in a concentration dependent manner, with the highest concentration (250 µg/ml) giving 28% increased uptake compared to the negative control. The increase in glucose uptake (2.5 times more than control) was coupled to increase in GLUT 4 mRNA and subsequently GLUT 4 translocation. Wortmannin expunged the  induced increase in GLUT 4 mRNA and glucose uptake.The results suggest that  aqueous extract increases glucose uptake partly through increasing the GLUT 4 mRNA and translocation potentially acting via the PI-3-K pathway.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of telehomecare (THC) use on clinical efficacy, nursing interventions and medical visits compared to the standard care in insulin-treated diabetic patients.A prospective non-inferiority clinical trial was designed. Participants were assigned to either an intervention group provided with a THC system during 3 months or to a control group. Main outcome was the difference in A1c at 3 months compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes were the difference in A1c at 6 months compared to baseline, the number of medical visits during the 6-month period of the study and nursing interventions during the 3 months on THC.A total of 92 participants completed the study. A significant decrease in A1c levels was observed in the THC group (n=45) compared to the control group (n= 47) at 3 months (-0.61% vs -0.06%, respectively, p = 0.048) and at 6 months (-0.37% vs -0.10%, respectively, p = 0.036). The THC group had an average of 0.6 medical visit compared to 1.0 in the control group (p < 0.001). An increase in nursing interventions (mainly E-mails) was noted in THC group (n=14.7) compared to control group (n=1.1).This THC program demonstrates improvement in glycemic control and a decrease in the number of medical visits.

However, chronic illnesses such as cancer and  are often seen in this culturally, ethnically diverse group. The present study had two aims. First was to explain two health outcomes, which were presence of chronic illness (any of the five common conditions cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and/or /prediabetes) and self-rated health, in terms of links to certain factors in acculturation, social status, health, social support, and lifestyle. Second was to determine how uniform these links might be across five ethnic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central/South American. We combined data from 17 years of the National Health Interview Survey (1999-2015) and subjected these secondary measures to logistic and linear regression, separately by ethnicity, to explain both outcomes. With few exceptions, results generally linked illness/health to the tested independent variables. Additionally, results confirmed ethnicity to moderate the outcomes' associations with the independent variables. Ethnicity-specific analysis showed the two outcomes to exhibit dissimilar relationships with certain independent variables across ethnic groups. Research that (as has been common) lumps together respondents whose Hispanic ethnicities may differ disregards some meaningful variation rather than accounting for it. In future research-and in subsequent evidence-based policy/practice development-all essential sociocultural factors, including ethnicity, should be carefully outlined, advancing good health for the entire Hispanic immigrant population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646112>The emergence of cardiodiabetology.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654516>Uncommon association between diabetic ketoacidosis, thyrotoxicosis, cutaneous abscess and acute pericarditis in an immunocompetent patient: a single case report and literature review.</a></h2><p>The typical factors precipitating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) include infections (30%), cessation of antidiabetic medication (20%), and a new diagnosis of  (25%).

We conducted a 2-year study, enrolling 1788 patients with rheumatic diseases who were treated with glucocorticoid for at least 4 weeks at the Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Interferon-release assays (IGRA) were performed with patient blood samples obtained at baseline. Patient data, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), duration and dosage of glucocorticoid and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (immunosuppressant) treatment and comorbidities (malignancies, , chronic renal failure, silicosis) were collected. Patients were followed for 2 years to detect the emergence of active tuberculosis (TB).  21.8% (349/1600) of the patients tested positive in IGRA, indicating LTBI. 2-year follow-up showed that 18 (5.16%) patients with positive IGRA but only 4 (0.35%) patients with negative IGRA developed active TB ( < .05). SLE patients had the highest activation rate of 2.22 per 100 total recruitment cases/year. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that low BMI(<18.5), administration of high dose glucocorticoids (>15 mg daily), and comorbidities that included interstitial lung disease and malignant cancers were significantly associated with LTBI activation.  Our results suggest that screening and preventive therapy of LTBI may be advisable for Chinese rheumatic disease and particularly SLE patients undergoing glucocorticoid therapy with dosage above 15 mg prednisone equivalent daily for more than 4 weeks.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654099>Human erythrocytes: cytoskeleton and its origin.</a></h2><p>In the last few years, erythrocytes have emerged as the main determinant of blood rheology. In mammals, these cells are devoid of nuclei and are, therefore, unable to divide. Consequently, all circulating erythrocytes come from erythropoiesis, a process in the bone marrow in which several modifications are induced in the expression of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins, and different vertical and horizontal interactions are established between them. Cytoskeleton components play an important role in this process, which explains why they and the interaction between them have been the focus of much recent research. Moreover, in mature erythrocytes, the cytoskeleton integrity is also essential, because the cytoskeleton confers remarkable deformability and stability on the erythrocytes, thus enabling them to undergo deformation in microcirculation. Defects in the cytoskeleton produce changes in erythrocyte deformability and stability, affecting cell viability and rheological properties. Such abnormalities are seen in different pathologies of special interest, such as different types of anemia, hypertension, and , among others. This review highlights the main findings in mammalian erythrocytes and their progenitors regarding the presence, conformation and function of the three main components of the cytoskeleton: actin, intermediate filaments, and tubulin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652822>IL-1β and Statin Treatment in Patients with Myocardial Infarction and Diabetic Cardiomyopathy.</a></h2><p>Statins are effective lipid-lowering drugs with a good safety profile that have become, over the years, the first-line therapy for patients with dyslipidemia and a real cornerstone of cardiovascular (CV) preventive therapy. Thanks to both cholesterol-related and "pleiotropic" effects, statins have a beneficial impact against CV diseases. In particular, by reducing lipids and inflammation statins, they can influence the pathogenesis of both myocardial infarction and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Among inflammatory mediators involved in these diseases, interleukin (IL)-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that recently been shown to be an effective target in secondary prevention of CV events. Statins are largely prescribed to patients with myocardial infarction and , but their effects on IL-1β synthesis and release remain to be fully characterized. Of interest, preliminary studies even report IL-1β secretion to rise after treatment with statins, with a potential impact on the inflammatory microenvironment and glycemic control. Here, we will summarize evidence of the role of statins in the prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction and diabetic cardiomyopathy. In accordance with the dual lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effect of these drugs and in light of the important results achieved by IL-1β inhibition through canakinumab in CV secondary prevention, we will dissect the current evidence linking statins with IL-1β and outline the possible benefits of a potential double treatment with statins and canakinumab.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646116>Dyslipidemia in  and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Patients with  have a high residual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and adverse outcomes despite statin therapy and lifestyle modifications.

For protein drugs, only a few studies have been published to elucidate the challenges of stabilizing two proteins in one formulation. Here, we show a systematic study with the model proteins EPO and G-CSF, which differ significantly in their physicochemical properties. We apply several analytical methods to investigate the stability of the co-formulated proteins in the liquid and solid state. Forced degradation studies at elevated temperature indicate poor stability of the liquid co-formulations. Therefore, we use lyophilization as a stabilization strategy. Finally, we adopt an elegant approach, in which the proteins are lyophilized at pH 4.0 and reconstituted with buffer at pH 7.0 to obtain high monomer recovery and to preserve the protein structure of both EPO and G-CSF. After reconstitution, both proteins in co-formulation remain stable for the timespan until eventual application in patients. With this case study, we demonstrate how to overcome some challenges during the co-formulation of therapeutic proteins.Copyright © 2019.

The inadequacy of existing measurements lies in the fact that they view the variability from different aspects, so that no consensus has been reached among physicians as to which metrics to use in practice. Moreover, although glycemic variability, from one day to another, can show very different patterns, very few metrics have been dedicated to daily evaluations.A reference (stable-glycemia) statistical model is built based on a combination of daily computed canonical glycemic control metrics including variability. The metrics are computed for subjects from the TRIMECO islet transplantation trial, selected when their β-score (composite score for grading success) ≥ 6 after a transplantation. Then, for any new daily glycemia recording, its likelihood with respect to this reference model provides a multi-metric score of daily glycemic variability severity. In addition, determining the likelihood value that best separates the daily glycemia with β-score=0 from that with β-score>=6, we propose an objective decision rule to classify daily glycemia into "stable" or "unstable".The proposed characterization framework integrates multiple standard metrics and provides us a comprehensive daily glycemic variability index, based on which, long term variability evaluations and investigations on the implicit link between variability and β-score can be carried out. Evaluation, in a daily glycemic variability classification task, shows that the proposed method is highly concordant to the experience of diabetologists.A multivariate statistical model is proposed to characterize the daily glycemic variability of subjects with type 1 . The model has the advantage to provide a single variability score that gathers the information power of a number of canonical scores, too partial to be used individually.

Several systemic inflammatory conditions have been linked to an increased risk of ASCVD; however, this has not been well established in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD is comprised of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease, both of which involve chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, often with evidence of systemic involvement. Several ASCVD risk factors such as smoking, , poor diet and the presence of obesity may increase the risk of ASCVD in patients suffering from IBD, despite a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Medications used to treat IBD and target inflammation, such as steroids, may also accelerate the risk of the risk for ASCVD heart failure while exacerbating ASCVD risk factors. Several studies have demonstrated an elevated risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke in these patients, most notably in women and in younger patients. Some cohort studies have also suggested a link between IBD and both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, particularly during periods of active flares. All IBD patients, particularly younger individuals, should be screened for ASCVD risk factors with aggressive risk factor modification to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Further research is needed to identify how to prevent and treat cardiovascular events that occur in patients with IBD, particularly during active flares.Copyright © 2019.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the methylation pattern of the PDK4 promoter in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice until the 12th week of the observation. The methylation pattern in the blood samples was analyzed periodically, while the pattern in the muscle sample was only analyzed at the end of the experiment using the blood of the sacrificed animals. Three methylated CpG site 1, CpG site 6, and CpG site 7 were analyzed and quantified based on the band density using bisulfite treatment and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The hyperglycemia period was developed at the 9th week of experiment. However, there was a significant increase of methylation, specifically on CpG site 6 started from week 6 to week 12. This peculiar methylation on CpG site 6 of PDK4 promoter in the blood sample before the hyperglycemic period might serve as a potential biomarker for early detection of  in the patients. No significant difference was found between the methylation level of streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice and of the control group in the muscle sample.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652638>Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Curcumin Nanoparticles on Drug-Induced Acute Myocardial Infarction in Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>We have investigated the cardio-protective effects of pretreatment with curcumin nanoparticles (CUN) compared to conventional curcumin (CUS) on the changes in oxidative stress parameters and inflammatory cytokine levels during induced acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in rats with  (DM). DM was induced with streptozotocin, and AMI with isoproterenol. Eight groups of seven Wister Bratislava rats were included in the study. The N-C was the normal control group, AMI-C was the group with AMI, DM-C was the group with DM, and DM-AMI-C was the group with DM and AMI. All four groups received saline solution orally during the whole experiment. S-DM-CUS-AMI and S-DM-CUN-AMI groups received saline for seven days prior to DM induction and continued with CUS (200 mg/kg bw, bw = body weight) for S-DM-CUS-AMI and CUN for S-DM-CUN-AMI (200 mg/kg bw) for 15 days before AMI induction. The CUS-DM-CUS-AMI group received CUS (200 mg/kg bw), while the CUN-DM-CUN-AMI received CUN (200 mg/kg bw) for seven days prior to DM induction, and both groups continued with administration in the same doses for 15 days before AMI induction. CUS and CUN prevented elevation of creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase in all groups, with better results in the CUN (S-DM-CUN-AMI and CUN-DM-CUN-AMI groups). CUS and CUN significantly reduced serum levels of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, the indirect assessment of nitric oxide synthesis, and total oxidative status) and enhanced antioxidative markers (total antioxidative capacity and thiols, up to 2.5 times). All groups that received CUS or CUN showed significantly lower serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β. The best antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects were obtained for the group that received CUN before DM induction (CUN-DM-CUN-AMI group). Pretreatment with CUN proved higher cardio-protective effects exerting an important antioxidative and anti-inflammatory impact in the case of AMI in DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646117>Hypertension in  and the risk of cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>Hypertension (HTN) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and its many manifestations. It shares pathogenic pathways with  and is part of a common metabolic entity, the metabolic syndrome. When combined with , HTN has been shown to predict and promote increased risk for cardiovascular disease events over and above each risk factor alone. Of the components of this metabolic syndrome, HTN is relatively easy to diagnose and thereby more accessible for implementing preventive and treatment strategies. The recent release of Joint National Committee-8 guidelines for the treatment of HTN has fueled a debate on treatment target goals.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

At the vascular level, T presents genomic and non-genomic effects, and both effects may overlap. The genomic actions assume that androgens can freely cross the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to nuclear androgen receptors, inducing gene transcription and protein synthesis. The non-genomic effects have a more rapid onset and may be related to the interaction with protein/receptor/ion channels of the plasma membrane. The key T effect at the vascular level is vasorelaxation, which is primarily due to its rapid effect. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to discuss the T non-genomic effects at the vascular level and the molecular pathways involved in its vasodilator effect observed in in vivo and in vitro studies. In this sense, the nuclear receptor activation, the influence of vascular endothelium and the activation or inhibition of ion channels (potassium and calcium channels, respectively) will be reviewed regarding all the data that corroborated or not. Moreover, this review also provides a brief update on the association of T with the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, namely metabolic syndrome, type 2 , obesity, atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension. In summary, in this paper we consider the non-genomic vascular mode of action of androgen in physiological conditions and the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2019.

The major risk factor for liver cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and ), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic liver disorders and their progression to liver cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to liver cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of liver cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of liver fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both liver fibrosis progression and liver cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653901>Prognosis and Associated Factors among Elderly Patients with Small Artery Occlusion.</a></h2><p>Small artery occlusion (SAO) is the one of the primary subtype of ischemic stroke in China. However, its outcomes among elderly patients are unclear. Consecutive patients with SAO were recruited at Jiamusi University First Hospital, China between January 2008 and December 2016. Stroke subtype, severity, and risk factors were collected; outcomes at 3, 12, and 36 months after stroke onset were assessed. A total of 1464 SAO patients were included in this study. Participants aged ≥75 years had higher dependency rates than Participants aged <75 years with SAO in all three follow-up periods, in addition to a higher recurrence rate at 12 months and a higher mortality rate 36 months after stroke. After adjusting for confounders, elevated triglyceride level was found to be a protective factor against mortality 36 months after stroke. Stroke severity, , artery stenosis, gender, obesity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were independently associated with the risk of dependency; elevated triglyceride level was an independent risk factor for recurrence at 3 months point after stroke onset. These findings suggest that it is vital to manage risk factors that may affect prognosis of stroke among elderly patients with SAO to improve patient prognosis and reduce the burden of stroke in China.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658129>Delayed Gastric Emptying Associates With Diabetic Complications in Diabetic Patients With Symptoms of Gastroparesis.</a></h2><p>Diabetic gastroparesis (Gp) occurs more often in type 1  (T1DM) than in type 2  (T2DM). Other diabetic end-organ complications include peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy (together termed triopathy). This study determines the prevalence of diabetic complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy) in diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp, assessing the differences between T1DM and T2DM and delayed and normal gastric emptying (GE).Diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp underwent history and physical examination, GE scintigraphy, electrogastrography with water load, autonomic function testing, and questionnaires assessing symptoms and peripheral neuropathy.One hundred thirty-three diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp were studied: 59 with T1DM and 74 with T2DM and 103 with delayed GE and 30 without delayed GE. The presence of retinopathy (37% vs 24%; P = 0.13), nephropathy (19% vs 11%; P = 0.22), and peripheral neuropathy (53% vs 39%; P = 0.16) was not significantly higher in T1DM than in T2DM; however, triopathies (all 3 complications together) were seen in 10% of T1DM and 3% of T2DM (P = 0.04). Diabetic patients with delayed GE had increased prevalence of retinopathy (36% vs 10%; P = 0.006) and number of diabetic complications (1.0 vs 0.5; P = 0.009); however, 39% of diabetic patients with delayed GE did not have any diabetic complications.In diabetic patients with symptoms of Gp, delayed GE was associated with the presence of retinopathy and the total number of diabetic complications. Only 10% of patients with T1DM and 3% of those with T2DM had triopathy of complications, and 39% of diabetic patients with Gp did not have any diabetic complications. Thus, the presence of diabetic complications should raise awareness for Gp in either T1DM or T2DM; however, diabetic Gp frequently occurs without other diabetic complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657959>Response by Kato et al to Letter Regarding Article, "Effect of Dapagliflozin on Heart Failure and Mortality in Type 2 ".</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646115>Metabolically healthy versus unhealthy obesity and risk for  and cardiovascular diseases.</a></h2><p>Obesity presents one of the biggest issues of modern-day life for a wide variety of medical specialties, starting with the cardiologist and ending with the diabetologist or the bariatric surgeon. However, in the last few years a new entity has emerged, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individual. This category encompasses obese individuals without the presence of metabolic diseases such as type 2 , dyslipidemia, or hypertension. Several studies have thus been undertaken to determine the risk of these MHO individuals for  or cardiovascular diseases compared with the 'unhealthy' obese.

We find that exercise enhances resolution of acute inflammation by augmenting resolvin D1 (RvD1) levels and by promoting macrophage phagocytosis. When compared with sedentary controls, mice that performed a four-week treadmill exercise regimen displayed higher macrophage phagocytic activity, enhanced RvD1 levels, and earlier neutrophil clearance following an acute inflammatory challenge. In acute inflammatory cell extracts from exercised mice, we found elevated expression of  and  and higher RvD1 levels. Because exercise stimulates release of epinephrine, which has immunomodulatory effects, we questioned whether epinephrine exerts proresolving actions on macrophages. Epinephrine-treated macrophages displayed higher RvD1 levels and 15-lipoxygenase-1 protein abundance, which were prevented by incubation with the α1 adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) antagonist prazosin. Likewise, stimulation of the α1-AR with phenylephrine enhanced macrophage phagocytosis and RvD1 production. During acute inflammation, prazosin abrogated exercise-enhanced neutrophil clearance, macrophage phagocytosis, and RvD1 biosynthesis. These results suggest that exercise-stimulated epinephrine enhances resolution of acute inflammation in an α1-AR-dependent manner. To our knowledge, our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the proresolving effects of exercise that could lead to the identification of novel pathways to stimulate resolution.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655586>Rationale and protocol for the Assessment of Impact of Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring on people presenting with severe Hypoglycaemia (AIR-CGM) study.</a></h2><p>Severe hypoglycaemia carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality for people with type 1 . Economic costs are also high, estimated at approximately £13 million annually in England, UK. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to reduce hypoglycaemia and associated fear, improve overall glycaemia and quality of life, and is cost-effective. Despite effective pathways in place with high levels of resource utilization, it has been reported there are low levels of follow-up, therapy change and specialist intervention after severe hypoglycaemia. This study is designed to assess the impact of providing real-time CGM to people with type 1 , who have had a recent episode of severe hypoglycaemia (within 72 h), compared to standard care.Fifty-five participants with type 1  and a recent episode of severe hypoglycaemia, who are CGM naïve, will be recruited to the study. Participants will be randomised to CGM or standard care. The primary outcome is percentage time spent in hypoglycaemia (< 3.0 mmol/L, 55 mg/dL). Secondary outcomes include other measures of hypoglycaemia, time in euglycaemia, overall glucose status and patient reported qualitative measures.This study assesses the impact of providing continuous glucose monitoring at the outset in individuals at highest risk of hypoglycaemia.

To study simultaneous pharmacokinetics of teneligliptin and its major active metabolite, teneligliptin sulfoxide in human plasma, we developed and validated a LC-MS/MS method. The analytes were detected in the positive mode using multiple reaction monitoring (teneligliptin: m/z 427.2→243.1; teneligliptin-d : m/z 435.2→251.3; teneligliptin sulfoxide: m/z 443.2→68.2). The method demonstrated accuracy, precision, and linearity over the concentration range of 5 to 1000 ng/mL for teneligliptin and 2.5 to 500 ng/mL for teneligliptin sulfoxide. The developed method is the first fully validated method capable of simultaneous determination of teneligliptin and its active metabolite, teneligliptin sulfoxide in plasma. The suitability of the method was successfully demonstrated in terms of quantification of teneligliptin and teneligliptin sulfoxide pharmacokinetics in plasma samples collected from healthy volunteers.

A major factor in the pathogenesis of CV disease is vascular calcification (VC), which is accelerated in type 2 . Calcification of the vessel wall contributes to vascular stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy whereas intimal calcification may predispose to plaque rupture and CV death. The pathogenesis of VC is complex but appears to be regulated by the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) signaling pathway, which is involved in bone remodeling. Within the bone, OPG prevents RANKL from binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB and inhibiting bone resorption. Outside of the bone, the clinical significance of OPG blocking RANKL is not well understood, but OPG knockout mice that lack OPG develop early and severe VC. This minireview outlines some of the research on OPG/RANKL in the pathogenesis of VC and discusses potential therapies, which may reduce VC and CV burden in humans.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In vitro regulation of miR-132 in trophoblast cell HTR-8/SVneo was achieved by cell transfection, and the effects of miR-132 on cell proliferation were assessed using CCK-8 assay.Expression of miR-132 was decreased in serum and placenta tissues in GDM patients compared with the healthy women. A negative correlation was found between the serum miR-132 levels and fasting blood glucose of the GDM patients. A ROC curve shown the serum miR-132 had considerable diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.898. High glucose (HG) treatment induced an inhibition in HTR-8/SVneo cell proliferation and the expression of miR-132. The overexpression of miR-132 in HTR-8/SVneo cells could markedly rescued the HG - induced suppressed cell proliferation.All the data of this study revealed the reduced expression of miR-132 in serum and placenta tissues of GDM, and serum miR-132 serves a candidate biomarker in the diagnosis of GDM. miR-132 may act a protective role against GDM via enhancing the trophoblast cell proliferation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652622>Amino-3,5-Dicyanopyridines Targeting the Adenosine Receptors Ranging from Pan Ligands to Combined A/A Partial Agonists.</a></h2><p>The amino-3,5-dicyanopyridine derivatives belong to an intriguing series of adenosine receptor (AR) ligands that has been developed by both academic researchers and industry. Indeed, the studies carried out to date underline the versatility of the dicyanopyridine scaffold to obtain AR ligands with not only a wide range of affinities but also with diverse degrees of efficacies at the different ARs. These observations prompted us to investigate on the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of this series leading to important previously reported results. The present SAR study has helped to confirm the 1-imidazol-2-yl group at R position as an important feature for producing potent AR agonists. Moreover, the nature of the R substituent highly affects not only affinity/activity at the hA and hA ARs but also selectivity versus the other subtypes. Potent hA and hA AR ligands were developed, and among them, the 2-amino-6-[(1-imidazol-2-ylmethyl)sulfanyl]-4-[4-(prop-2-en-1-yloxy)phenyl]pyridine-3,5-dicarbonitrile () is active in the low nanomolar range at these subtypes and shows a good trend of selectivity versus both the hA and hA ARs. This combined hAhA partial agonist activity leads to a synergistic effect on glucose homeostasis and could potentially be beneficial in treating  and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646284>Is  equivalent to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease from a healthcare cost perspective? Insights from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey: 2010-2013.</a></h2><p> (DM) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) both increase the risk for a major adverse cardiac event, and are therefore considered priority conditions clinically. Although guidelines encourage clinicians to treat them similarly, many researchers do not consider DM an ASCVD risk-equivalent. However, from a healthcare system standpoint it is more important to determine whether DM is an economic burden equivalent to ASCVD. Using data from the Household Component of the 2010-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we determined that the diagnosis of DM yields significantly lower healthcare expenditures and resource utilization when compared with ASCVD. In fact, the healthcare cost associated with DM alone is almost $1000 less than ASCVD. That being said, the cost and resource utilization was highest among those individuals diagnosed with ASCVD+DM, underscoring the importance of primary and secondary prevention to help detect individuals early and initiate proper lifestyle and aggressive therapeutic managements.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

T2DM patients experience glucose intolerance, and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and α-glucosidase are used as drugs for T2DM management. DPP-IV and α-glucosidase inhibitors are also naturally contained in foods, but their potency can be affected by the food matrix and processing methods. In this study, germination and solid-state fermentation (SSF) were used to alter pulse seed microstructures, to convert compounds into more bioactive forms, and to improve their bioaccessibility. Germination substantially modified the seed microstructure, protein digestibility, contents and profiles of phenolic compounds in all the pulses. It also increased DPP-IV and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities in chickpeas, faba beans and yellow peas. Compared to germination, SSF with Lactobacillus plantarum changed the content and the profile of phenolic compounds mainly in yellow peas and green lentils because of greater disruption of the seed cell wall. In the same pulses, heat treatment and SSF of flour increased DPP-IV and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. The results of this study suggest that germination and SSF with L. plantarum are effective and simple methods for modulating phenolic and protein profiles of common pulses and improve the action on DPP-IV and α-glucosidase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653892>Genomic Prediction of 16 Complex Disease Risks Including Heart Attack, , Breast and Prostate Cancer.</a></h2><p>We construct risk predictors using polygenic scores (PGS) computed from common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for a number of complex disease conditions, using L1-penalized regression (also known as LASSO) on case-control data from UK Biobank. Among the disease conditions studied are Hypothyroidism, (Resistant) Hypertension, Type 1 and 2 , Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Testicular Cancer, Gallstones, Glaucoma, Gout, Atrial Fibrillation, High Cholesterol, Asthma, Basal Cell Carcinoma, Malignant Melanoma, and Heart Attack. We obtain values for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the range ~0.58-0.71 using SNP data alone. Substantially higher predictor AUCs are obtained when incorporating additional variables such as age and sex. Some SNP predictors alone are sufficient to identify outliers (e.g., in the 99th percentile of polygenic score, or PGS) with 3-8 times higher risk than typical individuals. We validate predictors out-of-sample using the eMERGE dataset, and also with different ancestry subgroups within the UK Biobank population. Our results indicate that substantial improvements in predictive power are attainable using training sets with larger case populations.

However, little is known about the potential combined relationships of time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with indices of cognitive health. We examined the cross-sectional associations of objectively-determined sedentary and physically-active behaviors with an indicator of cognitive function decline (CFD) in older adults.A randomly-recruited sample of 511 Japanese older adults (47% male; aged 65-84 years) wore a tri-axial accelerometer (HJA-750C, Omron) for seven consecutive days in 2017. Cognitive function was assessed by interviewers using the Japanese version of Mini-Mental State Examination, with a score of ≤23 indicating CFD. Associations of sedentary and physically-active behaviors with CFD were examined using a compositional logistic regression analysis based on isometric log-ratio transformations of time use, adjusting for potential confounders.Forty one (9.4%) of the participants had an indication of CFD. Activity compositions differed significantly between CFD and normal cognitive function (NCF); the proportion of time spent in MVPA was 39.1% lower, relatively to the overall mean composition in those with CFD, and was 5.3% higher in those with NCF. There was a significant beneficial association of having a higher proportion of MVPA relative to other activities with CFD. LPA and SB were not associated with CFD when models were corrected for time spent in all activity behaviors.Larger relative contribution of MVPA was favorably associated with an indicator of CFD in older adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652794>The Exploration of Natural Compounds for Anti- from Distinctive Species Garcinia  with Comprehensive Review of the Garcinia Family.</a></h2><p>Approximately 400 Garcinia species are distributed around the world.

Patients were divided into four subgroups. The groups were as follows: patients with less than or equal to 12 ng/ml (group 1, =126) vitamin D levels, between 20 and 12 ng/ml (group 2, =48), between 30 and 20 ng/ml (group 3, =21), and at least 30 ng/ml (group 4, =120) vitamin D levels. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL-C levels of the four groups were compared.HDL-C levels of group 4 were the highest (=0.03), and TG and non-HDL-C levels of group 1 were the highest (=0.04, 0.016, respectively) in all groups. There was no significant difference between serum parathormone, calcium, and phosphorus levels of the four groups (=0.778, 0.121, 0.184, respectively).

As compared to normal weight subjects, obese children had higher blood pressure, were significantly more hyper-insulinemic and insulin resistant, showing significantly higher plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). LDF showed lower pre- and post-occlusion forearm skin perfusion (perfusion units/second (PU/sec); median [IQR]) in obese than in normal weight subjects (pre-occlusion: 1633.8 [1023.5] vs. 2281.1 [1344.2]; p = 0.015. Post-occlusion: 4811.3 [4068.9] vs. 7072.8 [7298.8]; p = 0.021), while PAT revealed similar values of reactive hyperemia index (RHI). In entire population, fat mass % (FM%) was an independent determinant of both pre-and post-occlusion skin perfusion. Finally, being obese was associated with a higher risk to have a reduction of both pre- and post-occlusion skin perfusion (OR = 5,82 and 9,27, respectively).LDF showed very early, pre-clinical, vascular involvement in obese adolescents, characterized by impaired skin microcirculation, possibly reflecting a more diffuse microvascular dysfunction to other body tissues.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the long-term effects of SG on T2DM remission with remission seen after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or gastric banding (GB).A literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane Library using the following search terms: 'sleeve gastrectomy', '', 'gastric bypass' and 'gastric banding'. Studies published between January 2000 and April 2018, and with following inclusion criteria were selected for this review: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2, age ≥ 18 years, follow-up ≥ 1 year, T2DM. Data was statistically analysed using a random-effects model and results were expressed as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.After exclusion, 35 out of an initial 748 studies, consisting of 18 138 T2DM patients, remained for inclusion. Of these patients, 2480 underwent a SG. The remaining patients underwent a RYGB (n = 10,597) or GB (n = 5061). One year postoperatively, SG patients reached significantly (OR 0.71, p = 0.003) less T2DM remission than RYGB. After stratifying for different criteria for remission, RYGB still tended to result in higher remission rates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Beyond 1 year of follow-up, the difference between RYGB and SG in terms of T2DM remission decreased. SG was superior to the GB (OR 2.17, p = 0.001) after 1 year of follow-up.This review demonstrates important remission of T2DM following SG. Nevertheless, as remission was significantly more often observed following RYGB surgery, the latter procedure remains the gold standard for reaching T2DM remission in patients with concurrent obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654495>Ganglion cell layer thickening in well-controlled patients with type 1 : an early sign for diabetic retinopathy?</a></h2><p>To evaluate early changes in retinal layers using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with long-standing type 1  (DM1) receiving intensified insulin therapy.In a cross-sectional case-control study 150 patients with DM1 and 150 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants underwent OCT imaging. Scans of both eyes were analysed for different layers (NFL, GCL (+IPL), INL, outer layer complex (OLC, including OPL, ONL and ELM) and photoreceptors (PR)) in all subfields of an ETDRS grid. All analyses were performed semi-automatically using custom software by certified graders of the Vienna Reading Center. ANOVA models were used to compare the mean thickness of the layers between patients and controls.Six hundred eyes with 512 datapoints in 49 b-scans in each OCT were analysed. Mean thickness in patients/controls was 31.35 μm/30.65 μm (NFL, p = 0.0347), 76.7 μm/73.15 μm (GCL, p ≤ 0.0001), 36.29 μm/37.13 μm (INL, p = 0.0116), 114.34 μm/112.02 μm (OLC, p < 0.0001) and 44.71 μm/44.69 μm (PR, p = 0.9401). When evaluating the ETDRS subfields separately for clinically meaningful hypotheses, a significant swelling of the GCL in patients could be found uniformly and a central swelling for the OLC, whereas the distribution of NFL and INL thickening suggests that their statistical significance was not clinically relevant.These preliminary results demonstrate that preclinical retinal changes in patients with long-standing DM1 can be found by retinal layer evaluation. However, the changes are layer-specific, with significant thickening of the GCL and less so of the OLC suggesting a role as an early sign for diffuse swelling and the evolution of DME even in well-controlled .© 2019 The Authors.

This review examines the tissue distribution of the hcrt/orexin system and the variety of biological activities attributed to it. Factors that either stimulate or inhibit the expression of hcrt/orexin system were also addressed in addition to its link to obesity, and insulin and glucose metabolism. Hcrt/orexin ligands and receptors have been localized to different parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hcrt/orexin, orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors are also present in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) and in the exocrine (pancreas, salivary, lacrimal) as well as endocrine (pancreatic islets, pituitary, adrenal) glands. Several factors including stress, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, glutamate, nicotine, glucose, hypoglycemia stimulate the expression of Hcrt/orexin system, but it is inhibited by ageing, bone morphogenetic protein, hypoxia/hypercapnia, melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 and glucagon. Literature reports show that hcrt/orexin can significantly increase insulin secretion from normal and diabetic rat pancreata. Moreover, several studies reported that the tissue expression of glucose transporter type 4 is markedly higher after treatment with orexin. Hcrt/orexin also decreases blood glucose concentration and reduces insulin resistance. It reduces obesity by increasing browning of fat cells and energy expenditure.

The clinical manifestations are similar but not identical to those in excess circulating catecholamines. The underlying symptomatic mechanism includes augmented cardiovascular responsiveness to catecholamines alongside heightened sympathetic nervous stimulation. The psychological characteristics are probably attributed to the component of repressed emotions related to a past traumatic episode or repressive coping style. Successful management can be achieved by strong collaboration between a hypertension specialist and a psychiatrist or psychologist with expertise in cognitive-behavioral panic management.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

CIN is associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased health-care costs, and undesirable clinical outcome. The risk of CIN includes advanced age and . With the rapid development of iconography and the wide application of interventional techniques, the patients with CIN are increasing. The preventive measures of CIN include hydration, using appropriate contrast media, stopping nephrotoxic drugs, ischemic preconditioning, renal replacement therapy, and using appropriate drugs. In this paper, the current status and early prevention progress of CIN will be reviewed from three aspects of the high-risk factors, pathogenesis and prevention, aiming to provide guidance for the early prevention of CIN and explore new research directions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653476>The importance of relationship processes for lowering BMI over time in women with type 2  in a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>Weight change may be affected by dyadic processes within couple relationships. The aim of this secondary data analysis was to explore trends in BMI across time, and assess whether relationship processes (i.e., relationship satisfaction, positive problem-solving), predict BMI trajectories in men and women.Data are from 268 participants in the  Support Project, a randomized trial of behavioral intervention for individuals with type 2  (T2D) in poor glycemic control. For secondary analyses, BMI was measured at pre-treatment (baseline), 4 months (post-treatment), 8 months, and 12 months. Multiple relationship variables were measured at all time points and were modeled as predictors and correlates of change in BMI across time.In general, BMI trajectories had higher starting values (intercepts) for females than for males in the sample (b = -2.51, p < .05), and slopes trended downward from pre-treatment to 12 months (b = -.09, p <  .05). Downward trajectories of BMI were more pronounced for women with higher relationship satisfaction (b = .05, p <  .05) and higher positive problem solving skills (b = .06, p < .05) at baseline. Change in relationship processes were not correlated with change in BMI across time.For women with T2D in this behavioral intervention study, relationship process scores at the beginning of treatment predicted changes in BMI over time, with better problem solving and higher relationship satisfaction at baseline related to steeper decreases in BMI across treatment. Additional research is needed to understand how improving relationship interaction prior to  treatment may positively influence weight loss during treatment.Copyright © 2019.

Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a metabolic clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a metabolic clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the metabolic team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the metabolic clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Simultaneously, the treatment of gestational  in our clinic has shifted towards metformin with substantially less insulin treatment. The aim was to study the impact of these changes on metabolic control and pregnancy outcome through comparing women diagnosed with gestational  during 2012-2013 and 2016-2017.Our universal Oral Glucose Tolerance Test screening program for gestational  diagnosed a total of 199 women with singleton pregnancies during 2012-2013 and 203 during 2016-2017. Treatment and achieved metabolic control in the two different time periods was compared. Pregnancy outcome data related to gestational  was retrieved from case notes and compared between the different time periods.When comparing results from 2016-2017 with 2012-2013 there was no difference in maternal weight or weight gain. There was a higher frequency of heredity (52.6 vs 35.4%; P=0.001) and non-Scandinavian ethnicity (46.5 vs 33.8%; P=0.011).The frequency of smoking during pregnancy was significantly lower (2.6 vs 7.7%; P=0.023) There was an improved metabolic control as measured by median glucose in 2016-2017 compared to 2012-2013 (5.8 vs. 6.2 mmol/L; P<0.001). Insulin was less frequently used in 2016-2017 compared to 2012-2013 (32.5% vs. 44.7%; P=0.012). There was a significant increase in the use of metformin (14.8 vs. 0%; P<0.001). There were no differences regarding the frequency of large for gestational age infants (8.2 vs. 7.3%; P=ns) or macrosomia (16.3 vs. 15.1%; P=ns), median birthweight (3510 vs. 3521; P=ns), frequency of cesarean section (28.1 vs. 27.8%; P=ns) or Apgar scores at 10 minutes (10 (3-10) vs. 10 (7-10); P=ns).In an increasing but changing population of gestational  women in our region, with more heredity and non-Scandinavian origin, but with fewer smokers, metabolic control has improved with maintained favorable pregnancy outcomes, with more frequent use of Metformin and substantially less use of insulin treatment.© 2019 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646133>Oxford  Symposium 2017.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653516>Plaque calcification is driven by different mechanisms of mineralization associated with specific cardiovascular risk factors.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations among markers of mineralization, plaque instability and the main risk factors of atherosclerosis.A Tissue MicroArray containing 52 samples of calcified carotid plaques from 52 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were built. TMA serial sections were used to study the expression of inflammatory and mineralization markers (BMP-2, BMP-4, VDR, RANKL, Osteopontin, Sclerostin, β-catenin and calmodulin) by immunohistochemistry. Our data clearly demonstrated the expression of mineralization markers in atheromatic plaques. Indeed, with the exception of RANKL, all investigated markers were expressed in at least 60% of cases. Specifically, multivariate analysis displayed significant associations between both the expression of BMP-2 and the presence of unstable plaques as well as between the expression of β-catenin and the presence of stable plaques. We also found a significant inverse association between both a) the presence of hypertension and VDR and b) smoking habits and calmodulin expression. Finally, we noted a higher density of RANKL positive cells in plaques from diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic ones and a significant positive association between hypertriglyceridemia and BMP-4 expression.Our results support the hypothesis that the process of atherosclerotic plaque calcification presents a number of similarities with the physiological processes that occur in bone, involving both osteoblasts- and osteoclasts-like arterial cells. Finally, the present study suggests that risk factors, such as hypertension, cigarette smoke and , can cause the destabilization of the atheromatic plaque acting on calcification process as well as inflammation.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Identifying those at risk of developing active CHB requiring antiviral therapy is important. In this study, we prospectively characterize incidence rates and predictors of transitioning from inactive to active CHB in a North American adult cohort.Participants in the multicenter National Institute of  and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Hepatitis B Research Network cohort who were HBeAg negative with baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA ≤ 10,000 IU/mL were included in the study. Cox regression models were used to estimate the proportion of individuals in 3 baseline HBV DNA categories (≤100, 101 to ≤2,000, and 2,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL) who developed phase transition defined by HBV DNA > 10,000 IU/mL and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2× upper limit of normal or initiated treatment during follow-up.Of 970 participants meeting inclusion criteria, 15% experienced phase transition or initiated treatment over a median follow-up of 4 years: 9% of those with baseline HBV DNA ≤ 100 IU/mL, 14% with HBV DNA 101 to ≤2,000 IU/mL, and 24% with HBV DNA 2,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL (P < 0.001). The overall rate of phase transition or treatment initiation was 7.6 per 100 person-years: 4.6 in those with HBV DNA ≤ 100 IU/mL, 6.8 in those with HBV DNA 101 to ≤2,000 IU/mL, and 12.2 in those with HBV DNA 2,001 to ≤10,000 IU/mL (P < 0.001). Factors independently associated with higher rate of phase transition or treatment initiation included HBV genotype B or C, higher baseline ALT and HBV DNA levels, lower platelet count, quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen > 1,000 IU/mL, and hyperlipidemia. Only higher ALT, higher HBV DNA, and lower platelets were associated with phase transition when patients starting treatment were censored.Most adults in this North American cohort with HBeAg-negative CHB and low-level viremia remained inactive and off treatment over 4 years. Transition from inactive to active CHB is infrequent and predominantly associated with viral rather than host factors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654916>Associations of long-term exposure to PM, PM, NO with type 2  prevalence and fasting blood glucose levels in Chinese rural populations.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the associations between long-term exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤1.0 μm and ≤2.5 μm (PM and PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO) and type 2  prevalence and fasting blood glucose levels in Chinese rural populations.A total of 39, 259 participants were enrolled in The Henan Rural Cohort study. Questionnaires and medical examination were conducted from July 2015 to September 2017 in rural areas of Henan province, China. Three-year average residential exposure levels of PM, PM, NO for each subject were estimated by a spatiotemporal model. Logistic regression and linear regression models were applied to estimate the associations between PM, PM, NO exposure and type 2  prevalence and fasting blood glucose levels.The mean 3-year residential exposure concentrations of PM, PM and NO was 57.4 μg/m, 73.4 μg/m and 39.9 μg/m, respectively.

Objective BE measures were calculated using geographic information systems for 10,008 participants (4463 male, 45%) aged 16-66 years in 14 cities. Participants self-reported proximity to three types of food outlets. Outcomes were body mass index (BMI) and overweight/obesity status. Male and female weight status associations with BE measures were estimated by generalized additive mixed models. Proportion (95% CI) of overweight (BMI 25 to <30) ranged from 16.6% (13.1, 19.8) to 41.1% (37.3, 44.7), and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) from 2.9% (1.3, 4.4) to 31.3% (27.7, 34.7), with Hong Kong being the lowest and Cuernavaca, Mexico highest for both proportions. Results differed by sex. Greater street intersection density, public transport density and perceived proximity to restaurants (males) were associated with lower odds of overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25). Perceived proximity to public transport stops (females) was associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. Composite BE measures were more strongly related to BMI and overweight/obesity status than single variables among men but not women. One standard deviation improvement in the composite measures of BE was associated with small reductions of 0.1-0.5% in BMI but meaningful reductions of 2.5-5.3% in the odds of overweight/obesity. Effects were linear and generalizable across cities. Neighborhoods designed to support public transport, with food outlets within walking distance, may contribute to global obesity control.Copyright © 2019.

Risk assessment has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In view of their proximity and accessibility, community pharmacies could be a suitable site for cardiovascular risk assessment and other preventive health activities especially in rural underserved populations. The objective of this study was to assess outcome of cardiovascular risk assessment among rural community dwellers.Five hundred and five community dwellers aged 40 to 80 years were recruited for the study. Cardiovascular risk assessment was performed using the region specific WHO/ISH risk assessment charts. Blood pressure,  status, total non- fasting cholesterol, and age were used to estimate risk category. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were expressed as frequency and percentage. Regression analysis was done to identify predictors of high risk category.More than 30% of subjects were hypertensive. Nearly 30% were overweight and had abnormal cholesterol levels. The proportion of subjects in the high risk category was 8.9%. Systolic blood pressure, random blood sugar and advancing age were the highest predictors of high risk category.Accessibility, proximity and availability are unique characteristics of community pharmacies that could be exploited to support community based screening services.© 2019 Adje et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656536>Mechanism associated with aberrant lncRNA MEG3 expression in gestational .</a></h2><p>Gestational  (GDM) is a common metabolic condition during pregnancy. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to seve critical roles in GDM development; however, the role of lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in GDM remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and role of MEG3 in GDM, and to further explore the underlying mechanism. The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in the blood and placental villous tissues of pregnant women with GDM was measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the association between lncRNA MEG3 and microRNA (miR)-345-3p. Transfection was subsequently performed on HTR-8/SVneo cells, a human chorionic trophoblast cell line, to assess the role of lncRNA MEG3 in GDM. In particular, cell viability, cellular migratory/invasive ability and cell apoptosis were analyzed using MTT assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Compared with pregnant women without GDM, lncRNA MEG3 levels were significantly elevated in the blood and placental villous tissues of GDM pregnant women. miR-345-3p was identified to be a direct target of lncRNA MEG3 using dual luciferase reporter assay, which was found to be reduced in pregnant women with GDM. Further analysis demonstrated that lncRNA MEG3 overexpression significantly inhibited HTR-8/SVneo cell viability, and prevented cell migration and invasion in addition to inducing cell apoptosis. In contrast, lncRNA MEG3 knockdown significantly enhanced HTR-8/SVneo cell viability, promoted cell migration/invasion and reduced cell apoptosis. Inhibiting miR-345-3p expression negated all the observed physiological effects of lncRNA MEG3 knockdown on HTR-8/SVneo cells. In conclusion, lncRNA MEG3 levels were abnormally upregulated in GDM, which participated in the development and progression of GDM by regulating human chorionic trophoblast cell physiology. Therefore, lncRNA MEG3 may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for GDM.Copyright: © Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656244>Personal characteristics effects on validation of self-reported type 2  from a cross-sectional survey among Chinese adults.</a></h2><p>The objective was to evaluate the effects of personal characteristics on the validation of self-reported type 2  among Chinese adults in urban Shanghai.During 2015 to 2016, 4,322 participants were recruited in this validation study.

Additional 5 PPI peptides previously proved to be antigenic in other cohorts of patients with T1D were also used. PPI reactive T cell responses were measured by interferon (IFN)-γ ELISPOT assay.51 Chinese patients with T1D were enrolled in this study and 72.34% of them were positive for at least one islet autoantibody. The stimulation index (SI) value of IFN-γ response to PPI peptide pool or peptides with dominant epitopes was below 3 in patients when SI≥3 was used as the positive cut-off value. 2 peptides (B9-23, C19-A3) restricted to DQ8 or DR4 molecule failed to induce positive IFN-γ response in patients with high risk HLA-DQ8 or HLA-DR4/DR9 alleles. RNA-seq analysis of PPI specific CD4 T cell lines further showed that most of the IFN-γ associated genes remained unchanged.This is the first report of CD4 T cell epitope mapping of PPI in Chinese T1D. The lack of positive IFN-γ response to PPI peptides indicates that PPI might not be the principal antigenic candidate for autoreactive CD4 T cells in Chinese T1D. Therefore, the efficacy of PPI-based immunotherapies in attenuating proinflammatory CD4 T cell response requires further investigation.This article is protected by copyright.

At present the signals required for the maturation process are poorly defined. Cytokines could potentially provide the necessary "third signal" required to generate fully mature CTL capable of killing insulin-producing β-cells. To determine whether autoreactive CTL within islets respond to cytokines we generated non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with a reporter for cytokine signalling. These mice express a reporter gene, hCD4, under the control of the endogenous regulatory elements for suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS)1, which is itself regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. In NOD mice, the hCD4 reporter was expressed in infiltrated islets and the expression level was positively correlated with the frequency of infiltrating CD45 cells. SOCS1 reporter expression was induced in transferred β-cell-specific CD8 8.3T cells upon migration from pancreatic draining lymph nodes into islets. To determine which cytokines induced SOCS1 promoter activity in islets, we examined hCD4 reporter expression and CTL maturation in the absence of the cytokine receptors IFNAR1 or IL-21R. We show that IFNAR1 deficiency does not confer protection from  in 8.3 TCR transgenic mice, nor is IFNAR1 signalling required for SOCS1 reporter upregulation or CTL maturation in islets. In contrast, IL-21R-deficient 8.3 mice have reduced  incidence and reduced SOCS1 reporter activity in islet CTLs. However IL-21R deficiency did not affect islet CD8 T cell proliferation or expression of granzyme B or IFNγ. Together these data indicate that autoreactive CD8 T cells respond to IL-21 and not type I IFNs in the islets of NOD mice, but neither IFNAR1 nor IL-21R are required for islet intrinsic CTL maturation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653665>Mexican hat sign.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657365>Structure characterization and optical properties investigation of the four main components of the classical phenazinium dye Safranin O.</a></h2><p>Safranin O is an important and classical phenazinium dye; since the 19th century, it has been extensively used in the academic field as a spectroscopic probe and indicator.

From baseline, the treatment with anti-PCSK9 mAbs: i) in ASA HC patients, significantly decreased platelet aggregation detected in platelet-rich plasma by light transmission aggregometry and in whole blood Platelet Function Analyzer-100 assay; ii) in all HC patients, significantly decreased platelet membrane expression of CD62P and plasma levels of the in vivo platelet activation markers soluble CD40 Ligand, Platelet Factor-4, and soluble P-Selectin. Furthermore, CD62P expression, and sP-Selectin, PF-4, sCD40L levels significantly correlated with serum PCSK9.Besides markedly lowering LDL-c levels, our results suggest that HC patients benefit from anti-PCSK9 mAb treatment also for reducing platelet reactivity and increasing platelet sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of aspirin.

It has been closely linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 , with strong implications for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review focuses on the relationship between NAFLD and CVD and the proposed interactions interlinking these two diseases. This appraisal also discusses treatments targeting NAFLD in the context of CVD. NAFLD is a multisystem disease and ultimately the goals of therapy are to ameliorate CVD and prevent coronary artery disease morbidity and mortality.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

BCL11A functions mainly as a transcriptional repressor that is crucial in brain, hematopoietic system development, as well as fetal-to-adult hemoglobin switching. The expression of this gene is regulated by microRNAs, transcription factors and genetic variations. A number of studies have recently shown that BCL11A is involved in β-hemoglobinopathies, hematological malignancies, malignant solid tumors, 2p15-p16.1 microdeletion syndrome, and type II . It has been suggested that BCL11A may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for some diseases. In this review, we summarize the current research state of BCL11A, including its biochemistry, expression, regulation, function and its possible clinical application in human diseases.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652814>Regulation of c-Jun NH-Terminal Kinase for Islet Transplantation.</a></h2><p>Islet transplantation has been demonstrated to provide superior glycemic control with reduced glucose lability and hypoglycemic events compared with standard insulin therapy. However, the insulin independence rate after islet transplantation from one donor pancreas has remained low. The low frequency of islet grafting is dependent on poor islet recovery from donors and early islet loss during the first hours following grafting. The reduction in islet mass during pancreas preservation, islet isolation, and islet transplantation leads to β-cell death by apoptosis and the prerecruitment of intracellular death signaling pathways, such as c-Jun NH-terminal kinase (JNK), which is one of the stress groups of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In this review, we show some of the most recent contributions to the advancement of knowledge of the JNK pathway and several possibilities for the treatment of  using JNK inhibitors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655799>Role of Muscle Profile in Alzheimer's Disease: A 3-Year Longitudinal Study.</a></h2><p>Many factors are known to affect the rate of cognitive decline; however, studies on clinical outcomes are rare. Muscle profile and their relationship to dementia trajectories have not been extensively investigated. We investigated factors that affect the rate of clinical decline and the usefulness of muscle profiles for predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD).Sixty-nine subjects with probable AD were included and several factors that are known to affect the rate of cognitive decline were evaluated.Over a period of 3 years, each subject received an annual evaluation that included a clinical interview and an assessment of their cognitive status as measured by a clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SOB) score. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for associations between each factor and the -CDR-SOB score over time. These analyses were repeated in a multivariate linear mixed-effects model after adjusting the covariates.Age, , and baseline dementia severity were identified as potential covariates that influence clinical progression. However, a subject's muscle profile was not found to predict dementia progression.We expect that early screening and intervention, as well as new drugs with mechanisms of action similar to those of antidiabetic medications, will help patients with dementia maintain their clinical status.© 2019 S.

These should be evaluated before and after active hypercortisolism, and each should be treated specifically. Antihypertensives may be chosen based on probable pathophysiology. Thus, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensinogen system are recommended. Mineralocorticoid antagonists are helpful in hypokalemic patients. Other agents are often needed to normalize blood pressure. If medical treatment of Cushing syndrome is chosen, the goal should be to normalize cortisol (or its clinical action); if this is not achieved, it is more difficult to treat comorbidities.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646281>Leveling-off of declining trend of cardiovascular disease-related mortality in the USA: the challenge to rein in obesity and  epidemic.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654685>Prolonged half-life of small-sized therapeutic protein using serum albumin-specific protein binder.</a></h2><p>Many small-sized proteins and peptides, such as cytokines and hormones, are clinically used for the treatment of a variety of diseases. However, their short half-life in blood owing to fast renal clearance usually results in a low therapeutic efficacy and frequent dosing. Here we present the development of a human serum albumin (HSA)-specific protein binder with a binding affinity of 4.3 nM through a phage display selection and modular evolution approach to extend the blood half-life of a small-sized therapeutic protein. As a proof-of-concept, the protein binder composed of LRR (Leucine-rich repeat) modules was genetically fused to the N-terminus of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1). The fused GLP-1 was shown to have a significantly improved pharmacokinetic property: The terminal half-life of the fused GLP-1 increased to approximately 10 h, and the area under the curve was 5-times higher than that of the control. The utility and potential of our approach was demonstrated by the efficient control of the blood glucose level in type-2  mouse models using the HSA-specific protein binder-fused GLP-1 over a prolonged time period. The present approach can be effectively used in enhancing the efficacy of small-sized therapeutic proteins and peptides through an enhanced blood circulation time.Copyright © 2019.

To understand how these interactions contribute to metabolic homeostasis and disease states, we analysed the steady state response of metabolic regulation (catabolic or anabolic) with respect to structural and input perturbations in the integrated signalling network, for varying levels of plasma glucose. Structural perturbations revealed: the positive feedback of AKT on IRS is responsible for the bistability in anabolic zone (glucose >5.5 mmol); the positive feedback of calcium on cAMP is responsible for ensuring ultrasensitive response in catabolic zone (glucose <4.5 mmol); the crosstalk between AKT and PDE3 is responsible for efficient catabolic response under low glucose condition; the crosstalk between DAG and PKC regulates the span of anabolic bistable region with respect to plasma glucose levels. The macronutrient perturbations revealed: varying plasma amino acids and fatty acids from normal to high levels gradually shifted the bistable response towards higher glucose range, eventually making the response catabolic or unresponsive to increasing glucose levels. The analysis reveals that certain macronutrient composition may be more conducive to homeostasis than others. The network perturbations that may contribute to disease states such as , obesity and cancer are discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655001>Hypoglycemic Episodes Increase the Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmia and Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Patients with Type 2 - A Nationwide Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>The impact of hypoglycemic episode (HE) on the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) remains unclear. We hypothesized that HE increases the risk of both VA and SCA, and that glucose-lowering agents causing HE also increase the risk of VA/SCA in patients with type 2  (T2D).Patients aged ≥20 years with newly diagnosed T2D were identified using Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. HE was defined as the presentation of hypoglycemic coma or specified/unspecified hypoglycemia. The control group consisted of T2D patients without HE. The primary outcome was the occurrence of VA (including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation) and SCA during the defined follow-up periods. A multivariate Cox hazards regression model was used to evaluate the hazard ratio (HR) for VA or SCA.A total of 54,303 patients were screened, with 1,037 patients with HE were assigned to the HE group, and 4,148 frequency-matched patients without HE constituted the control group. During a mean follow-up period of 3.3±2.5 years, 29 VA/SCA events occurred. Compared to the control group, HE group had a higher incidence of VA/SCA (adjusted HR: 2.42, p=0.04). Patients who had used insulin for glycemic control showed an increased risk of VA/SCA compared to that of patients who did not receive insulin (adjusted HR: 3.05, p=0.01).The HEs in patients with T2D increased the risk of VA/SCA, compared to those who did not experience HEs. Use of insulin also independently increased the risk of VA/SCA.This article is protected by copyright.

Securidaca seed (HESS) on antioxidant capacity, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and insulin resistance in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, alone and in combination with glibenclamide.Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided in to eight equal groups including healthy and diabetic controls and six treated groups with a various doses of HESS alone and in combination with glibenclamide, for 35 consecutive days. Serum samples were taken and analyzed for biochemical profile, HOMA indexes, FGF21, oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory biomarkers as compared with the controls. Moreover, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of herbal extract were assessed.The herbal extract was found to be rich in flavonoid and phenolic components.

Alogliptin is efficacious both as monotherapy and as add-on/combination therapy with other commonly prescribed T2DM treatments, such as metformin and pioglitazone. Overall, alogliptin is well-tolerated in patients with T2DM, including older patients, those with renal and/or hepatic impairment, and those at high risk of cardiovascular events. There is a low risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, acute pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal adverse events with alogliptin treatment, as demonstrated in long-term trials (lasting up to 4.5 years) and in a real-world setting. Additionally, alogliptin has a generally favorable or similar safety profile in comparison to other antidiabetic agents (metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin). However, further evaluation would be required to determine the mechanism and effect of alogliptin on heart failure, bullous pemphigoid, and inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, due to the ethnic diversity in the epidemiology of T2DM, alogliptin has been shown to be more efficacious in Asian patients than in non-Asian patients with T2DM, but with a similar tolerability profile. These data indicate that DPP-4is, including alogliptin, are important treatment options, especially for Asian patients with T2DM, for whom they have potential as a first-line therapy. This benefit-risk assessment aims to place alogliptin within the current armamentarium of T2DM and aid physicians when choosing optimal  treatment for their patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657992>Type 1  (Juvenile ) - A Review for the Pediatric Oral Health Provider.</a></h2><p>: To describe the significance of type 1  (juvenile ) to the pediatric oral health provider. : The oral health provider must be aware of type 1  (T1DM) characteristics, influence of on oral health, each patient pre-operative diabetic management, symptoms and treatment of hypo and hyper-glycemia, and the clinical implications before, during and after treatment of children with T1DM. : A review of the scientific literature about the T1DM influence on dental development, caries prevalence, gingival and periodontal diseases, wound healing, salivary and taste dysfunction, oral infections, and the factors that must be taken in consideration before, during and after oral treatment of children with T1DM is presented. : The increasing prevalence of T1DB in children strongly emphasizes the need for oral health providers to be aware of the complicacy of the treatment aimed to obtain and maintain acceptable blood glucose levels in diabetic children, the effect of  on the oral cavity, the possible serious complications due to hypo- or hyper glycemia before, during and after oral treatments, the effect of stress on blood glucose levels, and the special behavioral interaction between the diabetic child, his/her family and the oral health providers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646121>Pioglitazone and cardiovascular risk reduction: time for a second look?</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance, a fundamental pathophysiological abnormality in patients with type 2 , is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) disease risk. In  management, the macrovascular impact of antihyperglycemic agents that do not improve insulin sensitivity has generally been disappointing.

Rosiglitazone is a synthetic ligand while 15-deoxy-Δ -prostaglandin J (15d-PGJ ) is the endogenous agonist of PPARγ. Reticulon 4B (Nogo-B) is the detectable Nogo protein family member in the liver and secreted into circulation. Herein, we determined if rosiglitazone can alleviate intrahepatic cholestasis in mice.Wild type, hepatocyte-specific PPARγ or Nogo-B knockout mice received intragastric administration of α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) and/or rosiglitazone, followed by determination of intrahepatic cholestasis and the involved mechanisms. Serum samples were collected from PBC patients and non-PBC controls to analyze cholestasis-related serum parameters.Rosiglitazone prevented wild type but not hepatocyte-specific PPARγ deficient mice from ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis by activating expression of bile homeostatic molecules, reducing hepatic necrosis, and correcting abnormal serum parameters and bile enterohepatic circulation. Nogo-B deficiency had similar protections to rosiglitazone. ANIT-induced intrahepatic cholestasis reduced 15d-PGJ but increased Nogo-B in serum, and both were corrected by rosiglitazone. Nogo-B deficiency in the liver boosted 15d-PGJ production, thereby activating expression of PPARγ and bile homeostatic molecules. Rosiglitazone and Nogo-B deficiency also alleviated cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia. Furthermore, reduced 15d-PGJ and increased Nogo-B in PBC patients' serum were determined, with a negative or positive correlation to classical cholestatic parameters. In addition, rosiglitazone reduced symptoms of the established intrahepatic cholestasis.Our study demonstrates that 15d-PGJ and Nogo are important biomarkers for intrahepatic cholestasis. Synthetic PPARγ ligands can be used for treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis and cholestasis-associated dyslipidemia potentially.This article is protected by copyright.

There are no effective approaches to preventing its development in the clinic. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are increasingly recognized as important molecular players in cardiovascular disease. Herein we investigated the profiling of cardiac lncRNA and mRNA expression in type 2 diabetic db/db mice with and without early diabetic cardiomyopathy. We found that db/db mice developed cardiac hypertrophy with normal cardiac function at 6 weeks of age but with a decreased diastolic function at 20 weeks of age. LncRNA and mRNA transcripts were remarkably different in 20-week-old db/db mouse hearts compared with both nondiabetic and diabetic controls. Overall 1479 lncRNA transcripts and 1109 mRNA transcripts were aberrantly expressed in 6- and 20-week-old db/db hearts compared with nondiabetic controls.

In particular, due to the steadily increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders such as , an adequate control of the circulating amount of insulin is desirable. In addition, also in forensics and doping control analysis, the determination of insulin in blood, urine or other biological matrices plays a major role. However, in order to establish general reference values for insulin and C-peptide for diabetology, the comparability of measured concentrations is indispensable. This has not yet been fully implemented, although enormous progress has been made in recent years, and the search for a "gold standard" method is still ongoing. In addition to established ligand-binding assays, an increasing number of mass-spectrometric methods have been developed and employed as the to-date available systems (for example, high-resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometers) provide the sensitivity required to determine analyte concentrations in the sub-ng/mL (sub-100pmol/L) level. Meanwhile, also high-throughput measurements have been realized to meet the requirement of testing a high number of samples in a short period of time. Further developments aim at enabling the online measurement of insulin in the blood with the help of an insulin sensor and, in the following, in addition to a brief review, today's state of the art testing developments are summarized.© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Stem cell research is nowadays part of the medicine. After developments and trials for decades, in 1988 it was announced that a variety of diseases and injuries would be cured with new stem cell therapy, such as: cancer, , Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries and many others. After almost 10 years of research in the field, in 2007 other good news and hopes were announced: the possibility to create induced pluripotent stem cells, derived from somatic cells, easily used to establish any disease-specific cell line. And research is going on. In order to find answer to a variety of challenges in this area, a researcher faces the following main question: Which are the legislations and the normative standards to be taken into account when we are supposing to conduct a research on/with stem cells? The purpose of the paper is: (i) to familiarize professionals with the current steps in the evolution of stem cell research; (ii) to provide main legal orientations related to stem cell research; (iii) to indicate limits and explanations on legal regulations related to the research on stem cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652867>Identifying Phlorofucofuroeckol-A as a Dual Inhibitor of Amyloid-β Self-Aggregation and Insulin Glycation: Elucidation of the Molecular Mechanism of Action.</a></h2><p>Both amyloid-β (Aβ) and insulin are amyloidogenic peptides, and they play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type-2  (T2D). Misfolded or aggregated Aβ and glycated insulin are commonly found in AD and T2D patients, respectively, and exhibit neurotoxicity and oxidative stress. The present study examined the anti-Aβ aggregation and anti-insulin glycation activities of five phlorotannins isolated from  . Thioflavin-T assay results suggest that eckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A (PFFA) significantly inhibit Aβ self-assembly. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation analyses confirmed that these phlorotannins have a strong potential to interact with Aβ peptides and interrupt their self-assembly and conformational transformation, thereby inhibiting Aβ aggregation. In addition, PFFA dose-dependently inhibited d-ribose and d-glucose induced non-enzymatic insulin glycation. To understand the molecular mechanism for insulin glycation and its inhibition, we predicted the binding site of PFFA in insulin via computational analysis. Interestingly, PFFA strongly interacted with the Phe1 in insulin chain-B, and this interaction could block d-glucose access to the glycation site of insulin. Taken together, our novel findings suggest that phlorofucofuroeckol-A could be a new scaffold for AD treatment by inhibiting the formation of β-sheet rich structures in Aβ and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in insulin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654999>Predicting Selection Preference of Robotic Pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) in a Chinese Single Center Population: Development and Assessment of a New Predictive Nomogram.</a></h2><p>BACKGROUND Robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD) is a novel type of minimally invasive surgery to treat tumors located at the head of the pancreas. This study aimed to construct a novel prediction model for predicting selection preference for RPD in a Chinese single medical center population. MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical data from 451 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients were collected and analyzed from January 2013 to December 2016. Twenty-three items affecting clinical strategies were optimized by LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression analysis and then were incorporated in multivariable logistic regression analysis. C-index was used for evaluating the discriminative ability. Decision curve was applied to determine clinical application of this model and the calibration of this nomogram was evaluated by calibration plot. The model was internally validated through bootstrapping validation. RESULTS Clinicopathological factors included in the model were age, history of , history of hypertension, history of heart, brain and kidney disease, history of abdominal surgery, symptoms (jaundice, accidental discovery and weight loss), anemia, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), smoking, alcohol intake, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, vascular invasion, overweight, preoperative lymph node metastasis and tumor size >3.5 cm. A C-index of 0.831 indicated good discrimination and calibration of this model. Interval validation generated an acceptable C-index of 0.787. When surgical approach was determined at the threshold of preference possibility less than 63%, decision curve analysis indicated that this model had good clinical application value in this range. CONCLUSIONS This new nomogram could be conveniently used to predict the selection preference of robotic surgery for patients with pancreatic head cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654972>Depression-like behavior, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation presented in diabetic mice are reversed by the administration of 1-methyl-3-(phenylselanyl)-1H-indole.</a></h2><p>Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are found both in  and major depressive disorder (MDD). In addition to damage in peripheral organs, such as liver and kidney, diabetic patients have a higher risk of developing depression. In this sense, the objective of the present study was to characterize the antidepressant-like effect of a selenium-containing compound, the 1-methyl-3-(phenylselanyl)-1H-indole (MFSeI), in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. STZ (200 mg/kg, i.p.) was used to induce  type I, and after seven days, the administration of MFSeI (10 mg/kg, i.g.) was initiated and followed for the next 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of MFSeI, the behavioral tests were performed, followed by euthanasia. The treatment with MFSeI was able to reverse the hyperglycemia induced by STZ. MFSeI also decreased the plasma levels of biomarkers of liver and kidney damage. Importantly, MFSeI reversed the depression-like behavior induced by STZ in the tail suspension test and forced swimming test without promoting locomotor alterations. Furthermore, MFSeI reversed the increased levels of reactive species and lipid peroxidation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HC), liver, and kidney of STZ-treated mice. Treatment with MFSeI also decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, while increasing the expression of interleukin-10, insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucose transport-4 in the PFC and HC of mice. Taken together, the results indicate the effectiveness of MFSeI against depression-like behavior and central and peripheral complications caused by  in mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Activity limitations negatively impact social connectedness and psychological well-being, reducing the quality of life (QoL) of patients. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing information on QoL in KOA patients and share the reported individual factors, which may influence it.We conducted a systematic review examining the literature up to JAN/2017 available at MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO using KOA and QOL related keywords. Inclusion criteria were QOL compared to at least one demographic factor (e.g., age, gender), lifestyle factor (e.g., functional independence), or comorbidity factor (e.g., , obesity) and a control group. Analytical methods were not considered as part of the original design.A total of 610 articles were reviewed, of which 62 met inclusion criteria. Instruments used to measure QoL included: SF-36, EQ-5D, KOOS, WHOQOL, HAS, AIMS, NHP and JKOM. All studies reported worse QoL in KOA patients when compared to a control group. When females were compared to males, females reported worse QOL. Obesity as well as lower level of physical activity were reported with lower QoL scores. Knee self-management programs delivered by healthcare professionals improved QoL in patients with KOA. Educational level and higher total mindfulness were reported to improve QoL whereas poverty, psychological distress, depression and lacking familial relationships reduce it. Surgical KOA interventions resulted in good to excellent outcomes generally; although, results varied by age, weight, and depression.KOA has a substantial impact on QoL. In KOA patients, QoL is also influenced by specific individual factors including gender, body weight, physical activity, mental health, and education. Importantly, education and management programs designed to support KOA patients report improved QoL. QoL data is a valuable tool providing health care professionals with a better comprehension of KOA disease to aid implementation of the most effective management plan.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h2><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of metabolic dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and chronic low-grade inflammatory diseases, and to determine the frequency of MetS and insulin resistance in psoriasis and PsA as compared to RA.A total of 155 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Fifty patients who were diagnosed with psoriasis, 55 PsA patients who were diagnosed according to the CASPAR criteria, and 50 seropositive RA patients who were diagnosed according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria were included in this study. MetS was diagnosed by the 2005 criteria of International  Federation. The cardiovascular risk factors and parameters associated with MetS were evaluated.The patients' mean age was significantly higher in the RA. MetS was determined in 33.5% of all patients and MetS and insulin resistance showed no significant difference among the three groups (psoriasis: 36%, PsA: 29%, RA: 36%; p: 0.684 and psoriasis: 70%, PsA: 64%, RA: 66%, respectively; p: 0.785). Triglyceride levels were higher in psoriasis and PsA as compared to the RA (psoriasis: 34%, PsA: 32.7%, RA: 16%, respectively; p: 0.045). The frequency of hypertension was 38% in the RA, which was higher than PsA and psoriasis (p: 0.011).In all three groups, the prevalence of MetS was shown to be higher than the general population. The lack of difference between these groups may be due to the small number of patients, the retrospective study design, and the inequality of the population with respect to age and gender.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656034>Neuregulin-4 is associated with plasma glucose and increased risk of type 2 .</a></h2><p>Neuregulin-4 is a cytokine with many functions and is primarily produced by fat tissue.The aim of the study was to observe the relationship between serum neuregulin-4 levels and  regulation in type 2  (T2DM), and to compare neuregulin-4 levels of diabetic subjects with those in healthy controls.Patients with T2DM were included to the study. Healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. Subjects with T2DM with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;7% were classed as well controlled and those with HbA1c &ge;7% were classed as poorly controlled. Neuregulin-4 levels of the study and control groups were compared.The neuregulin-4 levels of the poorly controlled T2DM, well-controlled T2DM and control groups were significantly different (p = 0.005). Neuregulin-4 was significantly correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r = 0.247, p = 0.002) but not with HbA1c. In a regression analysis model, 0.1 point elevation in neuregulin-4 levels increased the rate of existence of T2DM 4.4-fold (odds ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.26&ndash;15.1; p = 0.02).Neuregulin-4 is significantly increased in patients with T2DM compared with control subjects, which means that it could be a marker of T2DM. Since neuregulin-4 was correlated with fasting glucose, we suggest that elevated neuregulin-4 could predict poor control in T2DM for short periods when HbA1c is not useful.&nbsp; Moreover, one unit elevation in neuregulin-4 (0.1 ng/ml) increases the rate of existence of T2DM 4.4-fold, independently from other variables.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656021>Risk of Potential Glucocorticoid-Related Adverse Events in Patients with Giant Cell Arteritis: Results from a USA-Based Electronic Health Records Database.</a></h2><p>Oral glucocorticoids (GC) have been the mainstay of treatment for giant cell arteritis (GCA). We estimated the risk and dose-effect relationship of potential GC-related adverse events (AEs) in patients with GCA.This retrospective, observational cohort study utilized data from the IBM Explorys Electronic Health Records database from 2008 through 2016. Inclusion criteria included the presence of at least two GCA diagnostic codes in subjects aged 50 or older along with supporting laboratory [C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)], prescription data on oral GCs, and at least 12 months of follow-up before and after the first oral GC prescription for GCA (index date). Potential AEs captured on the basis of new diagnoses, prescriptions, and laboratory tests were assessed during the 12 months post-index date. Results were descriptively summarized across cohorts according to quartiles (Q) of mean daily GC dose measured over the first 6 months of follow-up (Q1, ≥ 1.00 to ≤ 13.75 mg; Q2, > 13.75 to ≤ 25.00 mg; Q3, > 25.00 to ≤ 40.00 mg; Q4, > 40.00 mg).We identified 785 eligible patients with GCA. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 76 (9) years and 70% were female. The mean oral GC dose during the first 6 months post-index was 28.9 mg/day. A dose-effect response was observed from Q1 to Q4 in the following potential GC-related AEs: newly diagnosed type 2 /HbA1c > 7.5% (range 7.5-24.5%), blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (range 7.5-15%), serious infection (range 16.8-24.8%), cataracts (range 12.0-21.7%), gastrointestinal bleed/ulcer (range 6.0-11.8%), and increase in BMI ≥ 5 units (range 4.1-6.4).In patients with GCA, potential GC-related AEs increased with higher daily oral GC doses.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the hyperglycemia peak during OGTT on the levels of oxidants and antioxidants in the body.Eighty individuals who had applied to the outpatient clinic with suspected  and OGTT indication were included in the study. Glucose, total oxidant capacity (status) (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels were tested on blood samples collected from these individuals at minutes 0, 60 and 120 during the OGTT carried out with 75g glucose. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated as the ratio of TOS to TAS (OSI = TOS/TAS).While oxidative parameters TOS, LOOH were significantly increased in the 60th minute of OGTT, only LOOH was significantly increased in the 120th minute of OGTT. A significant decrease in antioxidative parameters (TAS, SOD) were observed at 60th minutes of the OGTT and at 120th minutes of the OGTT. Oxidative stress index was significantly increased at the 60th minutes of the OGTT and 120th minutes of the OGTT.Oxidative stress parameters were increased and antioxidative parameters were decreased during OGTT.

The placenta provides the fetus with the necessary nutrition and oxygen and takes away the metabolic waste. Patients with GDM are diagnosed and treated merely on the basis of the blood glucose level; this approach does nothing to help evaluate the status of the placenta, which is worth noting in GDM. The purpose of this research was to clarify the relation between thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the placenta of patients with GDM, which has thus far remained unclear.The expression of TXNIP in the placentas of 10 patients with GDM and 10 healthy puerperae (control group) was investigated via immunofluorescence. The relation among TXNIP, ROS, and the function of mitochondria was explored in HTR-8/SVneo cells stimulated by high glucose (HG).The results showed the expression of TXNIP in the placentas of patients with GDM was higher than that in the control group, and the expression of TXNIP in HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with HG was higher than that in the control group, causing the accumulation of ROS and changes of mitochondria, promoting apoptosis and inhibition of migration.High expression of TXNIP caused by HG mediates the increasing ROS and the mitochondria dysfunction in GDM; this impairs the function of the placenta and is the basis for the prediction of perinatal outcome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658144>SWEDEHEART-1-year data show no benefit of newer generation drug-eluting stents over bare-metal stents in patients with severe kidney dysfunction following percutaneous coronary intervention.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that the transition from bare-metal stents (BMS) to newer generation drug-eluting stents (n-DES) in clinical practice may have reduced the risk also in patients with kidney dysfunction.Observational study in the national SWEDEHEART registry, that compared the 1-year risk of in-stent restenosis (RS) and stent thrombosis (ST) in all percutaneous coronary intervention treated patients(n = 92 994) during 2007-2013.N-DES patients were younger than BMS, but had more often , previous myocardial infarction, previous revascularization and were more often treated with potent platelet inhibition.

However, the role of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in increasing the risk of insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM remained elusive. The current study aimed to determine the role of ART in predicting insulin therapy in GDM women and investigate the clinical and biochemical factors predicting the need for insulin therapy in pregnancies complicated with GDM.In this prospective cohort study, 236 Iranian women with GDM were diagnosed by one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between October 2014 and June 2017. They were mainly assigned to two groups; the first group (n = 100) was designated as ART which was further subdivided into two subgroups as follows: 60 participants who received medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and 40 participants who received MNT plus insulin therapy (MNT-IT). The second group (n = 136) was labeled as the spontaneous conception (SC), consisting of 102 participants receiving MNT and 34 participants receiving MNT in combination with IT (MNT-IT). The demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate prognostic factors for insulin therapy.A higher rate of insulin therapy was observed in the ART group as compared with the SC group (40% vs. 25%; P < 0.001).

Macular and peripapillary SD-OCT measurements (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), DM duration, HbA1c levels and presence of HT and/or HL were used for statistical analyses.The MA (+), MA (-) and control groups had similar age and gender distribution (p > 0.05). The differences in SD-OCT measurements among the MA (+), MA (-) and control groups were insignificant (p > 0.05). However, diabetic patients (n = 95) had significantly thinner inferior-temporal peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) (p = 0.042) than in the controls (n = 91). Superior peripapillary RNFL was significantly thinner in patients with an HbA1c level > 7% (p = 0.049).

SSB taxes are a possible way of reducing sugar intake, as well as an effective method of integrating oral health (OH) into general health promotion. There is widespread support for these taxes from PH professionals as they have the potential to improve diet and nutrition, and by OH professionals since nutrition is an integral component of OH, and sugar reduction can reduce the incidence of caries. SSB taxes can also generate revenues which can be reinvested in healthcare to further health improvement.

Gelatin-based nanofibers, which were constructed with curcumin and LR extract at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/hour and an applied voltage of 20 kV, were electrospun onto chitosan scaffolds to produce bilayer nanofibrous scaffolds (GC/L/C). The wounds treated with GC/L/C exhibited a higher recovery rate and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) expression in Western blot assays. The decreased levels of pro-inflammatory markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), provided evidence for the anti-inflammatory effects of GC/L/C treatment. Chronic wounds treated with GC/L/C achieved better performance with a 58 ± 7% increase in recovery rate on the seventh day. Based on its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing effects, the GC/L/C bilayer nanofibrous scaffolds can be potential materials for chronic wound treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654550>Weighting approaches for a genetic risk score and an oxidative stress score for predicting the incidence of obesity.</a></h2><p>We aimed to predict the incidence of obesity in a Korean population using a genetic risk score (GRS) constructed with obesity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along with an oxidative stress score (OSS).A total of 9,460 Korean subjects and 356,974 SNPs were included. The GRS was constructed using three significant obesity-related SNP loci, and the OSS was calculated with three reliable oxidative stress biomarkers.The GRS showed a more significant association with increased obesity (OR=2.879) than did individual SNPs after adjusting for age and sex. Three oxidative stress biomarkers, including malondialdehyde, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and 8-epi-prostaglandin F , showed significantly high levels in the obese group. The OSS, which was the sum of each oxidative stress biomarker score, showed a markedly high association with the incidence of obesity, with an OR of 3.213. Based on the results of the regression tests and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we found that HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, the GRS, and the OSS were the most relevant factors for the increased risk of obesity and were significantly associated with the incidence of obesity. The area under the ROC curve was improved when the GRS was added to the model (from 74.2% to 75.1%).We first identified that subjects with an obesity GRS and a high OSS might have a higher risk of obesity. Our findings and weighting approaches were effective in predicting the incidence of obesity; furthermore, the GRS is a relevant factor that significantly predicts the risk of obesity.This article is protected by copyright.

To drive health behavior changes, wearable devices are needed, and they must not only provide accurate sensing and visualization functions but also effective intervention functions. In this paper, we propose a health support system, WaistonBelt X, that consists of a belt-type wearable device with sensing and intervention functions and a smartphone application. WaistonBelt X can automatically measure a waistline with a magnetometer that detects the movements of a blade installed in the buckle, and monitor the basic activities of daily living with inertial sensors. Furthermore, WaistonBelt X intervenes with the user to correct lifestyle habits by using a built-in vibrator. Through evaluation experiments, we confirmed that our proposed device achieves measurement of the circumference on the belt position (mean absolute error of 0.93 cm) and basic activity recognition (F1 score of 0.95) with high accuracy. In addition, we confirmed that the intervention via belt vibration effectively improves the sitting posture of the user.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653175>Clinical associations of an updated medication effect score for measuring  treatment intensity.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656024>Potential clinical variants detected in mitochondrial DNA D-loop hypervariable region I of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a mitochondrial disease. However, the underlying role of mitochondrial genetics has not yet been completely elucidated. Evaluation of D-loop nucleotide variations with respect to statistical significance and clinical data distribution.Genomic DNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples of patients with biopsy-proven 150 NASH as well as from 150 healthy individuals to explore the functional D-loop region responsible for the replication and transcription of the mitochondrial genome. DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis analysis was performed for the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA containing the hypervariable region I, and restriction fragment length polymorphism with MnlI analysis was performed for the m.16189 T/C D-loop variant.The m.A16318C variant was detected only in patients with NASH and approached significance level. Based on clinical data, six variants associated with histological subgroups of NASH and NASH-complicated diseases were identified. In patients with NASH, the m.16129 AA genotype was associated with advanced-stage fibrosis; the m.16249 CC genotype was associated with advanced lobular inflammation and advanced-stage histological steatosis; the m.16296 TT genotype was associated with hypothyroidism; the m.16163 GG and m.16294 TT genotypes were associated with metabolic syndrome; and the m.16256 TT+CT genotypes were associated with type II . In patients with NASH, microRNAs were estimated by targeting the significant variants identified in this study.These findings suggest that NASH may be associated with D-loop nucleotide variations and that microRNA-based in vitro and/or in vivo studies may be developed by targeting the D-loop variants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654155>[Anesthesiological perspectives on perioperative management in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII): stop or continue?]</a></h2><p>Perioperative handling of insulin pumps (CSII) is inconsistent.

Mesenchymal stem cell treatment (MSCT) offers us an alternative approach that might reverse  erectile dysfunction (DMED).The aim of this study was to review the current studies investigating mesenchymal stem cell approach in diabetic rat models of ED for future research.A medical literature search was performed in PubMed by using the keywords including erectile dysfunction, mesenchymal stem cells, , and rat model.Representative studies on DMED rats treated by MSCT were reviewed.Streptozocin-induced type 1  rats were used in most studies because of cost and convenience. With the development of stem cell treatment for DMED research, many kinds of stem cells were used in animal experiment, such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, muscle-derived stem cells, urine-derived stem cells, neural crest stem cells, and endothelial progenitor cells. Although diverse stem cells were applied for DMED treatment, the mechanism behind these approaches was identical, including improving vascular injury, recovering smooth muscle, restoring neuronal cells, inhibiting the generation of inflammatory cytokines, homing mesenchymal stem cells, and decreasing apoptosis in corpus cavernosum. Meanwhile, combination therapies, including MSCT with drug, herb, and low-energy extracorporeal shockwave treatment showed satisfactory results for ED.It has been proved that MSCT is an effective and safe treatment for the DMED rats. What's more, MSCT might be a potential and promising approach for patients with DMED as a minimally invasive treatment. Combination of MSCT with various methods was proved to be a more efficient treatment and dependable option to make up for deficiencies of MSCT. Kim SW, Zhu GQ, Bae WJ.

T2D presents with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance resulting in increased risk for blindness, renal failure, nerve damage, and premature death. Skeletal muscle is a major site for insulin resistance and is responsible for up to 80% of glucose uptake during euglycemic hyperglycemic clamps. Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is driven by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and for this reason mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in T2D. In this review we integrate mitochondrial function with physiologic function to present a broader understanding of mitochondrial functional status in T2D utilizing studies from both human and rodent models. Quantification of mitochondrial function is explained both in vitro and in vivo highlighting the use of proper controls and the complications imposed by obesity and sedentary lifestyle. This review suggests that skeletal muscle mitochondria are not necessarily dysfunctional but limited oxygen supply to working muscle creates this misperception. Finally, we propose changes in experimental design to address this question unequivocally. If mitochondrial function is not impaired it suggests that therapeutic interventions and drug development must move away from the organelle and toward the cardiovascular system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656583>Recent advances in understanding lipodystrophy: a focus on lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease and potential effects of leptin therapy on cardiovascular function.</a></h2><p>Lipodystrophy is a disease characterized by a partial or total absence of adipose tissue leading to severe metabolic derangements including marked insulin resistance, type 2 , hypertriglyceridemia, and steatohepatitis. Lipodystrophy is also a source of major cardiovascular disorders which, in addition to hepatic failure and infection, contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy. Metreleptin, the synthetic analog of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin and current therapy of choice for patients with lipodystrophy, successfully improves metabolic function. However, while leptin has been associated with hypertension, vascular diseases, and inflammation in the context of obesity, it remains unknown whether its daily administration could further impair cardiovascular function in patients with lipodystrophy. The goal of this short review is to describe the cardiovascular phenotype of patients with lipodystrophy, speculate on the etiology of the disorders, and discuss how the use of murine models of lipodystrophy could be beneficial to address the question of the contribution of leptin to lipodystrophy-associated cardiovascular disease.Copyright: © 2019 Bruder-Nascimento T et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653558>Racial differences of incident  postpartum in women with a history of gestational .</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the race-specific association between a history of gestational  (GDM) and incidence of type 2  and evaluate how the risk changed over different years after delivery.We performed two large cohorts - the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort and the Tianjin GDM Observational Study.

Remarkably, it has recently emerged that the GCT can also predict a woman's future risk of cardiovascular disease, although the mechanistic basis of this relationship is unclear. In this context we hypothesized that a higher GCT may identify women with an otherwise unrecognized adverse cardiovascular phenotype. Thus, we sought to evaluate the relationship between the antepartum GCT and subsequent postpartum cardiovascular risk factor profile. Methods and Results In this study 503 women completed a screening GCT in late second trimester and then underwent cardiometabolic characterization at 3 months postpartum, whereupon traditional (blood pressure, glucose, lipids) and nontraditional (apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein, adiponectin) cardiovascular risk factors were compared across GCT tertiles. At 3 months postpartum, each of the following risk factors progressively worsened from the lowest to middle to highest GCT tertile: fasting glucose (=0.0002), 2-hour glucose (<0.0001), total cholesterol:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (=0.0004), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (=0.004), triglycerides (=0.001), apolipoprotein B (=0.001), and adiponectin (=0.02). On multiple linear regression analyses, the GCT emerged as a significant independent predictor of higher fasting glucose (=0.0006), 2-hour glucose (<0.0001), total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (=0.0004), triglycerides (=0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (=0.01), and apolipoprotein B (=0.004) and of lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (=0.02) and adiponectin (=0.0099). Moreover, these independent associations persisted after excluding women who had gestational .

Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the β cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through IRS2/AKT and SREBP1 signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CRTC2 in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (e.g., PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (OR = 2.692, P = 0.023, n = 135). Integrating grafts' CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (AUCs: 0.71 vs. 0.79, P = 0.048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces 'hepatogenous ' via CRTC2 signaling.

Diet composition may also affect their systemic concentrations during fasting and in the postprandial period. Hence, we studied the influence of sex steroids and obesity on the circulating levels of a panel of metabolic cytokines in the fasting state and after single macronutrient challenges.On alternate days we submitted 17 women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (9 non-obese, 8 obese), 17 non-hyperandrogenic control women (9 non-obese, 8 obese) and 19 control men (10 non-obese, 9 obese) to isocaloric oral glucose, lipid and protein loads. Serum levels of omentin-1, vaspin, lipocalin-2, adipsin, PAI-1, chemerin, FGF-21 and FGF-23 were determined by Luminex multiplex technology.During fasting, obese patients presented higher levels of PAI-1, chemerin and adipsin but decreased FGF-23 and omentin-1 compared with non-obese subjects. Vaspin showed sexual dimorphism with lower levels in men than women with PCOS and female controls. Following macronutrient ingestion, most metabolic cytokines presented a similar physiological response consisting of a decrease in circulating concentrations, which was inversely associated with the fasting levels of these molecules. Protein intake caused the major postprandial decrease whereas glucose did not significantly reduce PAI-1, FGF-23 and vaspin, and even increased FGF-21. Regardless of the macronutrient administered, vaspin levels showed a larger reduction in non-obese individuals while the decrease in PAI-1 was particularly noticeable in the obese subgroup. The postprandial reductions of omentin-1 and FGF-23 after glucose and protein loads were influenced by obesity. No major differences were found between patients with PCOS and male and female controls.Obesity, but not PCOS or sex, markedly influences metabolic cytokine levels at fasting and after macronutrient ingestion. The observed postprandial decrease in their circulating concentrations might represent a physiological compensatory mechanism against food-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. This mechanism is altered by obesity and is differently modulated by macronutrients, suggesting a larger contribution of glucose to stressful postprandial responses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656542>Low-frequency ultrasound enhances vascular endothelial growth factor expression, thereby promoting the wound healing in diabetic rats.</a></h2><p> is a chronic metabolic disease with a high prevalence worldwide, which typically delays or impairs wound healing, potentially causing death. Low-frequency ultrasound treatment promotes the repair of various injuries and may promote wound healing. The aim of the present study was to determine whether low-frequency ultrasound can accelerate wound healing, as well as investigate its effects on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in diabetic rats. A total of 45 Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with 1% streptozocin following intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium anesthesia. Subsequently an incision wound was created in the skin of back. The area of the wound was recorded to calculate the rate of wound healing. The expression of VEGF and TGF-β1 was determined via immunohistochemical analysis and their mRNA and protein levels were measured via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis. The results revealed that when compared with the control group, low-frequency ultrasound treatment significantly increased wound healing rate in diabetic rats and markedly increased the mRNA and protein levels of VEGF and TGF-β1. US treatment also reduced the mRNA and protein levels of TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that low-frequency ultrasound promotes the expression of VEGF and TGF-β1, and inhibits the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby promoting wound healing in diabetic rats.Copyright: © Chen et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657660>Health Inequalities Among Elderly Type 2  Patients in Japan.</a></h2><p>The influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on health inequalities has received much attention worldwide.

A total of 32 536 ICU patients were recorded from 2001 to 2008 published by Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II v2.6) in April 2011. The circadian heart rate variation was defined as the ratio of mean nighttime (23:00 to 07:00) heart rate to mean daytime (07:00 to 23:00) heart rate. The 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality were defined as outcome events. The information such as age, gender, ethnicity, first sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, first simplified acute physiology score I (SAPS I), usage of sedatives and catecholamines within 24 hours admission of ICU, clinical complications [hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),  with or without complications, congestive heart failure, liver disease, renal failure, etc.], and the complete heart rate records within 24 hours after ICU admission were collected. Cox proportional risk regression models were used to investigate the association between circadian heart rate variation and 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality in ICU patients. Besides, subgroup analysis was also performed in patients with different first SOFA scores.Totally 15 382 ICU patients in MIMIC-II database were enrolled, excluding the patients without heart rate records or death records, using pacemaker with arrhythmia, without SOFA or SAPS I score records. Finally, 9 439 patients were enrolled in the study cohort. (1) Cox regression analysis of the whole patient showed that the higher circadian heart rate variation was correlated with the increased 28-day mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.613, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.338-1.943, P < 0.001] and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.573, 95%CI was 1.296-1.908, P < 0.001). After adjustment for demographic factors (age, gender and ethnicity), severity of illness (SOFA and SAPS I scores), clinical complications (hypertension, COPD,  with or without complications, congestive heart failure, liver disease, renal failure, etc.), and influence of medications (sedatives and catecholamines), the night-day heart rate ratio was also correlated with 28-day mortality (HR = 1.256, 95%CI was 1.018-1.549, P = 0.033) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.249, 95%CI was 1.010-1.545, P = 0.040). (2) According to the SOFA score (median value of 5), the patients were divided into two subgroups, in which 5 478 patients with SOFA score ≤ 5 and 3 961 patients with SOFA score > 5. Cox regression subgroup analysis showed that circadian heart rate variation was related with higher 28-day mortality (HR = 1.430, 95%CI was 1.164-1.756, P = 0.001) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.393, 95%CI was 1.123-1.729, P = 0.003) in patients with SOFA score > 5. After adjustment for covariates, the 28-day mortality (HR = 1.279, 95%CI was 1.032-1.584, P = 0.025) and 1-year mortality (HR = 1.255, 95%CI was 1.010-1.558, P = 0.040) also increased with the increasing of night-day heart rate ratio in patients with SOFA score > 5. However, the relationships did not exist in patients with SOFA score ≤ 5.In ICU patients, the 28-day mortality and 1-year mortality increase with the higher circadian heart rate variation, which indicates that the circadian heart rate variation in ICU patients is positively correlated with the short-term and long-term mortality, especially in patients with relatively severe illness.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650132>Quantifying the Impact of Type 2  on Brain Perfusion Using Deep Neural Networks.</a></h2><p>The effect of Type 2  (T2D) on brain health is poorly understood.

With a case-control design, we aimed to explore whether maternal  is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer in the offspring. Combining data from population-based registries, we analyzed a total of 2,029 cases, i.e. persons with childhood cancer diagnosed under the age of 20 years between years 1996-2014 and a total of 10,103 matched population controls. The mothers of the cases/controls and their diagnoses of  (DM) before/during pregnancy as well as their insulin/metformin prescriptions during pregnancy were identified. Conditional logistic regression modelling was used to analyze the risk of childhood cancer. The OR for childhood cancer among those exposed to any maternal  was 1.32 (95% CI 1.14-1.54) compared to the offspring of the non-diabetic mothers. The effect of maternal  on the risk of childhood cancer remained elevated even after adjusting for maternal age, parity and smoking. Our data suggest that maternal  medication may reduce the risk for childhood cancer (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.36-1.94), especially in gestational  (adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05-1.25), compared to the diabetic mothers without medication. The risk of childhood leukemia was significantly higher among children exposed to any maternal  (OR 1.36, CI 1.04-1.77) compared to the unexposed. Maternal  appears to be associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer in the offspring. The possible risk-reducing effect of an exposure to  medication on offspring cancer risk warrants further investigation. This article is protected by copyright.

The presence of Candida species in urine in asymptomatic patients does not warrant antifungal therapy except neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants and patients undergoing urologic procedures. Fluconazole is the treatment of choice for symptomatic infections, it achieves high urinary levels. The other azole antifungals and echinocandins do not reach sufficient urine levels. Amphotericin B deoxycholate is the alternative antifungal agent if fluconazole can not be used because of resistance, allergy or failure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658142> is not independently associated with mortality in elderly patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Insights from the Codi Infart registry.</a></h2><p> predicts poorer outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but the magnitude of this association in patients at older ages remains controversial.Data were extracted from the Codi Infart database. All consecutive patients with diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 2010 and 2015 were included. We assessed the impact of  on 30-day and one-year mortality in patients aged less than and at least 75 years.A total of 12 792 cases were registered, of whom 3023 (23.6%) were aged at least 75 years. About 20% patients had previous  diagnosis. Patients aged at least 75 years had higher prevalence of comorbidities, higher proportion of heart failure at admission, a more extensive coronary artery disease and significant delay to reperfusion (P < 0.001).  was associated with higher 30-day mortality both in young [odds ratio (OR) 1.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-2.70] and in elderly patients (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). After adjusting for potential confounders, this association remained significant in young patients (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.00-2.16, P = 0.047), but not in the elderly (OR 1.14, P = 0.43). Likewise, a crude association between  and one-year mortality was observed in both groups (young patients: HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.51-2.46; older patients: HR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08-1.64). However, after adjusting for potential confounders, this association remained significant in younger patients (HR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.13-1.89; P < 0.001), but not in the elderly (HR = 1.16; P = 0.17).A significant proportion of these nonselected patients with STEMI had previous . The association between  and outcomes is different according to age.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653956>Effect of Empagliflozin on Cardiac Function, Adiposity, and Diffuse Fibrosis in Patients with Type 2 .</a></h2><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, significantly improves cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients; however, the mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that empagliflozin might have beneficial effects on cardiac function, structure, adiposity, and myocardial diffuse fibrosis. This prospective study enrolled 35 patients (48.6% men, age 63.5 ± 9.7 years) with type 2  (T2DM) from June 1, 2017, to November 31, 2018. The patients received an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 25 or 12.5 mg/d) for 6 months in addition to stable oral hypoglycaemic treatment. All patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) before and after empagliflozin treatment. Left ventricular (LV) function and structure were quantified using cine CMRI. Cardiac adiposity was defined based on pericardial fat and intracardiac triglyceride contents, whereas myocardial diffuse fibrosis was indicated by extracellular volume (ECV). The statistical significance of parameter changes was assessed using paired t-test and stepwise multiple linear regression. There were no significant differences in LV function and structure changes. Cardiac adiposity and diffuse fibrosis indices were also not different before and after empagliflozin treatment. Concerning clinical parameters, only a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (by 6.4 mmHg) was observed (p = 0.013). Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that worse baseline MRI parameters were associated with better improvements. Intracardiac triglyceride content decrease was inversely associated with baseline intracardiac triglyceride content (p < 0.001). Pericardial fat changes were negatively correlated with baseline pericardial fat (p < 0.001) and ECV changes (p = 0.028). ECV changes were inversely associated with baseline ECV (p < 0.001), baseline LV ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and LV mass index changes (p = 0.020). This study demonstrated that 6 months of empagliflozin treatment did not significantly improve the LV function, structure, adiposity, and diffuse fibrosis in patients with T2DM. Further, the beneficial effects of empagliflozin treatment might be more evident in patients with worse baseline LV substrate and structure.</p></html>
