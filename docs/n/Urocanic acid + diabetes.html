<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21792987>Metabolomic assessment with CE-MS of the nutraceutical effect of Cystoseira spp extracts in an animal model.</a></h2><p>There is a need of scientific evidence of claimed nutraceutical effects, but also there is a social movement towards the use of natural products and among them algae are seen as rich resources. Within this scenario, the development of methodology for rapid and reliable assessment of markers of efficiency and security of these extracts is necessary. The rat treated with streptozotocin has been proposed as the most appropriate model of systemic oxidative stress for studying antioxidant therapies. Cystoseira is a brown alga containing fucoxanthin and other carothenes whose pressure-assisted extracts were assayed to discover a possible beneficial effect on complications related to  evolution in an acute but short-term model. Urine was selected as the sample and CE-TOF-MS as the analytical technique to obtain the fingerprints in a non-target metabolomic approach. Multivariate data analysis revealed a good clustering of the groups and permitted the putative assignment of compounds statistically significant in the classification. Interestingly a group of compounds associated to lysine glycation and cleavage from proteins was found to be increased in diabetic animals receiving vehicle as compared to control animals receiving vehicle (N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine, N-methylnicotinamide, galactosylhydroxylysine, L-carnitine, N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxylysine, fructose-lysine, pipecolic , , amino-isobutanoate, formylisoglutamine. Fructoselysine significantly decreased after the treatment changing from a 24% increase to a 19% decrease. CE-MS fingerprinting of urine has provided a group of compounds different to those detected with other techniques and therefore proves the necessity of a cross-platform analysis to obtain a broad view of biological samples.Copyright Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The vast majority of the researchers was primarily focused on the local immunomodulatory role of UVR. But today evidence is increasing in favor of plural immune activation and systemic reaction of the organism. Most of the attention is directed toward the regulatory T lymphocytes which are responsible for the local and systemic immunosuppressive response under the impact of sunlight. The role of regulatory T cells in autoimmune diseases is well studied on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Epidemiological research shows a proportional interdependence of latitude and prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent  (IDDM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is evidence that UVR has direct influence on the level of antibodies against the SNF2-superfamily helicase (Mi-2), distinctive for dermatomyositis (DM). On this basis a hypothesis is established that UVR is a risk factor for DM. A Croatian epidemiologic study o f systemic sclerosis (SSc) gave results consistent with the hypothesis that there is a higher prevalence of SSc in the Mediterranean regions of Croatia. Such discoveries encouraged further studies that found that not only regulatory T cells are responsible for a systemic immunosuppressive response, but that there is a complex interactive network of immune cells and mediators such as cytokines, neuropeptides, and chromophores like  involved. Present findings require continued research on the importance of UVR on autoimmune disease prevalence and immunopathophysiology. Finally, it is necessary to distinguish whether UVR is a protective factor for some autoimmune diseases or a risk factor for their induction.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1606724>Prevention of spontaneous and cyclophosphamide-induced  in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with oral 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI), a component of caramel colouring III.</a></h2><p>The effect of oral administration of THI, a compound present in ammonia caramel food colouring, was studied in spontaneous and induced murine . Continuous administration of THI at 400 ppm in drinking water reduced the prevalence of spontaneous  in female NOD/Lt mice from 63% in untreated controls to 8% in treated animals. Since cyclophosphamide (CP) accelerates and intensifies  in NOD mice, we also studied the effect of THI in this model.  incidence was reduced from 100% in mice given only CP to 13-14% in mice given THI either concurrently or from 14 days previously. Histologically, THI greatly reduced the severity of insulitis. As measured by flow cytometry, all THI-treated mice had a 60-80% reduction in splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. THI-treated mice showed no untoward effects and specifically no weight loss, or pathological changes in their livers, kidneys or lungs. However, there was moderate atrophy of the thymus cortex. THI is a small imidazole-containing compound with structural similarity to histamine and , both known to have immunosuppressive properties. It is a widely used food additive with no known long-term toxic effects at low dosage. Thus, THI could be a useful immunosuppressive agent.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12003561>New building blocks for fluorinated bioimidazole derivatives II: preparation of beta-fluorourocanic acids.</a></h2><p>Replacement of vinyl hydrogen with fluorine is based on addition of an FBr equivalent to a double bond followed by HBr elimination.

Tritylation of the imidazole nitrogen was necessary for successful addition of "FBr" to the double bond, and prior reduction of the carboxyl group to the alcohol was required to provide the desired chemoselectivity in the elimination of HX. Reoxidation and deprotection produced the fluorinated  acids.</p><p>Keyword: diabetes</p></html>
