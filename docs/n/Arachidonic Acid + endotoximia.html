Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type (TRPV)-1, a predominantly neuronal nonselective cation channel, has been shown to improve outcome in sepsis and . However, the role of TRPV1 and the identity of its endogenous ligands in the cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis and  are unknown. Using TRPV1 and TRPV1 mice, we showed that endogenous activation of cardiac TRPV1 during sepsis is key to limiting the ensuing cardiac dysfunction. Use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry lipid analysis and selective inhibitors of  metabolism suggest that the arachidonate-derived TRPV1 activator, 20-hydroxyeicosateraenoic  (20-HETE), underlies a substantial component of TRPV1-mediated cardioprotection in sepsis. Moreover, using selective antagonists for neuropeptide receptors, we show that this effect of TRPV1 relates to the activity of neuronally released cardiac calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and that, accordingly, administration of CGRP can rescue cardiac dysfunction in severe . In sum activation of TRPV1 by 20-HETE leads to the release of CGRP, which protects the heart against the cardiac dysfunction in  and identifies both TRPV1 and CGRP receptors as potential therapeutic targets in .-Chen, J., Hamers, A.

Very-low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to improve glucose control and the inflammatory response. We aimed to determine the effects of a eucaloric ketogenic diet (EKD) enriched with ω-3 fatty acids (O3KD) on glucose levels and inflammation in mice with .Adult mice were fed 1 of 3 diets (control diet [CD], EKD, or O3KD). After 4 weeks, each group received saline or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally during the postprandial (PPP) or postabsorptive (PAP) periods. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL) 6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Distribution of serum fatty acids was determined by gas liquid chromatography. Hepatic expression of genes involved in inflammation, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism, were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.During the PPP, glucose curves were comparable among the experimental groups. During the PAP, EKD showed a more pronounced increase in glucose levels at the first hour after LPS challenge compared with the CD-LPS group. During the PAP, IL6 was lower in O3KD-LPS compared with CD-LPS and EKD-LPS groups. These differences disappeared in the PPP. Similarly, TNF-α was lower in the O3KD-LPS group compared with the EKD-LPS group. The O3KD significantly increased the serum levels of the ω-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids and decreased the ω-6 .An O3KD leads to reduced inflammation and maintains glucose homeostasis in mice with .© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28600357>The natural phosphoinositide derivative glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory and thrombotic responses.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory responses are elicited through lipid products of phospholipase A activity that acts on the membrane phospholipids, including the phosphoinositides, to form the proinflammatory  and, in parallel, the glycerophosphoinositols. Here, we investigate the role of the glycerophosphoinositol in the inflammatory response. We show that it is part of a negative feedback loop that limits proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. This inhibition is exerted both on the signaling cascade initiated by the lipopolysaccharide with the glycerophosphoinositol-dependent decrease in IκB kinase α/β, p38, JNK, and Erk1/2 kinase phosphorylation and at the nuclear level with decreased NF-κB translocation and binding to inflammatory gene promoters. In a model of  in the mouse, treatment with glycerophosphoinositol reduced TNF-α synthesis, which supports the concept that glycerophosphoinositol inhibits the  synthesis of proinflammatory and prothrombotic compounds and might thus have a role as an endogenous mediator in the resolution of inflammation. As indicated, this effect of glycerophosphoinositol can also be exploited in the treatment of manifestations of severe inflammation by exogenous administration of the compound.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27815261>Soluble epoxide hydrolase deficiency or inhibition enhances murine hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction after lipopolysaccharide challenge.</a></h2><p>Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is the response of the pulmonary vasculature to low levels of alveolar oxygen. HPV improves systemic arterial oxygenation by matching pulmonary perfusion to ventilation during alveolar hypoxia and is impaired in lung diseases such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in experimental models of . Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are pulmonary vasoconstrictors, which are metabolized to less vasoactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). We hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition or a congenital deficiency of sEH in mice would reduce the metabolism of EETs and enhance HPV in mice after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). HPV was assessed 22 h after intravenous injection of LPS by measuring the percentage increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance of the left lung induced by left mainstem bronchial occlusion (LMBO). After LPS challenge, HPV was impaired in sEH, but not in sEH mice or in sEH mice treated acutely with a sEH inhibitor. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of sEH protected mice from the LPS-induced decrease in systemic arterial oxygen concentration (Pa ) during LMBO. In the lungs of sEH mice, the LPS-induced increase in DHETs and cytokines was attenuated. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of sEH protects mice from LPS-induced impairment of HPV and improves the Pa after LMBO. After LPS challenge, lung EET degradation and cytokine expression were reduced in sEH mice. Inhibition of sEH might prove to be an effective treatment for ventilation-perfusion mismatch in lung diseases such as ARDS.Copyright © 2016 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28125622>Expression of Calgranulin Genes S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 Is Modulated by n-3 PUFA during Inflammation in Adipose Tissue and Mononuclear Cells.</a></h2><p>Calgranulin genes (S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12) play key immune response roles in inflammatory disorders, including cardiovascular disease. Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) may have systemic and adipose tissue-specific anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective action. Interactions between calgranulins and the unsaturated fatty   (AA) have been reported, yet little is known about the relationship between calgranulins and the LC n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). We explored tissue-specific action of calgranulins in the setting of evoked  and n-3 PUFA supplementation. Expression of calgranulins in adipose tissue in vivo was assessed by RNA sequencing (RNASeq) before and after n-3 PUFA supplementation and evoked  in the fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty  modulation of  (FFAME) Study. Subjects received n-3 PUFA (n = 8; 3600mg/day EPA/DHA) or matched placebo (n = 6) for 6-8 weeks, before completing an endotoxin challenge (LPS 0.6 ng/kg). Calgranulin genes were up-regulated post-LPS, with greater increase in n-3 PUFA (S100A8 15-fold, p = 0.003; S100A9 7-fold, p = 0.003; S100A12 28-fold, p = 0.01) compared to placebo (S100A8 2-fold, p = 0.01; S100A9 1.4-fold, p = 0.4; S100A12 5-fold, p = 0.06). In an independent evoked  study, calgranulin gene expression correlated with the systemic inflammatory response. Through in vivo and in vitro interrogation we highlight differential responses in adipocytes and mononuclear cells during inflammation, with n-3 PUFA leading to increased calgranulin expression in adipose, but decreased expression in circulating cells. In conclusion, we present a novel relationship between n-3 PUFA anti-inflammatory action in vivo and cell-specific modulation of calgranulin expression during innate immune activation.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29765489>Gallic -L-Leucine Conjugate Protects Mice against LPS-Induced Inflammation and Sepsis via Correcting Proinflammatory Lipid Mediator Profiles and Oxidative Stress.</a></h2><p>The pathology of endotoxin LPS-induced sepsis is hallmarked by aberrant production of proinflammatory lipid mediators and nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine whether the new product gallic -L-leucine (GAL) conjugate could ameliorate the LPS-induced dysregulation of  metabolism and NO production. We first investigated the effects of GAL conjugate on the expression of proinflammatory enzymes and the production of proinflammatory NO and lipid mediators in mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, primary peritoneal macrophages, and mouse model. Western blot analyses revealed that GAL attenuated LPS-induced expression of iNOS, COX-2, and 5-LOX in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistently, probing NO-mediated fluorescence revealed that GAL antagonized the stimulatory effect of LPS on iNOS activity. By profiling of lipid mediators with ESI-MS-based lipidomics, we found that GAL suppressed LPS-induced overproduction of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2, leukotriene B4, and thromboxane B2. We further discovered that GAL might exhibit anti-inflammatory activities by the following mechanisms: (1) suppressing LPS-induced activation of MAP kinases (i.e., ERK1/2, JNK, and p38); (2) reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (3) preventing LPS-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factors NF-B and AP-1. Consequently, GAL significantly decreased the levels of COX-2 and iNOS expression and the plasma levels of proinflammatory lipid mediators in LPS-treated mice. GAL pretreatment enhanced the survival of mice against LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Taken together, our results suggest that GAL may be a potential anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of  and sepsis.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25641170>Proinflammatory effects of  in a lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory microenvironment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro.</a></h2><p>Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3, DHA), have known anti-inflammatory effects, including the modulation of adipose tissue-derived inflammatory mediators (i.e., adipokines) implicated in obesity-related pathologies, such as insulin resistance. Less is known about the effects of plant-derived n-3 PUFA, α-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3) and stearidonic  (SDA 18:4n-3), or n-6 PUFA linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6) and  (AA, 20:4n-6), especially in combination with an inflammatory stimulus, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), at a dose intended to mimic obesity-associated low-grade inflammation. To study this, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 100 μmol/L of various n-3 or n-6 PUFA with or without 10 ng/mL LPS for up to 24 h. AA in the presence of LPS synergistically increased (p < 0.05) pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion and gene expression, as well as COX-2 and TLR2 gene expression at 6 and/or 24 h, suggesting their potential roles in the synergistic effects of AA and LPS. Plant-derived fatty acids ALA, SDA, and LA did not differentially affect adipokine gene expression or secretion, whereas LPS-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1β expression and MCP-1 secretion was decreased (p < 0.05) by EPA, DHA, and/or EPA+DHA (50 μmol/L each) compared with LPS alone. Only DHA increased (p < 0.05) gene expression of the n-3 PUFA receptor GPR120 and simultaneously decreased LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB activation compared with control. Our findings emphasize that specific fatty acids within the n-3 or n-6 PUFA class warrant consideration in the development of nutritional strategies to improve obesity-associated inflammation.</p><p>Keyword: endotoximia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26403860>Lipopolysaccharide suppresses carboxylesterase 2g activity and 2-arachidonoylglycerol hydrolysis: A possible mechanism to regulate inflammation.</a></h2><p>Inflammation is an important part of the innate immune response and is involved in the healing of many disease processes; however, chronic inflammation is a harmful component of many diseases. The regulatory mechanisms of inflammation are incompletely understood. One possible regulatory mechanism is the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA) are generally anti-inflammatory via engagement of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) on innate cells; therefore, preventing the degradation of endocannabinoids by specific serine hydrolases such as fatty  amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and carboxylesterases (CES) might decrease inflammation. We hypothesized that the activities of these catabolic enzymes would decrease with a subsequent increase in 2-AG and AEA in a model of inflammation. Mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 or 24h, and inflammation was confirmed by an increase in interleukin-6 (il6) and il17 gene expression. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of serine hydrolases showed no significant difference in various serine hydrolase activities in brain or liver, whereas a modest decrease in Ces activity in spleen after LPS administration was noted. 2-AG hydrolase activity in the spleen was also decreased at 6h post LPS, which was corroborated by LPS treatment of splenocytes ex vivo. ABPP-MudPIT proteomic analysis suggested that the decreased 2-AG hydrolysis in spleen was due to a reduction in Ces2g activity. These studies suggest that the endocannabinoid system could be activated via suppression of a 2-AG catabolic enzyme in response to inflammatory stimuli as one mechanism to limit inflammation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.
