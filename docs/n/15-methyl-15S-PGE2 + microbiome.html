The research was carried out in selected lakes located within the administrative boundaries of the city of Olsztyn, the largest city in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland). The experiment was conducted in three summer seasons near bathing sites in three lakes, which are the most popular as recreational sites (Lake Kortowskie, Lake Tyrsko, and Lake Skanda). Microfungi isolated from the phyllosphere of 13 plant species of the littoral zone from dropped leaves of coast plants with no disease symptoms were used as the study material. The isolated fungi were identified in accordance with the accepted diagnostic procedures applied in mycological laboratories. A total of 36 yeast species of 16 genera were identified. Fungi found earlier at the bathing sites of the lakes were identified in 60% of the cases. Nine species were categorised as class BSL-2 fungi.

To study reactive products of gut inflammation and redox signaling on CRC development we used untargeted adductomics to detect adduct features in pre-diagnostic serum from the EPIC-Italy cohort. We focused on modifications to Cys34 in human serum albumin (HSA), which is responsible for scavenging small reactive electrophiles that might initiate cancers. Employing a combination of statistical methods, we selected seven Cys34 adducts associated with CRC, as well as BMI (a well-known risk factor). Five adducts were more abundant in CRC cases than controls and clustered with each other, suggesting a common pathway. Since two of these adducts were Cys34 modifications by methanethiol, a microbial-human co-metabolite, and crotonaldehyde, a product of lipid peroxidation, these findings further implicate infiltration of gut microbes into the intestinal mucosa and the corresponding inflammatory response as causes of CRC. The other two associated adducts were Cys34 disulfides of homocysteine that were less abundant in CRC cases than controls and may implicate homocysteine metabolism as another causal pathway. The selected adducts and BMI ranked higher as potentially causal factors than variables previously associated with CRC (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and total meat consumption). Regressions of case-control differences in adduct levels on days to diagnosis showed no statistical evidence that disease progression, rather than causal factors at recruitment, contributed to the observed differences. These findings support the hypothesis that infiltration of gut microbes into the intestinal mucosa and the resulting inflammation are causal factors for CRC.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640890>The probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum 296 attenuates cardiometabolic disorders in high fat diet-treated rats.</a></h2><p>High-fat (HF) diet consumption has been associated with gut dysbiosis and increased risk of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. This study was designed to assess the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) fermentum 296, a fruit-derived bacteria strain, against cardiometabolic disorders induced by HF diet.Male Wistar rats were divided into control diet (CTL); HF diet; and HF diet treated with Lactobacillus fermentum 296 (HF + Lf 296). The L. fermentum 296 strain at 1 × 10 colony forming units (CFU)/ml were daily administered by oral gavage for 4 weeks. The results showed that rats fed with HF diet displayed insulin resistance, reduced Lactobacillus spp. counts in feces, serum lipids, and oxidative profile. Rats fed on HF diet also demonstrated augmented blood pressure associated with sympathetic hyperactivity and impaired baroreflex control. The administration of L. fermentum 296 for 4 weeks recovered fecal Lactobacillus sp. counts and alleviated hyperlipidemia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and reduced systolic blood pressure in HF rats without affecting baroreflex sensibility.Our results suggest the ability of L. fermentum 296 improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters altered in cardiometabolic disorders.Copyright © 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection,  studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform.

Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001).

In this work, polyphenol extracts from Lessonia trabeculate were purified and investigated for the anti-diabetic activity in vitro and in vivo. The purified polyphenol extracts exhibited good antioxidant activities, α-glucosidase and lipase inhibition activities ((IC50<0.25 mg/mL). The HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis indicated that the compounds in polyphenol extracts were mainly phlorotannin derivatives, phenolic acid derivatives, and gallocatechin derivatives. In vivo, C57BL/6J rats treated with polyphenol extracts for 4 weeks had lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, insulin levels as well as better serum lipid profiles and antioxidant stress parameters, compared with diabetic control (DC) group. Histopathology revealed that polyphenol extracts preserved the architecture and function of liver.

Agricultural domestication of soils, that is, the conversion of previously uncultivated soils to a cultivated state, is frequently accompanied by intensive monoculture, especially in the developing world. However, there is limited understanding of how continuous cultivation alters the structure of prokaryotic soil  after soil domestication, including to what extent crop plants impact soil  composition, and how changes in  composition arising from cultivation affect crop performance.We show here that continuous monoculture (> 8 growing seasons) of the major food crop rice under flooded conditions is associated with a pronounced shift in soil bacterial and archaeal  structure towards a more consistent composition, thereby domesticating  of previously uncultivated sites. Aside from the potential effects of agricultural cultivation practices, we provide evidence that rice plants themselves are important drivers of the domestication process, acting through selective enrichment of specific taxa, including methanogenic archaea, in their rhizosphere that differ from those of native plants growing in the same environment. Furthermore, we find that  from soils domesticated by rice cultivation contribute to plant-soil feedback, by imparting a negative effect on rice seedling vigor.Soil domestication through continuous monoculture cultivation of rice results in compositional changes in the soil , which are in part driven by the rice plants.

The urban environment differs greatly from that in which humans evolved, with potentially important consequences for health. Rates for allergic, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases appear to rise with urbanization and be higher in the more urbanized nations of the world which has led some to suggest that cities promote the occurrence of these diseases. However, there are no syntheses outlining what urban-associated diseases are and what characteristics of cities promote their occurrence.To synthesize the current understanding of "urban-associated diseases", and discover the common, potentially modifiable features of cities that may be driving these associations.We focus on any diseases that have been associated with cities or are particularly prominent in today's urban societies. We draw on expertise across diverse health fields to examine the evidence for urban connections and drivers.We found evidence for urban associations across allergic, auto-immune, inflammatory, lifestyle and infectious disease categories. Some conditions (e.g. obesity and diabetes) have complex relationships with cities that have been insufficiently explored. Other conditions (e.g. allergies and asthma) have more evidence demonstrating their relationship with cities and the mechanisms driving that association. Unsurprisingly, air pollution was the characteristic of cities most frequently associated with disease. Other identified urban risk factors are not as widely known: altered microbial exposure and a disconnect from environmental microbiomes, vitamin D deficiency, noise and light pollution, and a transient, over-crowded, impoverished population. However, many complexities and caveats to these relationships beg clarification; we highlight the current knowledge gaps and outline ways to fill those gaps. Identifying urban-associated diseases and their drivers will allow us to prepare for the urban-disease burden of the future and create healthy cities that mitigate that disease burden.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We investigated if this applies to eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Stool bacterial DNA was extracted and followed by 16S rRNA amplification from 12 patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and 12 controls. Alpha- and beta-diversity were analyzed. Only two patients had asthma or atopy and one patient was on budesonide. No patients were on PPIs. Patients with EoE had lower gut  alpha diversity (species richness, P = 0.09; Shannon index, P = 0.01). The microbial composition was distinct as evidenced by significantly different beta diversity (P = 0.03) when compared to healthy controls. There were also significant differences in relative abundance at multiple taxonomic levels when comparing the two communities; at the phylum level, we observed a marked decrease in Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes and at the order and family level there were significant decreases in Clostridia and Clostridiales in patients with EoE (q ≤ 0.1). We conclude that there are significant differences in microbial community structure, microbial richness, and evenness and a significant decrease in taxa within the Clostridia in patients with EoE. Our data suggest that Clostridia based interventions could be tested as adjuncts to current therapeutic strategies in EoE.© 2019 The Authors.

PHT is an important driver of hepatic decompensation such as development of ascites or variceal bleeding. Dysbiosis and an impaired intestinal barrier in ACLD facilitate translocation of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote disease progression  immune system activation with subsequent induction of proinflammatory and profibrogenic pathways. Congestive portal venous blood flow represents a critical pathophysiological mechanism linking PHT to increased intestinal permeability: The intestinal barrier function is affected by impaired microcirculation, neoangiogenesis, and abnormal vascular and mucosal permeability. The close bidirectional relationship between the gut and the liver has been termed "gut-liver axis". Treatment strategies targeting the gut-liver axis by modulation of  composition and function, intestinal barrier integrity, as well as amelioration of liver fibrosis and PHT are supposed to exert beneficial effects. The activation of the farnesoid X receptor in the liver and the gut was associated with beneficial effects in animal experiments, however, further studies regarding efficacy and safety of pharmacological FXR modulation in patients with ACLD are needed. In this review, we summarize the clinical impact of PHT on the course of liver disease, discuss the underlying pathophysiological link of PHT to gut-liver axis signaling, and provide insight into molecular mechanisms that may represent novel therapeutic targets.©The Author(s) 2019.

However, it is unclear whether the gut  will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut  of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading  such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut  were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism were dominant metabolic pathways. Lipid metabolism was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal fat deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading  (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the lipid metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal fat accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649646>Microbial Metabolic Capacity for Intestinal Folate Production and Modulation of Host Folate Receptors.</a></h2><p>Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects of human health. Folate, or vitamin B, refers to a broad category of biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamate subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In addition to dietary nutrients, the gut  has been recognized as a source of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes identified in the Human  Project and folate production by representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete  folate synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the folate producers, we focused on the commensal  to examine host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type  did not influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from  containing a site-specific inactivation of the  gene, which prevents the bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using  with a site inactivation of , which results in no folate production. This work sheds light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and mammalian host metabolism.Copyright © 2019 Engevik, Morra, Röth, Engevik, Spinler, Devaraj, Crawford, Estes, Kalkum and Versalovic.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646213>Chlamydia in adolescent/adult reproductive management trial study (CHARM): Clinical core protocol.</a></h2><p> (CT) is a common sexually transmitted pathogen with significant reproductive health implications.

Yet, how such a diverse and functionally complex  influences ecosystem functioning remains unclear. Here we manipulated the soil  in experimental grassland ecosystems and observed that  diversity and microbial network complexity positively influenced multiple ecosystem functions related to nutrient cycling (e.g. multifunctionality). Grassland microcosms with poorly developed microbial networks and reduced microbial richness had the lowest multifunctionality due to fewer taxa present that support the same function (redundancy) and lower diversity of taxa that support different functions (reduced  functional uniqueness). Moreover, different microbial taxa explained different ecosystem functions pointing to the significance of functional diversity in microbial communities. These findings indicate the importance of microbial interactions within and among fungal and bacterial communities for enhancing ecosystem performance and demonstrate that the extinction of complex ecological associations belowground can impair ecosystem functioning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657871>Evaluating Bioinformatic Pipeline Performance for Forensic  Analysis.</a></h2><p>Microbial communities have potential evidential utility for forensic applications. However, bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing data varies widely among laboratories. These differences can potentially affect microbial community composition and downstream analyses. To illustrate the importance of standardizing methodology, we compared analyses of postmortem  samples using several bioinformatic pipelines, varying minimum library size or minimum number of sequences per sample, and sample size. Using the same input sequence data, we found that three open-source bioinformatic pipelines, MG-RAST, mothur, and QIIME2, had significant differences in relative abundance, alpha-diversity, and beta-diversity, despite the same input data. Increasing minimum library size and sample size increased the number of low-abundant and infrequent taxa detected. Our results show that bioinformatic pipeline and parameter choice affect results in important ways. Given the growing potential application of forensic microbiology to the criminal justice system, continued research on standardizing computational methodology will be important for downstream applications.© 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652909>From the Table to the Tumor: The Role of Mediterranean and Western Dietary Patterns in Shifting Microbial-Mediated Signaling to Impact Breast Cancer Risk.</a></h2><p>Diet is a modifiable component of lifestyle that could influence breast cancer development. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is considered one of the healthiest of all dietary patterns. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet protects against diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Reported consumption of a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with lower breast cancer risk for women with all subtypes of breast cancer, and a Western diet pattern was associated with greater risk. In this review, we contrast the available epidemiological breast cancer data, comparing the impact of consuming a Mediterranean diet to the Western diet. Furthermore, we will review the preclinical data highlighting the anticancer molecular mechanism of Mediterranean diet consumption in both cancer prevention and therapeutic outcomes. Diet composition is a major constituent shaping the gut . Distinct patterns of gut  composition are associated with the habitual consumption of animal fats, high-fiber diets, and vegetable-based diets. We will review the impact of Mediterranean diet on the gut  and inflammation. Outside of the gut, we recently demonstrated that Mediterranean diet consumption led to distinct  shifts in the mammary gland tissue, suggesting possible anticancer effects by diet on breast-specific . Taken together, these data support the anti-breast-cancer impact of Mediterranean diet consumption.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650688>Theoretical turnover rate of the rumen liquid fraction in dairy cows and its relationship to feed intake, rumen fermentation, and milk production.</a></h2><p>Ruminant animals are able to convert plant materials (grain and the human-indigestible portion of carbohydrates) to milk and meat. In this conversion, most of the plant materials are digested by rumen fermentation and are changed to short-chain fatty acids, microbial cells, and methane, which is released into the atmosphere. The relationships among feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production are poorly understood. Here we report a novel indicator of characteristics of rumen fermentation, theoretical turnover rate (TTOR) of the rumen liquid fraction. The TTOR was calculated from the presumed rumen volume (PRV) which is estimated by dividing the methane yield by the methane concentration of rumen fluid. The formula for the TTOR is: TTOR = PRV/body weight . Our present analyses confirm that the TTOR as an indicator is capable of connecting feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production, because dry matter intake/TTOR showed a strong correlation with milk yield/TTOR. In addition, the TTOR may be related to ruminal pH, as we observed that the ruminal pH decreased as the TTOR increased. We propose that the TTOR is a factor characterizing rumen fermentation and a good indicator of the productivity of ruminants and dysbiosis of the rumen .© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high-fat and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut  regulation.</a></h2><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high fat and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut  composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut  variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut  by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut , which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656993>The gut  to the brain axis in the metabolic control.</a></h2><p>The regulation of glycemia is under a tight neuronal detection of glucose levels performed by the gut-brain axis and an efficient efferent neuronal message sent to the peripheral organs, as the pancreas to induce insulin and inhibit glucagon secretions.

The rat model of sepsis was reproduced by injection of 10 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via tail vein, the rats in the NS control group was given the same amount of NS. The rats in the fecal  transplantation group received nasogastric infusion of feces from healthy donor on the 1st day, 2 mL each time, for 3 times a day, the other two groups were given equal dose of NS by gavage. Fecal samples were collected on the 7th day after modeling, the levels of intestinal  composition was determined using the 16SrDNA gene sequencing technology. The brain function was evaluated by electroencephalogram (EEG), and the proportion of each waveform in EEG was calculated. After sacrifice of rats, the brain tissues were harvested, the levels of protein expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) were determined by Western Blot, and positive cells of Iba-1 in brain tissue were detected by immunohistochemistry method.

However, due to the diverse processing conditions applied across Europe, it remained unclear to which degree bacterial heterogeneity can be encountered in commercially available fermented meat products and whether this is linked to their geographical origin. Therefore, the bacterial species diversity of 80 fermented meat products available in the Belgian retail, coming from five different countries, was investigated. It was also assessed how this related to the country of origin and the key processing parameters pH and salt concentration. The samples originated from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. In general, Southern European fermented meat products commonly had a higher pH, with their lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities being represented by  and with mostly  and  governing over the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) communities.

Extensive data collected over the past decades on this chronic disease demonstrate that its progression is infrequent and episodic, and the susceptibility to it can vary among individuals. Physical assessments of previously occurring damage to periodontal tissues remain the cornerstone of detection and diagnosis, whereas traditionally used diagnostic procedures do neither identify susceptible individuals nor distinguish between disease-active and disease-inactive periodontal sites. Thus, more sensitive and accurate "measurable biological indicators" of periodontal diseases are needed in order to place diagnosis (e.g., the presence or stage) and management of the disease on a more rational less empirical basis. Contemporary "omics" technologies may help unlock the path to this quest. High throughput nucleic acid sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine the taxonomic distribution of microbial communities in oral health and disease, whereas proteomic technologies allowed us to decipher the molecular state of the host in disease, as well as the interactive cross-talk of the host with the . The newly established field of metaproteomics has enabled the identification of the repertoire of proteins that oral microorganisms use to compete or co-operate with each other. Vast such data is derived from oral biological fluids, including gingival crevicular fluid and saliva, which is progressively completed and catalogued as the analytical technologies and bioinformatics tools progressively advance.

Abnormalities in this -gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut  to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, indoles, bile acids, choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules.

Nutritional status has a clear relationship with disease outcomes, and malnutrition in CF is typically a result of chronic negative energy balance secondary to malabsorption. As the mechanisms underlying the pathology of CF and its implications on nutrient absorption and energy expenditure have been elucidated, nutrition support has become increasingly sophisticated. Comprehensive nutrition monitoring and treatment guidelines from professional and advocacy organizations have unified the approach to nutrition optimization around the world. Newborn screening allows for early nutrition intervention and improvement in short- and long-term growth and other clinical outcomes. The nutrition support goal in CF care includes achieving optimal nutritional status to support growth and pubertal development in children, maintenance of optimal nutritional status in adult life, and optimizing fat soluble vitamin and essential fatty acid status. The mainstay of this approach is a high calorie, high-fat diet, exceeding age, and sex energy intake recommendations for healthy individuals. For patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, enzyme replacement therapy is required to improve fat and calorie absorption. Enzyme dosing varies by age and dietary fat intake. Multiple potential impediments to absorption, including decreased motility, altered gut luminal bile salt and  composition, and enteric inflammation must be considered. Fat soluble vitamin supplementation is required in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

Members of these communities have been reported with variable prevalence and pathogenicity, mainly depending on their host and environment (e.g. lifespan, distribution, habitat, diet, health status and stressors). Indeed, many species commonly inhabiting the sea turtle gastrointestinal tract exhibit an opportunistic behaviour. This study aimed to provide baseline data on enterobacterial and parasitic composition, through bacteriological culture-based methods and the FLOTAC parasitological technique, in cloacal and faecal samples of 30 live Caretta caretta, examined upon their arrival at the Marine Turtle Research Centre (Portici, Italy).Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in 18/23 cloacal samples (78.3%), with Citrobacter and Morganella as the most common genera, followed by Proteus, Enterobacter, Providencia, and Hafnia. Parasitic elements were detected in 11/30 faecal samples (36.7%), with Enodiotrema, Rhytidodes, and Eimeria as most common genera, followed by Pachypsolus and Cymatocarpus. Additionally, Angiodyctium is reported for the first time in this host. The majority (47.8%) of sea turtles hosted exclusively Enterobacteriaceae, whereas 30.4% hosted both parasites and Enterobacteriaceae; the remaining 21.8% hosted neither of the agents.Bacteria and parasites evaluated in the present study are common in Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles, with slight differences between the western and eastern basin. Although naturally present in the gastrointestinal system of free-living sea turtles, their relationship with these hosts might range from mutualism to parasitism. Indeed, members of the gut community might express their pathogenic potential in immune-compromised animals, such as those in rehabilitation facilities. Therefore, it is advisable to include in the standard work-up of rescued sea turtles a screening procedure for such opportunistic agents, in order to better evaluate the animal's health status and achieve timely intervention with appropriate treatment, thus improving rehabilitation. Furthermore, data collected from free-living sea turtles represent a starting point for investigating wild populations.

Enterococcal infections, mainly caused by Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, include apical periodontitis, endocarditis, and bloodstream infections. Recently, vancomycinresistant Enterococci are considered major pathogens that are common but difficult to treat, especially in nosocomial settings. Moreover, E. faecalis is closely associated with recurrent endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are metabolites fermented by gut , on the growth of Enterococci. Enterococci were cultured in the presence or absence of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, and the optical density at 600 nm was measured to determine bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a SCFA, together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652705>Gut  Profiles Differ among Individuals Depending on Their Region of Origin: An Italian Pilot Study.</a></h2><p> heterogeneity among humans is mainly due to genetic background, age, dietary habits, lifestyle and local environments.

The objective of this translational study was to evaluate, in a pediatric population, the efficacy and safety of prophylactic probiotics for a better nutritional absorption capacity in the view to enhance their overall health and immunity.A total of 40 pediatric patients between the ages of 14 and 18 years were enrolled in the study and divided under two categories (treated/active group and placebo group). Three-time points clinical evaluations were performed: a baseline assessment (Time 0), a second evaluation at 5 weeks after the start of probiotic use (Time 1), and a final evaluation at the timeline after 10 weeks (Time 2). In the initial phase of the study, the recruited subjects underwent a panel of initial T0 clinical tests. For each of the patients, a blood sample was taken in order to evaluate the following biochemical measurements: Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Calcium, Zinc, and Iron. Moreover, an initial nutritional evaluation was carried out through which the nutritionist estimated the body composition of the subject (weight and body mass index), the caloric needs and dietary behaviour of each recruited patient.Eligible participants were randomized into placebo (n = 20) or treated/active (n = 20) treatment conditions by random allocation using a computerized random number generator, ensuring all investigators remained blind to the treatment distribution. The data were compared within and between groups using statistical methods.

Despite the common occurrence of yeast (primarily Candida) within the vaginal , there is still an incomplete picture of relationships between yeast and bacteria (especially lactobacilli), as well as how such associations are governed. Such relationships could be important to a more holistic understanding of the vaginal  and its connection to reproductive health.To perform molecular characterization of clinical specimens to define associations between vaginal bacteria (especially Lactobacillus species) and Candida colonization. In vitro studies were conducted to test the two most common dominant Lactobacillus species (Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) in their ability to inhibit Candida growth and to examine the basis for such inhibition.A nested cross-sectional study of reproductive age women from the Contraceptive CHOICE Project was conducted. Vaginal swabs from 299 women were selected to balance race and BV status, resulting in similar representation of black and white women in each of the three Nugent score categories [normal (0-3), intermediate (4-6), and bacterial vaginosis (7-10)]. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal gene (V4 region) was used to determine the dominant Lactobacillus species present (primarily L. iners and L. crispatus), defined as >50% of the community. Subjects without dominance by a single Lactobacillus species were classified as Diverse. A Candida-specific qPCR targeting the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was validated using vaginal samples collected from a second cohort of women and used to assess Candida colonization. 255 nonpregnant women with sufficient bacterial biomass for analysis were included in the final analysis. Generalized linear models were employed to evaluate associations between Lactobacillus dominance, sociodemographic and risk characteristics and vaginal Candida colonization. In separate in vitro studies, the potential of cell-free supernatants from L. crispatus and L. iners cultures to inhibit Candida growth was evaluated.Forty-two women (16%) were vaginally colonized with Candida. Microbiomes characterized as Diverse (38%), L. iners-dominant (39%), and L. crispatus-dominant (20%) were the most common. The , race and Candida colonization co-varied with a higher prevalence of Candida among black women and L. iners-dominant communities compared to white women and L. crispatus-dominant communities. L. iners-dominant communities were more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities (OR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.21; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.048). In vitro, L. crispatus produced greater concentrations of lactic acid and exhibited significantly more pH-dependent growth inhibition of C. albicans, suggesting a potential mechanism for the clinical observations.In nonpregnant women, L. iners-dominant communities were significantly more likely to harbor Candida than L. crispatus-dominant communities, suggesting that Lactobacillus species have different relationships with Candida. In vitro experiments indicate that L. crispatus may impede Candida colonization more effectively than L. iners through a greater production of lactic acid.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The gut of children with optimum growth is enriched in certain species, especially  and  and ommensal  both contribute to formation of acidic stool, and an elevated faecal pH indicates reduction of these species in the gut. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association of faecal pH with childhood stunting.In this cross-sectional study, 100 children with length-for-age Z score (LAZ) <-1 aged between 12 and 18 months were enrolled from the ongoing Bangladesh Environmental Enteric Dysfunction study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. LAZ was measured by anthropometry and data on factors affecting linear growth were recorded. Faecal pH measurement was done using pH metre on freshly collected non-diarrhoeal faecal samples following standard procedure. Multiple quantile regression was done to quantify the relation between faecal pH and LAZ scores.The mean LAZ and faecal pH of the children were -2.12±0.80 and 5.84±1.11, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed a statistically significant negative correlation between stool pH and the LAZ scores (p<0.01). After inclusion of other factors affecting linear growth into the regression model, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between faecal pH and LAZ score (p<0.01).Elevated faecal pH was found to have a significant association with stunted growth. As an indicator of gut  status, faecal pH might have emerged as a possible indirect determinant of childhood stunting..© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Given the importance of the spinal cord as a locomotor control center and the public perception that paralysis is the defining feature of SCI, this "spinal-centric" focus is logical. Unfortunately, such a focus likely will not yield new discoveries that reverse other devastating consequences of SCI including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, bladder/bowel dysfunction and infection. The current review considers how SCI changes the physiological interplay between the spinal cord, the gut and the immune system. A suspected culprit in causing many of the pathological manifestations of impaired spinal cord-gut-immune axis homeostasis is the gut . After SCI, the composition of the gut  changes, creating a chronic state of gut "dysbiosis". To date, much of what we know about gut dysbiosis was learned from 16S-based taxonomic profiling studies that reveal changes in the composition and abundance of various bacteria. However, this approach has limitations and creates taxonomic "blindspots". Notably, only bacteria can be analyzed. Thus, in this review we also discuss how the application of emerging sequencing technologies can improve our understanding of how the broader ecosystem in the gut is affected by SCI. Specifically, metagenomics will provide researchers with a more comprehensive look at post-injury changes in the gut virome (and mycome). Metagenomics also allows changes in microbe population dynamics to be linked to specific microbial functions that can affect the development and progression of metabolic disease, immune dysfunction and affective disorders after SCI. As these new tools become more readily available and used across the research community, the development of an "ecogenomic" toolbox will facilitate an Eco-Systems Biology approach to study the complex interplay along the spinal cord-gut-immune axis after SCI.Copyright © 2018.

M cells actively transport luminal antigens to the underlying lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response. The molecular machinery of M-cell differentiation and function has been vigorously investigated over the last decade. Studies have shed light on the role of M cells in the mucosal immune system and have revealed that antigen uptake by M cells contributes to not only mucosal but also systemic immune responses. However, M-cell studies usually focus on infectious diseases; the contribution of M cells to autoimmune diseases has remained largely unexplored. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the intestinal  is implicated in multiple systemic diseases, including autoimmune diseases. This implies that the uptake of microorganisms by M cells in PPs may play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. We provide an outline of the current understanding of M-cell biology and subsequently discuss the potential contribution of M cells and PPs to the induction of systemic autoimmunity, beyond the mucosal immune response.Copyright © 2019 Kobayashi, Takahashi, Takano, Kimura and Hase.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645720>The  regulate neuronal function and fear extinction learning.</a></h2><p>Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the .

Alterations in the  can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the  influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the  in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the  in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the  revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which -derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that -derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires -derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642067>Starving the Gut: A Deficit of Butyrate in the Intestinal Ecosystem of Children With Intestinal Failure.</a></h2><p>Intestinal epithelial integrity is influenced by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and is of critical importance for children with intestinal failure (IF) given the known devastating infectious and gastrointestinal complications. The composition of the  in IF represents an important variable in the physiology and prognosis of this disease.We sought to compare the intestinal  and SCFA concentration of children who require parenteral nutrition (PN) with that of children with short-bowel syndrome (SBS) who have discontinued PN and with age-matched controls, using high-throughput sequencing to investigate host-microbe interactions.Fifty-three samples were submitted over 6-15 months. Six children with SBS + IF submitted 34 samples, and 6 children with SBS with discontinued PN submitted 15 samples; these were compared with samples from 5 control children. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA partial gene sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer. SCFAs were measured in stool samples by mass spectrometry.Butyrate quantity was near absent in children with IF compared with that in controls (median 0.37 nmol/mg vs 10.92 nmol/mg; P < .0001). Similarly, commensal anaerobes known to produce SCFA, including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, were reduced in those with SBS. SBS + IF enteric samples demonstrated a 168-fold increase in the relative abundance of the Escherichia genus seemingly attributable to the species Escherichia coli.The reduced relative abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridia as well as decreased intestinal butyrate concentration in children with IF support further investigation in therapeutic options that target butyrate-producing bacterial communities or butyrate supplementation.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649640>Editorial: Characterizing Modern Microbialites and the Geobiological Processes Underlying Their Formation.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651219>Human Nasal  as Characterized by Metagenomics Differs Markedly Between Rural and Industrial Communities in Egypt.</a></h2><p>Microbial communities residing in the nose play important roles in human health and disease.

Acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate mucus production and suppress Th2 inflammation through nicotinic receptors in lungs but UC is rarely observed in smokers and the mechanism of the protection is unclear.In order to evaluate whether acetylcholine can ameliorate UC-associated pathologies, we employed a mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC-like conditions, and a group of mice were treated with Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) to increase acetylcholine availability. The effects on colonic tissue morphology, Th2 inflammatory factors, MUC2 mucin, and gut  were analyzed.DSS challenge damaged the murine colonic architecture, reduced the MUC2 mucin and the tight-junction protein ZO-1. The PB treatment significantly attenuated these DSS-induced responses along with the eosinophilic infiltration and the pro-Th2 inflammatory factors. Moreover, PB inhibited the DSS-induced loss of commensal Clostridia and Flavobacteria, and the gain of pathogenic Erysipelotrichia and Fusobacteria.Together, these data suggest that in colons of a murine model, PB promotes MUC2 synthesis, suppresses Th2 inflammation and attenuates bacterial dysbiosis therefore, PB has a therapeutic potential in UC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645481>Embrace the fat when getting old.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657907>Detecting changes in the Caenorhabditis elegans intestinal environment using an engineered bacterial biosensor.</a></h2><p>Caenorhabditis elegans has become a key model organism within biology.

Although colonization by S. aureus is common in AD, the mechanisms rendering an organism prone to dysbiosis, and the role of IL-17A in the control of S. aureus-induced skin inflammation, are not well understood. Here, we show several pathological aspects of AD, including type 2/type 17 immune responses, elevated IgE, barrier dysfunction, pruritus, and importantly, spontaneous S. aureus colonization in JunB mice, with a large transcriptomic overlap with AD. Additionally, using Rag1 mice, we demonstrate that adaptive immune cells are necessary for protection against S. aureus colonization. Prophylactic antibiotics, but not antibiotics after established dysbiosis, reduce IL-17A expression and skin inflammation, examined using Il17a-eGFP reporter mice. Mechanistically, keratinocytes lacking JunB exhibit higher MyD88 levels in vitro and in vivo, previously shown to regulate S. aureus colonization. In conclusion, our data identify JunB as an upstream regulator of -immune cell interactions and characterize the IL-17A response upon spontaneous dysbiosis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The aim of the present review is to summarize the findings and suggest a framework for future studies designed to investigate the etiology of inter-individual variability in plant bioactive ADME and bioefficacy.Few studies have reported individual data on the ADME of bioactive compounds and on determinants such as age, diet, lifestyle, health status and medication, thereby limiting a mechanistic understanding of the main drivers of variation in ADME processes observed across individuals. Metabolomics represent crucial techniques to decipher inter-individual variability and to stratify individuals according to metabotypes reflecting the intrinsic capacity to absorb and metabolize bioactive compounds.A methodological framework was developed to decipher how the contribution from genetic variants or  variants to ADME of bioactive compounds can be predicted. Future study design should include (1) a larger number of study participants, (2) individual and full profiling of all possible determinants of internal exposure, (3) the presentation of individual ADME data and (4) incorporation of omics platforms, such as genomics, microbiomics and metabolomics in ADME and efficacy studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649627>Composition and Drivers of Gut Microbial Communities in Arctic-Breeding Shorebirds.</a></h2><p>Gut  can have important effects on host health, but explanatory factors and pathways that determine gut microbial composition can differ among host lineages. In mammals, host phylogeny is one of the main drivers of gut , a result of vertical transfer of  during birth. In birds, it is less clear what the drivers might be, but both phylogeny and environmental factors may play a role. We investigated host and environmental factors that underlie variation in gut  composition in eight species of migratory shorebirds. We characterized bacterial communities from 375 fecal samples collected from adults of eight shorebird species captured at a network of nine breeding sites in the Arctic and sub-Arctic ecoregions of North America, by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Firmicutes (55.4%), Proteobacteria (13.8%), Fusobacteria (10.2%), and Bacteroidetes (8.1%) dominated the gut  of adult shorebirds. Breeding location was the main driver of variation in gut  of breeding shorebirds (  = 11.6%), followed by shorebird host species (  = 1.8%), and sampling year (  = 0.9%), but most variation remained unexplained. Site variation resulted from differences in the core bacterial taxa, whereas rare, low-abundance bacteria drove host species variation. Our study is the first to highlight a greater importance of local environment than phylogeny as a driver of gut  composition in wild, migratory birds under natural conditions.Copyright © 2019 Grond, Santo Domingo, Lanctot, Jumpponen, Bentzen, Boldenow, Brown, Casler, Cunningham, Doll, Freeman, Hill, Kendall, Kwon, Liebezeit, Pirie-Dominix, Rausch and Sandercock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641509> sp. nov., a new bacterium isolated from the human .</a></h2><p> sp. nov., strain Marseille-P3755 (= CSUR P3755 = DSM 103513) is a new bacterial species from the phylum  and the family  which was isolated from the human gut .© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659420>Effects of sialylated lactulose on the mouse intestinal  using Illumina high-throughput sequencing.</a></h2><p>Sialylated oligosaccharides are known to have beneficial effects, such as increasing the level of bifidobacteria, reducing the levels of blood endotoxin and blood ammonia, and enhancing the body's immune system. However, it is unknown whether sialylated lactuloses have modulatory effects on the intestinal . In this study, 60 healthy mice were randomly divided into six groups, namely, a normal control group, a lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,3-lactulose group, a Kdn-α2,6-lactulose group, a Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group, and a Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose group. After 14 days of lactulose administration, the feces of three mice from each group were collected, and the intestinal  were detected by Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes was increased in the sialylated lactulose groups, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased. At the family level, sialylated lactulose intervention decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales S24-7 group and Helicobacteraceae and enhanced the abundance of Lactobacillaceae, which reflects the modulatory effect of sialylated lactulose on intestinal . Diversity analysis indicated that the index of Chao was higher in the sialylated lactulose groups than in the normal control group, and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher in the Kdnα-2,6-lactulose group and the Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose group than in the normal control group. The results of the intestinal  sample composition indicated that there were differences between the sialylated lactulose groups and the normal control group.

However, the inoculation of  showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic acid content. Based on the results of variance partitioning analysis, 17.0, 34.0, 14.9, 40.1, 28.2, and 18.0% variations in shoot morphology, root morphology, plant biomass, active ingredient, photosynthetic parameters, and antioxidant parameters, respectively, were attributable to the presence of certain soil microorganisms. These findings suggest the possibility that DSE inoculation improved the root development and nutrient absorption of host plants, altered the soil , and might also contribute to plant growth and survival under drought conditions. As  exhibited positive effects on the plant biomass, morphological and physiological parameters, and active ingredient content in licorice plants under drought stress, it was considered to be the best fungus for licorice cultivation.

At weaning, 96 pigs (8.4 (SD 1.09) kg) (meatline boars x (large white x landrace sows) were blocked by live weight, litter and sex and randomly assigned to: 1) basal diet; 2) basal + 100ppm laminarin; 3) basal + 200ppm laminarin; 4) basal + 300ppm laminarin (3 pigs/pen). The appropriate quantity of a laminarin rich extract (65% laminarin) was added to the basal diet to achieve the above dietary inclusion levels of laminarin. After 14 days of supplementation, 8 pigs from the basal group and the best performing laminarin group were euthanised for sample collection. The 300ppm laminarin group was selected as this group had higher ADFI compared to all other groups and higher ADG than the basal group (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased villus height in the duodenum and jejunum (P<0.05). Laminarin supplementation increased the expression of SLC2A8/GLUT8 in the duodenum, SLC2A2/GLUT2, SLC2A7/GLUT7, SLC15A1/PEPT1 and FABP2 in the jejunum, and SLC16A1/MCT1 in the colon. Laminarin supplementation reduced Enterobacteriaceae numbers in the caecum (P<0.05), and increased lactobacilli numbers (P<0.05), total volatile fatty acid concentrations and the molar proportions of butyrate (P<0.01) in the colon. In conclusion, 300ppm laminarin from a laminarin rich extract has potential, as a dietary supplement, to improve performance and prevent post-weaning intestinal dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638020>Effects of 2,2-dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm), an emerging disinfection by-product in drinking water, on the intestinal  of adult zebrafish.</a></h2><p>The presence of disinfection by-products (DBPs) increases the mutagenicity of water and may pose adverse health effects. Gut  exerts a fundamental role on host physiology, and how extrinsic perturbations influence its composition has been increasingly examined. However, the effect of DBPs on gut  is still poorly understood. In the present study, adult zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations of dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm, an emerging nitrogenous DBP) for 30 days. Sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons revealed a significant change in the richness and diversity of  in the gut of DCAcAm-exposed zebrafish. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased and the abundance of Fusobacteria and Firmicutes increased significantly in the gut after exposure to 100 and 500 μg/L DCAcAm. At the genus level, the abundances of several bacteria which are considered pathogens or opportunistic pathogens in fish and closely related to fish metabolism, disease and inflammation (Aeromonas, Stenotrophomonas, Bacteroides and Ralstonia) increased in the DCAcAm-treated groups. Our results reveal that DBPs in drinking water potentially affect gut  composition, which may contribute to the toxicity assessment of DBPs in future and provide new insight into the complex interactions between the DBPs in drinking water and host health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638593>Targeting the Infant Gut  Through a Perinatal Educational Dietary Intervention: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.</a></h2><p>The early life gut  are an important regulator of the biological pathways contributing toward the pathogenesis of noncommunicable disease. It is unclear whether improvements to perinatal diet quality could alter the infant gut .The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a perinatal educational dietary intervention in influencing gut  in mothers and infants 4 weeks after birth.The Healthy Parents, Healthy Kids randomized controlled trial aimed to recruit 90 pregnant women from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. At week 26 of gestation, women were randomized to receive dietary advice from their doctor (n=45), or additionally receive a dietary intervention (n=45). The intervention included an educational workshop and 2 support calls aiming to align participants' diets with the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increase intakes of prebiotic and probiotic foods. The educational design focused on active learning and self-assessment. Behavior change techniques were used to support dietary adherence, and the target behavior was eating for the gut . Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years, diagnosed mental illnesses, obesity, diabetes mellitus, diagnosed bowel conditions, exclusion diets, illicit drug use, antibiotic use, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, and those lacking dietary autonomy. The primary outcome measure is a between-group difference in alpha diversity in infant stool collected 4 weeks after birth. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in influencing infant and maternal stool microbial composition and short chain fatty acid concentrations, epigenetic profile, and markers of inflammation and stress, as well as changes in maternal dietary intake and well-being. The study and intervention feasibility and acceptance will also be evaluated as secondary outcomes.The study results are yet to be written. The first participant was enrolled on July 28, 2016, and the final follow-up assessment was completed on October 11, 2017.Data from this study will provide new insights regarding the ability of interventions targeting the perinatal diet to alter the maternal and infant gut . If this intervention is proven, our findings will support larger studies aiming to guide the assembly of gut  in early life.Australian Clinical Trials Registration Number ACTRN12616000936426; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=370939.DERR1-10.2196/14771.©Samantha L L.

We investigated the mechanisms by which the western diet promotes tumor recurrence, including changes in the , in mice that underwent colorectal resections.BALB/c male mice were fed either standard chow diet or western-type diet (characterized by high fat, no fiber, and decreased minerals and vitamins) for 4 weeks; some mice were given antibiotics or ABA-PEG20k-Pi20 (Pi-PEG), which inhibits collagenase production by bacteria but not bacterial growth, in drinking water. Colorectal resections and anastomoses were then performed. The first day after surgery, mice were given enemas containing collagenolytic rodent-derived strain of Enterococcus faecalis (strain E2), and the second day they were given mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26). Twenty-one days later, distal colons were removed and colon contents (feces, distal colon, and tumor) were collected. Colon tissues were analyzed by histology, for the presence of collagenolytic colonies, and by 16S rRNA sequencing. determined the anatomical distribution of E faecalis at the site of the anastomosis and within tumors using in situ hybridization. Mouse imaging analyses were used to identify metastases.Colorectal tumors were found in 88% of mice fed the western diet and given antibiotics, surgery, and E faecalis compared with only 30% of mice fed the standard diet followed by the same procedures. Colon tumor formation correlated with the presence of collagenolytic E faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotics eliminated collagenolytic E faecalis and P mirabilis but did not reduce tumor formation. However, antibiotics promoted emergence of Candida parapsilosis, a collagenase-producing microorganism. Administration of a Pi-PEG reduced tumor formation and maintained diversity of the colon .We identified a mechanisms by which diet and antibiotic use can promote tumorigenesis by colon cancer cells at the anastomosis following colorectal surgery. Strategies to prevent emergence of these microbe communities or their enzymatic activities might be used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment, which is a special drying process and is considered to be an essential embodiment of high quality and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating of Houpo leads to peculiar changes in the microbial community structure and the content of main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial community was considered the cause of the change in content of active substances of Houpo, although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content remain unidentified.In this study, we used MiSeq high-throughput sequencing methods for partial bacterial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences to compare the bacterial and fungal community structures at different timepoints in the process of sweating. The content of the main active substances (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to evaluate the effects of sweating. UPLC-Q-Extractive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE Orbitrap MS) was used to detection of differential metabolites of unsweated Houpo before and after co-culture with core bacterial solutions.In this study, the total contents of magnolol (MG) and honokiol (HK) were significantly increased at 4 dp (dp for day PM sample), up to 3.75%, and the contents of syringin (SG) and magnoflorine (MF) were as high as 0.12% and 0.06%, respectively. Bacterial abundance and diversity were higher in the early stage (0 day-2 da; da for day AM sample) than in the later stage (4-5 dp), while fungal abundance was more obvious in the later stage than in the early stage. Positive correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05),  (P < 0.05) and  (P < 0.05) would be conducive to improving the quality of Houpo. Negative correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of , , , , , , , ,  and  could be a potential antagonist for the decrease in the quality of Houpo. After co-culture of single core strain and unsweated Houpo, there was no significant difference in the four main active components, but there were other metabolites with significant difference.Our findings reveal that sweating increased the content of the main active compounds, promoted the relative abundance of potentially beneficial microbes, decreased the abundance of potentially harmful microbes, the core functional genera group together, forming a core , these genera are dominant across the different stages of the sweating process and contribute to the quality development of the characteristics of Houpo. Meanwhile, this study presented a clear scope for potential beneficial microbes that improve the quality of Houpo.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641087>Vaginal Biomarkers That Predict Cervical Length and Dominant Bacteria in the Vaginal Microbiomes of Pregnant Women.</a></h2><p>In many impoverished regions of the world, it may not be possible to assess two major risk factors for preterm birth: a short cervical length and the depletion of vaginal lactobacilli. We determined whether measuring specific compounds in vaginal fluid might be a simple, noninvasive, and cost-effective way to predict the bacteria that dominate the vaginal  and indicate the presence of a shortened cervix (<25 mm). Vaginal fluid samples were prospectively collected from mid-trimester pregnant women, and the concentrations of d- and l-lactic acid, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-8, the 70-kDa heat shock protein, a2 isoform of vacuolar ATPase, and sequestrome-1 were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The compositions of vaginal microbiomes were assessed by analysis of the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA genes, while cervical length was determined by transvaginal ultrasonography. The vaginal microbiomes could be clustered into five community state types (CSTs), four of which were dominated by a single  species. The dominance of  or  in the vaginal  predicted the level of d-lactic acid present. Several of the biomarkers, especially TIMP-1, in combination with the subject's age and race, were significantly associated with cervical length. Using piecewise structural equation modeling, we established a causal network that links CST to cervical length via biomarkers. We concluded that measuring levels of TIMP-1 and d-lactic acid in vaginal secretions might be a straightforward way to assess the risk for preterm birth due to a short cervix and  composition. Premature birth and its complications are the largest contributors to infant death in the United States and globally. A short cervical length and the depletion of  species are known risk factors for preterm birth. However, in many resource-poor areas of the world, the technology to test for their occurrence is unavailable, and pregnant women with these risk factors are neither identified nor treated. In this study, we used path analysis to gain an unprecedented understanding of interactions between vaginal  composition, the concentrations of various compounds in vaginal secretions, and cervical length. We identified low-cost point-of-care measures that might be used to identify pregnant women at risk for preterm birth. The use of these measures coupled with appropriate preventative or treatment strategies could reduce the incidence of preterm births in poor areas of the world that lack access to more sophisticated diagnostic methods.Copyright © 2019 Witkin et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660868>Aging progression of human gut .</a></h2><p>Human gut  are important for human health and have been regarded as a "forgotten organ", whose variation is closely linked with various factors, such as host genetics, diet, pathological conditions and external environment. The diversity of human gut  has been correlated with aging, which was characterized by different abundance of bacteria in various age groups. In the literature, most of the previous studies of age-related gut  changes focused on individual species in the gut community with supervised methods. Here, we aimed to examine the underlying aging progression of the human gut microbial community from an unsupervised perspective.We obtained raw 16S rRNA sequencing data of subjects ranging from newborns to centenarians from a previous study, and summarized the data into a relative abundance matrix of genera in all the samples. Without using the age information of samples, we applied an unsupervised algorithm to recapitulate the underlying aging progression of microbial community from hosts in different age groups and identify genera associated to this progression. Literature review of these identified genera indicated that for individuals with advanced ages, some beneficial genera are lost while some genera related with inflammation and cancer increase.The multivariate unsupervised analysis here revealed the existence of a continuous aging progression of human gut  along with the host aging process. The identified genera associated to this aging process are meaningful for designing probiotics to maintain the gut  to resemble a young age, which hopefully will lead to positive impact on human health, especially for individuals in advanced age groups.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654515>Human  and allergic diseases in children: pathogenetic role and therapeutic options.</a></h2><p>The recent and extensive study of the  has provided an enormous amount of data concerning the type and possible functions of microorganisms present in the gut, airways, genital tract, and skin. These data showed interpersonal differences in the composition of the  and these differences suggest a link between the , the immune modulation, and the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. This research is particularly relevant in paediatrics, since allergic diseases are constantly increasing and there is evidence in the paediatric age that shows that the composition of the  in the foetal and neonatal period plays a key role in the development of the immune system: vaginal delivery, breastfeeding, childhood spent in rural environments and/or in contact with animals result in a greater biodiversity of the  with the presence of protective species that reduce the activation of Th2 lymphocytes, involved in allergic reactions. Further studies are necessary to better understand the  role in the pathogenesis of atopy in order to understand if specific probiotics and prebiotics, administered orally or topically, can affect the  composition and modulate immune system functions, producing a therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergic diseases.

The intestinal  has various functions including host protection from overgrowth or colonization by unwanted bacteria. The exposure to antibiotics significantly reduces the bacterial density of intestinal  leaving an ecologic void that can be occupied by potentially pathogenic and/or resistant bacteria frequently present in hospital settings. Consequently, the intestinal  of inpatients acts as a major reservoir and plays a critical role in perpetuating the spread of resistant bacteria. There are novel innovative methods to protect the host  during antibiotic treatment, but they do not offer a solution for already established colonization by resistant microorganisms. Fecal  transfer (FMT) is a promising intervention to achieve this goal; however, controlled trials report lower success rates than initial retrospective studies, especially in case of gram negatives. The aim of the present article is to highlight the importance of the intestinal  in the global spread of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms and to review the recent advances to protect the human  from the action of antibiotics as well as a critical discussion about the evidence of decolonization of MDR microorganisms by FMT.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653078>The Role of the Gut  in Colorectal Cancer Causation.</a></h2><p>Here, we reviewed emerging evidence on the role of the microbial community in colorectal carcinogenesis. A healthy gut  promotes intestinal homeostasis and can exert anti-cancer effects; however, this  also produces a variety of metabolites that are genotoxic and which can negatively influence epithelial cell behaviour. Disturbances in the normal microbial balance, known as dysbiosis, are frequently observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Microbial species linked to CRC include certain strains of ,   and   amongst others. Whether these microbes are merely passive dwellers exploiting the tumour environment, or rather, active protagonists in the carcinogenic process is the subject of much research. The incidence of chemically-induced tumours in mice models varies, depending upon the presence or absence of these microorganisms, thus strongly suggesting influences on disease causation. Putative mechanistic explanations differentially link these strains to DNA damage, inflammation, aberrant cell behaviour and immune suppression. In the future, modulating the composition and metabolic activity of this microbial community may have a role in prevention and therapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659582>Age-related compositional and functional changes in micro-pig gut .</a></h2><p>Age-related changes in human gut  composition have been reported, and such changes might be influenced by the intake of nutrients or diets. To investigate the effects of aging on the gut  independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut  was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut . Consistent with previous studies on the human gut , beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut -age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639089>Nutrition - facts and myths.</a></h2><p>Taking responsibility for your life, among other factors, means also considering what to eat and which nutrition pattern to follow.

In this review, we provide a new perspective on succinate as a gut -derived metabolite with a key role governing intestinal homeostasis and energy metabolism. Thus, succinate is not merely a major intermediary of the TCA traditionally considered as an extracellular danger signal in the host, but also a by-product of some bacteria and a primary cross-feeding metabolite between gut resident microbes. In addition to maintain a healthy , specific functions of -derived succinate in peripheral tissues regulating host nutrient metabolism should not be rule out. Indeed, recent research point to some probiotic interventions directed to modulate succinate levels in the intestinal lumen, as a new -based therapies to treat obesity and related co-morbidities. While further research is essential, a large body of evidence point to succinate as a new strategic mediator in the -host cross-talk, which might provide the basis for new therapeutically approaches in a near future.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649546>Inflammation in Renal Diseases: New and Old Players.</a></h2><p>Inflammation, a process intimately linked to renal disease, can be defined as a complex network of interactions between renal parenchymal cells and resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, coupled with recruitment of circulating monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils. Once stimulated, these cells activate specialized structures such as Toll-like receptor and Nod-like receptor (NLR). By detecting danger-associated molecules, these receptors can set in motion major innate immunity pathways such as nuclear factor ĸB (NF-ĸB) and NLRP3 inflammasome, causing metabolic reprogramming and phenotype changes of immune and parenchymal cells and triggering the secretion of a number of inflammatory mediators that can cause irreversible tissue damage and functional loss. Growing evidence suggests that this response can be deeply impacted by the crosstalk between the kidneys and other organs, such as the gut. Changes in the composition and/or metabolite production of the gut  can influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, thus offering opportunities to positively manipulate the composition and/or functionality of gut  and, consequentially, ameliorate deleterious consequences of renal diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent evidence that renal inflammation can be ameliorated by interfering with the gut  through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics. In addition to these innovative approaches, we address the recent discovery of new targets for drugs long in use in clinical practice. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, NF-ĸB inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and antimetabolic drugs can reduce renal macrophage infiltration and slow down the progression of renal disease by mechanisms independent of those usually attributed to these compounds. Allopurinol, an inhibitor of uric acid production, has been shown to decrease renal inflammation by limiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. So far, these protective effects have been shown in experimental studies only. Clinical studies will establish whether these novel strategies can be incorporated into the arsenal of treatments intended to prevent the progression of human disease.Copyright © 2019 Andrade-Oliveira, Foresto-Neto, Watanabe, Zatz and Câmara.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655999>Composition and Structure of Gut  in Adolescents with Obesity and Different Breastfeeding Duration.</a></h2><p>Gut  of adolescents with obesity and different duration of breastfeeding was analyzed by metagenomic analysis of V3-V4 variable domains of the 16S rRNA gene.

Herein, we describe GM changes following a large burn in swine randomized to different volumes of IV Lactated Ringers' (LR).Anesthetized Yorkshire swine sustained 40% Total body surface area full-thickness burns and were randomized to different volumes of IV LR: none (n = 3), 15 mL/kg/day (Low; n = 6), or 80 mL/kg/day (High; n = 6). At baseline and days 1 and 2, fecal swabs were collected for 16 s rDNA sequencing. Proximal jejunum was collected immediately after euthanasia (day 2) for western blot, histopathology, and cytokine analyses.Burns produced significant shifts in β-diversity and non-significant reductions in α-diversity that did not recover regardless of treatment group. Burn-induced increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Firmicutes were attenuated by IV fluids in a dose-dependent manner, and also correlated with α-diversity. IV fluids caused a dose-dependent increase in Bacteroides and prevented a transient increase in the opportunistic pathogen Haemophilus parainfluenzae. While high volumes of IV fluids increased intestinal Hsp70 levels (p = 0.0464), they reduced SGLT1 (p = 0.0213) and caspase3 (p = 0.0139) levels. IV fluids elicited a non-specific cytokine response however Bacteroidetes levels correlated with intestinal IL18 levels (p = 0.0166, R = 0.4201).We present the first report on the gut  in a porcine burn model, and present data to suggest that IV fluids may influence GM and gut functional proteins following a burn. Overall, burn injury results GM diversity shifts, which may expose diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets to improve outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646072>Autoinducer-2 of gut , a potential novel marker for human colorectal cancer, is associated with the activation of TNFSF9 signaling in macrophages.</a></h2><p>: The interaction between the quorum sensing (QS) molecules of gut  and the immunity of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been investigated before. : We measured the concentration of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in samples of stool, colorectal tissue, saliva and serum of CRC patients, and compared this to AI-2 levels in colorectal adenoma (AD) and normal colon mucosa (NC). To explore the activated signaling pathways involved, we utilized AI-2 extracted from  to stimulate macrophages and validated these  findings in human CRC tissues. : The AI-2 concentration in both colorectal tissue and stool of CRC patients was significantly higher when compared to that in AD and NC (all  values < .01). The AI-2 concentration along with the progression of CRC in both tissues and stools was significantly increased (= .045，= .0003, respectively). After AI-2 stimulation, TNFSF9 was the most significantly increased protein in macrophage cells ( < .01). TNFSF9 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues when compared to NCs (< .0001), which was mainly derived from macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, AI-2 level was positively associated with CD3 + T cell numbers (= .0462), and negatively associated with CD4/CD8 ratio (= .0113) within CRC tissues. : We demonstrated for the first time that AI-2 may serve as a novel marker for screening CRC in the clinic. AI-2 was associated with tumor immunity in CRCs through tumor-associated macrophages and CD4/CD8 ratio in a TNFSF9-dependent manner.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639103>Applying mass spectrometry-based assays to explore gut microbial metabolism and associations with disease.</a></h2><p>The workings of the gut  have gained increasing interest in recent years through the mounting evidence that the  plays an influential role in human health and disease. A principal focus of this research seeks to further understand the production of metabolic by-products produced by bacteria resident in the gut, and the subsequent interaction of these metabolites on host physiology and pathophysiology of disease. Gut bacterial metabolites of interest are predominately formed via metabolic breakdown of dietary compounds including choline and ʟ-carnitine (trimethylamine N-oxide), amino acids (phenol- and indole-containing uremic toxins) and non-digestible dietary fibers (short-chain fatty acids). Investigations have been accelerated through the application of mass spectrometry (MS)-based assays to quantitatively assess the concentration of these metabolites in laboratory- and animal-based experiments, as well as for direct circulating measurements in clinical research populations. This review seeks to explore the impact of these metabolites on disease, as well as to introduce the application of MS for those less accustomed to its use as a clinical tool, highlighting pertinent research related to its use for measurements of gut bacteria-mediated metabolites to further understand their associations with disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653906>Clostridium difficile clade 3 (RT023) have a modified cell surface and contain a large transposable island with novel cargo.</a></h2><p>The major global pathogen Clostridium difficile (recently renamed Clostridioides difficile) has large genetic diversity including multiple mobile genetic elements. In this study, whole genome sequencing of 86 strains from the poorly characterised clade 3, predominantly PCR ribotype (RT)023, of C. difficile revealed distinctive surface architecture characteristics and a large mobile genetic island. These strains have a unique sortase substrate phenotype compared with well-characterised strains of C. difficile, and loss of the phage protection protein CwpV. A large genetic insertion (023_CTnT) comprised of three smaller elements (023_CTn1-3) is present in 80/86 strains analysed in this study, with genes common among other bacterial strains in the gut . Novel cargo regions of 023_CTnT include genes encoding a sortase, putative sortase substrates, lantibiotic ABC transporters and a putative siderophore biosynthetic cluster. We demonstrate the excision of 023_CTnT and sub-elements 023_CTn2 and 023_CTn3 from the genome of RT023 reference strain CD305 and the transfer of 023_CTn3 to a non-toxigenic C. difficile strain, which may have implications for the use of non-toxigenic C. difficile strains as live attenuated vaccines. Finally, we show that the genes within the island are expressed in a regulated manner in C. difficile RT023 strains conferring a distinct "niche adaptation".</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649786>Therapeutic applicability of helminths in autoimmune diseases - literature overview.</a></h2><p>This paper presents an overview of published studies conducted on helminths - parasites of the human gastrointestinal tract. Making use of their ability for immunomodulation may lead to the introduction of effective therapies for autoimmune diseases. This paper presents chronologically attempts to treat autoimmune diseases not only of the gastrointestinal tract, but also of the nervous and endocrine systems, which have been undertaken for decades. The overview of analysed reports demonstrates that as medical knowledge on the cells and mediators participating actively in inflammatory processes accumulates, clinical trials focus on ever more specific areas concerning the pathomechanisms of autoimmune diseases. The outcomes of clinical trials conducted both on animals and humans give reasons to assume that the modification of the human intestinal microflora may be the key to fighting against these diseases.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653902>Retinal artery occlusion is associated with compositional and functional shifts in the gut  and altered trimethylamine-N-oxide levels.</a></h2><p>Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is a sight threatening complication of cardiovascular disease and commonly occurs due to underlying atherosclerosis. As cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis in particular has been associated with compositional alterations in the gut , we investigated this association in patients with clinically confirmed non-arteritic RAO compared to age- and sex-matched controls. On the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased in patients with RAO compared to controls, whereas the opposite applied for the phylum of Proteobacteria. Several genera and species such as Actinobacter, Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides stercoris, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were relatively enriched in patients with RAO, whereas others such as Odoribacter, Parasutterella or Lachnospiraceae were significantly lower. Patient's gut microbiomes were enriched in genes of the cholesterol metabolism pathway. The gut derived, pro-atherogenic metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) was significantly higher in patients with RAO compared to controls (p = 0.023) and a negative correlation between relative abundances of genera Parasutterella and Lachnospiraceae and TMAO levels and a positive correlation between relative abundance of genus Akkermansia and TMAO levels was found in study subjects. Our findings proposes that RAO is associated with alterations in the gut  and with elevated TMAO levels, suggesting that RAO could be targeted by -altering interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638147>More arrows in the ancient DNA quiver: use of paleoepigenomes and paleomicrobiomes to investigate animal adaptation to environment.</a></h2><p>Whether and how epigenetic mechanisms and the  play a role in mammalian adaptation raised considerable attention and controversy, mainly because they have the potential to add new insights into the Modern Synthesis. Recent attempts to reconcile neo-Darwinism and neo-Lamarckism in a unified theory of molecular evolution give epigenetic mechanisms and  a prominent role. However, supporting empirical data is still largely missing. Because experimental studies using extant animals can hardly be done over evolutionary timescales, we propose that advances in ancient DNA techniques provide a valid alternative. In this piece, we evaluate: (1) the possible roles of epigenomes and microbiomes in animal adaptation; (2) advances in the retrieval of paleoepigenome and paleomicrobiome data using ancient DNA techniques; and (3) the plasticity of either and interactions between the epigenome and the , while emphasising that it is essential to take both into account, as well as the underlying genetic factors that may confound the findings. We propose that advanced ancient DNA techniques should be applied to a wide range of past animals, so novel dynamics in animal evolution and adaption can be revealed.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previous investigations have observed a higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in patients with GPA, and chronic nasal carriage has been linked with an increased risk of disease relapse. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated changes in the nasal  including a detailed analysis of Staphylococcus spp. by shotgun metagenomics in patients with active and inactive granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Shotgun metagenomic sequence data were also used to identify protein-encoding genes within the SEED database, and the abundance of proteins then correlated with the presence of bacterial species on an annotated heatmap.The presence of S. aureus in the nose as assessed by culture was more frequently detected in patients with active GPA (66.7%) compared with inactive GPA (34.1%). Beta diversity analysis of nasal  by bacterial 16S rRNA profiling revealed a different composition between GPA patients and healthy controls (P = 0.039). Beta diversity analysis of shotgun metagenomic sequence data for Staphylococcus spp. revealed a different composition between active GPA patients and healthy controls and disease controls (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0023, respectively), and between healthy controls and inactive GPA patients and household controls (P = 0.0168 and P = 0.0168, respectively). Patients with active GPA had a higher abundance of S. aureus, mirroring the culture data, while healthy controls had a higher abundance of S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, generally assumed to be a pathogen of cats and dogs, showed an abundance of 13% among the Staphylococcus spp. in our cohort. During long-term follow-up of patients with inactive GPA at baseline, a higher S. aureus abundance was not associated with an increased relapse risk. Functional analyses identified ten SEED protein subsystems that differed between the groups. Most significant associations were related to chorismate synthesis and involved in the vitamin B pathway.Our data revealed a distinct dysbiosis of the nasal  in GPA patients compared with disease and healthy controls. Metagenomic sequencing demonstrated that this dysbiosis in active GPA patients is manifested by increased abundance of S. aureus and a depletion of S. epidermidis, further demonstrating the antagonist relationships between these species. SEED functional protein subsystem analysis identified an association between the unique bacterial nasal  clusters seen mainly in GPA patients and an elevated abundance of genes associated with chorismate synthesis and vitamin B pathways. Further studies are required to further elucidate the relationship between the biosynthesis genes and the associated bacterial species.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657225>THE ROLE OF THE GUT  IN LIVER DISEASE.</a></h2><p>The gut  is the natural intestinal inhabitant that has been recognized recently as a major player in the maintenance of human health and the pathophysiology of many diseases. Those commensals produce metabolites that have various effects on host biologic functions. Therefore, alterations in the normal composition or diversity of  have been implicated in various diseases, including liver cirrhosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease concept provides potential underlying mechanisms for such associations, including intrauterine exposure to endogenous hormones (androgens and estrogens), insulin-like growth factors, etc. However, there is conflicting evidence on the association between birth parameters and the cancer mortality risk. Therefore, we aimed to review and analyse the available data on the association linking birth weight and birth length with cancer mortality. Eleven studies were identified, published until April 2019. A significant association between birth weight and the prognosis of cancer (overall) was found (relative risk, RR 1.06, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.01, 1.11), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 27.7%). In addition, higher birth weight was associated with poorer prognosis of prostate cancer (RR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.44). However, the association of birth weight with breast cancer mortality risk in women was not significant (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.44), which might be due to high statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 67.9%). Birth length was not associated with cancer mortality risk (RR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.90-1.11). It might be inferred that birth parameters are not associated with cancer mortality as strongly as with the risk of developing cancer. Also, the association between birth parameters and cancer mortality risk is not uniform and varies according to its subtypes, and study characteristics/design. This highlights the need for further prospective studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646062>Transmissible inflammation-induced colorectal cancer in inflammasome-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>The  is pivotal in orchestrating the pathogenesis of IBD-associated colorectal cancer (CRC).

Epidemiological studies have linked perinatal antibiotic exposure in human newborns to an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but if this effect is mediated by the gut-lung axis is unknown. To explore antibiotic disruption of the newborn gut-lung axis, we studied how perinatal maternal antibiotic exposure influenced lung injury in a hyperoxia-based mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We report that disruption of intestinal commensal colonization during the perinatal period promotes a more severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype characterized by increased mortality and pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, metagenomic shifts were associated with decreased IL-22 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage and were independent of hyperoxia-induced inflammasome activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unrecognized influence of the gut-lung axis during the development of neonatal lung injury, which could be leveraged to ameliorate the most severe and persistent pulmonary complication of preterm birth.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h2><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving lipid metabolism is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty acids in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut  in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Associations between the mycobiome and bacteriome in the piglet gut, in the context of weaning, remain unknown. Weaning is a time of significant stress, dietary changes, microbial alterations, and a predisposition to infection. The loss of animal health and growth makes potential microbial interventions of interest to the swine industry. Recent studies have demonstrated the diversity and development of the  in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of piglets during weaning, resulting from the dietary and physiological changes. Despite these advances, the role of the mycobiota in piglet health and its contribution to overall  development remains mostly unknown. In this study we investigated the bacteriome and the mycobiome after weaning in the GI tract organs and feces from 35-day old piglets. Following weaning, the α-diversity and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) counts of the bacteriome increased, proximally to distally, from the stomach to the feces along the GI tract, while the mycobiome α-diversity and ASV counts were highest in the porcine stomach. β-diversity analyses show distinct clusters based on organ type in the bacteriome and mycobiome, but dispersion remained relatively constant in the mycobiome between organ/fecal sites. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Epsilonbacteraeota were the most abundant bacterial phyla present in the GI tract and feces based on mean taxonomic composition with high variation of composition found in the stomach. In the mycobiome, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and the stomach mycobiome did not demonstrate the same high level of variation observed in the bacteriome. Potential interactions between genera were found in the lower piglet GI bacteriome and mycobiome with positive correlations found between the fungus, , and several bacterial species, including .  demonstrated negative correlations with the short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria , , and .

Here, we focus on the environmental influence of cohabitation on the gut  as well as whether these environmentally influenced microorganisms are associated with cardiometabolic and inflammatory burden. We perform this by investigating the gut  composition of various groups of related individuals including cohabitating monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, non-cohabitating MZ twin pairs and spouse pairs.A stronger correlation between alpha diversity was found in cohabitating MZ twins (45 pairs, r = 0.64, p = 2.21 × 10) than in non-cohabitating MZ twin pairs (121 pairs, r = 0.42, p = 1.35 × 10). Although the correlation of alpha diversity did not attain significance between spouse pairs (42 pairs, r = 0.23, p = 0.15), the correlation was still higher than those in the 209 unrelated pairs (r = - 0.015, p = 0.832). Bray-Curtis (BC) dissimilarity metrics showed cohabitating MZ twin pairs had the most similar gut  communities which were more similar than the BC values of non-cohabitating MZ twins (empirical p-value = 0.0103), cohabitating spouses (empirical p-value = 0.0194), and pairs of unrelated non-cohabitating individuals (empirical p-value< 0.00001). There was also a significant difference between the BC measures from the spouse pairs and those from the unrelated non-cohabitating individuals (empirical p-value< 0.00001). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated between the various groups of interest and the results indicate the presence of OTUs with an environmental influence and one OTU that appeared to demonstrate genetic influences. One of the OTUs (Otu0190) was observed to have a significant association with both the cardiometabolic and inflammatory burden scores (p's < 0.05).Through the comparison of the  contents of MZ twins with varying cohabitation status and spousal pairs, we showed evidence of environmentally influenced OTUs, one of which had a significant association with cardiometabolic and inflammatory burden scores.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657973>Inflammatory bowel diseases: interrelationships between dietary vitamin D, exposure to UV radiation and the faecal .</a></h2><p>: Environmental factors and an altered faecal  are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

Vitamin D, and to a lesser extent UVR, can modify the gastrointestinal  either directly, or through immune-mediated mechanisms and this may explain the effect on intestinal inflammation in animal models of IBD and some clinical studies. Thus, both vitamin D and UVR exposure can be considered potential "master regulators" of gastrointestinal immunity, fine-tuning the complex interaction between genetics, host immunity and the gut . Further research and increased understanding of environment-host interactions is essential to achieving the ultimate goal of preventing and curing IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652348>Nod-like receptors are critical for gut-brain axis signalling in mice.</a></h2><p>Nod-like receptors regulate cognition, anxiety, and HPA-axis activation Nod-like receptors regulate central and peripheral serotonergic biology Nod-like receptors are important for maintenance of GI physiology Intestinal epithelial cell expression of Nod1 receptors regulate behaviour ABSTRACT: Gut-brain axis signalling is critical for maintaining health and homeostasis. Stressful life events can impact gut-brain signalling, leading to altered mood, cognition and intestinal dysfunction. Here we identify nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptors (NLR), Nod1 and Nod2, as novel regulators for gut-brain signalling. NLR are innate immune pattern recognition receptors expressed in the gut and brain, important in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. We found that mice deficient in both Nod1 and Nod2 (NodDKO) demonstrate signs of stress-induced anxiety, cognitive impairment and depression in the context of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These deficits were coupled with impairments in the serotonergic pathway in the brain, decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and immature neurons, as well as reduced neural activation. In addition, NodDKO mice had increased GI permeability and altered serotonin signalling in the gut following exposure to acute stress. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, abrogated behavioral impairments and restored serotonin signalling. We also identified that intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of Nod1 (VilCre Nod1 ), but not Nod2, increased susceptibility to stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour and cognitive impairment following exposure to stress. Together these data suggest that intestinal epithelial NLR are novel modulators of gut-brain communication and may serve as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of gut-brain disorders.

Thirty-two conventional M. hyopneumoniae free piglets were randomly selected from six different litters at 3 weeks of age and were experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae at 8 weeks of age. Lung lesion scores (LS) were recorded 4 weeks post-inoculation (12 weeks of age) from piglet lungs at necropsy. Fecal bacterial community composition of piglets at 3, 8 and 12 weeks of age were targeted by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The LS ranged from 0.3 to 43% with an evident clustering of the scores observed in piglets within litters. There were significant differences in species richness and alpha diversity in fecal microbiomes among piglets within litters at different time points (p < 0.05). The dissimilarity matrices indicated that at 3 weeks of age, the fecal  of piglets was more dissimilar compared to those from 8 to 12 weeks of age. Specific groups of bacteria in the gut that might predict the decreased severity of M. hyopneumoniae associated lesions were identified. The microbial shift at 3 weeks of age was observed to be driven by the increase in abundance of the indicator family, Ruminococcaceae in piglets with low LS (p < 0.05). The taxa, Ruminococcus_2 having the highest richness scores, correlated significantly between litters showing stronger associations with the lowest LS (r = -0.49, p = 0.005).

NP type, dose, and the presence or absence of minerals was shown to result in altered mineral transporter, BBM functional, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Metal oxide NP also altered the abundance of intestinal bacterial populations. Overall, the data suggest that the in vivo results align with in vitro studies, and that NP have the potential to negatively affect intestinal functionality and health.Copyright © 2019.

Thirty-two mice were divided into normal (N), Prozac (NP), lard (L) and fish oil (F) groups. After a 12-week dietary intervention, the open field test (OFT) and the forced swim test (FST) were conducted before sacrifice. The mice in the L group exhibited anxiety-like behaviours in the OFT and depressive-like behaviours in the FST. A significant difference was observed in β-diversity indices between the L group and the F group. The abundance of  and  was significantly higher in the F group than in the L and N groups. The prefrontal cortex fatty acid composition was altered in various lipid-treated groups and was highly correlated with depressive-like behaviours.

To study underlying biological mechanisms and factors that influence the intestinal  development, longitudinal data from flocks and individual birds is needed. However, post-mortem collection of samples hampers longitudinal data collection. In this study, invasively collected cecal and ileal content, cloacal swabs collected from the same bird, and boot sock samples and cecal droppings from the litter of the broilers' poultry house, were collected on days 0, 2, 7, 14 and 35 post-hatch. The different sample types were evaluated on their applicability and reliability to characterize the broiler intestinal . The  of 247 samples was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analyses of α and β measures showed a similar development of  composition of cecal droppings compared to cecal content. Furthermore, the composition of cecal content samples was comparable to that of the boot socks until day 14 post-hatch. This study shows that the value of non-invasive sample types varies at different ages and depends on the goal of the  characterization. Specifically, cecal droppings and boot socks may be useful alternatives for cecal samples to determine intestinal  composition longitudinally.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659035>Global imprint of mycorrhizal fungi on whole-plant nutrient economics.</a></h2><p>Mycorrhizal fungi are critical members of the plant , forming a symbiosis with the roots of most plants on Earth. Most plant species partner with either arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi, and these symbioses are thought to represent plant adaptations to fast and slow soil nutrient cycling rates. This generates a second hypothesis, that arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal plant species traits complement and reinforce these fungal strategies, resulting in nutrient acquisitive vs. conservative plant trait profiles. Here we analyzed 17,764 species level trait observations from 2,940 woody plant species to show that mycorrhizal plants differ systematically in nitrogen and phosphorus economic traits. Differences were clearest in temperate latitudes, where ectomycorrhizal plant species are more nitrogen use- and phosphorus use-conservative than arbuscular mycorrhizal species. This difference is reflected in both aboveground and belowground plant traits and is robust to controlling for evolutionary history, nitrogen fixation ability, deciduousness, latitude, and species climate niche. Furthermore, mycorrhizal effects are large and frequently similar to or greater in magnitude than the influence of plant nitrogen fixation ability or deciduous vs. evergreen leaf habit. Ectomycorrhizal plants are also more nitrogen conservative than arbuscular plants in boreal and tropical ecosystems, although differences in phosphorus use are less apparent outside temperate latitudes. Our findings bolster current theories of ecosystems rooted in mycorrhizal ecology and support the hypothesis that plant mycorrhizal association is linked to the evolution of plant nutrient economic strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647551>Host specificity in diatom-bacteria interactions alleviates antagonistic effects.</a></h2><p>While different microalgae tend to be associated with different bacteria, it remains unclear if such specific associations are beneficial for the microalgae. We assessed the impact of bacterial isolates, derived from various marine benthic diatoms, on the growth of several strains belonging to the Cylindrotheca closterium diatom species complex. We first tested the effect of thirty-five different bacterial isolates on the growth of a single C. closterium strain, and then evaluated the impact of eight of these isolates on the growth of six C. closterium strains and one C. fusiformis strain. Surprisingly, most interactions were neutral to antagonistic. The interactions were highly specific, with diatom growth in the presence of specific bacteria differing between Cylindrotheca strains and species, and closely related bacteria eliciting contrasting diatom growth responses. These differences could be related to the origin of the bacterial isolates, as only isolates from foreign diatom hosts significantly reduced diatom growth, implying coadaptation between different Cylindrotheca strains and their associated bacteria. Interestingly, the antagonistic effect of a Marinobacter strain was alleviated by the presence of microbial inocula that was native to the diatom host, suggesting that coadapted bacteria might also benefit their host indirectly by preventing the establishment of harmful bacteria.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652955>An Association of Gut  with Different Phenotypes in Chinese Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.</a></h2><p>We aimed to investigate the association of gut  with disease activity, inflammatory parameters, and auto-antibodies profile in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Using a novel gnotobiotic hyperoxia chamberGF and NGF mice were exposed to either normoxia or hyperoxia. Alveolar morphometry, pulmonary mechanics, echocardiograms, inflammatory markers and measures of pulmonary hypertension were studied. GF and NGF mice in normoxiashowed no difference whereas GF mice in hyperoxia showed protected lung structure and mechanics and decreased markers of inflammation compared to NGF mice. Compared to NGF mice, GF mice lungs show relatively protected lung structure and better function in hyperoxic conditions.

Two of the four rhinoceros species in human care, Sumatran rhinoceros () and black rhinoceros (), are susceptible, whereas the other two, white rhinoceros () and greater one-horned (GOH) rhinoceros (), are relatively resistant to IOD. Complex interrelationships exist between mammalian hosts, their indigenous gut , metabolome, physical condition, and iron availability. The goal of this study was to gain insight into these relationships within the family Rhinocerotidae. Specific objectives were to (1) characterize the gut  and metabolome of four rhinoceros species; (2) compare the  and metabolome of IOD-susceptible and IOD-resistant rhinoceros species; and (3) identify variation in the  and metabolome associated with compromised health or disease in IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses. Fecal samples were collected from 31 rhinoceroses (Sumatran rhinoceros,  = 3; black rhinoceros,  = 6; GOH rhinoceros,  = 9; white rhinoceros,  = 13) located at five facilities, and matched fecal aliquots were processed for  and metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Despite the phylogenetic disparity and dissimilar zoo diets of the hosts, the structure of the fecal  of the two IOD-susceptible rhinoceros species were more closely related to each other than to those of the two IOD-resistant species (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; IOD-susceptible vs. IOD-resistant -value < 0.001). In addition, IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses exhibited less microbial diversity than their IOD-resistant relatives (Shannon diversity; -value < 0.001) which could have health implications. Of note, the black rhinoceros was distinct among the four rhinoceros species with the most divergent fecal metabolome; interestingly, it contained higher concentrations of short chain fatty acids. Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in microbial community composition ( = 0.253 and 0.488, respectively) or fecal metabolomic profile ( = 0.634 and 0.332, respectively). Differences in the distal gut microbiomes between IOD-resistant and IOD-susceptible rhinoceroses support hypotheses that gut microbes play a role in host iron acquisition, and further studies and experiments to test these hypotheses are warranted.Copyright © 2019 Roth, Switzer, Watanabe-Chailland, Bik, Relman, Romick-Rosendale and Ollberding.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650414>Effects of the Probiotic Candidate E. faecalis-1, the Poulvac E. coli Vaccine, and their Combination on Growth Performance, Caecal Microbial Composition, Immune Response, and Protection against E. coli O78 Challenge in Broiler Chickens.</a></h2><p>The present study was performed on 180-day-old commercial Cobb chicks to assess the effects of the probiotic candidate Enterococcus faecalis-1, the Poulvac Escherichia coli vaccine, and their combination on growth parameters, intestinal microbial composition, immune response, and protection against challenge with the avian pathogen E. coli O78.

The composition of the mosquitoes'  plays a role in P. falciparum transmission, so we studied midgut bacterial communities of An. gambiae s.l from Burkina Faso. DNA was extracted from 17 pools of midgut of mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae complex from six localities in three climatic areas, including cotton-growing and cotton-free localities to include potential differences in insecticide selection pressure. The v3-v4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted and sequenced using Illumina Miseq (2 × 250 nt). Diversity analysis was performed using QIIME and R software programs. The major bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria (97.2%) in all samples. The most abundant genera were Enterobacter (32.8%) and Aeromonas (29.8%), followed by Pseudomonas (11.8%), Acinetobacter (5.9%) and Thorsellia (2.2%). No statistical difference in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found (Kruskal-Wallis FDR-p > 0.05) among the different areas, fields or localities. Richness and diversity indexes (observed OTUs, Chao1, Simpson and Shannon indexes) showed significant differences in the cotton-growing fields and in the agroclimatic zones, mainly in the Sudano-Sahelian area. OTUs from seven bacterial species that mediate refractoriness to Plasmodium infection in An. gambiae s.l were detected. The beta diversity analysis did not show any significant difference. Therefore, a same control strategy of using bacterial species refractoriness to Plasmodium to target mosquito midgut bacterial community and affect their fitness in malaria transmission may be valuable tool for future malaria control efforts in Burkina Faso.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655168>Sepsis roadmap: What we know, what we learned, and where we are going.</a></h2><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition originating as a result of systemic blood infection causing, one or more organ damage due to the dysregulation of the immune response.

We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with metabolic syndrome were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC. In the WGC and RC groups combined, adiponectin concentrations significantly increased after 12-week intervention, and are directly associated with plasma SCFAs and acetate.

Scientific research has established that oats can improve diet quality, reduce cholesterol, regulate satiety, and protect against carcinogenesis in the colon; however, determining the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health and the gut  is a newer, evolving area of research. To better understand the effects of oats on gastrointestinal health in humans, a literature review with predefined search criteria was conducted using the PubMed database and keywords for common gastrointestinal health outcomes. Moreover, to examine the gastrointestinal effects of oats across the scientific spectrum, a similar search strategy was executed to identify animal studies. In vitro studies were identified from the reference lists of human and animal studies. A total of 8 human studies, 19 animal studies, and 5 in vitro studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence in humans shows beneficial effects of oats on gastrointestinal health, with supportive evidence provided by in vitro and animal studies. The effective dose of oats varies by type, although an amount providing 2.5 to 2.9 g of β-glucan per day was shown to decrease fecal pH and alter fecal bacteria. For oat bran, 40 to 100 g/d was shown to increase fecal bacterial mass and short-chain fatty acids in humans. Differences in study design, methodology, and type of oats tested make valid comparisons difficult. The identification of best practices for the design of oat studies should be a priority in future research, as the findings will be useful for determining how oats influence specific indices of gastrointestinal health, including the composition of the human gut .© The Author(s) 2019.

Recent studies provided strong evidence that autophagy plays a key role in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD). Probiotics may exhibit many therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory abilities. While successful results have been obtained in ulcerative colitis patients, probiotics remain inefficient in CD for unknown reason. It remains therefore important to better understand their molecular mechanisms of action.The activation of autophagy was examined by stimulating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by the bacteria, followed by confocal microscopy and western blot analysis. The impact of blocking in vitro autophagy was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using 3-methyl adenine or bafilomycin followed by cytokine secretion measurement by ELISA. The role of autophagy in the anti-inflammatory capacities of the bacterial strains was evaluated in vivo using an acute trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis. The impact of BMDC was evaluated by adoptive transfer, notably using bone marrow cells derived from autophagy-related 16-like 1-deficient mice.We showed that selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are able to induce autophagy activation in BMDCs. Blocking in vitro autophagy abolished the capacity of the strains to induce the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, while it exacerbated the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β. We confirmed in the TNBS-induced mouse model of colitis that autophagy is involved in the protective capacity of these selected strains, and showed that dendritic cells are involved in this process.We propose autophagy as a novel mechanism involved in the regulatory capacities of probiotics.© Copyright by the Author(s).

This condition is accompanied by an extensive series of relatively serious neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of PANS is made by "exclusion", as the individual PANS symptoms overlap with a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Several researchers accumulated evidence to support the hypothesis that PANS was closely associated with a variety of infections. In the last decade, metabolomics played an essential role in improving the knowledge of complex biological systems and identifying potential new biomarkers, as indicators of pathological progressions, or pharmacologic responses to therapy. The metabolome is considered the most predictive phenotype, capable to catch epigenetic differences, reflecting more closely the clinical reality at any given moment and thus providing extremely dynamic data. In the present work, we review the most recent hypothesis and suggested mechanisms of this condition and describe the case of a 10 year -year-old girl with PANS, before and after clarithromycin treatment. The main results of this case report are discussed from a metabolomics point of view. The alteration of several metabolic pathways concerning the microbial activity highlights the possible role of the  in the development of PANS. Furthermore, different metabolic perturbations at the level of the protein biosynthesis, energy and amino acid metabolisms were observed and discussed. Based on our observations, we believe that metabolomics is a promising technology to unravel the mysteries of PANS in the near future.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642342>Gut  and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; are they related?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640780>Immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation has clinical impact in DLBCL and potential implications for immune checkpoint blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</a></h2><p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) harbors somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable region genes, IGHV and IGK/LV. Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM creates neoantigens that activate T-cell responses against B-cell lymphoma.To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy, we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens' immunogenicity potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of T cell-exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, , and pathogen databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry.SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHM) were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHM groups harbored more potentially immune-stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1 expression in CD8 T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHM than in SHM patients with activated B-cell-like DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4 T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV SHM than in SHM patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV SHM and ongoing SHM.These results show for the first time that IGV SHM and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654911>Harnessing the  to control plant parasitic weeds.</a></h2><p>Microbiomes can significantly expand the genomic potential of plants, contributing to nutrient acquisition, plant growth promotion and tolerance to (a)biotic stresses. Among biotic stressors, root parasitic weeds (RPWs), mainly of the genera Orobanche, Phelipanche and Striga, are major yield-limiting factors of a wide range of staple crops, particularly in developing countries. Here, we provide a conceptual synthesis of putative mechanisms by which soil and plant microbiomes could be harnessed to control RPWs. These mechanisms are partitioned in direct and indirect modes of action and discussed in the context of past and present studies on microbe-mediated suppression of RPWs. Specific emphasis is given to the large but yet unexplored potential of root-associated microorganisms to interfere with the chemical signalling cascade between the host plant and the RPWs. We further provide concepts and ideas for future research directions and prospective designs of novel control strategies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Bioaugmentation has been proposed for the biodegradation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (DCC) and carbanilide (NCC) in soil. The isolated TCC-degrading strain Ochrobactrum sp. TCC-2 and chloroanilines-degrading strain Diaphorobacter sp. LD72 were used to study the removal efficiency of TCC, DCC and NCC mixture and their chloroanilines intermediates, respectively. The potential degradation competition between TCC and its dechlorinated congeners, and the response of bacterial community during the bioremediation were also investigated. The biodegradation of DCC and TCC was significantly enhanced for soil with inoculums compared with sterilized and natural soils. Chloroanilines products could also be effectively removed. For the degradation of combined substrates in the aqueous medium, NCC had negative effect on the degradation of TCC and DCC, while TCC and DCC negatively influenced each other. The bioaugmentation with two degraders obviously changed the phylogenetic composition and function of indigenous soil . Importantly, the inoculated degraders could be maintained, suggesting their adaptability and potential application in bioaugmentation for such recalcitrant contaminants. This study offers new insights into the enhanced bioremediation of TCC and its dechlorinated congeners contaminated soils by the bioaugmentation of functional degraders and the structure and function response of the indigenous soil  to the bioremediation process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Selective enrichment of microbial consortia was done using the glycerol-based medium at initial stage, followed by purification to isolated colonies, after positive HPLC detection of 1,3-PDO in the fermentation broth. When the purified isolated were re-tested for 1,3-PDO production, only two isolates namely Isolate 1 and 3 were capable of producing the targeted product preferably under anaerobic conditions. On account of better 1,3-PDO fermentation efficiency (Isolate 3, 22% vs Isolate 1, 4.48%) and acetic acid as the only major by-product, Isolate 3 was shortlisted for further studies. A dye based technique was devised in which bromothymol blue was incorporated in the medium to monitor the pH drop due to acetic acid formation and hence change in color. Visual change in color helped in intermittent pH restoration. During fermentation, with pH stat being 8-8.5, Isolate 3 at 32°C yielded 0.67 mol mol 1,3-PDO within a short span of 12 h only with an initial concentration of glycerol being 20 g L . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Isolate 3 shared 95.8% homology with C. freundii CFNIH1 and hence designated as Citrobacter freundii IIP DR3.The present study demonstrated that during bioprospecting glycerol assimilating , dye-based technique can be successfully employed. This technique can further be exploited to monitor consistent production of all microbial secondary metabolites that accompanies acid production.Incorporation of "Bromothymol blue" can visually help in the identification of pH drop in the medium, so that pH stat can be easily maintained during 1,3-PDO production from glycerol especially under shake flask conditions.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652812>Introducing Murine  Database (MMDB): A Curated Database with Taxonomic Profiling of the Healthy Mouse Gastrointestinal .</a></h2><p>The gut  modulates overall metabolism, the immune system and brain development of the host.

We include studies on physical activity and exercise, sedentary time, nutrition, behavioral therapy and the role of schools.Several small studies in children with asthma suggest that exercise interventions can improve aerobic fitness, asthma symptoms or control and quality of life. Existing evidence supports recommending higher intake of fruits and vegetables for asthma risk and control. In contrast, the 'Western diet' - high in refined grains, highly processed foods, red meats and fried foods with low intake of fruits and vegetables - has a proinflammatory effect and may alter  composition leading to worse asthma outcomes. Finally, there are opportunities to utilize schools to promote physical activity, though standardization of asthma management in the schools is needed.Assessing physical activity/fitness levels, sedentary time and nutritional status is important in the management of children with asthma, as they are modifiable factors. Larger rigorous studies evaluating lifestyle interventions are needed to better inform current asthma guidelines as well as to understand the underlying mechanism(s) related to physical activity and diet in asthma.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640184>Gut DNA Virome Diversity and Its Association with Host Bacteria Regulate Inflammatory Phenotype and Neuronal Immunotoxicity in Experimental Gulf War Illness.</a></h2><p>Gulf War illness (GWI) is characterized by the persistence of inflammatory bowel disease, chronic fatigue, neuroinflammation, headache, cognitive impairment, and other medically unexplained conditions. Results using a murine model show that enteric viral populations especially bacteriophages were altered in GWI. The increased viral richness and alpha diversity correlated positively with gut bacterial dysbiosis and proinflammatory cytokines. Altered virome signature in GWI mice also had a concomitant weakening of intestinal epithelial tight junctions with a significant increase in Claudin-2 protein expression and decrease in ZO1 and Occludin mRNA expression. The altered virome signature in GWI, decreased tight junction protein level was followed by the presence an activation of innate immune responses such as increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. The altered virome diversity had a positive correlation with serum IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, intestinal inflammation (IFN-γ), and decreased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurogenesis marker. The co-exposure of Gulf War chemical and antibiotic (for gut sterility) or Gulf War chemical and Ribavirin, an antiviral compound to suppress virus alteration in the gut showed significant improvement in epithelial tight junction protein, decreased intestinal-, systemic-, and neuroinflammation.

However, our understanding of the changes induced by TP on MO challenged layers performances and oxidative status, and on the , remains limited. The aim of the present study was to better understand host (performances and redox balance) and  responses in MO-challenged layers with dietary TP. In this study, 200 Lohmann laying hens (65-week-old) were randomly allocated in a 2 × 2 factorial design to receive a diet with or without MO (0 or 100 mg/kg), and supplemented with either 0 or 600 mg/kg TP. The results indicate that 100 mg/kg MO decreased egg production ( = 0.03), while dietary TP increased egg production in MO challenged layers ( < 0.01). Egg yolk color was decreased by high MO ( < 0.01), while dietary TP had no effect on yolk color ( > 0.05). Serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration were increased by high MO, while total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity, glutathione s-transferase (GSH-ST), and glutathione concentration in serum were decreased ( < 0.05). Dietary TP was able to reverse the increasing effect of MO on ALT and AST ( < 0.05). High MO resulted in higher MO levels in serum, liver, kidney, and egg, but it decreased Cu and Se content in serum, liver, and egg ( < 0.05). The Fe concentration in liver, kidney, and eggs was significantly lower in MO supplementation groups ( < 0.05). High MO levels in the diet led to lower  and higher  abundance, whereas dietary TP alone and/or in high MO treatment increased the  abundance and the  ratio at phylum level. High MO increased the abundance of  (phylum),  (class),  (order), and  (family), whereas dietary TP promoted the enrichment of  (species). Dietary TP also enhanced the enrichment of  (class),  (order),  (family), and  (species).  analysis revealed differentially enriched microbial compositions in the cecum caused by MO and TP, which might be responsible for the protective effect of dietary TP during a MO challenge.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659416>Kynurenic acid and cancer: facts and controversies.</a></h2><p>Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous tryptophan metabolite exerting neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties in the brain. However, its importance on the periphery is still not fully elucidated. KYNA is produced endogenously in various types of peripheral cells, tissues and by gastrointestinal . Furthermore, it was found in several products of daily human diet and its absorption in the digestive tract was evidenced. More recent studies were focused on the potential role of KYNA in carcinogenesis and cancer therapy; however, the results were ambiguous and the biological activity of KYNA in these processes has not been unequivocally established. This review aims to summarize the current views on the relationship between KYNA and cancer. The differences in KYNA concentration between physiological conditions and cancer, as well as KYNA production by both normal and cancer cells, will be discussed.

Although it is known that increased synthetic fertilizer input in Chinese farmlands over the past 50 years has resulted in not only increased yields but also environmental problems, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how crops under elevated nutrient input shape root-associated microbial communities, especially through adjusting the quantities and compositions of root metabolites and exudates.The compositions of bacterial and fungal communities from the roots and rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under four levels of long-term inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilization were characterized at the tillering, jointing and ripening stages. The root-released organic carbon (ROC), organic acids in the root exudates and soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil active carbon (SAC) in the rhizosphere were quantified.ROC levels varied dramatically across wheat growth stages and correlated more with the bacterial community than with the fungal community. Rhizosphere SOC and SAC levels were elevated by long-term N fertilization but varied only slightly across growth stages. Variation in the microbial community structure across plant growth stages showed a decreasing trend with N fertilization level in the rhizosphere. In addition, more bacterial and fungal genera were significantly correlated in the jointing and ripening stages than in the tillering stage in the root samples. A number of bacterial genera that shifted in response to N fertilization, including Arthrobacter, Bacillus and Devosia, correlated significantly with acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid levels.Our results indicate that both plant growth status and N input drive changes in the microbial community structure in the root zone of wheat. Plant growth stage demostrated a stronger influence on bacterial than on fungal community composition. A number of bacterial genera that have been described as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) responded positively to N fertilization, and their abundance correlated significantly with the organic acid level, suggesting that the secretion of organic acids may be a strategy developed by plants to recruit beneficial microbes in the root zone to cope with high N input. These results provide novel insight into the associations among increased N input, altered carbon availability, and shifts in microbial communities in the plant roots and rhizosphere of intensive agricultural ecosystems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640224>Probiotics in Adolescent Prediabetes: A Pilot RCT on Glycemic Control and Intestinal Bacteriome.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis of intestinal ecology could be implicated in prediabetes. The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to collect preliminary data on the effects of probiotic supplementation (Vivomixx©) on markers of glucose metabolism, intestinal  composition, and intestinal health indices, of prediabetic adolescents. The intervention group was administered probiotic sachets twice daily for 4 months, while both intervention and control groups received weekly consultation sessions for a healthier lifestyle. Thirty-two participants were recruited (1.3 participants per month) and were randomized (16 in control and 16 in intervention group). Fifteen of them signed the inform consent and never entered the study (6 in control and 9 in intervention group). Thus, seventeen participants completed the study (10 in control and 7 in intervention group), with no serious adverse events. After the 4-month intervention, no difference was observed in the markers of glycemic control between the two groups, although a minor effect was observed for fasting glucose at 1-month, probably due to the initial higher adherence to the probiotic supplements. Modifications of the protocol procedures are warranted because of the high attrition rates and suboptimal compliance that were noted. Future studies and further RCTs with larger samples need to be conducted to fully elucidate the potential effects of probiotics in the glycemic control of prediabetic adolescents.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661201>The Convergence of Infectious Diseases and Noncommunicable Diseases: Proceedings of a Workshop.</a></h2><p>On June 11 and June 12, 2019, the National Academies convened a workshop to explore the growing understanding of how the interplay between humans and microbes affects host physiology and causes noncommunicable diseases.

However, the relative importance of these processes in shaping riverine microeukaryotic biogeography is still poorly understood. Here, we compared the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic community using high-throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA gene and multivariate statistical analyses from a subtropical river during wet and dry seasons.Our results provide the first description of biogeographical patterns of microeukaryotic communities in the Tingjiang River, the largest river in the west of Fujian province, southeastern China. The results showed that microeukaryotes from both wet and dry seasons exhibited contrasting community compositions, which might be owing to planktonic microeukaryotes having seasonal succession patterns. Further, all components of the microeukaryotic communities (including total, dominant, always rare, and conditionally rare taxa) exhibited a significant distance-decay pattern in both seasons, and these communities had a stronger distance-decay relationship during the dry season, especially for the conditionally rare taxa. Although several variables had a significant influence on the microeukaryotic communities, the environmental and spatial factors showed minor roles in shaping the communities. Importantly, these microeukaryotic communities were strongly driven by stochastic processes, with 89.9%, 88.5%, and 89.6% of the community variation explained by neutral community model during wet, dry, and both seasons, respectively. The neutral community model also explained a large fraction of the community variation across different taxonomic groups and levels. Additionally, the microeukaryotic taxa, which were above and below the neutral prediction, were ecologically and taxonomically distinct groups, which might be interactively structured by deterministic and stochastic processes.This study demonstrated that stochastic processes are sufficient in shaping substantial variation in river microeukaryotic metacommunity across different hydrographic regimes, thereby providing a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns, processes, and mechanisms of microeukaryotic community in waters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649943>Endodontic  of Fractured Non-vital Teeth in Dogs Determined by 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing.</a></h2><p>Dental fractures resulting in pulp exposure will lead to an endodontic infection with microbes from the oral cavity.

However, chronic TMP use drives development of antibiotic resistance (increasing likelihood of subsequent infections) and disrupts the gut  (linked to autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases), tempering translational excitement of this approach in model systems and for treating human diseases. Herein, we identified a TMP-based, non-antibiotic small molecule, termed 14a (MCC8529), and tested its ability to control multiple DHFR-based reporters and signaling proteins. We found that 14a is non-toxic and can effectively stabilize DHFR DDs expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, 14a crosses the blood-retinal barrier and stabilizes DHFR DDs expressed in the mouse eye with kinetics comparable to that of TMP (≤6 h). Surprisingly, 14a stabilized a DHFR DD in the liver significantly better than TMP did, while having no effect on the mouse gut . Our results suggest that alternative small-molecule DHFR DD stabilizers (such as 14a) may be ideal substitutes for TMP in instances when conditional, non-antibiotic control of protein abundance is desired in the eye and beyond.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659215>Metabolism of the predominant human milk oligosaccharide fucosyllactose by an infant gut commensal.</a></h2><p>A number of bifidobacterial species are found at a particularly high prevalence and abundance in faecal samples of healthy breastfed infants, a phenomenon that is believed to be, at least partially, due to the ability of bifidobacteria to metabolize Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs). In the current study, we isolated a novel strain of Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense, named APCKJ1, from the faeces of a four-week old breastfed infant, based on the ability of the strain to utilise the HMO component fucosyllactose. We then determined the full genome sequence of this strain, and employed the generated data to analyze fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1. Transcriptomic and growth analyses, combined with metabolite analysis, in vitro hydrolysis assays and heterologous expression, allowed us to elucidate the pathway for fucosyllactose metabolism in B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1.

These microbial communities and their associated genes - collectively termed the root  - are diverse and have been shown to play an important role in conferring abiotic stress tolerance to their plant hosts. In light of growing concerns over the threat of water and nutrient stress facing terrestrial ecosystems, especially those used for agricultural production, increased emphasis has been placed on understanding how abiotic stress conditions influence the composition and functioning of the root  and the ultimate consequences for plant health. However, the composition of the root  under abiotic stress conditions will not only reflect shifts in the greater bulk soil microbial community from which plants recruit their root  but also plant responses to abiotic stress, which include changes in root exudate profiles and morphology. Exploring the relative contributions of these direct and plant-mediated effects on the root  has been the focus of many studies in recent years. Here, we review the impacts of abiotic stress affecting terrestrial ecosystems, specifically flooding, drought, and changes in nitrogen and phosphorus availability, on bulk soil microbial communities and plants that interact to ultimately shape the root . We conclude with a perspective outlining possible directions for future research needed to advance our understanding of the complex molecular and biochemical interactions between soil, plants, and microbes that ultimately determine the composition of the root  under abiotic stress.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653062>Microbial Metabolites Determine Host Health and the Status of Some Diseases.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a highly complex organ composed of the intestinal epithelium layer, intestinal , and local immune system. Intestinal  residing in the GI tract engages in a mutualistic relationship with the host. Different sections of the GI tract contain distinct proportions of the intestinal , resulting in the presence of unique bacterial products in each GI section. The intestinal  converts ingested nutrients into metabolites that target either the intestinal  population or host cells. Metabolites act as messengers of information between the intestinal  and host cells. The intestinal  composition and resulting metabolites thus impact host development, health, and pathogenesis. Many recent studies have focused on modulation of the gut  and their metabolites to improve host health and prevent or treat diseases. In this review, we focus on the production of microbial metabolites, their biological impact on the intestinal  composition and host cells, and the effect of microbial metabolites that contribute to improvements in inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic diseases.

Studies on the prevalence of Blastocystis in HIV-positive patients are limited and dated.A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 156 HIV-positive patients to evaluate the prevalence of Blastocystis-subtypes by molecular amplification and sequencing the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA), to identify the risk factors for its transmission, to examine the relationship between the presence of the protist and gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, the evaluation of the faecal calprotectin by immunoassay from a sample of subjects was performed to evaluate the gut inflammation in Blastocystis-carriers.Blastocystis-subtypes ST1, ST2, ST3, ST4 were identified in 39 HIV-positive patients (25%). No correlation was found between the presence of the protist and virological or epidemiological risk factors. Blastocystis was more frequently detected in homosexual subjects (p = 0.037) infected by other enteric protozoa (p = 0.0001) and with flatulence (p = 0.024). No significant differences in calprotectin level was found between Blastocystis-carriers and free ones.Blastocystis is quite common in HIV-positive patients on ART showing in examined patients 25% prevalence.

Despite its prevalence, studies on the microbiology of halitosis are rare in Nigeria. This study determines the presence of five putative periodontal pathogens viz: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola on the tongue dorsa of halitosis and non-halitosis patients using a 16S rDNA-directed polymerase chain reaction assay. Furthermore, an association of these bacteria with oral malodour [as assessed by volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) measurements] with a portable sulphide monitor, the Halimeter (Interscan Corp, Chatsworth, California), was performed. The results showed that the prevalence of halitosis in this environment as defined by VSC level above 160 ppb is 14.9%. Halitosis is affected by gender with males having it more than the females. Males also tend to present more with self-reported complaints of halitosis than females. Age does not appear to contribute to the incidence of halitosis. Fusobacterium nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia are responsible for increased production of VSCs in halitosis patients while A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. denticola appear to play no part in the production of VSCs. Evaluation of halitogenic bacteria and VSCs may potentially become a surrogate biomarker for monitoring halitosis. Targeted assessment of putative halitogenic bacteria may provide a rapid point-of-care diagnostic tool for halitosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645370>Regulations of bile acid metabolism in mouse models with hydrophobic bile acid composition.</a></h2><p>The bile acid (BA) composition in mice is substantially different from that in humans. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic acids (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut  converts the primary BAs cholic acid and CDCA into deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA metabolism under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641089>The  Promotes Arterial Thrombosis in Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Deficient Mice.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerotic plaque development depends on chronic inflammation of the arterial wall. A dysbiotic gut  can cause low-grade inflammation, and  composition was linked to cardiovascular disease risk. However, the role of this environmental factor in atherothrombosis remains undefined. To analyze the impact of gut  on atherothrombosis, we rederived low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient ( ) mice as germfree (GF) and kept these mice for 16 weeks on an atherogenic high-fat Western diet (HFD) under GF isolator conditions and under conventionally raised specific-pathogen-free conditions (CONV-R). In spite of reduced diversity of the cecal gut , caused by atherogenic HFD, GF  mice and CONV-R  mice exhibited atherosclerotic lesions of comparable sizes in the common carotid artery. In contrast to HFD-fed mice, showing no difference in total cholesterol levels, CONV-R  mice fed control diet (CD) had significantly reduced total plasma cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and LDL levels compared with GF  mice. Myeloid cell counts in blood as well as leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall at the common carotid artery of GF  mice on HFD were diminished compared to CONV-R  controls. Plasma cytokine profiling revealed reduced levels of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL7 and CXCL1 in GF  mice, whereas the T-cell-related interleukin 9 (IL-9) and IL-27 were elevated. In the atherothrombosis model of ultrasound-induced rupture of the common carotid artery plaque, thrombus area was significantly reduced in GF  mice relative to CONV-R  mice. , this atherothrombotic phenotype was explained by decreased adhesion-dependent platelet activation and thrombus growth of HFD-fed GF  mice on type III collagen. Our results demonstrate a functional role for the commensal  in atherothrombosis. In a ferric chloride injury model of the carotid artery, GF C57BL/6J mice had increased occlusion times compared to colonized controls. Interestingly, in late atherosclerosis, HFD-fed GF  mice had reduced plaque rupture-induced thrombus growth in the carotid artery and diminished  thrombus formation under arterial flow conditions.Copyright © 2019 Kiouptsi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660906>Prenatal pet keeping and caregiver-reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder through preadolescence in a United States birth cohort.</a></h2><p>While the keeping of pets has been shown to protect against childhood allergic disease and obesity, less is known regarding potential associations of prenatal pet keeping and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We sought to examine the associations between prenatal dog or cat keeping with caregiver-reported ADHD in preadolescents in the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS) birth cohort (N = 1258).At an interview with the caregiver at child age 10-12 years, caregivers reported if the WHEALS child had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. Similarly, during an interview with the mother prenatally, pet keeping (defined as dog or cat kept inside ≥1 h/day) was ascertained. Logistic regression models were fit to examine the association of prenatal pet keeping (dog keeping and cat keeping, separately) with ADHD.A subset of 627 children were included in the analyses: 93 who had ADHD and 534 with neurotypical development. After accounting for confounders and loss to follow-up, maternal prenatal dog exposure was associated with 2.23 times (95% CI: 1.15, 4.31; p = 0.017) greater odds of ADHD among boys. Prenatal dog keeping was not statistically significantly associated with ADHD in girls (odds ratio = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.12; p = 0.070). Prenatal cat keeping was not associated with ADHD.In boys, but not girls, maternal prenatal dog keeping was positively associated with ADHD.

Here, we show that the development of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells relies on a specific temporal window, after which MAIT cell development is permanently impaired. This imprinting depends on early-life exposure to defined microbes that synthesize riboflavin-derived antigens. In adults, cutaneous MAIT cells are a dominant population of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-producing lymphocytes, which display a distinct transcriptional signature and can subsequently respond to skin commensals in an IL-1-, IL-18-, and antigen-dependent manner. Consequently, local activation of cutaneous MAIT cells promotes wound healing. Together, our work uncovers a privileged interaction between defined members of the  and MAIT cells, which sequentially controls both tissue-imprinting and subsequent responses to injury.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

These interactions take place in a highly complex chemical landscape, the intestinal eco-active chemosphere, composed of chemical substances that positively or negatively influence bacterial growth, including those originated from nutrient uptake, and those produced by the action of the human or animal host and the intestinal . The contribution of bacteria results from their effect on the host generated molecules, on food and digested food, and organic substances from microbial origin, including from bacterial degradation. Here, we comprehensively review the main chemical substances present in the human intestinal chemosphere, particularly of those having inhibitory effects on microorganisms. With this background, and focusing on , the most relevant human pathogens from the intestinal , the microcin's history and classification, mechanisms of action, and mechanisms involved in microcin's immunity (in microcin producers) and resistance (non-producers) are reviewed. Products from the chemosphere likely modulate the ecological effects of microcin activity. Several cross-resistance mechanisms are shared by microcins, colicins, bacteriophages, and some conventional antibiotics, which are expected to produce cross-effects. Double-microcin-producing strains (such as microcins MccM and MccH47) have been successfully used for decades in the control of pathogenic gut organisms. Microcins are associated with successful gut colonization, facilitating translocation and invasion, leading to bacteremia, and urinary tract infections. In fact,  strains from the more invasive phylogroups (e.g., B2) are frequently microcinogenic. A publicly accessible APD3 database http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/ shows particular genes encoding microcins in 34.1% of .  strains (mostly MccV, MccM, MccH47, and MccI47), and much less in  and  (<2%).

However, a systematic study of the intestinal  of this harmful insect pest is still lacking. Here, we comprehensively investigated the larval gut  of  in two field populations from Zigui (developed in orange) and Danjiangkou (developed in mandarin orange). We observed a dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in these bacterial communities, and Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant family throughout the larval stage. However, most of the identified fungal sequences were annotated as being from either Ascomycota or Basidiomycota phyla. Although there was a difference in the structure of the microbial communities between the two populations, the dynamic change patterns of most of the members of the  were similar across the lifespan of larvae in both populations.

This work characterized the composition, diversity, and microbial co-associations in the soil  associated with species and cultivars of plant in the genus  (common name boxwood), a group of woody perennial shrubs commonly used in residential landscapes and found in native ecosystems. Soil was collected from 82 individual curated boxwood accessions at the U.S. National Arboretum National Boxwood Collection. Amplicon libraries targeting archaea, bacteria, and fungi were generated and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Identification of individual sequence variants resulted in 275 archaeal, 15,580 bacterial, and 7,525 fungal taxa. Neither spatial distance among samples nor association with different types of boxwood were significant predictors of soil  composition. However, archaeal and bacterial diversity was significantly different in soil from distinct types of boxwood. Co-association networks indicated that archaea and bacteria show greater evidence of being keystone taxa than fungi. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential for targeting specific keystone taxa to shift the soil  associated with these boxwood accessions and that planting different species or cultivars in the landscape may shift the diversity of prokaryotic microorganisms.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we used the water avoidance stress (WAS) test in mouse models for chronic stress-induced gastritis to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this disease. The effect of stress on the gastric  was analyzed based on 16S rRNA sequencing; the changes in hydrogen sulfide (H S) and inflammatory cytokine levels in gastric tissues were detected by Western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used as an indicator of the gastritis histological score. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that gastric H S is negatively associated with the inflammatory index and might protect the gastrointestinal tract from inflammation. WAS-induced gastritis was associated with a reduction in H S release, which appeared to affect the homeostasis of the gastric  of mice. Inflammation and microbial dysbiosis were partially reversed by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and vitamin B6 (VB6) supplementation, suggesting the therapeutic potential of VB6 supplementation for the treatment of stress-induced gastritis. Gastritis has a serious impact on health and quality of life. An increasing number of people are suffering from chronic gastritis linked to a high-stress lifestyle, and our research provides clues for the prevention and treatment of stress-induced gastritis.© 2019 The Authors.

NASH ends up to advanced liver disease, which is highly threatening to human health. Currently, treatment of NASH is very limited. Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC1/ACC2) are proved as effective drug targets for NASH. We aimed to develop novel ACC inhibitors and evaluate their therapeutic value for NASH prevention. ACC inhibitors were obtained through structure-based drug design, synthesized, screened from ACC enzymatic measurement platform and elucidated in cell culture-based assays and animal models. The lipidome and  analysis were integrated to assess the effects of WZ66 on lipids profiles in liver and plasma as well as gut  in the intestine. WZ66 was identified as a novel ACC1/2 inhibitor. It entered systemic circulation rapidly and could accumulate in liver. WZ66 alleviated NASH-related liver features including steatosis, Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells activation in diet-induced obese mice. The triglycerides (TGs) and other lipids including diglycerides (DGs), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) were decreased in WZ66-treated mice as evidenced by lipidome analysis in livers. The lipids profiles in plasma were also altered with WZ66 treatment. Plasma TG were moderately increased, while the activation of SREBP1c was not detected. WZ66 also downregulated the abundance of Allobaculum, Mucispirillum and Prevotella genera as well as Mucispirillum schaedleri species in gut . WZ66 is an ideal lead compound and a potential drug candidate deserving further investigation in the therapeutics of NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642043>An Overview of Novel Unconventional Mechanisms of Hematopoietic Development and Regulators of Hematopoiesis - a Roadmap for Future Investigations.</a></h2><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the best-characterized stem cells in adult tissues. Nevertheless, as of today, many open questions remain. First, what is the phenotype of the most primitive "pre-HSC" able to undergo asymmetric divisions during ex vivo expansion that gives rise to HSC for all hemato-lymphopoietic lineages. Next, most routine in vitro assays designed to study HSC specification into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) for major hematopoietic lineages are based on a limited number of peptide-based growth factors and cytokines, neglecting the involvement of several other regulators that are endowed with hematopoietic activity. Examples include many hormones, such as pituitary gonadotropins, gonadal sex hormones, IGF-1, and thyroid hormones, as well as bioactive phosphosphingolipids and extracellular nucleotides (EXNs). Moreover, in addition to regulation by stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), trafficking of these cells during mobilization or homing after transplantation is also regulated by bioactive phosphosphingolipids, EXNs, and three ancient proteolytic cascades, the complement cascade (ComC), the coagulation cascade (CoA), and the fibrinolytic cascade (FibC). Finally, it has emerged that bone marrow responds by "sterile inflammation" to signals sent from damaged organs and tissues, systemic stress, strenuous exercise, gut , and the administration of certain drugs. This review will address the involvement of these unconventional regulators and present a broader picture of hematopoiesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642533>Idiopathic chronic diarrhea associated with dysbiosis in a captive cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis).</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammatory enteric diseases occur commonly in humans and animals, especially in captive bred macaques.

Accumulating studies on the gut-brain axis indicated that the gut  (GM), which participates in various neurological diseases, would provide a harmless therapeutic target for the treatment of CP and epilepsy. To explore the GM characteristics in children with both CP and epilepsy (CPE), we collected fecal samples from 25 CPE patients (CPE group) and 21 healthy children (Healthy group) for 16S rDNA sequencing. In this study, we discovered significantly higher microbial diversity in the CPE group compared to healthy group ( < 0.001). After selecting the top 15 most abundant genera in each group, we found significantly enriched , and  in the CPE group, and noticeably reduced , and .

After KEGG annotation and functional enrichment, 24 functional categories exhibited different enrichment levels between the CPE and Healthy groups. The functions, associated with xenobiotics metabolism, immune system diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, were enriched in the CPE group. Conversely, the functional categories related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were reduced. Furthermore, the neurodegenerative diseases were mainly attributed to , while an increased risk of immune system diseases was associated with enriched  in the CPE patients. Generally, this study characterized the GM in CPE patients, illustrated the microbial co-occurrence relationships, and detected the functional distributions of the bacteria.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Li, Feng, Li, Li, Ouyang, Dai, Wu, Zhou, Wang, Zhou, Xu, Li and Peng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641199>Calibrated interdental brushing for the prevention of periodontal pathogens infection in young adults - a randomized controlled clinical trial.</a></h2><p>Periodontal disease is clearly correlated with systemic disease. The presence of periodontal pathogens in interdental spaces in young, healthy adults is a strong indicator of the need to introduce daily interdental prophylaxis. Twenty-five subjects (aged 18-35 years), diagnosticated clinically as periodontally healthy, were enrolled in this study. One hundred interdental sites were included. Among these sites, 50 "test" sites were cleaned daily with calibrated interdental brushes (IDBs), whereas the other 50 sites were not cleaned and considered "controls". The interdental biofilm at these interdental sites was collected at the beginning of the study (basal) and at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology was used to quantify (i) 19 periodontal bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, and (ii) total bacteria. In the test sites, the quantity of total bacteria decreased over time with the use of IDBs. The bacteria from the red and orange Socransky complexes, which are associated with periodontal disease, significantly decreased in the test sites but not in the control sites. Bacteria from the yellow, and purple Socransky complexes, which are associated with periodontal health, increased significantly in both groups whereas bacteria from the blue Socransky complex increased significantly only in the test sites. Furthermore, at basal, 66% of test sites and 68% of control sites bled during interdental brushing. These percentages decreased by 85% in 3 months for the test sites and by 27% in the control sites. In conclusion, the daily use of calibrated IDBs can reduce periodontal pathogens, reestablish symbiotic  and, decrease interdental inflammation in interdental sites of healthy young adults.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649076>Complete Genome Sequence of the Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Endemic Houston-1 Strain, Isolated from a Pediatric Patient with Cystic Fibrosis and Assembled Using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina Sequencing.</a></h2><p>Hybrid  assembly of Illumina/Nanopore sequence data produced complete circular sequences of the chromosome and a plasmid for the multidrug-resistant  Houston-1 strain.

BZTLF is potentially effective against diabetic vascular complications.Previous studies failed to clarify the molecular mechanism through which BZTLF suppressed diabetic ischemia. In this study, we aimed to explore whether BZTLF treatment could prevent the occurrence of type 2 diabetic (T2D) hindlimb ischemia in mice. Further, we investigated the regulatory effect of BZTLF on angiogenesis-related VEGF signaling pathway and gut  dysfunction in diabetic ischemia mice.C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) received STZ injection and femoral artery ligation to build T2D diabetic hindlimb ischemia model. Mice were gavaged with BZTLF (5 g [raw materials]/kg/d) or with metformin plus atorvastatin for three weeks. Laser doppler imaging system was utilized for the visualization of blood flow. Histochemistry analysis was performed for microvascular vessel staining. Western blot was applied to detect the protein changes of signaling molecules responsible for VEGF pathway. Finally, 16S rDNA gene sequencing was conducted for analysis of gut  structure.BZTLF treatment remarkably restored blood flow and capillary density of diabetic hindlimb ischemia. And the protein changes of VEGF signaling molecules were reversed in BZTLF-treated diabetic ischemia mice, including the decreased VEGF and HIF-1α, and the increased NO, eNOS and p-ERK1/2. The gut  analysis suggests that BZTLF treatment increased the abundances of several beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides), while decreased the populations of some harmful bacterial (Blautia, Weissella, Escherichia Shigella and Kurthia). By using Spearman correlation analysis, these changed gut flora were positively/negatively correlated with VEGF signaling pathway or glycometabolic parameters.BZTLF displayed beneficial effects on diabetic hindlimb ischemia by reshaping the gut  structure and stunning the VEGF/HIF-1α pathway.Copyright © 2019.

The abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes and bacteria in the gut  may provide the ideal platform for plasmid exchange. Systematic data on in vivo horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and its frequency are scarce.196 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CRGNB) from 179 patients (158 in-patients and 21 out-patients) from January 2016 to April 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Alignment of plasmid content for 32 isolates from 16 patients with multiple CRGNB species was performed from WGS data.8.9% (16/179) of the patients were colonized and/or infected with more than one CRGNB species. 6.1% (11/179) were colonized by multiple carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and 2.8% (5/179) by carbapenem-resistant non-fermenters (CRNF) and CRE.

Little is known regarding the changes in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and potential pathogen burden that occur in pediatric recipients of FMT. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in AMR genes, potential pathogens, species, and functional pathways with FMT in children.Nine children with recurrent CDI underwent FMT. Stool was collected from donor and recipient pre-FMT and longitudinally post-FMT for up to 24 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed. Reads were analyzed using PathoScope 2.0.All children had resolution of CDI. AMR genes decreased post-FMT ( < .001), with a sustained decrease in multidrug resistance genes ( < .001). Tetracycline resistance genes increased post-FMT ( < .001). Very low levels of potential pathogens were identified in donors and recipients, with an overall decrease post-FMT ( < .001).  sp. 109 expanded in all recipients post-FMT, and no recipients had any clinical infection. Alpha diversity was lower in recipients vs donors pre-FMT ( < .001), with an increase post-FMT ( ≤ .002) that was sustained. Beta diversity differed significantly in pre- vs post-FMT recipient samples ( < .001). Bacterial species  and  showed higher abundance in donors than recipients ( = .008 and  = .040, respectively), with expansion post-FMT.

From the biological and botanical perspectives, the interaction between microorganisms and perennial woody plants falls within the category of stable relationships from which the plants can benefit in multiple ways. The life cycle of the host ensures persistence in all seasons, repeated chances of contact, and consequent  accumulation over time, leading to potentially high diversity compared with that of herbaceous short-lived plants. Furthermore, grapevines are agriculturally exploited, highly selected germplasms where a profound man-driven footprint has indirectly and unconsciously shaped the inner  through centuries of cultivation and breeding. Moreover, since endophyte metabolism can contribute to that of the plant host and its fruits' biochemical composition, the nature of grapevine endophytic taxa identities, ecological attitudes, potential toxicity, and clinical relevance are aspects worthy of a thorough investigation. Can endophytic taxa efficiently defend grapevines by acting against pests or confer enough fitness to the plants to endure attacks? What are the underlying mechanisms that translate into this or other advantages in the hosting plant? Can endophytes partially redirect plant metabolism, and to what extent do they act by releasing active products? Is the inner microbial colonization necessary priming for a cascade of actions? Are there defined environmental conditions that can trigger the unleashing of key microbial phenotypes? What is the environmental role in providing the ground biodiversity by which the plant can recruit microsymbionts?

Beta-glucan or quercetin in a diet can alleviate colorectal cancer (CRC) by regulating the gut  and related genes, but the effects of alternating their consumption for routine ingestion during CRC occurrence remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin for routine ingestion on CRC development in mice. The mortality rate, colonic length, inflammatory cytokines, gut , and colonic epithelial gene expression in healthy and CRC mice that consumed normal and alternate diets were compared and studied. The results showed that alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin (alternating among a β-glucan diet, a normal diet and a normal diet that was supplemented with quercetin) alleviated colon damage and reduced the mortality rate in CRC mice, with a reduction in mortality of 12.5%. Alternating the consumption of β-glucan and quercetin significantly decreased the TNF-α level, increased the relative abundance of  and downregulated three genes ( and ) that are associated with inflammation and cancer.

For this, one requires a mathematical model that predicts microbial community composition and the emergent behaviour of microbial communities. We seek a modelling strategy that can capture emergent behaviour when built from sets of universal individual interactions. Our investigation reveals that species-metabolite interaction (SMI) modelling is better able to capture emergent behaviour in community composition dynamics than direct species-species modelling. Using publicly available data, we examine the ability of species-species models and species-metabolite models to predict trio growth experiments from the outcomes of pair growth experiments. We compare quadratic species-species interaction models and quadratic SMI models and conclude that only species-metabolite models have the necessary complexity to explain a wide variety of interdependent growth outcomes. We also show that general species-species interaction models cannot match the patterns observed in community growth dynamics, whereas species-metabolite models can. We conclude that species-metabolite modelling will be important in the development of accurate, clinically useful models of microbial communities.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641004>Cohort profile: the Biology, Affect, Stress, Imaging and Cognition (BASIC) study on perinatal depression in a population-based Swedish cohort.</a></h2><p>With the population-based, prospective Biology, Affect, Stress, Imaging and Cognition (BASIC) cohort, we aim to investigate the biopsychosocial aetiological processes involved in perinatal depression (PND) and to pinpoint its predictors in order to improve early detection.From September 2009 to November 2018, the BASIC study at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, has enrolled 5492 women, in 6478 pregnancies, of which 46.3% first-time pregnancies and with an average age of 31.5 years.

Nutritional constituents strongly influence composition and functional properties of the intestinal microbial communities. Here, we report that omission of a single essential amino acid - tryptophan - from the diet abrogates CNS autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Dietary tryptophan restriction results in impaired encephalitogenic T cell responses and is accompanied by a mild intestinal inflammatory response and a profound phenotypic shift of gut . Protective effects of dietary tryptophan restriction are abrogated in germ-free mice, but are independent of canonical host sensors of intracellular tryptophan metabolites. We conclude that dietary tryptophan restriction alters metabolic properties of gut , which in turn have an impact on encephalitogenic T cell responses. This link between gut , dietary tryptophan and adaptive immunity may help to develop therapeutic strategies for protection from autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642901>Repurposing auranofin as a Clostridioides difficile therapeutic.</a></h2><p>Clostridioides difficile (previously Clostridium difficile) is the leading cause of nosocomial, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea worldwide. Currently, the gold standard of treatment for C. difficile infection (CDI) is vancomycin or metronidazole, although these antibiotics also perturb the protective resident , often resulting in disease relapse. Thus, an urgent need remains for the development of new treatment strategies. Auranofin is an FDA-approved oral antirheumatic drug that was previously shown to inhibit C. difficile vegetative cell growth, toxin production and spore production in vitro.To determine the efficacy of auranofin as a CDI therapeutic by examining the effect of treatment on toxin and spore production in vitro and in vivo, and on disease outcomes in mice.C. difficile cultures were treated with auranofin and examined for effects on sporulation and toxin production by sporulation assay and ELISA, respectively. Mice were pretreated with auranofin prior to infection with C. difficile and monitored for physiological conditions, survival and gut damage compared with control animals. Faeces from mice were analysed to determine whether auranofin reduces sporulation and toxin production in vivo.Auranofin significantly reduces sporulation and toxin production under in vitro conditions and in infected mice in vivo. Mice treated with auranofin lost less weight, displayed a significant increase in survival rates and had significantly less toxin-mediated damage in their colon and caecum compared with control mice.Auranofin shows promise as a prospective therapeutic option for C. difficile infections.© The Author(s) 2019.

Little is known about the effect of exogenous factors (including enteric pathogens) on the colonic TPP uptake process. Our aim in this study was to investigate the effect of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection on colonic uptake of TPP. We used human-derived colonic epithelial NCM460 cells and mice in our investigation. The results showed that infecting NCM460 cells with live EHEC (but not with heat-killed EHEC, EHEC culture supernatant, or with non-pathogenic E. Coli) to lead to a significant inhibition in carrier-mediated TPP uptake, as well as in level of expression of the TPPT protein and mRNA. Similarly, infecting mice with EHEC led to a significant inhibition in colonic TPP uptake and in level of expression of TPPT protein and mRNA. The inhibitory effect of EHEC on TPP uptake by NCM460 was found to be associated with reduction in the rate of transcription of the SLC44A4 gene as indicated by the significant reduction in the activity of the SLC44A4 promoter transfected into EHEC infected cells. The latter was also associated with a marked reduction in the level of expression of the transcription factors CREB-1 and ELF3, which are known to drive the activity of the SLC44A4 promoter. Finally, blocking the ERK1/2 and NF-kB signaling pathways in NCM460 cells significantly reversed the level of EHEC inhibition in TPP uptake and TPPT expression. Collectively, these findings show, for the first time, that EHEC infection significantly inhibit colonic uptake of TPP, and that this effect appears to be exerted at the level of SLC44A4 transcription and involves the ERK1/2 and NF-kB signaling pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650861>The effects of medication adherence on study outcomes in randomized clinical trials: a role for cognitive dysfunction?</a></h2><p>Medication nonadherence is common and has been associated with poor health outcomes.

Data analyses were performed between November 2017 and February 2019. Using harmonized individual participant data, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lung cancer risk associated with dietary fiber and yogurt intakes were estimated for each cohort by Cox regression and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Participants who had a history of cancer at enrollment or developed any cancer, died, or were lost to follow-up within 2 years after enrollment were excluded.Dietary fiber intake and yogurt consumption measured by validated instruments.Incident lung cancer, subclassified by histologic type (eg, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma).The analytic sample included 627 988 men, with a mean (SD) age of 57.9 (9.0) years, and 817 862 women, with a mean (SD) age of 54.8 (9.7) years. During a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 18 822 incident lung cancer cases were documented. Both fiber and yogurt intakes were inversely associated with lung cancer risk after adjustment for status and pack-years of smoking and other lung cancer risk factors: hazard ratio, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for the highest vs lowest quintile of fiber intake; and hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) for high vs no yogurt consumption. The fiber or yogurt associations with lung cancer were significant in never smokers and were consistently observed across sex, race/ethnicity, and tumor histologic type. When considered jointly, high yogurt consumption with the highest quintile of fiber intake showed more than 30% reduced risk of lung cancer than nonyogurt consumption with the lowest quintile of fiber intake (hazard ratio, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61-0.73] in total study populations; hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54-0.89] in never smokers), suggesting potential synergism.Dietary fiber and yogurt consumption was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer after adjusting for known risk factors and among never smokers.

Javiana on the surface of six cucumber cultivars of varying surface morphology and the effect of fruit waxing on the persistence of S. Newport. S. Newport and S. Javiana were spot inoculated onto fruit of cultivars 'Marketmore 97', 'Patio Snacker' and 'Corinto' (varieties with trichomes or spines), and 'Bella', 'Pepinex' and 'Summer Dance' (glabrous or smooth varieties). Cucumbers were held at room temperature for 24 h before inoculated sections of exocarp were excised for enteropathogen enumeration. S. Javiana persisted at higher populations than S. Newport (1.0 and 1.5 log CFU g exocarp decline, respectively) after 24 h (P < 0.05). Fruit waxing lessened S. Newport population decline after 24 h on all cultivars tested (P < 0.01). While there was a ~2 log CFU g exocarp decline in populations on unwaxed cucumbers, the reduction on waxed cucumbers was ~1 log CFU g exocarp. A cultivar effect was also observed; 'Summer Dance' supported consistently higher and 'Corinto' and 'Marketmore 97' (though for S. Javiana only) consistently lower Salmonella levels. Cultivars with trichomes were associated with lower populations than glabrous cultivars (P < 0.05). Our data showed that Salmonella persistence on fruit differed for the two serotypes tested and that cultivar differences play a role in determining cucumber surface favourability for pathogen colonization. Additionally, fruit waxing may elevate the risk of Salmonella persistence on cucumber.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The earthworms Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826) and Octolasion lacteum (Örley, 1881) were the two species that were most frequently found at visited sites, however, only O. lacteum was present at sufficient number across different exposure levels to enable comparative hologenome analysis. The identification of morphotype O. lacteum as a probable single clade was established using a combination of mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear genome (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) using MspI loci). No clear site associated differences in population genetic structure was found between populations using the AFLP marker loci. Further, no relationship between ionising radiation exposure levels and the percentage of methylated loci or pattern of distribution of DNA methylation marks was found.  structure was clearly site dependent, with gut  community structure and diversity being systematically associated with calculated site-specific earthworm dose rates. There was, however, also co-correlation between earthworm dose rates and other soil properties, notably soil pH; a property known to affect soil bacterial community structure. Such co-correlation means that it is not possible to attribute  changes unequivocally to radionuclide exposure. A better understanding of the relationship between radionuclide exposure soil properties and their interactions on bacterial  community response is, therefore, needed to establish whether these the observed  changes are attributed directly to radiation exposure, other soil properties or to an interaction between multiple variables at sites within the CEZ.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, deficiency of IL-10 or its receptor results in aberrant immune responses that lead to immunopathology. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the limiting complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and results from an imbalance in pathological versus regulatory immune networks. A number of immune cells exert their immunomodulatory role through secretion of IL-10 or induction of IL-10-secreting cells after SCT. Type-1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells) and FoxP3 regulatory T cells (T) are predominant sources of IL-10 after SCT and the critical role of this cytokine in preventing GVHD is now established. Recently, intriguing interactions among IL-10, immune cells, commensal microbes and host tissues in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and other barrier surfaces have been uncovered. We now understand that IL-10 secretion is dynamically modulated by the availability of antigen, co-stimulatory signals, cytokines, commensal microbes and their metabolites in the microenvironment. In this review, we provide an overview of the control of IL-10 secretion and signaling after SCT and the therapeutic interventions, with a focus on Tr1 cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, insects' tolerance to Bt is influenced by environmental factors affecting immunity. To understand larval immune response in the devastating coleopteran insect pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), we undertook a proteomic analysis of hemolymph of non-treated control larvae and larvae consuming non-lethal doses of spore-crystal mixtures containing the coleopteran-active Cry3Aa toxin. Results revealed lower amount of proteins involved in insect growth and higher amount of immune response-related proteins in challenged insects, sustaining the larval weight loss observed. Additionally, we found a potential regulatory role of the evolutionary conserved miR-8 in the insect's immune response relying on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Upon toxin challenge, different patterns of hemolymph AMPs expression and phenoloxidase activity were observed in CPB larvae reared on different Solanaceae plants. This suggests that diet and diet-associated insect midgut  might modulate this insects' tolerance to non-lethal doses of Bt.Copyright © 2019.

However, when environmental change occurs, it is unclear whether resultant  restructuring is proximately driven by this changing external environment or by the host's physiological response to this change. We leveraged urbanization to compare the ability of host environment (urban or forest) versus multi-scale biological measures of host hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis physiology (neutrophil : lymphocyte ratio, faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, hair cortisol) to explain variation in the eastern grey squirrel () faecal . Urban and forest squirrels differed across all three of the interpretations of HPA axis activity we measured. Direct consideration of these physiological measures better explained greater phylogenetic turnover between squirrels than environment. This pattern was strongly driven by trade-offs between bacteria which specialize on metabolizing digesta versus host-derived nutrient sources. Drawing on ecological theory to explain patterns in intestinal bacterial communities, we conclude that although environmental change can affect the , it might primarily do so indirectly by altering host physiology. We demonstrate that the inclusion and careful consideration of dynamic, rather than fixed (e.g. sex), dimensions of host physiology are essential for the study of host-microbe symbioses at the micro-evolutionary scale.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658430>COYOTES () IN ARIZONA, USA, EXHIBIT IMMUNE AND GENETIC EVIDENCE OF RICKETTSIAL INFECTIONS.</a></h2><p>  Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), caused by the bacterium , was recognized as endemic in Arizona after a 2002 outbreak and has since been a public health concern. The brown dog tick ( sensu lato) is the principal vector of this pathogen in Arizona. Domesticated dogs () are the tick's main host, so free-roaming dogs in peridomestic areas have been named the primary risk factor for human cases of RMSF. However, the sudden emergence and long-distance dispersal of the pathogen have not been adequately explained, and one possible mechanism could include wildlife. Coyotes () are wide ranging in Arizona and closely related to dogs, so it is possible that brown dog ticks parasitize coyotes and infect them. Although  is the most severe spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial pathogen in humans, others occur in Arizona, and antibodies raised against them are cross-reactive, so we more-broadly hypothesized that coyotes in Arizona are exposed to SFG rickettsiae. We collected coyote tissues in spring 2016 and 2017. We tested sera for antibodies to  and found 9% (8/94) of samples were antibody-positive with titers of ≥256. Subsequent quantitative PCR analyses of skin showed evidence for  spp. in 2.9% (4/138) of samples. These data suggest that coyotes have a role in the maintenance of SFG rickettsiae in Arizona.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity, especially in the kidneys, is an important mechanism linking obesity to hypertension. Some adipokines play important roles in elevating blood pressure (BP). Hyperinsulinemia caused by insulin resistance stimulates sodium reabsorption, enhances sodium retention, and increases circulating plasma volume. Hyperinsulinemia also stimulates both the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the SNS, resulting in the acceleration of atherosclerosis through the hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells, which contributes to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Obesity is associated with increased RAAS activity despite volume overload, as the tissue RAASs are stimulated in obese hypertensive individuals. Mineralocorticoid receptor-associated hypertension must also be considered in obese patients with resistant hypertension. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Some components of the gut  contribute to BP control; therefore, gut dysbiosis caused by obesity might lead to increased BP. The ratio of visceral fat to subcutaneous fat is higher in Japanese patients than in Caucasian patients, which may explain why Japanese patients are more susceptible to metabolic disorders even though they are less obese than Caucasian individuals. Obesity-associated kidney dysfunction directly increases BP, leading to further deterioration of kidney function. A bodyweight reduction of more than 3% or 5 kg significantly lowers BP. Gastrointestinal bypass surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity and its related metabolic disorders, including hypertension. Because both obesity and hypertension are representative lifestyle-related disorders, lifestyle modification, especially to improve obesity, should be performed first as a treatment for hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646593>The effect of the octenidine-based oral antiseptic on the structure of microbial communities and periodontal status in patients with fixed orthodontic treatments.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the effect of an octenidine (OCT)-based antiseptic on the gingival inflammation and microbial composition of subgingival dental plaque in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.Thirty-three orthodontic patients were randomized into 2 groups.

The periodontal status was evaluated using the following indices: the plaque index (PI), the gingival index (GI), the papilla bleeding index (PBI) and the probing pocket depth (PD). Next Generation Sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicons was performed in order to assess the subgingival .The PD values obtained were significantly lower in the experimental group after one month, as well as PBI. The microbiological analysis showed a significant increase in the occurrence of the genus Prevotella in the control group, while the number of other periodontopathogens remained stable in both groups. The changes in the abundance of the bacteria not directly associated with periodontal disease were also observed.The use of an OCT-based antiseptic has a positive effect on the prevention of gingival inflammation.

It plays an important role in gut  and immunity. This paper provides a critical overview of experimental studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical) investigating the efficacy of glutamine and its effect on gut . As a result of this review, we have summarized that glutamine could affect gut  via different mechanisms including the reduction in the ratio of  to  with the activation of NF-κB and PI3K-Akt pathways, reducing the intestinal colonization ( lesions) and bacterial overgrowth or bacterial translocation, increasing the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and immunoglobulin A+ (IgA) cells in the intestinal lumen, and decreasing asparagine levels. The potential applications of glutamine on gut  include, but are not limited to, the management of obesity, bacterial translocation and community, cytokines profiles, and the management of side effects during post-chemotherapy and constipation periods.

The fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA-amplicon sequencing to analyze the composition and richness of gut . Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering was performed using Usearch software. Intra-sample diversity (alpha-diversity) analysis and inter-sample diversity (beta-diversity) analyses were performed. The community richness was compared between the two groups at family and genus levels.There were 1903 and 1880 OTUs identified in the control and frailty groups, respectively, with 1282 OTUs overlap between the two groups. The alpha diversity of  community was similar between the two groups, whereas the frailty group had larger beta diversity than the control group. The top-10 taxonomy categories and abundances of gut  between the two groups were similar. As for the gut  composition, 4 families and 17 genera were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.05).These results suggested that frailty can affect gut  diversity and compositions in late elderly hospitalized patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650468>Baicalein, an enteric microbial metabolite, suppresses gut inflammation and cancer progression in Apc mice.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) development.

We evaluated the anti-inflammation and anti-CRC effects of the metabolite BE.The in vitro biotransformation by human intestinal  from BI into BE has been determined with HPLC. Using a gut-specific Apc mouse model, the effects of oral BE on the life span, organ index, and tumor multiplicity were evaluated. The expressions of inflammatory cytokines were determined using ELISA. To verify the in vivo data, the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of BE were determined with an in vitro cell model.HPLC analysis showed that BI was quickly transformed into BE by the intestinal . Oral BE (30 mg/kg/day) significantly increased the life span, from 125.2 to 218.4 days (P < 0.01%). BE treatment also decreased intestine index and increased spleen index. Compared with the model group, following BE treatment, tumor numbers were significantly reduced in the small intestine and colon (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively). In the gut tissues, BE treatment significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. In vitro data supported our in vivo results that the anti-CRC effects of BE were via the inhibition of gut inflammation and induction of cancer cell death.Our results suggest that the parent compound BI can be quickly converted into its microbial metabolite BE, which has stronger bioactive effects than BI. Baicalein is an active chemopreventive metabolite for inflammatory associated CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657460>Analysis of leaf  composition of near-isogenic maize lines differing in broad-spectrum disease resistance.</a></h2><p>●Plant genotype strongly affects disease resistance, and also influences the composition of the leaf . However, these processes have not been studied and linked in the microevolutionary context of breeding for improved disease resistance. We hypothesized that broad-spectrum disease resistance alleles also affect colonization by non-pathogenic symbionts. ●Quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to multiple fungal pathogens were introgressed into a disease-susceptible maize inbred line. Bacterial and fungal leaf microbiomes of the resulting near-isogenic lines were compared to the  of the disease-susceptible parent line at two timepoints in multiple fields. ●Introgression of QTL from disease-resistant lines strongly shifted the relative abundance of diverse fungal and bacterial taxa in both 3-week-old and 7-week-old plants. Nevertheless, the effects on overall community structure and diversity were minor and varied among fields and years. Contrary to our expectations, host genotype effects were not any stronger in fields with high disease pressure than in uninfected fields, and  succession over time was similar in heavily infected and uninfected plants. ●These results show that introgressed QTL can greatly improve broad-spectrum disease resistance while having only limited and inconsistent pleiotropic effects on the leaf  in maize.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31638716>Angiosperm to Gymnosperm host-plant switch entails shifts in  of the Welwitschia bug, Probergrothius angolensis (Distant,1902).</a></h2><p>Adaptation of herbivorous insects to new host plants is key to their evolutionary success in diverse environments. Many insects are associated with mutualistic gut bacteria that contribute to the host's nutrition and can thereby facilitate dietary switching in polyphagous insects. However, how gut microbial communities differ between populations of the same species that feed on different host plants remains poorly understood. Most species of Pyrrhocoridae (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) are specialist seed-feeders on plants in the family Malvaceae, however populations of one species, Probergrothius angolensis, has switched to the very distantly related Welwitschia mirabilis plant in the Namib Desert. We first compared development and survival of laboratory populations of Pr. angolensis with two other pyrrhocorids on seeds of Welwitschia and found only Pr. angolensis capable of successfully completing its development. We then collected Pr. angolensis in Namibia from Malvaceae and Welwitschia host plants, respectively, to assess their bacterial and fungal community profiles using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Comparison with long-term lab reared insects indicated stable associations of Pr. angolensis with core bacteria (Commensalibacter, Enterococcus, Bartonella, and Klebsiella), but not fungi or yeasts. Phylogenetic analyses of core bacteria revealed relationships to other insect-associated bacteria, but also found new taxa indicating potential host-specialized nutritional roles. Importantly, the microbial community profiles of bugs feeding on Welwitschia versus Malvaceae revealed stark and consistent differences in the relative abundance of core bacterial taxa that correlate with the host-plant switch; a result we were able to recreate through feeding experiments. Thus, a dynamic gut  may provide a means for insect adaptation to new host plants in new environments when food plants are extremely divergent.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659049>Microbial communities in the tropical air ecosystem follow a precise diel cycle.</a></h2><p>The atmosphere is vastly underexplored as a habitable ecosystem for microbial organisms. In this study, we investigated 795 time-resolved metagenomes from tropical air, generating 2.27 terabases of data. Despite only 9 to 17% of the generated sequence data currently being assignable to taxa, the air harbored a microbial diversity that rivals the complexity of other planetary ecosystems. The airborne microbial organisms followed a clear diel cycle, possibly driven by environmental factors. Interday taxonomic diversity exceeded day-to-day and month-to-month variation. Environmental time series revealed the existence of a large core of microbial taxa that remained invariable over 13 mo, thereby underlining the long-term robustness of the airborne community structure. Unlike terrestrial or aquatic environments, where prokaryotes are prevalent, the tropical airborne biomass was dominated by DNA from eukaryotic phyla. Specific fungal and bacterial species were strongly correlated with temperature, humidity, and CO concentration, making them suitable biomarkers for studying the bioaerosol dynamics of the atmosphere.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging, and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species, impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca buffering, may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut  in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associatedwithPD pathogenesis and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

However, retrieving and interpreting the structure of such datasets requires efficient methods for dimensionality reduction. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be used to decompose environmental DNA samples into overlapping assemblages of co-occurring taxa. It is a flexible model-based method adapted to uneven sample sizes and to large and sparse datasets. Here, we compare LDA performance on abundance and occurrence data, and we quantify the robustness of the LDA decomposition by measuring its stability with respect to the algorithm's initialization. We then apply LDA to a survey of 1,131 soil DNA samples that were collected in a 12-ha plot of primary tropical forest and amplified using standard primers for bacteria, protists, fungi, and metazoans. The analysis reveals that bacteria, protists, and fungi exhibit a strong spatial structure, which matches the topographical features of the plot, while metazoans do not, confirming that microbial diversity is primarily controlled by environmental variation at the studied scale. We conclude that LDA is a sensitive, robust and computationally efficient method to detect and interpret the structure of large DNA-based biodiversity datasets.

Five samples of commercial spelt flour were subjected to spontaneous fermentation to obtain a type I sourdough. A total of 186 LAB and 174 yeast isolates were selected at different refreshment steps and subjected to further analyses. Within LAB, coccal isolates constituted 78.5% of the total LAB, with the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus. Although documented before as a component, this is the first report of a spelt sourdough fermentation dominated by this homofermentative LAB, characterized by a high acidification rate, ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources and to grow in high osmolarity conditions. Yeast communities resulted in four dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Pichia fermentans and Clavispora lusitaniae.

Out-of-the-box thinking in human  engineering is leading to novel methods, like engineering bacteria to kill pathogens, "persuade" them not to produce toxins or "mop up" their toxins. The bacterial agent can be given a competitive edge via an exclusive nutrient, and they can be engineered to commit suicide once their work is done. Viruses can kill pathogens with specific DNA sequences or knock out their antibiotic resistance genes using CRISPR technology. Some of these ideas may work for lakes. We critically review novel methods for managing harmful bacteria in the gut from the perspective of managing toxic cyanobacteria in lakes, and discuss practical aspects such as modifying bacteria using genetic engineering or directed evolution, mass culturing and controlling the agents. A key knowledge gap is in the ecology of strains, like toxigenic vs. nontoxigenic Microcystis, including allelopathic and Black Queen interactions.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino acid metabolism-associated pathways (amino acid related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal , which in turn modulates their odor production.

Markers of gut dysbiosis like -to- ratio or the short chain fatty acid producing bacterial genera were not significantly affected by vitamin D deficiency. Notably, there was an increase in the relative abundance of the , with significant rises in its associated genera ,  and  in vitamin D deficient rats.  and  were also increased and  and its genus  were decreased in rats with vitamin D-free diet. In conclusion, vitamin D deficit does not induce gut dysbiosis but produces some specific changes in bacterial taxa, which may play a pathophysiological role in the immunologic dysregulation associated with this hypovitaminosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655880>Amelioration of TMAO through probiotics and its potential role in atherosclerosis.</a></h2><p>Atherosclerosis is a major cause of mortalities and morbidities worldwide. It is associated with hyperlipidemia and inflammation, and become chronic by triggering metabolites in different metabolic pathways. Disturbance in the human gut  is now considered a critical factor in the atherosclerosis. Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) attracts attention and is regarded as a vital contributor in the development of atherosclerosis. TMAO is generated from its dietary precursors choline, carnitine, and phosphatidylcholine by gut  into an intermediate compound known as trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized into TMAO by hepatic flavin monooxygenases. The present review focus on advances in TMAO preventing strategies through probiotics, including, modulation of gut , metabolomics profile, miRNA, or probiotic antagonistic abilities. Furthermore, possible recommendations based on relevant literature have been presented, which could be applied in probiotics and atherosclerosis-preventing strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641822>HS-SPME-GC-MS approach for the analysis of volatile salivary metabolites and application in a case study for the indirect assessment of gut .</a></h2><p>In this work, a straightforward analytical approach based on headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed for the analysis of salivary volatile organic compounds without any prior derivatization step. With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain fatty acids and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of volatile metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing 5-day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the  and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut . This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut  dynamics.

Dysbiosis induced by the exposure to antibiotics reveals the potential therapeutic role of fecal  transplantation (FMT) in these patients. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the safety and potential benefit of rescue FMT for AAD in critically ill patients.A series of critically ill patients with AAD received rescue FMT from Chinese fmtBank, from September 2015 to February 2019. Adverse events (AEs) and rescue FMT success which focused on the improvement of abdominal symptoms and post-ICU survival rate during a minimum of 12 weeks follow-up were assessed.Twenty critically ill patients with AAD underwent rescue FMT, and 18 of them were included for analysis. The mean of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 21.7 ± 8.3 (range 11-37). Thirteen patients received FMT through nasojejunal tube, four through gastroscopy, and one through enema. Patients were treated with four (4.2 ± 2.1, range 2-9) types of antibiotics before and during the onset of AAD. 38.9% (7/18) of patients had FMT-related AEs during follow-up, including increased diarrhea frequency, abdominal pain, increased serum amylase, and fever. Eight deaths unrelated to FMT occurred during follow-up. One hundred percent (2/2) of abdominal pain, 86.7% (13/15) of diarrhea, 69.2% (9/13) of abdominal distention, and 50% (1/2) of hematochezia were improved after FMT. 44.4% (8/18) of patients recovered from abdominal symptoms without recurrence and survived for a minimum of 12 weeks after being discharged from ICU.In this case series studying the use of FMT in critically ill patients with AAD, good clinical outcomes without infectious complications were observed. These findings could potentially encourage researchers to set up new clinical trials that will provide more insight into the potential benefit and safety of the procedure in the ICU.ClinicalTrials.gov, Number  .

We examined associations between micronutrient intake and a low-Lactobacillus vaginal  as assessed by molecular methods (termed "molecular-BV").This cross-sectional analysis utilized data collected at the baseline visit of the Hormonal Contraception Longitudinal Study, a cohort of reproductive-aged women followed over 2 years while initiating or ceasing hormonal contraception (HC). The Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency Questionnaire was administered and micronutrient intakes were ranked. Vaginal  composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and clustered into community state types (CSTs) based on the types and relative abundance of bacteria detected. Associations between the lowest estimated quartile intake of nutrients and having a low-Lactobacillus CST (molecular-BV) were evaluated by logistic regression. Separate models were built for each nutrient controlling for age, body mass index, behavioral factors, HC use and total energy intake. We also conducted a literature review of existing data on associations between micronutrient intakes and BV.Samples from 104 women were included in this analysis. Their mean age was 25.8 years (SD 4.3), 29.8% were African American, 48.1% were using HC, and 25% had molecular-BV. In adjusted multivariable analyses, the lowest quartile of betaine intake was associated with an increased odds of molecular-BV (aOR 9.2, p value < 0.01, [CI 2.4-35.0]).This is the first study to assess the association between estimated micronutrient intake and molecular-BV. Lower energy-adjusted intake of betaine was associated with an increased risk of molecular-BV. Betaine might have direct effects on the vaginal microenvironment or may be mediated through the gut . Additional research is needed to determine reproducibility of this finding and whether improved intake of select micronutrients such as betaine decreases the risk of BV and its sequelae.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650293>Oral microbial influences on oral mucositis during radiotherapy treatment of head and neck cancer.</a></h2><p>Oral mucositis (OM) remains a significant complication developed by many patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) to the head and neck region. Emerging data suggest oral microbes may contribute to the onset and severity of this acute side effect.In this study, saliva and oral swabs from head and neck cancer patients undergoing RT were collected. We employed molecular microbiological techniques to study the bacterial communities present in saliva, and both the bacterial and fungal communities present on the buccal mucosa and lateral tongue. Changes in  composition with increasing radiation dose and the presence of mucositis were examined.The data suggest that the salivary  remain stable during RT and are consistently dominated by Streptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium and Granulicatella. Obligate and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) Bacteroidales G2, Capnocytophaga, Eikenella, Mycoplasma and Sneathia, as well as anaerobic GNB in the periopathogenic genera Porphyromonas and Tannerella, were all positively correlated with ≥ grade 2 OM. Significant increases in the relative abundances of Bacteroidales G2, Fusobacterium and Sneathia were identified in buccal mucosa swabs at sites of ≥ grade 2 OM (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the abundance of several GNB (Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Tannerella, Porphyromonas and Eikenella) on the buccal mucosa may influence patient susceptibility to developing OM. Candida was widely detected in buccal mucosa swabs, regardless of mucositis status.Our findings support previously hypothesized associations between oral health and the pathogenesis of OM, highlighting the importance of oral health interventions for head and neck cancer patients.</p></html>
