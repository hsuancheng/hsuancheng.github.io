Emergence of antibiotic-resistance among Shigella demands the development of effective medicines. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are expressed in phagocytes and at epithelial surfaces and are important effector molecules of innate immunity. We have found that pathogens are able to turn off the endogenous expression of AMPs, resulting in serious infections such as shigellosis. A therapeutic rationale to prevent microbial invasion would be to strengthen the epithelial line of defence through enhancing AMP expression. We have identified several inducers of AMP-production, including butyrate, phenylbutyrate and vitamin D, which have been investigated in animal models of shigellosis as well as in clinical trials. We believe that the conceptual framework presented here can be applied to additional clinical entities and that this novel approach can be an alternative or complement to traditional antibiotics in the future.2010.

In previous studies, fermentation of starch has been shown to inhibit the degradation of primary to secondary BA by the colonic microflora. This study was designed to investigate BA metabolism in continuous cultures of mixed fecal bacteria to get further insights into the mechanisms of this inhibition. Fermentation vessels were fed with media containing cholic (0.6 g/l) and chenodeoxycholic  (0.4 g/l). Cultures were either starch-free or enriched with starch (10 g/l). pH was controlled and adjusted to 7.0 or 6.0. Total culture duration was 28 days and concentrations of BA, short-chain   (), and starch were measured periodically. At pH 6, significantly more primary BA remained in the media and less secondary BA were produced. Total BA concentrations were lower at pH7.  concentrations were higher in the vessels supplemented with starch. Starch was completely fermented and not present in significant amounts in any fermentation vial after the first week. These data indicate that bacterial breakdown of primary to secondary BA is inhibited when starch is simultaneously fermented. This effect can be explained by the reduction of pH resulting from  production. Considering these findings, resistant starch which escapes assimilation in the small bowel may be a protective factor against colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16573377>Effects of a 3-mo consumption of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides on parameters of colorectal carcinogenesis in patients with or without small or large colorectal adenomas.</a></h2><p>Intervention studies of colorectal adenoma recurrence have demonstrated the need for surrogate markers of the cancer risk. Short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (sc-FOS) have protective actions on colon carcinogenesis in animal models. We investigated differences in biological markers between adenoma and adenoma-free subjects, before and after 3 mo of daily intake of 10 g sc-FOS, within a multicenter study. After a full colonoscopy, 3 groups were studied at baseline and after 3 mo: 26 subjects with small colorectal adenoma(s), 18 with large adenoma(s), and 30 with no adenoma. At baseline, the mean fecal butyrate concentration was significantly lower in the adenoma groups than in the adenoma-free group (12.01 +/- 5.08 vs. 17.28 +/- 7.34 mmol/g dry weight) but was significantly increased in that group after 3-mo ingestion of sc-FOS (15.7 +/- 8.0 mmol/g; P = 0.02). In subjects without adenoma, sc-FOS ingestion was associated with a decrease in fecal  (P = 0.02) and an increase in cholic  (P = 0.02), chenodeoxycholic  (P = 0.04), total primary bile  (P = 0.03), and ursodeoxycholic  (P = 0.05). Fecal pH, blood parameters, and crypt cell proliferation were not significantly modified by sc-FOS ingestion in either group. In subjects with and without adenoma, sc-FOS affects some aspects of the colonic environment, which may be involved in prevention of colorectal neoplasia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147381>Donor  characteristics drive effects of faecal microbiota transplantation on recipient insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and intestinal transit time.</a></h2><p>Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism. Recent data suggest that faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using faeces from postbariatric surgery diet-induced obese mice in germ-free mice improves glucose metabolism and intestinal homeostasis. We here investigated whether allogenic FMT using faeces from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass donors (RYGB-D) compared with using faeces from  donors (METS-D) has short-term effects on glucose metabolism, intestinal transit time and adipose tissue inflammation in treatment-naïve, obese, insulin-resistant male subjects.Subjects with  (n=22) received allogenic FMT either from RYGB-D or METS-D. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as lipolysis were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after FMT by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic stable isotope (H-glucose and H-glycerol) clamp. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in resting energy expenditure, intestinal transit time, faecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bile acids, and inflammatory markers in subcutaneous adipose tissue related to intestinal microbiota composition. Faecal SCFA, bile acids, glycaemic control and inflammatory parameters were also evaluated at 8 weeks.We observed a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity 2 weeks after allogenic METS-D FMT (median rate of glucose disappearance: from 40.6 to 34.0 µmol/kg/min; p<0.01). Moreover, a trend (p=0.052) towards faster intestinal transit time following RYGB-D FMT was seen. Finally, we observed changes in faecal bile acids (increased , deoxycholic and (iso) after METS-D FMT), inflammatory markers (decreased adipose tissue chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gene expression and plasma CCL2 after RYGB-D FMT) and changes in several intestinal microbiota taxa.Allogenic FMT using METS-D decreases insulin sensitivity in  recipients when compared with using post-RYGB-D. Further research is needed to delineate the role of donor characteristics in FMT efficacy in human insulin-resistant subjects.NTR4327.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The study was designed as a single stage crossover. Both cultures were inoculated and treated in an identical manner except that whilst one fermenter was subject to pH control the other was not and vice versa. Complex bacterial populations were maintained for 23 days and many of the metabolic functions carried out by the micro-organisms in vivo were demonstrated in vitro. The predominant organisms belonged to the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Clostridium with abundant levels of anaerobic Gram-positive rods. The redox potential in each fermenter showed considerable variation with maximum values of below -300 eV being attained. An indication of the stability of the bacterial communities was the production of short-chain ; during steady-state conditions the mean ratio of the major  acetic, propionic and butyric being 3.90:0.69:1.00 and 3.65:0.76:1.00 in each fermenter, respectively. During steady-state conditions, 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of the primary bile  chenodeoxycholic  was maintained at a constant rate with  representing over 85% of total steroid. Addition of the soluble fibre lactulose to the cultures had a profound effect on many of the parameters tested. Without pH control the culture pH dropped to below 5.0 and this coincided with a substantial decrease in total anaerobes, especially Bacteroides spp., an increase in Lactobacillus spp. (concomitant with an increase in lactic ), a decrease in the concentration of short-chain  and a substantial decrease in 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic . These results show that it is possible to maintain viable intestinal bacteria in vitro using a continuous culture chemostat and that the cultures respond to changing conditions as evinced by the inhibition of 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of chenodeoxycholic  on addition of lactulose. This indicates that the model may be of further use in studying the modulation of secondary bile  formation, a possible risk factor in colorectal carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17663444>High-performance functional ecopolymers based on flora and fauna.</a></h2><p>Liquid crystalline (LC) polymers of rigid monomers based on flora and fauna were prepared by in-bulk polymerization. Para-coumaric (p-coumaric)  [4-hydroxycinnamic  (4HCA)] and its derivatives were selected as phytomonomers and bile acids were selected as biomonomers. The 4HCA homopolymer showed a thermotropic LC phase only in a state of low molecular weight. The copolymers of 4HCA with bile acids such as  (LCA) and cholic  (CA) showed excellent cell compatibilities but low molecular weights. However, P(4HCA-co-CA)s allowed LC spinning to create molecularly oriented biofibers, presumably due to the chain entanglement that occurs during in-bulk chain propagation into hyperbranching architecture. P[4HCA-co-3,4-dihydroxycinnamic  (DHCA)]s showed high molecular weight, high mechanical strength, high Young's modulus, and high softening temperature, which may be achieved through the entanglement by in-bulk formation of hyperbranching, rigid structures. P(4HCA-co-DHCA)s showed a smooth hydrolysis, in-soil degradation, and photo-tunable hydrolysis.

Growing male rats were fed the experimental diets with or without 25 % tempe for 21 days. Tempe consumption slightly but significantly increased the growth of rats fed both the HF and LF diets (P < 0.05). With both the HF and LF diets, dietary tempe markedly reduced a harmful fecal secondary bile ,  (a risk factor of colon cancer) (P < 0.05), and markedly elevated fecal mucins (indices of intestinal barrier function) and immunoglobulin A (IgA, an index of intestinal immune function) (P < 0.05). With the HF diet, dietary tempe increased cecal acetate, butyrate, propionate, and succinate concentrations (P < 0.05). Analysis of the profile of cecal microflora revealed lower Bacteroides and higher Clostridium cluster XIVa levels in the tempe group of rats fed the HF diet (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the fecal activity of β-glucosidase was markedly higher in the tempe group (P < 0.05), while that of urease was lower (P < 0.05) with both the HF and LF diets.

However, one of the recent studies from our laboratory indicated that increased bile  excretion and subsequent increase in its synthesis, but not the inhibition of cholesterol absorption or synthesis might be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering effect of barley β-glucan. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of bile acids (BA), neutral sterols (NS) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) excreted through the feces by mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who consumed diets containing barley β-glucan with varying molecular weights (MW) and concentrations. In a controlled, four phase, crossover trial, 30 mildly hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive breakfast containing 3 g high MW (HMW), 5 g low MW (LMW), 3 g LMW barley β-glucan or a control diet for 5 weeks. The concentrations of BA, NS and SCFA in the feces were measured at the end of each treatment phase. Compared to the other treatment groups, 3 g day-1 HMW barley β-glucan consumption resulted in increased  (LCA) excretion (P < 0.001) but not LMW β-glucan, even at the high dose of 5 g day-1. Increased fermentability of fibre was also evident from a significant increase in fecal total SCFA concentrations in response to the 3 g HMW β-glucan diet compared to the 3 g LMW barley β-glucan and control diet (P = 0.0015). In summary, the current results validate our previous report on the role of fecal bile  excretion in cholesterol lowering through the consumption of barley β-glucan. In addition, increased SCFA concentrations indicate that an increase in β-glucan molecular weight promotes hindgut fermentation, which might also be playing a role in attenuating cholesterol levels.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11246608>Alterations in intestinal microflora, faecal bile  and short chain   in dextran sulphate sodium-induced experimental acute colitis in rats.</a></h2><p>The physiological effects on faecal bile  and short chain   (SCFAs) or intestinal microflora in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis remain unknown and are an area of interest DESIGN ALTERATIONS: of these parameters in DSS-induced colitis in rats were evaluated.Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10) were given a 3% DSS aqueous solution orally for 7 days.

Intestinal microflora, especially anaerobes, were investigated by microbiological methods.On day 7, the concentrations of  and alpha-muricholic  were significantly decreased and that of cholic  was significantly increased. There was a strong correlation between the concentration of cholic  and the macroscopic area of damaged tissue in the colon (R = 0.74, P < 0.05). With respect to SCFAs, DSS administration significantly decreased the concentrations of acetic  and n-butyric . There was also some correlation between the concentration of acetic  and macroscopic damaged area in the colon (R = -0.60, P = 0.07).

The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM dysbiosis was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty acids and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids and depleted of .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and  activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism. Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28661219>Feeding of the water extract from Ganoderma lingzhi to rats modulates secondary bile acids, intestinal microflora, mucins, and propionate important to colon cancer.</a></h2><p>Consumption of reishi mushroom has been reported to prevent colon carcinogenesis in rodents, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this effect, rats were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 5% water extract from either the reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lingzhi) (WGL) or the auto-digested reishi G. lingzhi (AWGL) for three weeks. Both extracts markedly reduced fecal secondary bile acids, such as  and deoxycholic  (colon carcinogens). These extracts reduced the numbers of Clostridium coccoides and Clostridium leptum (secondary bile acids-producing bacteria) in a per g of cecal digesta. Fecal mucins and cecal propionate were significantly elevated by both extracts, and fecal IgA was significantly elevated by WGL, but not by AWGL. These results suggest that the reishi extracts have an impact on colon luminal health by modulating secondary bile acids, microflora, mucins, and propionate that related to colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208006>Effects of konjac glucomannan on putative risk factors for colon carcinogenesis in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to determine effects of konjac glucomannan (KGM) in a high fat corn oil diet on risk factors of colon carcinogenesis, that is, fecal β-glucuronidase, mucinase, and bile acids, and on preventive factors, that is, fecal microflora and cecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8 animals per group) were fed a normal-fat fiber-free (5% corn oil, w/w) or high-fat (25% corn oil, w/w) diet containing no fiber, KGM (5%, w/w), or inulin (5%, w/w, as a prebiotic control) for 4 weeks. Results indicated that the high-fat fiber-free diet significantly elevated the fecal β-glucuronidase and mucinase activities and total bile  concentration and decreased cecal SCFA contents, as compared with its normal-fat counterpart. The incorporation of KGM, as well as inulin, into the high-fat fiber-free diet beneficially reduced the fecal β-glucuronidase and mucinase activities and  (secondary bile ) concentration. Although KGM elevated the daily fecal total bile  excretion, the change was due to the primary, instead of the secondary, bile acids. In addition, KGM beneficially promoted the daily fecal excretion of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and cecal SCFA contents, as compared with the high-fat fiber-free diet. Therefore, the present study suggests that KGM potentially attenuated the high fat-induced risk in colon carcinogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727078>Flaxseed meal and oat hulls supplementation modulates growth performance, blood lipids, intestinal fermentation, bile , and neutral sterols in growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal-based diets.</a></h2><p>The present study was conducted to determine the effect of flaxseed meal and oat hulls supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of fat, serum lipids, and concentrations of VFA, bile  (BA), and neutral sterols (NS) in digesta and feces in growing pigs. Forty-eight Genesus [(Duroc boar × Yorkshire-Landrace sows] barrows (25.0 ± 0.32 kg initial BW) were housed in pairs. Pigs were assigned to 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets-a basal corn-soybean meal-containing diet (control), a flaxseed meal-containing diet (FM), or an oat hulls-containing diet (OH)-in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and to contain similar standardized ileal digestible AA contents and meet other nutrient requirements for growing pigs. The experiment lasted for 28 d. Average daily feed intake; ADG; G:F; ATTD of fat, serum lipids, and digesta; and fecal VFA, BA, and NS concentrations were determined. Pigs fed the control or OH had greater final BW ( < 0.001), ADFI ( = 0.005), and ADG ( < 0.001) than FM-fed pigs. The ATTD of fat in the FM was lowest at 70.1% followed by 79.2% in OH and was greatest at 92.4% in the control ( = 0.020). Total serum cholesterol content was 2.25 and 1.99 mmol/L and lower ( < 0.001) in pigs fed FM and OH, respectively, than the 2.36 mmol/L in pigs fed the control. Pigs fed the FM and OH had greater ileal and cecal total VFA ( < 0.001), ileal deoxycholic  ( < 0.01), and cecal ( < 0.001) and fecal cholesterol ( = 0.002) concentrations than those fed the control. Pigs fed the FM excreted more fecal  ( = 0.002) and ursodeoxycholic  ( = 0.001) compared with those that consumed the control and OH. The concentrations of coprostanol in cecal digesta ( < 0.001) and feces ( = 0.011) were higher in pigs fed the FM and OH than in pigs fed the control. In conclusion, feeding flaxseed meal and oat hulls induced intestinal fermentation; however, the former depressed growth performance whereas the latter did not have any effect.

Primary BAs play critical roles in cholesterol metabolism, lipid digestion, and host⁻microbe interaction. Although BAs are reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation, primary BAs serve as substrates for bacterial biotransformation to secondary BAs in the colon. High-fat diets increase secondary BAs, such as deoxycholic  (DCA) and  (LCA), which are risk factors for colonic inflammation and cancer. In contrast, increased dietary fiber intake is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. These effects may be due to the increased production of the SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate during dietary fiber fermentation in the colon. Elucidation of the molecular events by which secondary BAs and SCFAs regulate colonic cell proliferation and inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the anticancer potential of dietary fiber in the context of high-fat diet-related colon cancer.

In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, controlled design trial, 11 healthy adults consumed for 5 days each a control diet (animal-based diet plus 30 g/day placebo powder) and a cranberry diet (animal-based diet plus 30 g/day freeze-dried whole cranberry powder). The animal-based diet included meats, dairy products, and simple sugars. Stool, urine, and blood samples were obtained before and after each intervention phase. As compared to the pre-control diet, control diet modified 46 taxonomic clades, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes. Moreover, it increased bacteria-derived deoxycholic  and decreased acetate and butyrate in stool. As compared to the post-intervention phase of control diet, the cranberry diet modified 9 taxonomic clades, including a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes and increase in Bacteroidetes. Further, the cranberry diet attenuated control diet-induced increase in secondary bile acids and decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and increased urinary anthocyanins and bacterially derived phenolic acids. No changes were found in fecal trimethylamine and plasma cytokines. In conclusion, an animal-based diet altered the  composition to a less favorable profile, increased carcinogenic bile acids, and decreased beneficial SCFA.

To investigate how dietary fat influences risk, we compared the colonic contents of 12 adult high-risk African Americans (AAs) and 10 Caucasian Americans (CAs) who consumed a high-fat diet (123 ± 11 g/d and 129 ± 17 g/d, respectively) to 13 native Africans (NAs) who subsisted on a low-fat (38 ± 3.0 g/d) diet, all aged 50-60 yr. The colonic bile acids were measured by LC-MS and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by GC. The chief secondary colonic bile acids, deoxycholic  and , were correlated with fat intake and similar between AAs and CAs, but 3-4 times higher than in AAs (p < 0.05). The major SCFAs were lower in AAs (p < 0.001) and CAs (p < 0.001) compared to AAs, but conversely, the branched chain fatty acids (BFCA) were higher. Our results suggest that the higher risk of colon cancer in Americans may be partly explained by their high-fat and high-protein, low complex carbohydrate diet, which produces colonic residues that promote microbes to produce potentially carcinogenic secondary bile acids and less antineoplastic SCFAs.

However, in vitro studies demonstrated that  is capable of stripping cholesterol from microsomal membranes even in the absence of increased de novo synthesis. This suggests that transfer of cholesterol from subcellular organelles (microsomes) to bile canalicular membranes may be the initial step in the development of -induced cholestasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924312>Effect of Wheat Dietary Fiber Particle Size during Digestion In Vitro on Bile , Faecal Bacteria and Short-Chain Fatty  Content.</a></h2><p>The influence of bile  concentration on the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. bacteria was demonstrated. Exposing these bacteria to the environment containing bile  salts, and very poor in nutrients, leads to the disappearance of these microorganisms due to the toxic effect of bile acids. A multidimensional analysis of data in the form of principal component analysis indicated that lactic  bacteria bind bile acids and show antagonistic effect on E. coli spp. bacteria. The growth in E. coli spp. population was accompanied by a decline in the population of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. with a simultaneous reduction in the concentration of bile acids. This is direct proof of  binding ability of the tested lactic  bacteria with respect to cholic ,  and deoxycholic . This research demonstrated that the degree of fineness of wheat dietary fibre does not affect the sorption of bile acids and growth of some bacteria species; however, it has an impact on the profile of synthesized short-chained fatty acids. During the digestion of a very fine wheat fibre fraction (WF 90), an increase in the concentration of propionic and butyric acids, as compared with the wheat fiber fraction of larger particles - WF 500, was observed. Our study suggested that wheat fibre did not affect faecal bacteria growth, however, we observed binding of bile acids by Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18657865>PU.1 and bacterial metabolites regulate the human gene CAMP encoding antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in colon epithelial cells.</a></h2><p>Mammalian antimicrobial peptides contribute to the protective barrier against microbes at epithelial surfaces. This study focuses on the promoter of the human CAMP gene, encoding the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, and induction of the gene in the colonic epithelial cell line HT-29. CAMP promoter segments were inserted in front of a luciferase reporter in order to identify regulatory regions. A transcription promoting region was identified and the transcription factor PU.1 of the Ets family was recruited to this region as shown by ChIP analysis. This ties PU.1 to the regulation of human innate epithelial defences for the first time. In addition, the conserved second intron was found to exert a transcription enhancing effect in cooperation with the 3' end of the proximal promoter, and the importance of two upstream AUG codons was examined. Moreover, we here demonstrate that  enhances CAMP transcription, and does so additively with butyrate. Thus, a crosstalk between bacteria and host epithelia of the gut could be partially mediated via these two bacterial products to obtain gut homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13129449>Effect of tartaric  and dietary fibre from sun-dried raisins on colonic function and on bile  and    excretion in healthy adults.</a></h2><p>Sun-dried raisins are a source of dietary fibre and tartaric . The effects of tartaric  on colon function have not been the focus of extensive research. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of dietary fibre and tartaric  from sun-dried raisins on colon function and on faecal bile  and short-chain   () excretion in healthy adults. Thirteen healthy subjects were fed 120 g sun-dried raisins/d or 5 g cream of tartar (equivalent to the tartaric  in 120 g sun-dried raisins)/d for 9 weeks, divided into 3-week cycles. The experimental diets were fed in a crossover design after an initial control period. Faeces were collected for the last 4 d of each cycle for analysis of  and bile . Intestinal transit time decreased from 42 h on the baseline diet to 31 h on cream of tartar (P<0.1) and to 28 h on sun-dried raisins (P<0.05). Faeces were softer on both sun-dried raisins and cream of tartar, but sun-dried raisins increased faecal wet weight (P<0.05), while cream of tartar did not. Sun-dried raisins caused significant reductions from baseline values in total bile  concentration (from 1.42 (SD 1.03) to 1.09 (SD 0.76) mg/g, P<0.05), whereas cream of tartar did not (1.40 (SD 1.06) mg/g). Sun-dried raisins also significantly reduced the  (LC):deoxylithocholic  (DC) ratio (from 1.63 (SD 0.85) to 1.09 (SD 0.50), P<0.02), whereas cream of tartar reduced the ratio, but to a lesser extent (1.29 (SD 0.79), NS). Both faecal bile  and the LC:DC ratio are indicators of reduced risk for colon cancer. Sun-dried raisins increased total  excretion (from 5.6 (SD 3.4) to 7.6 (SD 3.0) g/4 d, P<0.05), which remained unchanged with cream of tartar (5.6 (SD 3.0) g/4 d). Both sun-dried raisins and cream of tartar appear to be good stool softeners and to shorten intestinal transit time, although the fibre in sun-dried raisins has the added benefit of increasing faecal weight. Both sun-dried raisins and cream of tartar modulate the composition of faecal bile  and  in a way that has potential health benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291748>Burdock fermented by Aspergillus awamori elevates cecal Bifidobacterium, and reduces fecal deoxycholic  and adipose tissue weight in rats fed a high-fat diet.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with burdock powder and Aspergillus awamori-fermented burdock powder at 5% on the intestinal luminal environment and body fat in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Food intake and growth were unaffected by dietary manipulation. Consumption of the burdock and fermented burdock diets significantly elevated fecal IgA and mucins (indices of intestinal immune and barrier functions) and reduced fecal  (a risk factor for colon cancer) (p<0.05). The fermented burdock diet markedly elevated cecal Bifidobacterium and organic acids, including lactate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and reduced fecal deoxycholic  (a risk factor for colon cancer) and perirenal adipose tissue weight (p<0.05), but the burdock diet did not. These results suggest that consumption of fermented burdock improves the intestinal luminal environment and suppresses obesity in rats fed a HF diet.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6489646>Faecal weight, constituents, colonic motility, and lactose tolerance in the irritable bowel syndrome.</a></h2><p>Lactose intolerance and faecal characteristics were compared in 16 patients with symptomatic irritable bowel syndrome and in age- and sex-matched controls. Faecal stool weight was increased in the irritable bowel syndrome patients, whereas faecal bile , fat, , and neutral sterols were not significantly different. No lactose intolerance was found in irritable bowel syndrome subjects. Measurements of colonic motility showed only modest activity for both basal and food-stimulated activity. There was a weak correlation between the concentration of total bile , deoxycholic ,  and the motility index.</p></html>
