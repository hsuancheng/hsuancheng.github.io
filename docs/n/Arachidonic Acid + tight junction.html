The underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), an enzyme involved in  metabolism, has been reported to cause airway epithelial injury and thus may further promote the EMT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ALOX15 during the EMT process in CRSwNP.A total of 54 samples were obtained, including 10 from healthy control, 16 from non-eosinophilic CRSwNP, and 28 from eosinophilic CRSwNP. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to determine the basement membrane (BM) thickness. The concentration of molecules mediating remodeling was assayed by Luminex. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of target genes were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting.EMT was enhanced in eosinophilic CRSwNP compared with the healthy controls and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP infiltrated with lymphocytes and/or plasma cells. The expression pattern of molecules related to remodeling, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family members, differed between the subtypes of CRSwNP. The mRNA level of ALOX15 was correlated with the BM thickness and MMP-1 and TGF-β3 expression. The inhibition of ALOX15 by PD146176 could induce claudin-1, claudin-4, claudin-7, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2, E-Cadherin, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 expressions and reduce the levels of MMP-1 and N-Cadherin in epithelial cells acquired from eosinophilic CRSwNP patients.The specific inhibition of ALOX15 could attenuate the EMT, which may provide an alternative method for the treatment of CRSwNP.© 2018 ARS-AAOA, LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21858117>Exogenous HIV-1 Nef upsets the IFN-γ-induced impairment of human intestinal epithelial integrity.</a></h2><p>The mucosal tissues play a central role in the transmission of HIV-1 infection as well as in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Despite several clinical studies reported intestinal dysfunction during HIV infection, the mechanisms underlying HIV-induced impairments of mucosal epithelial barrier are still unclear. It has been postulated that HIV-1 alters enterocytic function and HIV-1 proteins have been detected in several cell types of the intestinal mucosa. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of the accessory HIV-1 Nef protein on human epithelial cell line.We used unstimulated or IFN-γ-stimulated Caco-2 cells, as a model for homeostatic and inflamed gastrointestinal tracts, respectively. We investigated the effect of exogenous recombinant Nef on monolayer integrity analyzing its uptake, transepithelial electrical resistance, permeability to FITC-dextran and the expression of  proteins. Moreover, we measured the induction of proinflammatory mediators. Exogenous Nef was taken up by Caco-2 cells, increased intestinal epithelial permeability and upset the IFN-γ-induced reduction of transepithelial resistance, interfering with  protein expression. Moreover, Nef inhibited IFN-γ-induced apoptosis and up-regulated TNF-α, IL-6 and MIP-3α production by Caco-2 cells while down-regulated IL-10 production. The simultaneous exposure of Caco-2 cells to Nef and IFN-γ did not affect cytokine secretion respect to untreated cells. Finally, we found that Nef counteracted the IFN-γ induced  cascade.Our findings suggest that exogenous Nef, perturbing the IFN-γ-induced impairment of intestinal epithelial cells, could prolong cell survival, thus allowing for accumulation of viral particles. Our results may improve the understanding of AIDS pathogenesis, supporting the discovery of new therapeutic interventions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934114>Lowering the dietary omega-6: omega-3 does not hinder nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease development in a murine model.</a></h2><p>It is hypothesized that a high dietary n-6:n-3 (eg, 10-20:1) is partly responsible for the rise in obesity and related health ailments. However, no tightly controlled studies using high-fat diets differing in the n-6:n-3 have tested this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and colitis development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and colitis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and  proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to colitis development or changes in  protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that colitis, or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Newly formed cell pairs were used to examine the conductance of gap , gj. Measurements were performed using a dual voltage-clamp method in conjunction with a whole-cell, -seal recording. Exposure to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 100-160 nM) led to a decrease in gj. Single-channel events recorded immediately before complete uncoupling yielded a single-channel conductance, gamma j, of 40.5 pS, implying that TPA affects the channel kinetics rather than gamma j. TPA-induced uncoupling was observed at subphysiological levels of cytosolic Ca2+ (pipette solution = 18 nM), not at physiological levels (pipette solution = 170 nM). The effects of TPA could not be mimicked by 250 microM 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG). Preincubation with TPA (up to 24 h) revealed no changes in gj attributable to down-regulation of protein kinase C, PKC. Pretreatment with PKC inhibitors, staurosporine or PKCI, prevented the TPA-dependent decrease in gj. TPA-dependent uncoupling was not impaired by 4-bromophenacyl bromide, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2, PLA2; conversely, an -dependent decrease in gj was not prevented by PKCI. This suggests that gj regulation does not involve an interaction between PLA2 and PKC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8825530>Regulation of tight junction resistance in T84 monolayers by elevation in intracellular Ca2+: a protein kinase C effect.</a></h2><p>Elevation in intracellular Ca2+ acting via protein kinase C (PKC) is shown to regulate tight junction resistance in T84 cells, a human colon cancer line and a model Cl- secretory epithelial cell. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187, which was used to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, caused a decrease in tight junction resistance in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Dual Na+/mannitol serosal-to-mucosal flux analysis performed across the T84 monolayers treated with 2 microM A23187 revealed that A23187 increased both fluxes and that in the presence of ionophore there was a linear relationship between the Na+ and mannitol fluxes with a slope of 56.4, indicating that the decrease in transepithelial resistance was due to a decrease in tight junction resistance. Whereas there was no effect of 0.1 microM A23187, 1 or 2 microM produced a 55% decrease in baseline resistance in 1 hr and 10 microM decreased resistance more than 80%. The A23187-induced decrease in tight junction resistance was partially reversible by washing 3 times with a Ringer's-HCO3 solution containing 1% BSA. The A23187 effect on resistance was dependent on intracellular Ca2+; loading the T84 cells with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA significantly reduced the decrease in tight junction resistance caused by A23187. This intracellular Ca2+ effect was mediated by protein kinase C and not calmodulin. While the protein kinase C antagonist H-7 totally prevented the action of A23187 on tight junction resistance, the Ca2+/calmodulin inhibitor W13 did not have any effect. Sphingosine, another inhibitor of PKC, partially reduced the A23187-induced decline in tight junction resistance. The PKC agonist PMA mimicked the A23187 effect on resistance, although the effect was delayed up to 1 hr after exposure. In addition, however, PMA also caused an earlier increase in resistance, indicating it had an additional effect in addition to mimicking the effect of elevating Ca2+. The effects of a phospholipase inhibitor (mepacrine) and of inhibitors of  metabolism (indomethacin for the cyclooxygenase pathway, NDGA for the lipoxygenase pathway, and SKF 525A for the epoxygenase pathway) on the A23187 action were also examined. None of these agents altered the A23187-induced decrease in resistance. Monolayers exposed to 2 microM A23187 for 1 hr were stained with fluorescein conjugated phalloidin, revealing that neighboring cells did not part one from another and that A23187 did not have a detectable effect on distribution of F-actin in the perijunctional actomyosin ring. The results indicate that elevation in intracellular Ca2+ decreases tight junction resistance in the T84 monolayer, acting through protein kinase C by a mechanism which does not involve visible changes in the perijunctional actomyosin ring.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29568904>Roles of elevated 20‑HETE in the breakdown of blood brain  and the severity of brain edema in experimental traumatic brain injury.</a></h2><p>Breakdown of the blood brain  (BBB) is a secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can lead to the development of brain edema. However, the factors that contribute to the disruption of the BBB and increase the severity of brain edema in TBI remain to be elucidated. 20‑hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20‑HETE) is a metabolite of . The inhibition of 20‑HETEsynthesis by HET0016 has been suggested as a strategy to decrease brain edema. The present study aimed to investigate whether the elevated production of 20‑HETE in cerebral tissue may contribute to BBB breakdown and increase the severity of brain edema in rats with TBI. BBB permeability was quantified using dynamic contrast‑enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and brain edema was measured according to brain water content. Superoxide production in injured tissue was also assessed. Liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry was used to evaluate 20‑HETE production in injured tissue. Western blot analysis was used to assess the expression of occludin, zonula occludens (ZO)‑1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑9, and proteins of the c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. A total of 3, 24 and 72 h following the induction of TBI, 20‑HETE levels, BBB permeability and brain edema were identified to be increased, accompanied by an increase in superoxide production. Conversely, superoxide dismutase levels, in addition to the total antioxidative capability were decreased. In addition, the expression of MMP‑9 and proteins of the JNK pathway was upregulated, whereas the expression of occludin and ZO‑1 was observed to be suppressed. These results suggested that 20‑HETE may aggravate BBB disruption following TBI, via enhancing the expression of MMP‑9 and tight junction proteins. Furthermore, oxidative stress and the JNK signaling pathway may be involved in BBB dysregulation. In conclusion, the results of the present demonstrated that the production of 20‑HETE was increased in cerebral tissue following traumatic injury, thus suggesting that it may contribute to the compromise of BBB  and the development of brain edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17608718>Bacterial-induced hepoxilin A3 secretion as a pro-inflammatory mediator.</a></h2><p>Bacterial infections at epithelial surfaces, such as those that line the gut and the lung, stimulate the migration of neutrophils through the co-ordinated actions of chemoattractants secreted from pathogen-stimulated epithelial cells. One such factor involved in attracting polymorphonuclear leukocytes across the epithelium and into the lumen has until recently remained elusive. In 2004, we identified the eicosanoid, hepoxilin A(3), to be selectively secreted from the apical surface of human intestinal or lung epithelial cells stimulated with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. In this role, the function of hepoxilin A(3) is to guide neutrophils, via the establishment of a gradient, across the epithelial  complex. Interestingly, interruption of the synthetic pathway of hepoxilin A(3) blocks the apical release of hepoxilin A(3)in vitro and the transmigration of neutrophils induced by S. typhimurium both in in vitro and in vivo models of inflammation. Such results have led to the discovery of a completely novel pathway that is not only critical for responses to bacterial pathogens but also has broad implications for inflammatory responses affecting mucosal surfaces in general. Thus, the objective of this review was to highlight the recent findings that implicate hepoxilin A(3) as a key regulator of mucosal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18941231>Cannabinoids inhibit HIV-1 Gp120-mediated insults in brain microvascular endothelial cells.</a></h2><p>HIV-1 infection has significant effect on the immune system as well as on the nervous system. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is frequently observed in patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) despite lack of productive infection of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Cellular products and viral proteins secreted by HIV-1 infected cells, such as the HIV-1 Gp120 envelope glycoprotein, play important roles in BBB impairment and HIV-associated dementia development. HBMEC are a major component of the BBB. Using cocultures of HBMEC and human astrocytes as a model system for human BBB as well as in vivo model, we show for the first time that cannabinoid agonists inhibited HIV-1 Gp120-induced calcium influx mediated by substance P and significantly decreased the permeability of HBMEC as well as prevented  protein down-regulation of ZO-1, claudin-5, and JAM-1 in HBMEC. Furthermore, cannabinoid agonists inhibited the transmigration of human monocytes across the BBB and blocked the BBB permeability in vivo. These results demonstrate that cannabinoid agonists are able to restore the integrity of HBMEC and the BBB following insults by HIV-1 Gp120. These studies may lead to better strategies for treatment modalities targeted to the BBB following HIV-1 infection of the brain based on cannabinoid pharmacotherapies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26808080>The endogenous cannabinoid anandamide increases human airway epithelial cell permeability through an  metabolite.</a></h2><p>Injury to the bronchial epithelium in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD results in the loss of  function and an elevated sensitivity to environmental insults. An increased release of the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide in response to inhalation of allergen in asthmatic patients has been reported. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine the effects of endocannabinoids on bronchial epithelial cell permeability and to investigate the mechanisms involved. Calu-3 human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured at air-liquid interface to allow development of tight junctions. Changes in Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER), a reflection of epithelial permeability, were measured at various time points post-treatment, and expression of the tight junction proteins, occludin and ZO-1, were determined using Western immunoblotting. Anandamide produced a significant reduction in TEER, which was unaffected by cannabinoid receptor antagonists, but attenuated by URB597, an inhibitor of fatty  amide hydrolase, and by a combination of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) blockade. The anandamide metabolite, , showed similar TEER decrease that was also prevented in the presence of COX and LOX inhibitor. Expression of occludin and ZO-1 were also reduced by anandamide. These findings indicate a pro-inflammatory-like effect of anandamide on bronchial epithelial permeability, mediated by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites, and suggest that inhibition of anandamide degradation might provide a novel approach to treat airway inflammation.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Each eicosanoid (prostanoid, leukotriene, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ) preferentially recognizes one or more receptors coupled to one or more signal-transduction processes. This overview focuses on the role of eicosanoid receptors in the maintenance of intestinal epithelium physiology through the control of proliferation/differentiation/apoptosis processes. Furthermore, it is reported that the role of these receptors on the regulation of the  function of the intestinal epithelium have arisen through the regulation of absorption/secretion processes, tight-junction state and the control of the intestinal immune response. Also, this review considers the implication of AA cascade in the disruption of epithelial homeostasis during inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer as well as the therapeutic values and potential of the eicosanoid receptors as novel targets for the treatments of the pathologies above mentioned.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that LCPUFAs play an essential role in priming postnatal gut development. We studied the effect of LCPUFAs on postnatal gut development using fat-1 transgenic mice, which are capable of converting n-6 to n-3 LCPUFAs, and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice.Distal ileum sections were collected from fat-1 and WT mice on days 3, 14, and 28. Fatty  analyses, histology, RT-qPCR and intestinal permeability were performed.Fat-1 mice, relative to WT mice, showed increased n-3 LCPUFAs levels (α-linolenic , docosahexaenoic , and eicosapentaenoic , p < 0.05) and decreased  levels (p < 0.05) in the ileum. Preweaning fat-1 mice, compared to WT, showed >50% reduced muc2, Tff3, TLR9, and Camp expression (p < 0.05), markers of the innate immune response. There was a >two-fold increased expression of Fzd5 and EphB2, markers of cell differentiation (p < 0.05), and Fabp2 and 6, regulators of fatty  transport and metabolism (p < 0.05). Despite reduced expression of  genes, intestinal permeability in fat-1 was comparable to WT mice.Our data support the hypothesis that fatty  profiles early in development modulate intestinal gene expression in formative domains, such as cell differentiation, , other innate host defenses, and lipid metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514943>Regulation of tight junction permeability and occludin expression by polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>Tight junctions (TJ) are the topical most structure in epithelial and endothelial cells and play a key role in the control of permeability and prevention of tumour cell invasion of endothelium. In this study we examined the effects of a range of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the  of TJs and the expression of occludin, a key molecule in the TJs of the human vascular endothelial cell line, ECV304. Treatment of the endothelial cells with gamma linolenic , an anti-cancer PUFA, increased the transendothelial cell resistance (TER) and reduced the paracellular permeability to large molecules. The effects were seen without any changes in the viability of the endothelial cells. Occludin, a recently identified molecule, which plays a major role in tight junctions was up-regulated by this fatty  as revealed by both Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Other fatty acids were also tested. Eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) also exerted an up-regulatory effect, but LA and AA down-regulated the expression. We conclude that GLA and EPA which also have other anti-cancer effects, regulate the expression of occludin in endothelial cells and thus contribute to the modification of the TER of these cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24338688>Vascular endothelial  and barrier function are disrupted by 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  partly via protein kinase C ε-mediated zona occludens-1 phosphorylation at threonine 770/772.</a></h2><p>Disruption of  (TJs) perturbs endothelial barrier function and promotes inflammation. Previously, we have shown that 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15(S)-HETE), the major 15-lipoxygenase 1 (15-LO1) metabolite of , by stimulating zona occludens (ZO)-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its dissociation from claudins 1/5, induces endothelial TJ disruption and its barrier dysfunction. Here, we have studied the role of serine/threonine phosphorylation of TJ proteins in 15(S)-HETE-induced endothelial TJ disruption and its barrier dysfunction. We found that 15(S)-HETE enhances ZO-1 phosphorylation at Thr-770/772 residues via PKCε-mediated MEK1-ERK1/2 activation, causing ZO-1 dissociation from occludin, disrupting endothelial TJs and its barrier function, and promoting monocyte transmigration; these effects were reversed by T770A/T772A mutations. In the arteries of WT mice ex vivo, 15(S)-HETE also induced ZO-1 phosphorylation and endothelial TJ disruption in a PKCε and MEK1-ERK1/2-dependent manner. In line with these observations, in WT mice high fat diet feeding induced 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) expression in the endothelium and caused disruption of its TJs and barrier function. However, in 12/15-LO(-/-) mice, high fat diet feeding did not cause disruption of endothelial TJs and barrier function. These observations suggest that the 12/15-LO-12/15(S)-HETE axis, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of ZO-2, also stimulates threonine phosphorylation of ZO-1 in the mediation of endothelial TJ disruption and its barrier dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2439587>Co-culture of human lung-derived mast cells with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts: morphology and IgE-mediated release of histamine, prostaglandin D2, and leukotrienes.</a></h2><p>Human mast cells, dispersed from lung tissue by proteolytic treatment and enriched to a purity of 23 to 68% by density-gradient centrifugation, were maintained ex vivo for up to 13 days when co-cultured with mouse skin-derived 3T3 fibroblasts in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The human mast cells were adherent to the fibroblast cultures within 2 to 4 hr after seeding, and after 7 days of co-culture were localized between the layers of fibroblasts. The cell surfaces of the mast cells and the fibroblasts did not form , but rather approached within 20 nm of each other. The co-cultured mast cells did not divide; they maintained their cellular content of histamine and TAMe esterase and resembled in vivo mast cells in that their secretory granules exhibited scroll patterns and their nuclei were oval. Both the freshly isolated and the co-cultured mast cells responded to activation with anti-human IgE by exocytosing histamine and generating and releasing  metabolites. When freshly isolated mast cells were activated immunologically, they exocytosed 38 +/- 8% of their total histamine content and released 28 +/- 1.9 ng (mean +/- range, n = 2) of immunoreactive equivalents of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) per microgram of total cellular histamine, but did not generate significant amounts of either leukotriene C4 (LTC4) or leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The 1-wk co-cultured mast cells, on the other hand, exocytosed 43 +/- 2.4% of their total histamine content, and released 86 +/- 10, 43 +/- 20, and 5.2 +/- 5.2 ng (mean +/- SD, n = 4) of immunoreactive equivalents of PGD2, LTC4, and LTB4, respectively, per microgram of histamine. Thus, human lung-derived mast cells can be maintained ex vivo when co-cultured with fibroblasts, and, when treated with anti-IgE, they metabolize  via both the cyclooxygenase and the 5-lipoxygenase pathways.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453388>Effect of eicosapentaenoic -derived prostaglandin E3 on intestinal epithelial barrier function.</a></h2><p>Prostaglandins (PG) are inflammatory mediators derived from  or eicosapentaenoic  giving rise to the 2-series or the 3-series prostanoids, respectively. Previously, we have observed that PGE2 disrupts epithelial barrier function. Considering the beneficial effect of fish oil consumption in intestinal inflammatory processes, the aim of this study was to assess the role of PGE3 on epithelial barrier function assessed from transepithelial electrical resistance and dextran fluxes in Caco-2 cells. The results indicate that PGE3 increased paracellular permeability (PP) to the same extent as PGE2, through the interaction with EP1 and EP4 receptors and with intracellular Ca(2+) and cAMP as the downstream targets. Moreover, we observed a redistribution of  proteins, occludin and claudin-4. In conclusion, PGE3 is able to increase PP thus leading to reconsider the role of PGE2/PGE3 ratio in the beneficial effects of dietary fish oil supplementation in the disruption of barrier function.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Using MDCK cells grown in dual sided chambers, we show in this report, that a) the receptor mediated release of prostaglandins and arachidonate into the extracellular medium is predominantly unidirectional, b) the direction of release is agonist specific, and c) the magnitude of the response due to a given agonist is cell-domain specific.

However, the mechanisms of its involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease are not clear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms by which 12/15-LO mediates endothelial dysfunction. 15(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15(S)-HETE), the major 12/15-LO metabolite of  (AA), induced endothelial barrier permeability via Src and Pyk2-dependent zonula occluden (ZO)-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its dissociation from the  complexes. 15(S)-HETE also stimulated macrophage adhesion to the endothelial monolayer in Src and Pyk2-dependent manner. Ex vivo studies revealed that exposure of arteries from WT mice to AA or 15(S)-HETE led to Src-Pyk2-dependent ZO-2 tyrosine phosphorylation,  disruption, and macrophage adhesion, whereas the arteries from 12/15-LO knock-out mice are protected from these effects of AA. Feeding WT mice with a high-fat diet induced the expression of 12/15-LO in the arteries leading to  disruption and macrophage adhesion and deletion of the 12/15-LO gene disallowed these effects. Thus, the findings of this study provide the first evidence of the role of 12/15-LO and its AA metabolite, 15(S)-HETE, in high-fat diet-induced endothelial  disruption and macrophage adhesion, the crucial events underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1671756>Differences in lipid characteristics of undifferentiated and enterocytic-differentiated HT29 human colonic cells.</a></h2><p>In this paper we compared several lipid characteristics of the homogenate and the corresponding plasma membrane in undifferentiated and differentiated HT29 human colon cancer cells, using normal human colonic cells as a reference. Electron microscopy showed that HT29 cells were morphologically undifferentiated when cultured in the presence of either glucose or inosine without glucose at early confluency. On the contrary, HT29 cells cultured at late confluency in a glucose-free medium containing inosine or grown in nude mice exhibited an enterocytic differentiation with the presence of  and an apical brush border. The cell homogenate and the plasma membrane were prepared from each cell type. The study of specific marker enzymes showed the same degree of purity in all plasma membranes, with a highly marked increase of brush border-associated hydrolases (N-aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase) only in the organelles isolated from differentiated HT29 and colonic cells. Respective similar increases in the amount of free cholesterol and phospholipid and in the free cholesterol:phospholipid molar ratio were found in the plasma membrane as compared with the homogenate in all HT29 cell types. This ratio, due to an increased phospholipid content in both homogenate and plasma membrane, was lowered in colonic cells. No differences in the phospholipid profile were found between the homogenates of all cell types and the plasma membrane of undifferentiated HT29 cells, with the exception of a decrease of cardiolipin in this organelle. On the contrary, the plasma membrane phospholipid composition was different from that of the corresponding homogenate in differentiated HT29 and colonic cells. The most striking changes were a highly increased sphingomyelin amount and concomitant decreases in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin. Moreover, differences in the percentage of phosphatidylcholine plus sphingomyelin as well as in phosphatidylcholine:sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and/or phosphatidylcholine molar ratios were also found. The monounsaturated:polyunsaturated fatty  ratio in phosphatidylethanolamine was similar in differentiated HT29 and colonic cells and lower than in undifferentiated HT29 cells. A decrease in this latter ratio in phosphatidylcholine was also observed in colonic cells and HT29 cells grown in nude mice. These changes were essentially due to opposite variations in the percentage of palmitoleic  and those of linoleic and/or  acids in both phospholipids. Thus, these data indicate that undifferentiated HT29 cells were characterized by the absence of a specific phospholipid composition in their plasma membrane, which is suggested to be related to altered phospholipid sorting. The plasma membrane phospholipid profile reversed essentially to the normal pattern when HT29 cells recovered the ability to differentiate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10935890>The blood-brain  and its role in inflammation.</a></h2><p>The unique microenvironment within the central nervous system (CNS) relies upon the integrity of the blood-brain  (BBB). This selectively permeable  comprises interendothelial tight junctions located at the capillaries and postcapillary venules. Cells and structures in the local environment are required to maintain normal BBB . When inflammation is present, the BBB itself plays an integral role in the inflammatory response by either producing or expressing a variety of cytokines, adhesion molecules, metalloproteinases, serine proteases, products of  metabolism, and nitric oxide. Understanding the role of the BBB during inflammation is essential when creating and employing a therapeutic regime for animals with CNS disease. This review focusses on recent discoveries about the BBB and its role in inflammation, and applies this knowledge to our current understanding of inflammatory CNS disease in dogs and cats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11379794>Regulation of blood-brain  permeability.</a></h2><p>The blood-brain  minimizes the entry of molecules into brain tissue. This restriction arises by the presence of tight junctions (zonulae occludens) between adjacent endothelial cells and a relative paucity of pinocytotic vesicles within endothelium of cerebral arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Many types of stimuli can alter the permeability characteristics of the blood-brain . Acute increases in arterial blood pressure beyond the autoregulatory capacity of cerebral blood vessels, application of hyperosmolar solutions, application of various inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during brain injury, and/or activation of blood-borne elements such as leukocytes can produce changes in permeability of the blood-brain . The second messenger systems that account for increases in permeability of the blood-brain  during pathophysiologic conditions, however, remain poorly defined. This review will summarize studies that have examined factors that influence disruption of the blood-brain , and will discuss the contribution of various cellular second messenger pathways in disruption of the blood-brain  during pathophysiologic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10832681>The resiliency of the corneal endothelium to refractive and intraocular surgery.</a></h2><p>To describe stress factors (phenylephrine and contact lenses) from the corneal epithelium that can affect the corneal endothelium, and to describe the effects of refractive and intraocular surgery on the corneal endothelial structure and .Significant clinical and experimental publications are reviewed and recent experiments conducted in the author's laboratory to describe the corneal endothelial stresses.The corneal epithelium serves as a  to topical phenylephrine (2.5-10%). In a compromised epithelium, topical phenylephrine will cause drug-induced stromal edema and endothelial vacuolization. Contact lenses are capable of stimulating the epithelial  cascade to release 12(R)hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (12(R)HETE) and 8(R)hydroxy-hexadecatrienoic  (8(R)HHDTrE) to cause endothelial Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-inhibition and polymegethism. Specular microscopy of the corneal endothelial cells after refractive surgery (photorefractive keratectomy [PRK], laser in situ keratomileusis [LASIK], intrastromal rings [INTACs]) has shown that there is minimal effect. However, laser ablation of the stroma within 200 microm of the corneal endothelium will result in endothelial cell structural changes and the formation of the amorphous substance deposited onto Descemet's membrane. Phacoemulsification with a high flow of the irrigation solution can alter the endothelial surface glycoprotein layer. Lidocaine hydrochloride (1%) used as intracameral anesthesia readily diffuses through the corneal endothelium, resulting in stromal uptake and endothelial cell swelling. With phacoemulsification, however, the washout of lidocaine from the cornea (T1/2, 5 minutes) and iris (T1/2, 9 minutes) occurs quickly. Corneal endothelial wound healing after keratoplasty occurs in the following sequence: migration of endothelial cells, development of tight junctions, and the formation of Na+/K+ ATPase pump sites.Corneal endothelial resiliency is due to the increased peripheral endothelial cell number for migration, the ability of endothelial cells to form tight junctions to maintain the endothelial , the increase in endothelial Na+/K+ ATPase pump sites under stress, and the ability of the corneal endothelial cells to shift their metabolism of glucose to the hexose monophosphate shunt for the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and membrane repair. All of these factors are important, along with the aqueous humor sodium concentration, which establishes the osmotic gradient for corneal deturgescence and transparency.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10696506>Inflammatory mediators and modulation of blood-brain  permeability.</a></h2><p>1. Unlike some interfaces between the blood and the nervous system (e.g., nerve perineurium), the brain endothelium forming the blood-brain  can be modulated by a range of inflammatory mediators. The mechanisms underlying this modulation are reviewed, and the implications for therapy of the brain discussed. 2. Methods for measuring blood-brain  permeability in situ include the use of radiolabeled tracers in parenchymal vessels and measurements of transendothelial resistance and rate of loss of fluorescent dye in single pial microvessels. In vitro studies on culture models provide details of the signal transduction mechanisms involved. 3. Routes for penetration of polar solutes across the brain endothelium include the paracellular tight junctional pathway (usually very tight) and vesicular mechanisms. Inflammatory mediators have been reported to influence both pathways, but the clearest evidence is for modulation of tight junctions. 4. In addition to the brain endothelium, cell types involved in inflammatory reactions include several closely associated cells including pericytes, astrocytes, smooth muscle, microglia, mast cells, and neurons. In situ it is often difficult to identify the site of action of a vasoactive agent. In vitro models of brain endothelium are experimentally simpler but may also lack important features generated in situ by cell:cell interaction (e.g. induction, signaling). 5. Many inflammatory agents increase both endothelial permeability and vessel diameter, together contributing to significant leak across the blood-brain  and cerebral edema. This review concentrates on changes in endothelial permeability by focusing on studies in which changes in vessel diameter are minimized. 6. Bradykinin (Bk) increases blood-brain  permeability by acting on B2 receptors. The downstream events reported include elevation of [Ca2+]i, activation of phospholipase A2, release of , and production of free radicals, with evidence that IL-1 beta potentiates the actions of Bk in ischemia. 7. Serotonin (5HT) has been reported to increase blood-brain  permeability in some but not all studies. Where  opening was seen, there was evidence for activation of 5-HT2 receptors and a calcium-dependent permeability increase. 8. Histamine is one of the few central nervous system neurotransmitters found to cause consistent blood-brain  opening. The earlier literature was unclear, but studies of pial vessels and cultured endothelium reveal increased permeability mediated by H2 receptors and elevation of [Ca2+]i and an H1 receptor-mediated reduction in permeability coupled to an elevation of cAMP. 9. Brain endothelial cells express nucleotide receptors for ATP, UTP, and ADP, with activation causing increased blood-brain  permeability. The effects are mediated predominantly via a P2U (P2Y2) G-protein-coupled receptor causing an elevation of [Ca2+]i; a P2Y1 receptor acting via inhibition of adenyl cyclase has been reported in some in vitro preparations. 10.  is elevated in some neural pathologies and causes gross opening of the blood-brain  to large molecules including proteins. There is evidence that  acts via generation of free radicals in the course of its metabolism by cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. 11. The mechanisms described reveal a range of interrelated pathways by which influences from the brain side or the blood side can modulate blood-brain  permeability. Knowledge of the mechanisms is already being exploited for deliberate opening of the blood-brain  for drug delivery to the brain, and the pathways capable of reducing permeability hold promise for therapeutic treatment of inflammation and cerebral edema.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20457139>Role of eicosanoids on intestinal epithelial homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The intestinal epithelium is a highly dynamic system that is continuously renewed by a process involving cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, it is the main interface with the external environment, and maintenance and regulation of the epithelial structure and epithelial barrier function are key determinants of digestive health and host well being. The , a multiprotein complex composed of transmembrane proteins associated with the cytoskeletal peri-junctional ring of actin and myosin, is an essential component of this barrier that is strictly regulated in a spatio-temporal manner by a complex signaling network. Defects in the intestinal epithelial barrier function have been observed in inflammatory bowel disease, and a classic example of the connection between inflammation and cancer is the increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In recent years, several molecules have emerged as critical players contributing to inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. For example, eicosanoids derived from  are proposed as mediators involved in the regulation of epithelial structure/function. Interestingly, the tissue concentration of eicosanoids increases during mucosal inflammation and colorectal cancer development. This overview focuses on the physiological and physiopathological roles of eicosanoids in cell growth/cell differentiation/apoptosis and in the paracellular permeability of the intestinal epithelium. A better understanding of these processes will foster new ideas for the development of therapies for these chronic disorders.2010 Elsevier Inc.

We recently reported that PLA2 mediates hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to lysophosphatidylcholine (L-PC) when both are applied to the apical surface of cultured EC monolayers, resulting in increased bacterial translocation (BT) and decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Free fatty acids (FFA) are the other products of this reaction, however, their effect on Caco-2 cell permeability has not been reported. In addition to PC, other luminal phospholipids are present at the surface of the enterocyte. PLA2 may also mediate the hydrolysis of luminal phospholipids other than PC. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of phospholipids other than PC and common FFA on intestinal epithelial permeability and BT. Human Caco-2 enterocytes were grown to confluence on porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system. Monolayer integrity and  permeability were measured as TEER. First, common FFA released by PC hydrolysis were determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). In separate experiments, monolayers were treated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (L-PE), or palmitoleic , oleic acids, linoleic acids, and  solubilized in solution with PC. The magnitude of BT was determined 2 h after treatment by adding Escherichia coli C25 to the apical chamber followed by quantitatively culturing basal-chamber samples. Statistical analysis was by the Kurosaki-Wallis test. TLC of PC samples incubated with PLA2 on the apical surface of Caco-2 monolayers demonstrated the production of palmitoleic , oleic acids, linoleic acids, and . L-PE significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, but to a lesser degree than L-PC alone. L-PE had no effects on BT. Palmitoleic  and oleic  likewise significantly decreased TEER compared to controls, however, less than L-PC. All FFA tested had no effect on BT. Phospholipids applied to the apical surface of enterocytes, such as those found in vivo in mucus, can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme PLA2 resulting in lysophospholipid and FFA species that can alter enterocyte monolayer permeability. However, FFA and L-PL, other than L-PC, appear to have no effect to stimulate BT. This observation may have clinical implications in the pathogenesis and treatment strategies for IBD patients in whom enterocyte PLA2 activity has been shown to be elevated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3091250>Morphology of  in the ciliary epithelium of rabbits during -induced breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier.</a></h2><p>A reversible breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier in the iridial processes of rabbits has been induced by  as demonstrated by the passage of horseradish peroxidase at places through the . Freeze-fracture images reveal very discontinuous P-face ridges. However, the analysis of complementary replicas demonstrates that discontinuities of P-face ridges are always complemented by particles or short bars found in the E-face furrows. Though the problem exists of correlating freeze-fracture images of the junctional structure to the focal passage of horseradish peroxidase, the data suggest that the discontinuities of P-face ridges cannot be the structural counterpart of the passage of horseradish peroxidase.

The effect of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, lipoxygenase inhibitors, NDGA or AA861, and antioxidant, BHT, was evaluated as a mechanism to change  permeability.Caco-2 cells formed polarized columnar epithelial cells with densely packed microvilli and well developed junctional complexes. Addition of EPA enhanced FS permeability to 3.0+/-1.6-fold and lowered TEER to 0.59+/-1.2-fold vs. control with concentration dependency without cell injury (P<0.01-0.05). OA, AA or LA did not change, but ALA enhanced  permeability.

To clarify that role, the present study characterized the epithelial cell line VNCC, derived from normal adult dog distal colon.Cells were cultured on plastic and permeable supports for analysis of eicosanoid production (by radioimmunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography) and transport characteristics (by Ussing chamber short-circuit determinations).In culture, VNCC formed confluent monolayers and domes, suggesting formation of tight junctions and active solute absorption. When cultured on permeable supports, VNCC developed modest, but variable, transepithelial resistances (563 +/- 94 omega/cm2) with a spontaneous short-circuit current of 5.0 +/- 0.4 microA/cm2. Forskolin caused a prolonged increase in the short-circuit current, inhibited by amiloride but not bumetanide, suggesting that VNCC display 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate-stimulated sodium absorption. VNCC incubated with  released a variety of eicosanoids including 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG)F1 alpha, PGE2, thromboxane B2, and PGF2 alpha, but no hydroxyarachidonate metabolites. Bradykinin stimulated VNCC eicosanoid release.The ability of VNCC to divide and differentiate in culture, to form polarized monolayers capable of active sodium absorption, and to respond to inflammatory mediators with eicosanoid release makes them a unique tool for the study of the interactions of inflammation on colonocyte .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1707515>Effects of  on the gap  of neonatal rat heart cells.</a></h2><p>Myocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and grown in tissue-culture dishes for 1-2 days. Spontaneously formed cell pairs were used to study the conductance of gap . The experiments involved a double voltage-clamp approach and whole-cell, -seal recording. Exposure to  (AA) produced a quasi dose-dependent decrease in junctional conductance, gi (binding constant, Kd = 4 microM; Hill coefficient, n = 0.75). AA-dependent uncoupling was reversible. Addition of 1 mg/ml albumin to the bath solution accelerated the recovery. During control, cell pairs exhibited a gradual decrease in gi (16.4% in 6 min). Exposure to 20 microM 4-bromophenacyl bromide, a phospholipase inhibitor, suppressed the decay in gi (1.8% in 6 min), suggesting that endogenous AA may be involved in spontaneous uncoupling. The effect of AA on gi was specific. Arachidic  (100 microM) and arachidonamide (10 microM), structural analogues of AA, had no effect on gi. Currents recorded shortly before complete uncoupling caused by AA, or early during recovery from uncoupling, revealed random opening and closing of single channels. The single channel conductance, gamma i, was not affected by the concentration of AA (1 microM - 100 microM). The mean gamma i turned out to be 33.5 pS. The results suggest that AA-dependent uncoupling was caused via decrease in open channel probability, presumably mediated by a direct action on channel proteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26691993>Lipid metabolites of the phospholipase A2 pathway and inflammatory cytokines are associated with brain volume in paediatric cerebral malaria.</a></h2><p>Cerebral malaria (CM) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. CM mortality has been associated with increased brain volume, seen on neuroimaging studies.To examine the potential role of blood metabolites and inflammatory mediators in increased brain volume in Malawian children with CM, an association study was performed between plasma metabolites, cytokine levels and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity with brain volume.The metabolomics analysis demonstrated  and other lysophospholipids to be positively associated with brain swelling. These lipids are products of the PLA2 enzyme and an association of plasma PLA2 enzymatic activity with brain swelling was confirmed. TNFα, which can upregulate PLA2 activity, was associated with brain volume. In addition, CCL2 and IL-8 were also associated with brain volume. Some of these cytokines can alter endothelial cell  proteins and increase blood brain barrier permeability.Taken together, paediatric CM brain volume was associated with products of the PLA2 pathway and inflammatory cytokines. Their role in causality is unknown. These molecules will need to undergo testing in vitro and in animal models to understand their role in processes of increased brain volume. These observations provide novel data on host physiology associated with paediatric CM brain swelling, and may both inform pathogenesis models and suggest adjunct therapies that could improve the morbidity and mortality associated with paediatric CM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2046916>Mechanisms of blood-brain barrier breakdown.</a></h2><p>The functional status of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) must be taken into account when designing and interpreting brain imaging techniques. The integrity of the BBB is affected in many diseases of the brain, with the potential involvement of a number of different but poorly understood cellular mechanisms. Factors known to disrupt the BBB experimentally include  and the eicosanoids, bradykinin, histamine and free radicals. These active compounds, released in pathological tissue, may alter cytosolic calcium levels and induce second messenger systems leading to an alteration in BBB permeability.

The modulators included two membrane-permeable analogues of DAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl glycerol (OAG) and dioctanoyl glycerol (DiC8); thapsigargin, which releases Ca++ from intracellular stores; ionomycin, a calcium ionophore; lanthanum chloride, an inorganic calcium channel blocker; nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker; quinacrine diHCl, a phospholipase A2 antagonist; melittin, a phospholipase A2 agonist; and indomethacin, which decreases the release of prostaglandins by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase. The main findings were: OAG (125 microM) and DiC8 (100 microM) blocked the responses of several bitter compounds while enhancing the taste response to several sweeteners. Lanthanum chloride blocked all responses, which may be due to the fact that it blocks tight junctions. Quinacrine (1 mM) suppressed several bitter responses while enhancing the response to several sweeteners. The enhancement of sweet taste responses by DAG analogues suggests that there is cross-talk between the adenylate cyclase system and one (or more) pathways involving lipid-derived second messengers in taste cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1280703>Development and characterization of rabbit proximal tubular epithelial cell lines.</a></h2><p>We have isolated rabbit kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell lines. The selection was based on their ability to form confluent monolayers on porous supports and to maintain receptor-mediated signal transduction and ion transport, characteristic of the proximal tubule. The isolation method consisted of several steps: (1) superficial cortical proximal tubule segments were microdissected and cultured on a matrix-coated porous support until cells formed a confluent monolayer; (2) primary cultures showing hormone-regulated ion transport typical for the proximal tubule were selected and co-cultured with irradiated fibroblasts; and (3) the epithelial cells surviving after several passages were expanded and passaged on porous substrates. Most of the cell lines developed in this manner were obtained by co-culture with irradiated fibroblasts producing a recombinant retrovirus encoding SV40 large T antigen and G418 resistance. However, SV40 T antigen expression was not essential for immortalization, since neither T antigen nor G418 resistance was detected in the isolated cell lines and co-culture with non-producing 3T3 cells gave similar results. One cell line (vEPT) has been characterized in some detail with respect to morphological, biochemical, and ion transport properties. This line forms confluent monolayers with apical microvilli, , and convolutions of the basolateral plasma membrane. Once confluent, monolayers maintain conductances of 25 to 32 mS/cm2 for several weeks in culture and possess phlorizin-sensitive short-circuit current (Isc) in glucose containing media, indicative of apical Na(+)-glucose co-transport. vEPT cells also retain receptor and signaling mechanisms for angiotensin II (Ang II). Apical and basal Ang II and 5,6-epoxy-eicosatrienoic  (5,6-EET) modulate the Isc in a manner similar to primary cultures. The cell lines share with primary cultures expression of the cytokeratins K8, K10/K11, and K19 ("nomenclature" [21]). They also retain several receptor and signal transduction mechanisms. For example, Ang II, arachidonate, bradykinin, 5,6-EET, parathyroid hormone (residues 1 through 34), and purine nucleotides increase cytosolic Ca2+, PTH elevates cAMP levels, and Ang II enhances proximal tubule-specific  metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24066055>Eicosapentaenoic  enhances heat stress-impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function in Caco-2 cells.</a></h2><p>Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial  (TJ) barrier is known to have an important etiologic role in the pathophysiology of heat stroke.
