<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20942393>Cholesterol slows down the lateral mobility of an oxidized phospholipid in a supported  bilayer.</a></h2><p>We investigated the mobility and phase-partitioning of the fluorescent oxidized phospholipid analogue 1--2-glutaroyl-sn--3---Alexa647- (PGPE-Alexa647) in supported  bilayers. Compared to the conventional phospholipid dihexadecanoylphosphoethanolamine (DHPE)-Bodipy we found consistently higher diffusion constants. The effect became dramatic when immobile obstacles were inserted into the bilayer, which essentially blocked the diffusion of DHPE-Bodipy but hardly influenced the movements of PGPE-Alexa647. In a supported  bilayer made of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn--3-phosphocholine (DOPC), the differences in probe mobility leveled off with increasing cholesterol content. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we could ascribe this effect to increased interactions between the oxidized phospholipid and the membrane matrix, concomitant with a translation in the headgroup position of the oxidized phospholipid: at zero cholesterol content, its headgroup is shifted to the outside of the DOPC headgroup region, whereas increasing cholesterol concentrations pulls the headgroup into the bilayer plane.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3006763>-protein interactions in cytochrome c oxidase. A comparison of covalently attached phospholipid photo-spin-label with label free to diffuse in the bilayer.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to clarify the possible origins of the motion-restricted electron spin resonance (ESR) spectral component observed in membranes. For this purpose, a phospholipid photo-spin-label was synthesized, characterized, and used to study -protein interactions in beef heart cytochrome c oxidase. The probe was designed with a nitroaryl azide incorporated in the phospholipid head group, and a spin-label on the sn-2 side chain, and was radiolabeled. The resulting molecule, 1--2-(14-proxyl [2-3H]stearoyl)-sn--3---(4-azido-3-nitrophenyl)ethanolami ne, was stable under subdued light and during the procedures required to reconstitute cytochrome c oxidase in phospholipid bilayers. Upon photolysis, the photo-spin-label reacted with the protein in high yields (50% attached). There was no detectable destruction of the spin-label. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cytochrome c oxidase after reaction with the photo-spin-label showed highest levels of attachment to bands I, III, and VII, with some labeling of other bands. The labeling pattern demonstrated a distribution of attachment sites, which was needed for the spin-labeling studies. ESR spectra of the attached labels at 25 degrees C indicated a constant fraction of motion-restricted  chains, independent of the  to protein ratio. In contrast, a spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine and the prephotolyzed photo-spin-label, both free to diffuse in the bilayer, exhibited behavior in agreement with the multiple equilibria binding model. These results, as well as data obtained with membranes frozen at -196 degrees C, show how several situations that lead to a motion-restricted ESR line shape can be distinguished. This study provides additional evidence that the fraction of lipids normally in contact with protein, and not aggregation artifacts, accounts for the observed motion-restricted component of ESR spectra of reconstituted cytochrome c oxidase in phospholipid bilayers.</p><p>Keyword: fat metabolism</p></html>
