(TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) could alleviate the increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and prevent insulin resistance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of TUDCA and PBA on metabolism of Cu and Zn in diabetic mice model.  was induced by streptozotocin in FVB mice treated with and without TUDCA and PBA. Determination of Cu and Zn in tissues and serum by acid digestion was followed by ICP-MS. The renal and serum Cu levels were significantly higher, while the hepatic Cu and Zn levels were significantly decreased in the diabetic mice at 2 weeks and 2 months after  onset. The increase of cardiac Cu together with the decrease of muscular Zn was found in the diabetic mice only at 2 months. Cu levels were positively correlated with Zn in the heart, liver, kidney, muscle, spleen, and serum of diabetic and control mice at both 2 weeks and 2 months. Both PBA and TUDCA reduced serum Zn, and PBA reduced hepatic Cu to normal levels in the diabetic mice at two time points, while PBA normalized serum Cu in the diabetic mice only at 2 months. PBA increased hepatic Zn to normal levels in the diabetic mice at 2 weeks, while it partially increased hepatic Zn in the same group at 2 months. Therefore, maintaining homeostasis of Cu and Zn by TUDCA and PBA in  needs to be received with special attention.</p><p>Keyword: insulin resistance</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508171>EFFECTS OF EXENDIN-4 ON ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM STRESS-MEDIATED  IN 3T3-L1 ADIPOCYTES.</a></h2><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is suspected as an important factor in the initiation of .To explore the effects of exendin-4 (Ex-4) on the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated  in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver and plays an important role in regulating lipid, glucose and energy metabolism. Transgenic mice overexpressing CYP7A1 (CYP7A1-tg mice) were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced , fatty liver, and diabetes. However the mechanism of resistance to HFD-induced  of CYP7A1-tg mice has not been determined. In this study, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of CYP7A1-tg mice were analyzed to explore the metabolic alterations in CYP7A1-tg mice that govern the protection against  and insulin resistance by using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analyses. Lipidomics analysis identified seven lipid markers including lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and ceramides that were significantly decreased in serum of HFD-fed CYP7A1-tg mice. Metabolomics analysis identified 13 metabolites in bile acid synthesis including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, , taurocholic acid, and tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-β-MCA) that differed between CYP7A1-tg and wild-type mice. Notably, T-β-MCA, an antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was significantly increased in intestine of CYP7A1-tg mice. This study suggests that reducing 12α-hydroxylated bile acids and increasing intestinal T-β-MCA may reduce high fat diet-induced increase of phospholipids, sphingomyelins and ceramides, and ameliorate diabetes and .

However, the exact mechanisms whereby FGF21 mediates insulin sensitivity remain not fully understood. In the present study, FGF21was administrated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice and tunicamycin-induced 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and metabolic parameters, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress indicators, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting. The administration of FGF21 in obese mice reduced body weight, blood glucose and serum insulin, and increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in alleviation of insulin resistance. Meanwhile, FGF21 treatment reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress in adipose tissue of obese mice. Additionally, suppression of ER stress via the ER stress inhibitor  increased adiponectin expression and improved insulin resistance in obese mice and in tunicamycin-induced adipocytes. In conclusion, our results showed that the administration of FGF21 reversed suppression of adiponectin expression and restored insulin signaling via inhibiting ER stress under the condition of insulin resistance, demonstrating the causative role of ER stress in downregulating adiponectin levels.</p><p>Keyword: insulin resistance</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902174>Endoplasmic reticulum stress regulates inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle from pregnant women.</a></h2><p>Sterile inflammation and infection are key mediators of inflammation and peripheral insulin resistance associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Studies have shown endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to induce inflammation and insulin resistance associated with  and type 2 diabetes, however is paucity of studies investigating the effects of ER stress in skeletal muscle on inflammation and insulin resistance associated with GDM. ER stress proteins IRE1α, GRP78 and XBP-1s were upregulated in skeletal muscle of obese pregnant women, whereas IRE1α was increased in GDM women. Suppression of ER stress, using ER stress inhibitor  (TUDCA) or siRNA knockdown of IRE1α and GRP78, significantly downregulated LPS-, poly(I:C)- or IL-1β-induced production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and MCP-1. Furthermore, LPS-, poly(I:C)- or TNF-α-induced insulin resistance was improved following suppression of ER stress, by increasing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR-β, IRS-1, GLUT-4 expression and glucose uptake. In summary, our inducible  and GDM-like models suggests that the development of GDM may be involved in activating ER stress-induced inflammation and insulin resistance in human skeletal muscle.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the mechanism underlying how TUDCA is involved in insulin resistance is not fully understood. We tested the effects of TUDCA on autophagic dysfunction in obese mice.500 mg/kg of TUDCA was injected into obese mice, and metabolic parameters, autophagy markers, and insulin signaling molecular were assessed by Western blotting and real-time PCR.The TUDCA injections in the obese mice resulted in a reduced body weight gain, lower blood glucose, and improved insulin sensitivity compared with obese mice that were injected with vehicle. Meanwhile, TUDCA treatment not only reversed autophagic dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress, but also improved the impaired insulin signaling in the liver of obese mice. Additionally, the same results obtained with TUDCA were evident in obese mice treated with the adenoviral Atg7.We found that TUDCA reversed abnormal autophagy, reduced ER stress, and restored insulin sensitivity in the liver of obese mice and that glycolipid metabolism disorder was also improved via the restoration of defective hepatic autophagy.</p><p>Keyword: insulin resistance</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29139555> inhibits intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis is associated with the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Targeting the gut-liver axis and bile acid-based pharmaceuticals are potential therapies for NAFLD. The effect of  (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD, on intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, gut lipid transport and microbiota composition was analysed in a murine model of NAFLD.The NAFLD mouse model was established by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. TUDCA was administered p.o. during the last 4 weeks. The expression levels of intestinal tight junction genes, lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes were determined by quantitative PCR. Tissue inflammation was evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining. The gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.TUDCA administration attenuated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses,  and insulin resistance in mice. Moreover, TUDCA attenuated gut inflammatory responses as manifested by decreased intestinal histopathology scores and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, TUDCA improved intestinal barrier function by increasing levels of tight junction molecules and the solid chemical barrier. The components involved in ileum lipid transport were also reduced by TUDCA administration in HFD-fed mice. Finally, the TUDCA-treated mice showed a different gut microbiota composition compared with that in HFD-fed mice but similar to that in normal chow diet-fed mice.TUDCA attenuates the progression of HFD-induced NAFLD in mice by ameliorating gut inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, decreasing intestinal fat transport and modulating intestinal microbiota composition.© 2017 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><p>Keyword: insulin resistance</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25538147>Reversal of glucose intolerance in rat offspring exposed to ethanol before birth through reduction of nuclear skeletal muscle HDAC expression by the bile acid TUDCA.</a></h2><p>Prenatal ethanol exposure causes cellular stress, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in adult offspring, with increased gluconeogenesis and reduced muscle glucose transporter-4 (glut4) expression. Impaired insulin activation of Akt and nuclear translocation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the liver partly explain increased gluconeogenesis. The mechanism for the reduced glut4 is unknown. Pregnant rats were gavaged with ethanol over the last week of gestation and adult female offspring were studied. Some ethanol exposed offspring was treated with  (TUDCA) for 3 weeks. All these rats underwent intraperitoneal glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests. The expression of glut4, HDACs, and markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (XBP1, CHOP, ATF6) was examined in the gastrocnemius muscle fractions, and in C2C12 muscle cells cultured with ethanol, TUDCA, and HDAC inhibitors. Non-TUDCA-treated rats exposed to prenatal ethanol were insulin resistant and glucose intolerant with reduced muscle glut4 expression, increased ER marker expression, and increased nuclear HDACs, whereas TUDCA-treated rats had normal insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance with normal glut4 expression, ER marker expression, and HDAC levels. In C2C12 cells, ethanol reduced glut4 expression, but increased ER makers. While TUDCA restored glut4 and ER markers to control levels and HDAC inhibition rescued glut4 expression, HDAC inhibition had no effect on ER markers. The increase in nuclear HDAC levels consequent to prenatal ethanol exposure reduces glut4 expression in adult rat offspring, and this HDAC effect is independent of ER unfolded protein response. HDAC inhibition by TUDCA restores glut4 expression, with improvement in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.© 2014 The Authors.

Activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces proinflammatory response and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) activate TLR4, which induces ER stress and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we determined whether TLR4-mediated ER stress is an obligatory step mediating SFA-induced endothelial dysfunction. Palmitate stimulated proinflammatory responses and ER stress, and this was suppressed by knockdown of TLR4 in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Next, we examined the role of TLR4 in vasodilatory responses in intact vessels isolated from wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and TLR4-KO mice after feeding high-fat (HFD) or normal chow diet (NCD) for 12 wk. Arterioles isolated from HFD WT mice exhibited impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation compared with arterioles isolated from NCD WT mice. Deficiency of TLR4 was protective from HFD-induced impairment of insulin-stimulated vasodilation. There were no differences in acetylcholine (Ach)- or sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-stimulated vasodilation between the two groups. Furthermore, we examined whether ER stress is involved in SFA-induced impairment of vasodilator actions of insulin. Infusion of palmitate showed the impairment of vasodilatory response to insulin, which was ameliorated by coinfusion with  (TUDCA), an ER stress suppressor. Taken together, the results suggest that TLR4-induced ER stress may be an obligatory step mediating the SFA-mediated endothelial dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword: insulin resistance</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332392>Gut microbiota-bile acid-interleukin-22 axis orchestrates polycystic ovary syndrome.</a></h2><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries, and is often accompanied by insulin resistance. The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved metabolic health is associated with a relatively high microbiota gene content and increased microbial diversity. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS, accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and  levels. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from women with PCOS or B. vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid metabolism, reduced interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS. This study suggests that modifying the gut microbiota, altering bile acid metabolism and/or increasing IL-22 levels may be of value for the treatment of PCOS.</p><p>Keyword: insulin resistance</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30223017>RNF186 impairs insulin sensitivity by inducing ER stress in mouse primary hepatocytes.</a></h2><p>RING finger 186 (RNF186) is involved in the process of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-mediated apoptosis and inflammation of different cell types, such as HeLa cells and colon epithelial cells. However, the physiological and functional roles of RNF186 in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In the current study, we investigate the physiological function of RNF186 in the regulation of ER stress with respect to its biological roles in regulating insulin sensitivity in mouse primary hepatocytes. RNF186 expression is induced in the livers of diabetic, obese and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with Ad-RNF186 or Ad-GFP. The results suggest that overexpression of RNF186 increases the protein levels of the ER stress sensors inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) protein, as well as the phosphorylation level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in mouse primary hepatocytes. This effect impedes the action of insulin through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Furthermore, overexpression of RNF186 also significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1. In addition,  (TUDCA), an ER stress inhibitor, alleviates the expression of ER stress markers induced by RNF186 overexpression. Taken together, the results of the present study show that overexpression of RNF186 induces ER stress and impairs insulin signalling in mouse primary hepatocytes, suggesting that RNF186 merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of insulin-resistance-associated metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2018.
