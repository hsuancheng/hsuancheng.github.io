<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187204>Differentiating founder and chronic HIV envelope sequences.</a></h2><p>Significant progress has been made in characterizing broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV envelope glycoprotein Env, but an effective vaccine has proven elusive. Vaccine development would be facilitated if common features of early founder virus required for transmission could be identified. Here we employ a combination of bioinformatic and operations research methods to determine the most prevalent features that distinguish 78 subtype B and 55 subtype C founder Env sequences from an equal number of chronic sequences. There were a number of equivalent optimal networks (based on the fewest covarying amino acid (AA) pairs or a measure of maximal covariance) that separated founders from chronics: 13 pairs for subtype B and 75 for subtype C. Every subtype B optimal solution contained the founder pairs 178-346 Asn-, 232-236 Thr-Ser, 240-340 -, 279-315 Asp-, 291-792 Ala-Ile, 322-347 Asp-Thr, 535-620 Leu-Asp, 742-837 Arg-, and 750-836 Asp-Ile; the most common optimal pairs for subtype C were 644-781 -Ala (74 of 75 networks), 133-287 Ala-Gln (73/75) and 307-337 Ile-Gln (73/75). No pair was present in all optimal subtype C solutions highlighting the difficulty in targeting transmission with a single vaccine strain. Relative to the size of its domain (0.35% of Env), the α4β7 binding site occurred most frequently among optimal pairs, especially for subtype C: 4.2% of optimal pairs (1.2% for subtype B). Early sequences from 5 subtype B pre-seroconverters each exhibited at least one clone containing an optimal feature 553-624 (Ser-Asn), 724-747 (Arg-Arg), or 46-293 (Arg-Glu).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8244287>[Rat bladder ubiquitin-like molecule: isolation, purification and N-terminal sequencing].</a></h2><p>A Ubiquitin-like peptide was accidentally isolated from rat bladder by using 5% acetic acid wash while we were isolating antibacterial peptides. The purified molecule was obtained by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Gas phase microsequence analysis indicated the N-terminal sequences of the molecule as follows: MET-GLN-ILE----THR-LEU-THR-GLY--THR-ILE-THR-LEU- GLU--GLU-PRO-SER-ASP-THR-ILE-GLU-ASN, which is homologous to human ubiquitin. Ubiquitin plays a role in the differentiation of pre-B lymphocytes, Thus, it is suggested from the findings of this molecule and the endogenous antibacterial polypeptides in mucosa or mucosal epithelium that mucosal epithelium also might be one of immune cells or -associated cells, which may secrete effector molecules directly to kill adherent microbes and produce regulating factors in mucosal immune response.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23502767>Identification of synthetic peptides that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding to myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2).</a></h2><p>Many studies have suggested that the synergic effect of myeloid differential protein-2 (MD-2) on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) may be a critical step during the LPS-TLR4 response signaling pathway. We performed a bioinformatic analysis on the MD-2 protein and identified the amino acid sequence NH2-FSKGKYKCV-COOH (K128-132) as a possible key sequence involved in the binding between MD-2 and LPS. We then screened a random phage display peptide library using this sequence as bait in order to identify antagonistic peptides. After 3 rounds of selection, 3 positive clones were identified. All 3 peptides were shown to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in human U937 and THP-1 cell lines as well as human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated by LPS. Only 2 of the 3 peptides were able to bind MD-2 directly as shown by sulfo-SBED biotin label transfer experiments. BALB/C mice were used to estimate the protection of these peptides from LPS challenge, and 2 of the 3 peptides (-Thr--Pro-Asp-Asn-His and Ile-Gly---Leu-Tyr-Arg) reduced mortality of the challenged mice from 100% to 53.8%. This study has demonstrated that interfering with the binding between MD-2 and LPS might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating LPS-induced sepsis, and in doing so has identified 2 potential peptide candidates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9219544>Envelope protein of parasitic wasp symbiont virus, polydnavirus, protects the wasp eggs from cellular immune reactions by the host insect.</a></h2><p>Cotesia kariyai polydnavirus (CkPDV) virions are present in the oviducts of C. kariyai wasp and are injected with eggs into the hemocoel of the host armyworm Pseudaletia separata larvae during parasitization. Evidence that the presence of polydnavirus particles on the surface of the wasp eggs may be essential for prevention of cellular immune reactions by the host hemocytes was obtained by isolating an immunoevasive factor from CkPDV virions. The purified proteinaceous factor protects foreign materials from adhesion and encapsulation by hemocytes of the host P. separata larvae but not by those of common cutworm Spodoptera litura larvae which is an incompatible host for the C. kariyai wasp. Purification procedures consisted of extraction with ethanol/trifluoroacetic acid and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. A factor with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa is demonstrated to be present on the envelope of CkPDV virion by immunoelectronmicroscopic observations. Furthermore, immunoreactive proteins are found in plasma of the armyworm larvae but not in the common cutworm larvae, indicating that only the natural host of C. kariyai wasp shares a similar epitope with CkPDV. The sequence of 23 amino acid residues at the amino terminus of the factor was determined to be Ile-Ser--Glu-Asn--Xaa-Thr-Thr-Gly-Ile--Leu-Asp-Ser-Gly-Glu-Xaa- - Pro-Tyr-Ala-Thr--Pro.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3878521>Region of peptide 125-147 of acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit is exposed at neuromuscular junction and induces experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, T-cell , and modulating autoantibodies.</a></h2><p>A major antigenic region of native nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AcChoR) has been identified by using a synthetic disulfide-looped peptide corresponding to alpha-subunit residues 125-147 of Torpedo electric organ AcChoR: -Ser-Tyr-Cys-Glu-Ile-Ile--Thr-His-- Pro--Asp-Gln-Gln-Asn-Cys-Thr-Met--Leu-Gly. The peptide bound 26-56% of polyclonal antibodies induced in rat, rabbit, and dog by immunization with native AcChoR. Rats inoculated with 50 micrograms of unconjugated peptide developed helper T-cell responses, delayed hypersensitivity, and antibodies to native AcChoR. Anti-peptide antibodies were more reactive with native than denatured AcChoR and bound to the alpha subunit. Some reacted exclusively with mammalian muscle AcChoR, some induced modulation of AcChoR on cultured myotubes, but none inhibited binding of alpha-bungarotoxin to solubilized or membrane-associated AcChoR. Repeated immunization induced experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis: clinical signs in one rat and electrophysiologic and/or biochemical signs in 10 of 11 rats. Thus, at least part of the corresponding region of the mammalian AcChoR alpha subunit is extracellular at the neuromuscular junction and a potential target for pathogenic autoantibodies in patients with acquired myasthenia gravis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287710>Rifampicin resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis: molecular characterisation and fitness cost of rpoB mutations.</a></h2><p>The molecular mechanisms and characteristics of rifampicin (RIF) resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis are poorly characterised, even though S. epidermidis is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens associated with indwelling medical device-related infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of RIF resistance and to characterise the associated molecular mechanisms in S. epidermidis. RIF-resistant mutants from two RIF-susceptible S. epidermidis strains (RP62A and IDRL-8883) were selected through in vitro and in vivo exposure to RIF. A total of 16 colonies with an RP62A background and 63 colonies with an IDRL-8883 background were analysed for rpoB mutations. The fitness of RIF-susceptible and isogenic RIF-resistant strains was assessed using a paired competition assay and by comparing generation times. All mutations detected were in cluster I of rpoB. The following five amino acid substitutions were selected in vitro: Asp471→Asn; Asp471→Gly; Asp471→; Ser486→Tyr; and His481→Tyr. The following three amino acid substitutions were selected in vivo: His481→Tyr; Gln468→; and Ser486→. Asp471→Asn and Asp471→Gly changes were associated with susceptible minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). In vitro competition assays revealed that all RIF-resistant mutants other than Ser486→Tyr and Ser486→ had a relative fitness of <1.0. His481→Tyr mutations had their own specific fitness costs and effects on growth rate, irrespective of strain background. In conclusion, the current study presents molecular characterisations and fitness costs of several rpoB mutations in S. epidermidis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

Immunoactive peptides derived from food proteins could exert immunomodulatory activity without side effects. Paphia undulata with high-protein is suitable for the production of immunoactive peptides. The objective of this study was to optimize the hydrolysis parameters to maximize the immune activity of hydrolysates from Paphia undulata.Hydrolysis parameters, including temperature, time and the ratio of alkaline protease to Paphia undulata meat (E/S), were optimized by response surface methodology with a central composite design. The optimum conditions were obtained as follows: temperature, 51 °C; time, 3.14 h; E/S, 4,321 U g(-1) (Paphia undulata meat). Furthermore, hydrolysates obtained under the optimum conditions were fractionated by ultrafiltration and gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column. After two-step isolation, the isolated fractions (P2 and P3) including the peptides Pro-His-Thr-Cys, -Gly-Try-Thr, Glu-, Leu-, and Glu-Gly-Ala-, Trp-Ile or Trp-Leu, respectively, could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation ability.These results showed that response surface methodology and two-step separation were efficient for recovery of low-molecular-weight peptides with high spleen lymphocyte proliferation activity, and the isolated fractions of Paphia undulata hydrolysates are potential ingredients for development of functional foods.© 2014 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1708384>Membrane topography of ColE1 gene products: the  protein.</a></h2><p>The topography of the colicin E1  (Imm) protein was determined from the positions of TnphoA and complementary lacZ fusions relative to the three long hydrophobic segments of the protein and site-directed substitution of charged for nonpolar residues in the proposed membrane-spanning segments. Inactivation of the Imm protein function required substitution and insertion of two such charges. It was concluded that the 113-residue colicin E1 Imm protein folds in the membrane as three trans-membrane alpha-helices, with the NH2 and COOH termini on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane, respectively. The approximate spans of the three helices are Asn-9 to Ser-28, Ile-43 to -62, and Leu-84 to Leu-104. An extrinsic highly charged segment, -66 to -74, containing seven charges in nine residues, extends into the cytoplasmic domain. The specificity of the colicin E1 Imm protein for interaction with the translocation apparatus and the colicin E1 ion channel is proposed to reside in its peripheral segments exposed on the surface of the inner membrane. These regions include the highly charged segment -66 to -83 (loop 2) and the short (approximately eight-residue) NH2 terminus on the cytoplasmic side, and Glu-29 to -44 (loop 1) and the COOH-terminal segment Gly-105 to Asn-113 on the periplasmic side.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19463738>The alyteserins: two families of antimicrobial peptides from the skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae).</a></h2><p>Two families of structurally related C-terminally alpha-amidated antimicrobial peptides have been identified in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the midwife toad Alytes obstetricans (Alytidae). The alyteserin-1 peptides (Gly-Leu--(Asp/Glu)-Ile---Ala-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ser-Leu---(Gly/Asn)-Ile-Ala-Ala-His--Ala-(Asn/Ser).NH(2)) show limited structural similarity to the ascaphins from the skins of frogs of the family Leiopelmatidae. Alyteserin-2a (Ile-Leu-Gly--Leu-Leu-Ser-Thr-Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-Asn-Leu.NH(2)) and alyteserin-2b and -2c (Ile-Leu-Gly-Ala-Ile-Leu-Pro-Leu--Ser-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser-(Asn/Ser)--Leu x NH(2)) show limited sequence identity with bombinin H6, present in the skins of frogs of the family Bombinatoridae. The alyteserin-1 peptides show selective growth inhibitory activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (MIC=25 microM) whereas alyteserin-2a is more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=50 microM). The hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes of all peptides tested is relatively weak (LC(50)>100 microM). The data demonstrate that the frogs belonging to the family Alytidae are among those producing dermal antimicrobial peptides that may represent a component of the animal's system of innate .</p></html>
