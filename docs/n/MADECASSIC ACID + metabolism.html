MEA or RA at 0.05% or 0.1% was supplied to diabetic mice for six weeks. The intake of MEA, not RA, dose-dependently lowered plasma glucose level and increased plasma insulin level. MEA, not RA, intake dose-dependently reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity and fibrinogen level; as well as restored antithrombin-III and protein C activities in plasma of diabetic mice. MEA or RA intake decreased triglyceride and cholesterol levels in plasma and liver. Histological data agreed that MEA or RA intake lowered hepatic lipid droplets, determined by ORO stain. MEA intake dose-dependently declined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione levels, increased glutathione content and maintained the activity of glutathione reductase and catalase in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. MEA intake dose-dependently reduced interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in the heart and kidneys of diabetic mice. RA intake at 0.1% declined cardiac and renal levels of these inflammatory factors. These data indicated that MEA improved glycemic control and hemostatic imbalance, lowered lipid accumulation, and attenuated oxidative and inflammatory stress in diabetic mice. Thus,  could be considered as an anti-diabetic agent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28001462>Comparative pharmacokinetics between madecassoside and asiaticoside presented in a standardised extract of Centella asiatica, ECa 233 and their respective pure compound given separately in rats.</a></h2><p>1. ECa 233, the standardised extract of Centella asiatica, contains not less than 80% triterpenoid glycosides, in a madecassoside:asiaticoside ratio of 1.5 (±0.5):1. 2. The pharmacokinetic comparison of madecassoside and asiaticoside was performed in rats following intravenous and oral administration of ECa 233, or an equivalent dose of the individual compounds.

There was a bidirectional interconversion between asiaticoside and madecassoside consistent with the increased exposure of madecassoside and asiaticoside in ECa 233. 4. Both madecassoside and asiaticoside appeared to be widely distributed in several organs and metabolized extensively; following intravenous administration of either compound, approximately 80-90% of the dose was recovered as  and asiatic acid in the faeces.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25685908>Structural analysis of metabolites of asiatic acid and its analogue  in zebrafish using LC/IT-MSn.</a></h2><p>Although zebrafish has become a significant animal model for drug discovery and screening, drug  in zebrafish remains largely unknown. Asiatic acid (AA) and  (MA), two natural pentacyclic triterpenoids mainly obtained from Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, have been found to possess many pharmacological effects. This study is to probe the  capability of zebrafish via investigation of the drug  of AA and MA in zebrafish, using a sensitive LC/IT-MSn method. In addition, the main fragmentation  of AA and MA were reported for the first time. Nineteen metabolites of AA and MA were firstly identified after zebrafish was exposed to the drug, which all were the phase I metabolites and mainly formed from hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, hydroxylation and dehydrogenation, dihydroxylation and dehydrogenation, and dehydroxylation reaction. The results indicated that zebrafish possessed strong  capacity, and the metabolites of AA and MA were formed via similar   and well matched with the known  rules in vivo and in vitro, which supports the widely use of this system in drug  research. This investigation would also contribute to the novel information on the structural elucidation, in vivo metabolites and  mechanism of pentacyclic triterpenoids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750154>Madecassoside ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice through promoting the generation of hepatocyte growth factor via PPAR-γ in colon.</a></h2><p>Madecassoside has potent anti-pulmonary fibrosis (PF) effects when administered p.o., despite having extremely low oral bioavailability. Herein, we explored the mechanism of this anti-PF effect with regard to gut hormones.A PF model was established in mice by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Haematoxylin and eosin stain and Masson's trichrome stain were used to assess histological changes in the lung. Quantitative-PCR and Western blot detected mRNA and protein levels, respectively, and cytokines were measured by ELISA. Small interfering RNA was used for gene-silencing. EMSA was applied to detect DNA-binding activity.Administration of madecassoside, p.o., but not its main metabolite , exhibited a direct anti-PF effect in mice. However, i.p. madecassoside had no anti-PF effect. Madecassoside increased the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in colon tissues, and HGF receptor antagonists attenuated its anti-PF effect. Madecassoside facilitated the secretion of HGF from colonic epithelial cells by activating the PPAR-γ pathway, as shown by an up-regulation of PPAR-γ mRNA expression, nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity both in vitro and in vivo. Also GW9662, a selective PPAR-γ antagonist, almost completely prevented the madecassoside-induced increased expression of HGF and amelioration of PF.The potent anti-PF effects induced by p.o. madecassoside in mice are not mediated by its metabolites or itself after absorption into blood. Instead, madecassoside increases the activity of PPAR-γ, which subsequently increases HGF expression in colonic epithelial cells. HGF then enters into the circulation and lung tissue to exert an anti-PF effect.© 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021372>Comparison of three different extracts of Centella asiatica for anti-amnesic, antioxidant and anticholinergic activities: in vitro and in vivo study.</a></h2><p>Centella asiatica (CA) has been used by Ayurvedic medical practitioners in India for almost 3000 years. The neuropharmacological properties of CA and its constituents have been studied extensively. Anti-oxidant, free radical scavenging and cholinergic modulatory activities are the reported mechanisms of action for its efficacy in memory disorders. Its medicinal values are mainly attributed to the presence of several triterpenes, namely asiatic acid, , asiaticoside, and madecassoside. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of these triterpenes content in CA extract on the antioxidant, cholinesterase modulation and anti-amnesic properties. The fractions of CA extract enriched for (CAE-EF) and depleted/freed of (CAE-FF) triterpenes contents were compared with methanolic extract (CAE). Both in vitro and in vivo methods for evaluation of antioxidant and anticholinergic activities were used. In vitro, free radical scavenging assays (ABTS, DPPH, NO, NORAC, and ORAC) and cholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) inhibition assays were used. For evaluation of anti-amnesic effect, scopolamine induced amnesia in rats, as the acute model of memory loss was used. Following behavioural assessments (MWM, PA, EPM), biomarkers of oxidative stress (reduced GSH, MDA and SOD activity) and cholinesterase (AChE and BuChE) status were also estimated in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rat brain. The methanolic extract (CAE) was found to perform best among all three fractions for in vitro free radical scavenging, cholinesterase inhibition, improvement of scopolamine-induced amnesia and also in vivo antioxidant effect and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Interestingly triterpenes free fraction (CAE-FF) showed better antioxidant activity than triterpenes enriched fraction (CAE-EF) along with comparable anti-amnesic effect. This indicates that triterpenes are not solely responsible for antioxidant activity, cholinesterase inhibitory and anti-amnesic effect of CA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Urban. (Apiaceae) that has been used as a wound-healing, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent. Up to now, the effects of MA against oxidative stress remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of MA and its mechanisms on hypoxia-induced human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (hRMECs). hRMECs were pre-treated with different concentrations of MA (0-50μM) for 30min before being incubated under hypoxia condition (37°C, 5% CO and 95% N). Cell apoptosis was evaluated with MTT assay and TUNEL staining, and the expression of apoptosis- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related molecules was assessed with western blotting and RT-PCR analysis. Intracellular ROS level was evaluated using DCFH-DA. Intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated using related Kits. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) nuclear translocation was assessed with western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence staining. MA significantly reduced oxidative stress in hypoxia-induced hRMECs, as shown by increased cell viability, SOD and GSH-PX leakage, decreased TUNEL- and ROS-positive cell ratio, LDH and MDA leakage, caspase-3 and -9 activity, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, MA also attenuated hypoxia-induced ER stress in hRMECs, as shown by reduced mRNA levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CHOP), protein levels of cleaved activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring kinase/endonuclease 1 alpha (IRE1α), phosphorylation of pancreatic ER stress kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), cleaved caspase-12 and ATF4 translocation to nucleus. The current study indicated that the regulation of oxidative stress and ER stress by MA would be a promising therapy to reverse the process and development of hypoxia-induced hRMECs dysfunction.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we aimed to compare MS, AS, MA, and AA for their neurite outgrowth activities and mechanisms in Neuro-2a cells. Immunofluorescent cell staining showed MS and AS significantly increased the percentage of neurite-bearing cells (%NBC) and the neurite length with higher potency than MA and AA. The triterpenoid glycosides induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, while their aglycones activated only transient signaling of ERK1/2. Suppression of ERK1/2 activation significantly abolished not only cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation but also the increment of %NBC and neurite length in MS- and AS-treated cells. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation did not produce similar blockage of CREB activation and neurite outgrowth in MA- and AA-treated cells. On the other hand, inactivation of protein kinase B (Akt) resulted in a suppression of neurite lengthening in all studied triterpenoids. This is the first study discerning the different signaling  of neurite outgrowth activity induced by  triterpenoid glycosides and aglycones. Neurite outgrowth activity of the glycosides MS and AS was found to involve the activation of sustained ERK phosphorylation leading to CREB activation, while ERK activation was not associated with MA- and AA-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, Akt activation was evident to be more involved in neurite elongation process.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980864>Determination and quantification of asiaticoside in endophytic fungus from Centella asiatica (L.) Urban.</a></h2><p>Centella asiatica (L.) Urban is a highly considered medicinal plant owing to its secondary metabolites asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and . The asiaticoside, one of the most important constituents of the plant, is a triterpenoid saponin having memory enhancement property. Given its medicinal properties, we isolated and characterized endophytic fungi from this plant with the aim to screen these microorganisms for asiaticoside production. In total, we isolated 13 endophytic fungi from the leaves of the plant, out of which one of the isolates produced asiaticoside. This asiaticoside producing isolate was identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides by internal transcribed spacer-based rDNA sequencing. The presence of asiaticoside in ethyl acetate extract of C. gloeosporioides was confirmed by LC-MS. The production of asiaticoside measured in relation to incubation time and subculture generation revealed presence of 62.29 ± 3.36 µg/100 mL of asiaticoside by C. gloeosporioides on the 15th day in first subculture generation followed by a decrease in subsequent generations. A similar trend was also shown by yield and growth curve of C. gloeosporioides. The asiaticoside production and yield were found to be positively correlated. This paper reported the production of asiaticoside by an endophytic fungus C. gloeosporioides for the first time. The present findings definitely provide an impetus to the production of asiaticoside by utilizing the endophytic source.

This study was designed as an open-labeled, 2-sequence dosage, single- and repeated-dose study investigated under fasting conditions. Plasma concentrations of the parent compounds and their relative acid metabolites were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and any observed adverse events. A key finding of this study was that the pharmacokinetics of ECa 233 in healthy volunteers did not correspond with its pharmacokinetics in animal studies. As indicated in human pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of the parent compounds (madecassoside and asiaticoside) were very low, while their respective metabolites ( and asiatic acid) demonstrated higher values. Based on the pharmacokinetic results observed in the dose comparison, accumulation of active metabolites after repeated dose is highly suggestive. In addition, the asiatic acid profile showed 2-fold increase in C and AUC after increasing dose from 250 to 500 mg of ECa 233. Lastly, the safety and tolerability evaluation illustrated that single and multiple doses in both 250 and 500 mg oral administration of ECa 233 were well tolerated, and none of the volunteers discontinued their participation due to adverse effects during the study.Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27992940>Pharmacokinetics of a Standardized Extract of Centella asiatica ECa 233 in Rats.</a></h2><p>ECa 233, a standardized extract of , has been found to exhibit various positive neurological effects and to have a good safety profile. The present study aimed to explore the disposition kinetics of ECa 233, containing madecassoside (53.1 %) and asiaticoside (32.3 %), in rats. The extract was intravenously or orally administered at doses from 50 to 200 mg/kg. Plasma, tissues, urine, and feces were collected at time points from 0 to 48 h after dosing. The levels of madecassoside and asiaticoside, as well as their postulated triterpenic metabolites,  and asiatic acid, in biological samples, were simultaneously measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that all animals had a good tolerability for ECa 233, whereas madecassic and asiatic acids were found in negligible amounts after pharmacokinetic assessment. Madecassoside and asiaticoside demonstrated rather similar absorption and tissue distribution profiles. They were rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum levels within 5-15 min after oral administration, but they had poor oral bioavailability, less than 1 %. Both triterpenoids were extensively distributed in the brain, stomach, and skin within 1 h and remained there for at least 4 h after dosing. Madecassoside and asiaticoside in ECa 233 were mainly excreted as an unchanged form after being injected, and exclusively as triterpenic acid metabolites in feces after oral administration. The pharmacokinetic results obtained could provide some guidance for an appropriate dosing regimen of ECa 233 in future studies.

Glycyrrhetinic acid was used as the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was accomplished on an Inertsil ODS-3 column, using a gradient elution with the mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water acidified with 0.1% (V/V) formic acid. Detection was achieved by ESI-MS under the negative selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. In normal and CIA rats, madecassoside (30 mg·kg(-1)) was orally administered for 21 consecutive days from the day of arthritis onset. For madecassoside, the linear range was 10-1 000 ng·mL(-1) with the square regression coefficient (r) of 0.998 9, while for , the linear range was 10-500 ng·mL(-1) with the square regression coefficient (r) of 0.996 1. The lower limit of quantification was 10 ng·mL(-1) for both analytes. The intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 1.78% to 13.42% for madecassoside and 2.30% to 14.90% for , and the accuracy was between -0.95% and 6.30% for madecassoside and between -1.48% and 5.34% for . The average recoveries of madecassoside,  and IS from spiked plasma samples were > 81%. The developed method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of madecassoside and  in rats after an oral administration of madecassoside. During initial 7 days of dosing, the cmax and AUC of madecassoside were greatly decreased and Vd/F was markedly increased in CIA rats, and no significant difference was observed on the first day of dosing. In contrast, the T1/2, cmax and AUC of  were significantly increased, and Ke of  was greatly decreased in CIA rats compared with normal rats. Along with repeated administration of madecassoside, the differences of pharmacokinetic parameters of both madecassoside and  between CIA and normal rats gradually subsided. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of both madecassoside and  in rats were significantly altered by arthritis status, and the differences of pharmacokinetic parameters between arthritis and normal rats coincide with the severity of arthritis.Copyright © 2014 China Pharmaceutical University.

Urban (Apiaceae), a small annual plant that grows in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and other parts of Asia, is well-known as a medicinal herb with a long history of therapeutic uses. The bioactive compounds present in C. asiatica leaves include ursane-type triterpene sapogenins and saponins-asiatic acid, , asiaticoside, and madecassoside. Various bioactivities have been shown for these compounds, although most of the steps in the biosynthesis of triterpene saponins, including glycosylation, remain uncharacterized at the molecular level.

Such a disconnection between poor pharmacokinetic property and undoubted bioactivity also exists in many other herbal medicines. However, there is no reasonable explanation for this phenomenon to date. Here we showed that orally administered madecassoside displayed marked therapeutic effect on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats, which was accompanied by a systemic downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In vitro assays demonstrated that neither madecassoside nor its main metabolite  could directly interfere with the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and IL-10. Intraperitoneal injection of madecassoside or  was absent of significant effects on CIA progression, which further excluded the possibility of systemic action and highlighted the indispensable role of intestinal tracts. Notably, madecassoside could dramatically enhance the secretion of IL-10 from the small intestine of CIA rats probably through increasing the number of Foxp3(+) T lymphocytes in the lamina propria. In conclusion, madecassoside displays anti-arthritis property not by absorption into blood or by its metabolite, but through an intestine-dependent manner. The action can be mediated by, at least partially, the mobilization of IL-10 that originates from small intestines.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

But the most studied GSH analogs exhibit poor pharmacokinetic properties. The aim of this study was to discover novel non-GSH analog GLOI inhibitors and analyze their binding mechanisms.Mouse GLOI (mGLOI) was expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS after induction with isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and purified using AKTA FPLC system. An in vitro mGLOI enzyme assay was used to screen a small pool of compounds containing carboxyl groups. Crystal structure of the mGLOI-inhibitor complex was determined at 2.3 Å resolution. Molecular docking study was performed using Discovery Studio 2.5 software package.A natural compound 18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and its derivative carbenoxolone were identified as potent competitive non-GSH analog mGLOI inhibitors with Ki values of 0.29 μmol/L and 0.93 μmol/L, respectively. Four pentacyclic triterpenes (ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, betulic acid and tripterine) showed weak activities (mGLOI inhibition ratio <25% at 10 μmol/L) and other three (maslinic acid, corosolic acid and ) were inactive. The crystal structure of the mGLOI-GA complex showed that the carboxyl group of GA mimicked the γ-glutamyl residue of GSH by hydrogen bonding to the glutamyl sites (residues Arg38B, Asn104B and Arg123A) in the GSH binding site of mGLOI. The extensive van der Waals interactions between GA and the surrounding residues also contributed greatly to the binding of GA and mGLOI.This work demonstrates a carboxyl group to be an important functional feature of non-GSH analog GLOI inhibitors.</p></html>
