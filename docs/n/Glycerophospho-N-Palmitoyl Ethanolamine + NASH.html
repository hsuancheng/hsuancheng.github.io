Metformin is almost exclusively eliminated through the kidney primarily through active secretion mediated by Oct1, Oct2, and Mate1. The purpose of this study was to determine how  affects kidney transporter expression and metformin pharmacokinetics. A single oral dose of [(14)C]metformin was administered to C57BL/6J (wild type [WT]) and diabetic ob/ob mice fed either a control diet or a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Metformin plasma concentrations were slightly increased in the WT/MCD and ob/control groups, whereas plasma concentrations were 4.8-fold higher in ob/MCD mice compared with WT/control. The MCD diet significantly increased plasma half-life and mean residence time and correspondingly decreased oral clearance in both genotypes. These changes in disposition were caused by ob/ob- and MCD diet-specific decreases in the kidney mRNA expression of Oct2 and Mate1, whereas Oct1 mRNA expression was only decreased in ob/MCD mice. These results indicate that the diabetic ob/ob genotype and the MCD disease model alter kidney transporter expression and alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, potentially increasing the risk of drug toxicity.© 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in the surfactant monolayer that coats and stabilizes lipid droplets within cells, and choline is required for its major biosynthetic pathway. Phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein (PC-TP), which exchanges phosphatidylcholines among membranes, is enriched in hepatocytes. PC-TP also regulates fatty acid metabolism through interactions with thioesterase superfamily member 2. We investigated the contribution of PC-TP to steatohepatitis induced by the MCD diet.  and wild-type control mice were fed the MCD diet for 5 wk and were then euthanized for histopathologic and biochemical analyses, as well as determinations of mRNA and protein expression. Whereas all mice developed steatohepatitis, plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were only elevated in wild-type mice, indicating that  mice were protected from MCD diet-induced hepatocellular injury. Reduced hepatotoxicity due to the MCD diet in the absence of PC-TP expression was further evidenced by decreased activation of c-Jun and reduced plasma concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21. Despite similar total hepatic concentrations of phosphatidylcholines and other lipids, the relative abundance of microvesicular lipid droplets within hepatocytes was reduced in  mice. Considering that the formation of larger lipid droplets may serve to protect against lipotoxicity in , our findings suggest a pathogenic role for PC-TP that could be targeted in the management of this condition. Phosphatidylcholine-transfer protein (PC-TP) is a highly specific phosphatidylcholine-binding protein that we previously showed to regulate hepatocellular nutrient metabolism through its interacting partner thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2). This study identifies a pathogenic role for PC-TP, independent of Them2, in the methionine- and choline-deficient diet model of experimental steatohepatitis. Our current observations suggest that PC-TP promotes liver injury by mediating the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholines, thus stabilizing more pathogenic microvesicular lipid droplets.Copyright © 2017 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22734967>Kupffer cell depletion attenuates leptin-mediated methoxamine-stimulated portal perfusion pressure and thromboxane A2 release in a rodent model of -cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Cirrhotic portal hypertension is characterized by increased hepatic oxidative stress, AA (arachidonic acid)-derived TXA(2) (thromboxane A(2)) release and exaggerated hepatic response to the α-adrenergic agonist MTX (methoxamine). Besides promoting hepatic fibrosis, the role of hyperleptinaemia in the modulation of vascular response in  (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) rat livers remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the possible links between hyperleptinaemia and the disarrangement in the hepatic microcirculation. -cirrhosis with hyperleptinaemia was induced in lean rats by feeding with an HF/MCD (high-fat/methionine-choline-deficient) diet. Portal haemodynamics, various substances, protein and mRNA expression and PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) composition were measured. Finally, the effects of leptin pre-infusion on TXA(2) release and concentration-PPP (portal perfusion pressure) curves in response to MTX were evaluated by simultaneously pre-treatment with the Kupffer cell inactivators GdCl(3) (gadolinium chloride) or EC (encapsulated clodronate), the TXS (TXA(2) synthase) inhibitor furegrelate, the TP receptor (TXA(2) receptor) antagonist SQ29548 and the dual TXS/TP receptor antagonist BM567. In HF/MCD+leptin-lean rats, cirrhosis-induced PPP and MTX hyper-responsiveness were associated with increased hepatic TXA(2) production, TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances) levels and the AA (arachidonic acid)/n-3 PUFA ratio, and up-regulation of hepatic leptin, FAS (fatty acid synthase), NADPH oxidase subunits, TXS, TP receptor, TGFβ(1) (transforming growth factor β(1)) proteins and mRNAs. Pre-infusion of leptin significantly enhanced MTX-stimulated PPP elevation and TXA(2) release, which were attenuated by GdCl(3) and EC pre-treatment. Concomitantly pre-incubation with BM567, but not furegrelate or SQ29548, significantly abolished the leptin-enhanced MTX-stimulated increase in PPP in -cirrhotic rats. Hyperleptinaemia plays an important role in hyper-responsiveness to MTX in -cirrhotic rat livers with portal hypertension. The leptin-enhanced MTX-stimulated increase in PPP is mediated by increased oxidative stress and Kupffer-cell-activated AA-derived TXA(2) release in -cirrhotic rats.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714086>Fatty acid elongation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () represents a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is characterized by quantitative and qualitative changes in hepatic lipids. Since elongation of fatty acids from C16 to C18 has recently been reported to promote both hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation we aimed to investigate whether a frequently used mouse  model reflects this clinically relevant feature and whether C16 to C18 elongation can be observed in HCC development. Feeding mice a methionine and choline deficient diet to model  not only increased total hepatic fatty acids and cholesterol, but also distinctly elevated the C18/C16 ratio, which was not changed in a model of simple steatosis (ob/ob mice). Depletion of Kupffer cells abrogated both quantitative and qualitative methionine-and-choline deficient (MCD)-induced alterations in hepatic lipids. Interestingly, mimicking inflammatory events in early hepatocarcinogenesis by diethylnitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis (48 h) increased hepatic lipids and the C18/C16 ratio. Analyses of human liver samples from patients with  or -related HCC showed an elevated expression of the elongase ELOVL6, which is responsible for the elongation of C16 fatty acids. Taken together, our findings suggest a detrimental role of an altered fatty acid pattern in the progression of -related liver disease.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17476695>Inhibiting triglyceride synthesis improves hepatic steatosis but exacerbates liver damage and fibrosis in obese mice with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>In the early stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), triglycerides accumulate in hepatocytes. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) catalyzes the final step in hepatocyte triglyceride biosynthesis. DGAT2 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment improved hepatic steatosis dramatically in a previous study of obese mice. According to the 2-hit hypothesis for progression of NAFLD, hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and fibrosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, we inhibited DGAT2 in a mouse model of  induced by a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD). Six-week-old genetically obese and diabetic male db/db mice were fed either the control or the MCD diet for 4 or 8 weeks. The MCD diet group was treated with either 25 mg/kg DGAT2 ASO or saline intraperitoneally twice weekly. Hepatic steatosis, injury, fibrosis, markers of lipid peroxidation/oxidant stress, and systemic insulin sensitivity were evaluated. Hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation, and fibrosis were increased in saline-treated MCD diet-fed mice compared to controls. Treating MCD diet-fed mice with DGAT2 ASO for 4 and 8 weeks decreased hepatic steatosis, but increased hepatic free fatty acids, cytochrome P4502E1, markers of lipid peroxidation/oxidant stress, lobular necroinflammation, and fibrosis. Progression of liver damage occurred despite reduced hepatic expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, increased serum adiponectin, and striking improvement in systemic insulin sensitivity.Results from this mouse model would suggest accumulation of triglycerides may be a protective mechanism to prevent progressive liver damage in NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6103815>alpha-Adrenergic blocking properties of quinine HCl.</a></h2><p>In the anesthetized dog, quinine HCl (50 mg/kg, i.v.) infused over a 20 min period produced 1 22% maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure, a 53% increase in pulse pressure and a 52% increase in myocardial contractile force. The initial positive inotropic response was maximal in the first 5--15 min of the quinine infusion and decreased to near control levels 40 min following the quinine infusion. Quinine caused a marked reduction in the noradrenaline (NA) pressor response, blockade of the adrenaline (A) pressor response, partial blunting of the angiotensin II (AII) pressor effect but no change in the depressor effect of isoprenaline (I). The positive inotropic effects of CaCl2 were reduced and the duration of contractile action to both I and CaCl2 was significantly prolonged by quinine. In isolated rabbit thoracic aortic strips, quinine produced a parallel, dose-related shift of the concentration-response curve for NA to the right but did not affect the maximum responses. A pA2 of 4.91 was estimated by the method of Schild. The determined line had a slope of -0.84 which is similar to a theoretical slope of -1.0 and indicates a direct relationship between the number of receptors occupied and the contractile response. The responses to AII and histamine (H) were not altered by quinine. These results suggest that quinine HCl produces alpha-adrenergic blockade; additionally, quinine modifies catecholamine- and calcium-induced myocardial contractile force responses.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29126873>Dual role of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in the progression and reversion of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a negative modulator of insulin and cytokine signaling, is a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. We investigated the impact of PTP1B deficiency during NAFLD, particularly in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (). features were evaluated in livers from wild-type (PTP1BWT) and PTP1B-deficient (PTP1BKO) mice fed methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) for 8 weeks. A recovery model was established by replacing MCD to chow diet (CHD) for 2-7 days. Non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Oval cells markers were measured in human and mouse livers with , and in oval cells from PTP1BWT and PTP1BKO mice.PTP1BWT mice fed MCD for 8 weeks exhibited , NPCs infiltration, and elevated Fgf21, Il6 and Il1b mRNAs. These parameters decreased after switching to CHD. PTP1B deficiency accelerated MCD-induced . Conversely, after switching to CHD, PTP1BKO mice rapidly reverted  compared to PTP1BWT mice in parallel to the normalization of serum triglycerides (TG) levels. Among NPCs, a drop in cytotoxic natural killer T (NKT) subpopulation was detected in PTP1BKO livers during recovery, and in these conditions M2 macrophage markers were up-regulated. Oval cells markers (EpCAM and cytokeratin 19) significantly increased during  only in PTP1B-deficient livers. HGF-mediated signaling and proliferative capacity were enhanced in PTP1BKO oval cells. In  patients, oval cells markers were also elevated.PTP1B elicits a dual role in  progression and reversion. Additionally, our results support a new role for PTP1B in oval cell proliferation during NAFLD.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or  and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in alleviating symptoms and protection against disease progression in patients with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1021224>Release of [3H]noradrenaline from perfused rat hearts by potassium and its modifications by 6-hydroxydopamine and reserpine.</a></h2><p>The sources of noradrenaline (NA) released by excess potassium from isolated perfused rat hearts were investigated by labelling the hearts from normal, reserpine-treated, and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (6-OHDA-treated) rats with [3H]HA, and measuring the increased rate of efflux induced by perfusion with a Krebs solution containing varying amounts of excess potassium. The [3H]NA and its metabolites in the effluent were separated by adsorption on alumina and a cation-exchange resin (Dowex-50). The release induced by potassium was a linear function of the log of the increased potassium concentration. Following a 1-h efflux period after labelling with [3H]NA, the hearts from reserpine-treated rats retained 1/5 as much [3H]NA, and released, in response to a 56mM elevation in the potassium concentration, less than 1/6 as much tritium label as the hearts from untreated (control) animals. In contrast, the hearts form 6-OHDA-treated animals retained 1/15 of the amount of [3H]NA and released 1/50 of the 3H label as did the control hearts. The potassium-induced increase of 3H-labelled substances in the effluent from the control hearts showed a large (threefold) percentage increase in the [3H]NA fraction, whereas the effluents from the hearts of reserpine- and 6-OHDA-treated animals contained only small increases in the [3H]NA fraction. Based on the assumptions that reserpine prevented retention of NA in the storage granules whereas 6-OHDA prevented almost all neuronal storage, it was concluded that more than 80% of the NA released by potassium excess from perfused normal hearts originated from the storage vesicles of the nerves, the remainder being largely from the cytoplasm of the nerves, with only a small portion from extraneuronal sources.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18986378>Nitric oxide plays a crucial role in the development/progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined diet-fed rat model.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is still unclear.

We have previously reported a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD) as a dietary  model with rapidly progressive liver fibrosis in mice. The current study in C57BL/6J mice fed CDAHFD provided evidence for the chronic persistence of advanced hepatic fibrosis in  and disease progression towards HCC in a period of 36 weeks. When mice fed CDAHFD were switched back to a standard diet, hepatic steatosis was normalized and NAFLD activity score improved, but HCC incidence increased and the phenotype of fibrosis-associated HCC development was observed. Moreover, when mice continued to be fed CDAHFD for 60 weeks, HCC further developed without severe body weight loss or carcinogenesis in other organs. The autochthonous tumours showed a variety of histological features and architectural patterns including trabecular, pseudoglandular and solid growth.

We identified six fatty acids that could serve as non-invasive markers of  in patients with NAFLD. Serum levels of 15:0, 17:0 and 16:1n7t negatively correlated with NAFLD activity scores and hepatocyte ballooning scores, while 18:1n7c serum levels strongly correlated with fibrosis stage and liver inflammation. Serum levels of 15:0 and 17:0 also negatively correlated with fasting glucose and AST, while 16:1n7c and 18:1n7c levels positively correlated with AST and ferritin, respectively. Inclusion of demographic and clinical parameters improved the performance of the fatty acid panels in detecting  in NAFLD patients. The panel [15:0, 16:1n7t, 18:1n7c, 22:5n3, age, ferritin and APRI] predicted intermediate or advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with 82% sensitivity at 90% specificity [AUROC = 0.92]. 15:0 and 18:1n7c were further selected for functional studies in vivo.

Dogs were exercised on a treadmill at low or high intensity (4.2 miles/h and a 6% or 20% incline) for 90 min, and were allowed to recover for 90 additional min. Neither intensity of exercise changed plasma glucose levels, but dose-related changes in glucose kinetics did occur. CSF glucose declined in both groups. During low intensity exercise, plasma levels of ir-beta-endorphin, ACTH, and cortisol increased with duration of exercise. During high intensity exercise, ACTH, ir-beta-endorphin and cortisol increased faster, and the integrated plasma response of these hormones was greater. Thus, peripheral release of ir-beta-endorphin, ACTH, and cortisol during exercise is dose-related with respect to time and intensity. CSF ir-beta-endorphin and ACTH both increased during low- but not high-intensity exercise. CSF cortisol rose markedly in both exercise groups.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is known to be a proinflammatory cytokine, but also promotes liver regeneration and protects the liver against various forms of damage. The role of IL-6/Glycoprotein 130 (GP130) in  remains unclear. In this study, we determined whether blocking IL-6/GP130 signaling prevents progression of steatohepatitis in a mouse  model. Six-week-old male C57/BL6 mice were fed either chow control or a methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks. Half of the MCD diet-fed mice were treated with 15 mg/kg rat anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1), intraperitoneally twice weekly, the remainder and chow-fed mice were injected with 15 mg/kg rat IgG as a control. Hepatic steatosis, injury, fibrosis, apoptosis, markers of lipid peroxidation/oxidant stress and IL-6-related gene expressions were evaluated. MR16-1 treatment decreased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activities and expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in MCD diet-treated mouse livers. Although this treatment enhanced intrahepatic lipid accumulation accompanied by increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha expression, elevated plasma alanine aminotransferase levels were improved with decreased plasma free fatty acid levels, lipid peroxidation/oxidant stress and hepatic apoptosis. Blocking IL-6/GP130 signaling by MR16-1 enhanced MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, but ameliorated liver injury.

The exact mechanism of this mislocalization is unknown, although increased activation of membrane retrieval processes may be one possibility. The current study measures the activation status of various mediators implicated in the active membrane retrieval or insertion of membrane proteins to identify which processes may be important in rodent methionine and choline deficient diet-induced .

Indeed, Gadd45a mRNA was induced in response to ER stress in primary hepatocytes. Lipidomic analysis of  livers demonstrated decreased triacylglycerol (TG) in MCD-treated Gadd45a-null mice, which was associated with increased mRNAs encoding phospholipase D (Pld1/2), phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2A, and choline/ phosphotransferase 1 (Cept1), involved in the phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidic acid-diacylglycerol cycle, and decreased mRNAs encoding fatty acid (FA)-binding protein 1 (Fabp1) and FA transport protein 5.

Furthermore, we studied the underlying mechanism of inhibitory action of GYY4137 on the posterior ciliary arteries. Isolated bovine posterior ciliary arteries were mounted in oxygenated organ baths and changes in isometric tension were measured with a Grass FT03 transducer connected to a recorder using a Grass Polyview Software. The relaxant actions of GYY4137 on phenylephrine pre-contracted arteries were observed in the absence and presence of an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, flurbiprofen. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of GYY4137 were studied in the absence or presence of inhibitors/activators of biosynthetic enzymes for H2S and nitric oxide production, as well as specific ion channel blockers. In the concentration range, 100 nM to 100 μM, GYY4137 elicited a concentration-dependant relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated posterior ciliary arteries, with IC50 value of 13.4 ± 1.9 μM (n = 6). The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen, significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the relaxation induced by GYY4137 yielding IC50 value of 0.13 ± 0.08 μM (n = 6). Both the inhibitors of cystathionine β-synthase (aminooxyacetic acid, AOAA, 30 μM) and cystathionine γ-lyase (propargylglycine, PAG, 1 mM) caused significant (p < 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to GYY4137. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (100 μM) significantly (p < 0.01) attenuated the relaxant action induced by GYY4137 on bovine ciliary artery. Conversely, the activator of cystathionine β-synthase, SAM (100 μM) and an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, L-NAME (100 μM) had no significant effect on relaxations induced by GYY4137.

Unstimulated purified neutrophils were perfused over reoxygenating HUVEC immediately after various periods of endothelial hypoxia. Adhesion to HUVEC was dependent on the duration of hypoxia, with 30, 60, and 100 min of exposure causing graded increments in neutrophil recruitment. The degree of hypoxia also markedly influenced the endothelial response. Severe hypoxia (O2 < 2.5%) induced stationary attachment and then migration of neutrophils, in contrast to rolling adhesion alone under a less intense regime (O2 = 2.5-4.0%). Judged from studies with monoclonal antibodies, P-selectin was essential for adhesion after severe hypoxia, and neutrophil immobilization was attributable to the activation of neutrophil beta 2-integrin. Perfusion of neutrophils with an antibody against interleukin-8 or a platelet-activating factor antagonist reduced levels of adhesion. However, IL-8 appeared to be the dominant agent involved in the immobilization from flow, whereas platelet-activating factor was the more potent agent involved in initiating subendothelial migration.

Subepicardial NE infusion caused the QRS complex to invert within a single beat (n = 35 animals, 101 observations), and the earliest epicardial activation consistently shifted to the randomly located infusion site (n = 14). This preceded right atrial activation, whereas the total ventricular epicardial activation time increased from 20 +/- 4 to 50 +/- 9 ms (P < 0.01). These events were accompanied by a ventricular tachycardia and a drop in left ventricular pressure, which were fully reversed after the infusion was stopped. Epicardial pacing at the infusion site mimicked all electrical and hemodynamic changes induced by NE. The arrhythmia was prevented by propranolol and abolished by cardiac sympathetic or vagal nerve stimulation. Focal automaticity was computationally reconstructed using a two-dimensional sheet of 256 x 256 resistively coupled ventricular cells, where calcium handling was abnormally high in the central region.

Using a flow-based adhesion assay we have investigated a novel route for the formation of neutrophil aggregates on the surface of immobilised activated platelets. Neutrophils perfused over a platelet monolayer formed numerous rolling attachments but rapidly stopped and spread after the superfusion of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or platelet-activating factor (both at 10(-7) M). Subsequent integrin-mediated migration across the platelet monolayer enabled formation of homotypic neutrophil aggregates, which was significant within 2.5 min of receipt of either stimulus. Aggregates increased in size with time and had an average projected area of approximately 500 microm2 after 10 min. Increasing size was correlated with an increasing tendency for movement downstream and large aggregates sometimes tumbled in that direction. The formation and stability of homotypic aggregates was dependent on several adhesive mechanisms. Antibody blockade demonstrated that interactions involving CD11a/CD18 and ICAM-3, between alpha(v)beta3-integrin and CD31 and between L-selectin and an unidentified counter-ligand were all required for the complete aggregatory response. Furthermore, blockade of L-selectin allowed initial aggregation which then reversed, suggesting that this receptor might regulate the interactions between other adhesion molecules that directly supported cell-cell adhesion.

Therefore, these results suggest that genistein may protect MCD-diet-mediated  development by suppressing lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and even liver fibrosis in db/db mice.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4426857>The fluorescence histochemistry of rat tissues denervated with 6-hydroxydopamine and their noradrenaline and monoamine oxidase activity levels.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177750>Modulatory role of Co-enzyme Q10 on methionine and choline deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in albino rats.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to evaluate the hepato-protective and neuro-protective activity of Co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10) on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in albino rats induced by methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Rats were fed an MCD diet for 8 weeks to induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. CoQ10 (10 mg/(kg·day)) was orally administered for 2 consecutive weeks. Twenty-four hours after the last dose of the drug, the behavioral test, namely the activity cage test, was performed and the activity counts were recorded. Serum alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, total/direct bilirubin, and albumin were valued to assess liver function. Moreover, hepatic cytokines interleukin-6 as well as its modulator nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells were determined. In addition, brain biomarkers, viz ammonia, nitric oxide, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), were measured as they are reliable indices to assess brain damage. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of brain proliferating cell nuclear antigen in brain and liver tissues were also evaluated. Results revealed that MCD-induced  showed impairment in the liver functions with an increase in the liver inflammatory markers. Moreover,  resulted in pronounced brain dysfunction as evidenced by hyper-locomotor activity, a decrease in the BDNF level, as well as an increase in the brain nitric oxide and ammonia contents. Oral treatment of MCD-diet-fed rats with CoQ10 for 14 days showed a marked improvement in all the assigned parameters.

In the present study, we demonstrate that both primary and secondary wave aggregation induced by adrenaline in plasma is blocked by two structurally distinct inhibitors of Src family kinases, dasatinib and PD0173952.In contrast, primary aggregation is partially inhibited or unaffected in the presence of inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase, phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases, and P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) ADP receptors, although secondary aggregation is abolished. The ability of adrenaline to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and to synergize with platelet agonists in mediating platelet activation in plasma is retained in the presence of Src family kinase inhibition. Moreover, adrenaline does not activate Src family kinases, as determined by western blotting of their regulatory tyrosines, suggesting that constitutive signaling from Src family kinases may underlie their role in activation. Adrenaline is widely used in clinical laboratories for investigation of patients with suspected bleeding disorders. In a group of 90 unrelated patients with a clinically diagnosed platelet bleeding disorder, we identified four who did not exhibit primary wave aggregation in response to adrenaline, although the catecholamine potentiated the response to other agonists, and five who failed to undergo secondary wave aggregation. In contrast, adrenaline stimulated biphasic aggregation in 60 controls. All of the patients with a defective response to adrenaline had impaired ADP-induced platelet activation.The present results indicate a previously unappreciated role for Src family kinases in mediating G(i) signaling in plasma, and demonstrate heterogeneity in response to adrenaline in patients with a clinically diagnosed platelet disorder.© 2010 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14329348>THE INFLUENCE OF RESERPINE ON CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSES TO NORADRENALINE, TYRAMINE, AND PITRESSIN DURING RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19552763>Melatonin ameliorates methionine- and choline-deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in rats.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () may progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Zucker rats, which naturally develop leptin receptor mutations, and their lean littermate rats were fed a choline-deficient, amino acid-defined diet. Both Zucker and littermate rats showed marked steatohepatitis and elevation of oxidative stress markers (e.g., thiobarbital acid reactive substances and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine). In sharp contrast, liver fibrosis, glutathione-S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive preneoplastic lesions, and HCC developed in littermate rats but not in Zucker rats. Hepatic neovascularization and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, only increased in littermate rats, almost in parallel with fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis.

Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups that received for 2 or 4 wk: the control diet plus vehicle, control diet plus quercetin, MCD diet plus vehicle, and MCD diet plus quercetin. At both 2 and 4 wk, feeding the MCD diet resulted in liver steatosis, inflammatory cell accumulation, oxidative stress evaluated by the concentration of TBARS, and fibrosis evidenced by the staining of α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells in the liver. At both 2 and 4 wk, the MCD diet induced an increase in the mRNA levels of Il6, Tnf, Ptgs2, and Hmgb1 and increased the protein concentrations of Toll-like receptor-4, c-Jun terminal kinase, and p65 NFκB subunit compared with control rats. Feeding the mice the MCD diet also triggered an increase of Col1a1, Col3a1, Plod3, Tgfb1, Smad3, Smad7, Pdgfb, Ctgf, Areg, Mmp9, and Timp1 mRNA levels. These effects were totally or partially prevented by treatment with quercetin.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) in contrast does not alter basal levels of C-AMP but elevates in an apparently dose-dependent manner the isoproterenol-induced stimulation of C-AMP. EGF also potentiates the forskolin-induced stimulation of C-AMP but has no effect on the elevation of C-AMP caused by NECA (5'-[N-ethyl]-carboxamido adenosine), an adenosine A2-receptor agonist. EGF, isoproterenol and NECA have no effect on basal levels of inositol phosphates (InsPs) in human RPE cells, but EGF specifically elevates the carbachol-induced stimulation of InsPs. The carbachol effect on InsPs is attenuated by the phorbol ester PMA (4 beta-phorbol 12 myrisate 13-acetate). PMA did not, however, affect the stimulation of C-AMP caused by isoproterenol. The interaction of EGF and C-AMP is further demonstrated in experiments where the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into RPE cells was studied, as an index for proliferation. EGF stimulates RPE cell proliferation while isoproterenol and dibutyryl C-AMP nullify the EGF effect. Dibutyryl C-AMP has a negative effect on RPE cell proliferation while isoproterenol is ineffective. The data presented here suggest that after stimulation of EGF receptors, tyrosine-kinase-activated products can influence secondary messenger products produced from activation of beta 2-type (linked with C-AMP formation) and muscarinic (linked with InsPs production) receptors in RPE cells.

Cultured rat RPE cells are also shown to possess beta 2-adrenergic receptors positively coupled to cAMP production. Isoproterenol and salbutamol both stimulate cAMP levels with half maximal (EC50) values of 0.5 and 0.2 microM, respectively. Isoproterenol action is attenuated most effectively by the beta 2-antagonist, ICI 118551, while the beta 1-antagonist, CGP 20712A, is only partially effective. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production is markedly reduced in the RCS rat RPE when compared to control cultures. In passaged RCS rat RPE cells cAMP stimulation by 10 microM isoproterenol was 6.4% of that by control cultures and in primary cultures it was around 75% of controls. The observed EC50 values were 0.4 and 1.3 microM for passaged control and RCS rat RPE cells, respectively. Melatonin negatively influences cAMP production in the RPE via Gi-proteins. Melatonin attenuated the action of forskolin by 51.1% in control rat RPE but only by 18.6% in the RCS rat RPE. The dose-response curve for melatonin shows an approximate 1000-fold shift in potency in the RCS rat. bFGF also has an inhibitory effect on rat RPE cells. bFGF (50ng/ml) attenuated forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels by 61.9% in control rat RPE but had not effect on the action of forskolin in RCS rat RPE. Serotonin (100 microM) potentiates the forskolin-induced stimulation of cAMP by 140.1%. However, unlike isoproterenol, melatonin and bFGF, the action of serotonin on adenylate cyclase appears normal in the RCS rat RPE. We conclude that the defect in the RCS rat RPE is likely to be due to impaired coupling of the components of the adenylate cyclase system and that this is most probably an abnormal interaction of adenylate cyclase with G-protein alpha-subunits.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11063784>Cocaine use and the mid-latency auditory evoked responses.</a></h2><p>To examine the effects of chronic cocaine use on the mid-latency auditory evoked responses (MLAERs), we recorded the evoked responses of 15 cocaine-dependent subjects and 13 age-matched healthy control subjects.

Studies were therefore undertaken to investigate the effect of serotonin on the cAMP system in rat RPE cells. Exposure of cultured rat RPE cells to serotonin (100 microM) for 10 minutes had no effect on the basal levels of cAMP. However, a 5 minute preincubation with serotonin potentiated the production of cAMP induced by a 5 minute exposure to forskolin (5 microM), isoproterenol (1 microM) and 5'-[N-ethylcarboxamido]-adenosine (10 microM) by 133.0%, 296.8% and 651.9%, respectively. This effect of serotonin was dose-dependent on forskolin and 5'-[N-ethylcarboxamido]-adenosine with half-maximal effects close to those reported for its action on inositol phosphates production. The antagonists ketanserin, methysergide and spiperone attenuated the action of serotonin, while yohimbine and spiroxatrine were ineffectual, thus indicating that the potentiating effect was through the 5-HT1A receptor. Incubation of cultured rat RPE cells with bradykinin stimulates inositol phosphates production with half-maximal effect observed at 1 nM. Bradykinin also potentiates the action of forskolin, isoproterenol and 5'-[N-ethylcarboxamido]-adenosine on cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner with little effect on basal levels. RPE cells exposed to serotonin (500 microM) or phorbol 12-13 dibutyrate (1 microM) for 30 minutes showed translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane from the cytosol, with 53.3% and 29.4% increases in membrane activity, respectively. Forskolin- and 5'-[N-ethylcarboxamido]-adenosine-induced cAMP production was potentiated by phorbol 12-13 dibutyrate (1 microM) treatment. The effect of both serotonin and phorbol 12-13 dibutyrate on forskolin-induced cAMP production was attenuated by pretreatment of cell cultures with the protein kinase C antagonists staurosporin and calphostin C at 1 microM. Thus, the production of cAMP in cultured rat RPE cells is potentiated by 5-HT2A receptors through activation of protein kinase C. This effect is, however, not specific since bradykinin, which stimulates inositol phosphates turnover, also potentiates stimulated cAMP production.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5674105>Dual adrenergic blockade and epinephrine infusion.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9038929>Endothelial-borne platelet-activating factor and interleukin-8 rapidly immobilize rolling neutrophils.</a></h2><p>The kinetics of the response of integrins to activating signal(s) must be rapid to ensure that rolling neutrophils are localized at the sites of inflammation. From video records, we analyzed the adhesion of individual neutrophils in a flow-based in vitro model of endothelial hypoxia and reoxygenation. There were numerous rolling interactions between flowing neutrophils and P-selectin on human umbilical vein endothelial cells after hypoxia, but 90% lasted for < 1 s, with approximately 30% converted to stationary attachment via beta 2-integrin(s). Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and platelet-activating factor (PAF) were responsible for neutrophil activation in this model [G. E Rainger, A. Fisher, C. Shearman, and G. B. . Am. J. Physiol. 269 (Heart Circ.

In the presence of a PAF-receptor antagonist, IL-8 acting alone induced conversion of rolling to stationary adhesion in as little as 80 ms after the initial attachment of a neutrophil, with a median response time of 240 ms. In the presence of a monoclonal antibody that neutralized IL-8 activity, PAF acting alone required a minimum duration of rolling of 560 ms to promote stationary adhesion, with a significantly longer median duration of 720 ms. In a reconstituted model, treatment of endothelial cells with hydrogen peroxide induced short-lived rolling of neutrophils supported by P-selectin. Exogenously added IL-8 and/or PAF bound to the endothelial surface and successfully induced the immobilization of neutrophils. Rapid and distinct kinetics of the conversion to stationary adhesion were observed again for IL-8 or PAF. Thus although endothelial-presented signals differed in their rate of action, neutrophils could be localized within one or two endothelial cell diameters of their initial adhesive contact point.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4825686>Adrenergic innervation of brown adipose tissue from the ground squirrel (Citellus richardsonii).</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31035006>Repositioning of niclosamide  (NEN), an anthelmintic drug, for the treatment of lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () is a common liver disease associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

It is now important to clarify the mechanisms that underlie such effects, and the main objective of the present study was to investigate whether changes in central noradrenaline underlie some of the behavioural and cardiovascular effects of caffeine. This was examined using a clonidine challenge paradigm. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were assigned to one of four conditions: (i) clonidine/caffeine; (ii) clonidine/placebo; (iii) placebo/caffeine: (iv) placebo/placebo. Baseline measurements of mood, cognitive performance, saccadic eye movements and cardiovascular function were recorded. Subsequently, volunteers were given either clonidine (200 microg) or placebo and consumed coffee containing caffeine (1.5 mg/kg) or placebo. The test battery was then repeated 30 min, 150 min and 270 min later. A second cup of coffee (with the same amount of caffeine as the first) was consumed 120 min after the first cup. The results showed that clonidine reduced alertness, impaired many aspects of performance and slowed saccadic eye movements; caffeine removed many of these impairments. Both clonidine and caffeine influenced blood pressure (clonidine reduced it, caffeine raised it) but the effects appeared to be independent, suggesting that separate mechanisms were involved. In addition, there were some behavioural effects of caffeine that were independent of the clonidine effect (e.g. effects on speed of encoding of new information) and these may reflect other neurotransmitter systems (e.g cholinergic effects).

Treatment with baicalein reduced hepatic NO formation through suppressing MCD-diet-induced iNOS activation, and suppressed MCD-diet-induced inflammation through suppressing NFκB activation and reducing IL-6 and TNFα expressions in livers. Treatment of MCD-diet fed rats with baicalein had a beneficial modulation on expression profiles of fatty acid metabolism genes in livers.

By mechanisms that are not completely understood, this disease may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). db/db mice spontaneously develop hepatic steatosis, which progresses to  when these mice are fed a methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet. The goal of our studies was to identify lipid and methionine metabolism pathways affected by MCD feeding to determine potential causal events leading to the development of  from benign steatosis. db/db mice fed the MCD diet for 2 weeks exhibited signs of incipient  development such as upregulated cytokines and chemokines. At this time point, MCD diet feeding caused S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) depletion in db/db mice, while wild-type mice on the same diet retained hepatic SAMe levels. SAMe depletion exerts pleiotropic effects upon liver homeostasis and is commonly associated with a variety of liver insults such as thioacetamide, CCL4, and alcohol treatment; thus, SAMe depletion may serve as the second hit in  development. It is possible that differences in hepatic lipid and/or methionine metabolism between wild-type and db/db mice underlay the differential maintenance of SAMe levels during methionine and choline restriction. Indeed, db/db mice exhibited inhibited lipid oxidation pathways, which may be a priming factor for  development, and db/db mice fed the MCD diet had differential methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) expression. The occurrence of SAMe depletion at this early, benign stage of  development in db/db mice with fatty liver suggests that SAMe supplementation may be (A) targeted to individuals susceptible to  (i.e., NAFLD patients) and (B) preventative of  before substantial liver injury has occurred.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281898>3, 3'-Diindolylmethane alleviates steatosis and the progression of  partly through shifting the imbalance of Treg/Th17 cells to Treg dominance.</a></h2><p>This study was designed to discuss the effects of 3, 3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) on methionine-choline-deficient (MCD)-diet induced mouse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and the potential mechanisms.  mice were administrated with or without DIM at different concentrations for 8 weeks. Both the in-vivo and in-vitro effects of DIM on Treg/Th17 imbalance during  progression were analyzed. The in-vivo blocking of CD25 or IL-17 was performed to respectively deplete respective function of Treg or Th17 subset. Besides, with the assistance of AhR antagonist CH223191 and anti-TLR4 neutralizing antibody, we designed the in-vitro DIM-incubation experiments to discuss the roles of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (CYP1A1, CYP1B1) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on DIM's effects when shifting Treg/Th17 imbalance. Notably, in  mouse models, DIM alleviated hepatic steatosis and inflammation, and shifted the Treg/Th17 imbalance from MCD diet-induced Th17 dominance to Treg dominance. In-vitro, DIM not only significantly up-regulated the mRNAs of Foxp3 (Treg-specific) in purified spleen CD4(+) T cells, but also enhanced the immunosuppressive function of these Treg cells. Besides, DIM significantly up-regulated the proteins of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 whereas down-regulated those of TLR4 on CD4(+) T cells from MCD-diet mice. Moreover, blocking AhR attenuated while blocking TLR4 enhanced the effects of DIM when regulating Treg/Th17 imbalance. Conclusively, DIM could be used as a potential therapeutic candidate to treat  based on its dramatic induction of Treg dominance to alleviate intra-hepatic inflammation, suggesting us a clue that the dietary cruciferous vegetables (containing abundant DIM) might exist as a protective factor for patients with -related liver diseases.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a variable in drug disposition, yet the impact on renal transport processes has yet to be fully understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis on the pharmacokinetics of adefovir in rats given a control or methionine and choline deficient diet to induce nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.Animals received a bolus dose of 7mg/kg (35μCi/kg) [(3)H] adefovir with consequent measurement of plasma and urine concentrations. Inulin clearance was used to determine glomerular filtration rate.Methionine and choline deficient diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis prolonged the elimination half-life of adefovir. This observation occurred in conjunction with reduced distribution volume and hepatic levels of adefovir. Notably, despite these changes, renal clearance and overall clearance were not changed, despite markedly reduced glomerular filtration rate in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Alteration of glomerular filtration rate was fully compensated for by a significant increase in tubular secretion of adefovir. Analysis of renal transporters confirmed transcriptional up-regulation of Mrp4, the major transporter for adefovir tubular secretion.This study demonstrates changes to glomerular filtration and tubular secretion that alter pharmacokinetics of adefovir in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

The traditional Chinese formula Salvia-Nelumbinis naturalis (SNN) is effectively applied to improve the symptoms of nonalcoholic simple fatty liver (NAFL) patients. Previous studies have confirmed that SNN could reduce the liver lipid deposition and serum transaminases of NAFL experimental models. This study aims to determine whether SNN is effective for murine  model and investigate the underlying pharmacological mechanisms.C57BL/6 J mice were fed with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for six weeks to induce . Simultaneously, SNN or saline was intragastrically administered daily to the mice in the SNN or model group, respectively. A standard diet was given to the control mice. Serum biochemical indices and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured. Liver histopathology was observed, and the contents of triglycerides and lipid peroxide malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver homogenates were evaluated. The hepatic expression and/or activation of genes associated with inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress were determined by quantitative RT-PCR or Western blot analysis.The prominent liver steatosis displayed in the  model was prevented by SNN. The liver injury of  mice was obviously manifested by the increased levels of serum transaminases and bilirubin, as well as the lobular inflammation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated apoptosis in liver tissues. SNN administration improved the aforementioned pathological changes. The increased hepatic levels of MDA and cytochrome P450 2E1 of the model confirmed the unregulated balance of oxidative stress. The hepatic expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its target genes decreased, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in the model mice increased. Treating the mice with SNN significantly improved oxidative stress-related harmful factors.This study shows that SNN can protect the liver from severe steatosis and damage induced by MCD diet, which suggests the potential use of SNN on the treatment of  patient.

Offspring of both control diet- and HFD-fed dams were weaned onto control and HFD, creating four groups.When compared to their control diet-fed littermates, offspring of HF-dams weaned onto HFD gained greater body weight; had increased relative liver weight and showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Similarly, this group revealed significantly greater immune response and pro-fibrogenic gene expression via RNA-seq. In parallel, 7-8 week old offspring were challenged with either control or MCD diets for 3 weeks. Responses to MCD diets were also exacerbated due to maternal HFD as seen by gene expression of classical pro-fibrogenic genes.

The transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2) plays a central role in stimulating expression of various antioxidant-associated genes in the cellular defense against oxidative stress. As the cytosolic repressor kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) negatively regulates Nrf2, activation of Nrf2 facilitated by its release from Keap1 may represent a promising strategy in the treatment of . To test this hypothesis, we used two chemically distinct types of Nrf2 activator. One is the thiol-reactive agent oltipraz (OPZ), a typical Nrf2 activator, and the other is a novel biaryl urea compound, termed NK-252 (1-(5-(furan-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-3-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)urea). NK-252 exhibits a greater Nrf2-activating potential than OPZ. Furthermore, in vitro binding studies revealed that NK-252 interacts with the domain containing the Nrf2-binding site of Keap1, whereas OPZ does not. This finding indicates that NK-252 is more potent than OPZ due to its unique mechanism of action. For in vivo animal model studies, we used rats on a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet, which demonstrate pathologic findings similar to those seen in human . The administration of OPZ or NK-252 significantly attenuated the progression of histologic abnormalities in rats on a CDAA diet, especially hepatic fibrosis.

MCD-feeding increased adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone sensitive lipase activities in all adipose depots which may be attributed to increased systemic FGF21 levels. The highest lipase enzyme activity was exhibited by visceral WAT.

However, the pressor effect of adrenaline and noradrenaline (NA) were significantly reduced in dogs, and the dose-response curves to NA in aortic strips and to the alpha-agonist, phenylephrine in rats was shifted to the right in a parallel manner by quinidine. In the rat, quinidine is at least 14 times more potent in antagonizing the vasopressor effect of an alpha 1-vs. and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23503837>Oral choline tolerance test as a novel noninvasive method for predicting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Although therapeutic intervention for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () at an early stage is important owing to the progressive nature of the disease, diagnosis using noninvasive methods remains difficult. We previously demonstrated  specific impairment of choline metabolism and the use of fasting plasma free choline (fCh) levels for  diagnosis. Here, we investigated the utility of an oral choline tolerance test (OCTT), based on disordered choline metabolism, as a novel noninvasive method for  diagnosis.Sixty-five patients with biopsy proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 17 healthy controls were enrolled. Blood samples were obtained from all subjects five times during the OCTT (before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after oral loading with 260 mg choline).Four-hour fCh levels after oral loading choline were markedly increased in  patients, compared with non- subjects. For detecting , compared with non- subjects, the area under the curve for 4-h fCh levels was 0.829 on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The cut-off level for  diagnosis was ≥0.16 mg/dL, and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80.1, 82.6, 78.4, and 84.4 %, respectively. Moreover, 4-h fCh levels were significantly associated with the disease activity based on NAFLD activity score in patients with NAFLD.Four-hour fCh levels obtained by an OCTT reflect a  specific disorder of choline metabolism, suggesting that the OCTT is a novel and useful noninvasive method for diagnosing  at an early stage with sufficient accuracy for clinical practice.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732940>Evaluation of the comparative efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine and artesunate-amodiaquine-chlorpheniramine (Artemoclo™) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria in Nigerian children.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artesunate-amodiaquine-chlorpheniramine (AQC) for the treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria among Southwest Nigerian children.One hundred and sixty children aged 6 months to 14 years with acute uncomplicated malaria were randomized to AL (n = 53), ASAQ (n = 53), or AQC (n = 54). Enrollees were seen daily on days 0-3 and then on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42 for clinical and parasitological evaluations. Paired samples of genomic DNA at enrolment and at the time of recurrent parasitaemia were genotyped using nested PCR to distinguish between reinfection and recrudescence. Detailed haematological and biochemical evaluations were carried out in a subset of enrollees on days 0, 7 and 28 as part of a safety evaluation.Of the 160 children, 144 (90%) completed the study. The mean fever clearance times and parasite clearance times for AL, ASAQ and AQC were comparable (p = 0.94 and p = 0.122, respectively). On day 14, the adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) for AL and AQC was 100% and for ASAQ it was 90% (p = 0.39). The PCR-uncorrected results on days 28 and 42 and the ACPR-corrected results on day 42 were similar for all drugs (p = 0.62 and p = 0.56, respectively). AQC resulted in the best parasite clearance and haematological recovery on day 2 (p = 0.022 and p = 0.018, respectively). Biochemical parameters were not adversely affected by the three artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and these were well tolerated.The three ACTs were efficacious and safe, but AQC resulted in a better haematological recovery on day 2 and higher cure rates throughout the study period.© 2014 S.

An experimental rat model made by feeding rats a choline-deficient diet (CDD) showed severe steatosis, fibrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver resembling nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ().  causes fibrosis by lipid peroxidation. In this study, we assess whether AT1 antagonists and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) antagonists can suppress the hepatic fibrosis and lipid peroxidation in CDD rats that lead to the development of .Both study groups received subcutaneously aqueous solutions of AT2 antagonist (PD123319 - 1 mg/kg/day) and AT1 antagonist (L158809 - 1 mg/kg/day), respectively, 6 times per week. On day 90, some rats (5 /group) were sacrificed by excision of the liver under anesthesia, in order to assess the hepatic hydroxyproline (HP), malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and TGFbeta-1. The remaining rats were maintained to observe the survival rate.All CDD rats developed liver cirrhosis. However, the tissue TGF and HP decreased in AT1 antagonist group in comparison with the other two groups. All groups of CDD rats showed strong adipose hyperoxidation. The AT1 antagonist group demonstrated a markedly improved survival rate in comparison to the other two groups.Hepatic fibrosis progression in the AT1 antagonist group was slower than that in the other groups. This observation suggests that AT1 antagonists delayed the progression of liver failure, which thus led to an improved survival rate.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12670945>Role of Ca2+ feedback on single cell inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate oscillations mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors.</a></h2><p>The dynamics of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) production during periods of G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated Ca2+ oscillations have been investigated using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase C (PLC) delta1 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-PHPLCdelta1). Activation of noradrenergic alpha1B and muscarinic M3 receptors recombinantly expressed in the same Chinese hamster ovary cell indicates that Ca2+ responses to these G-protein-coupled receptors are stimulus strength-dependent. Thus, activation of alpha1B receptors produced transient base-line Ca2+ oscillations, sinusoidal Ca2+ oscillations, and then a steady-state plateau level of Ca2+ as the level of agonist stimulation increased. Activation of M3 receptors, which have a higher coupling efficiency than alpha1B receptors, produced a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ even at low levels of agonist stimulation. Confocal imaging of eGFP-PHPLCdelta1 visualized periodic increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production underlying the base-line Ca2+ oscillations. Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations were blocked by thapsigargin but not by protein kinase C down-regulation. The net effect of increasing intracellular Ca2+ was stimulatory to Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, and dual imaging experiments indicated that receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 production was sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ between basal and approximately 200 nM. Together, these data suggest that alpha1B receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations result from a positive feedback effect of Ca2+ onto phospholipase C. The mechanisms underlying alpha1B receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses are therefore different from those for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5a, where Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations are the primary driving force for oscillatory Ca2+ responses (, M. S., Young, K. W., Challiss, R. A. J., and Nahorski, S. R. (2001) Nature 413, 381-382). For alpha1B receptors the Ca2+-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3 production may serve to augment the existing regenerative Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process; however, the sensitivity to Ca2+ feedback is such that only transient base-line Ca2+ spikes may be capable of causing Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4626189>The influence of inorganic ions on the uptake and retention of tritiated noradrenaline by isolated perfused rat hearts.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10820279>Differential ability of exogenous chemotactic agents to disrupt transendothelial migration of flowing neutrophils.</a></h2><p>Neutrophils migrate through endothelium using an ordered sequence of adhesive interactions and activating signals. To investigate the consequences of disruption of this sequence, we characterized adhesion and migration of neutrophils perfused over HUVEC that had been treated with TNF-alpha for 4 h and evaluated changes caused by exogenously added chemotactic agents. When HUVEC were treated with 2 U/ml TNF, flowing neutrophils adhered, with the majority rolling and relatively few migrating through the monolayer. If fMLP, IL-8, zymosan-activated plasma (a source of activated complement factor C5a), epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA-78), or growth-regulating oncogene, GRO-alpha, was perfused over these neutrophils, they stopped rolling and rapidly migrated over the monolayer, but did not penetrate it. When HUVEC were treated with 100 U/ml TNF, the majority of adherent neutrophils transmigrated. If neutrophils were treated with fMLP, IL-8, C5a, ENA-78, or GRO-alpha just before perfusion over this HUVEC, transmigration, but not adhesion, was abolished. However, when platelet-activating factor was used to activate neutrophils, migration through HUVEC treated with 100 U/ml TNF was not impaired, and migration through HUVEC treated with 2 U/ml TNF was actually increased. Transmigration required ligation of CXC chemokine receptor-2 on neutrophils, and differential desensitization of this receptor (e.g., by fMLP but not platelet-activating factor) may explain the pattern of disruption of migration. Thus, transmigration may require presentation of the correct activators in the correct sequence, and inappropriate activation (e.g., by systemic activators) could cause pathological accumulation of neutrophils in the vessel lumen.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941342>Standardized Salvia miltiorrhiza extract suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation and attenuates steatohepatitis induced by a methionine-choline deficient diet in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to examine the effect of standardized extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza (SME) on gene and protein expression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ()-related factors in activated human hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and in mice with steatohepatitis induced by a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet. Male C57BL/6J mice were placed on an MCD or control diet for 8 weeks and SME (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally every other day for 4 or 6 weeks. HSCs from the LX-2 cell line were treated with transforming growth factor β-1 (TGF-β1) or TGF-β1 plus SME (0.1-10 μg/mL). To investigate the effect of SME on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced condition, LX-2 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or H2O2 plus SME (0.1-100 μg/mL). MCD administration for 12 weeks increased mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), TGF-β1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), C-reactive protein (CRP), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), type I collagen, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. TGF-β1-induced LX-2 cells exhibited similar gene expression patterns. SME treatment significantly reduced the mRNA and protein expression of -related factors in the mouse model and HSCs. Histopathological liver analysis showed improved non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity and fibrosis score in SME-treated mice. The in vivo studies showed that SME had a significant effect at low doses. These results suggest that SME might be a potential therapeutic candidate for NAFLD treatment.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27321734>Effects of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease on Hepatic CYP2B1 and in Vivo Bupropion Disposition in Rats Fed a High-Fat or Methionine/Choline-Deficient Diet.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to hepatic pathologies, including simple fatty liver (SFL), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), fibrosis, and cirrhosis, that may progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. These liver disease states may affect the activity and expression levels of drug-metabolizing enzymes, potentially resulting in an alteration in the pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, and safety of drugs. This study investigated the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B1-modulating effect of a specific NAFLD state in dietary rat models. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) or high-fat (HF) diet to induce  and SFL, respectively. The induction of these disease states was confirmed by plasma chemistry and liver histological analysis. Both the protein and mRNA levels of hepatic CYP2B1 were considerably reduced in MCD diet-fed rats; however, they were similar between the HF diet-fed and control rats. Consistently, the enzyme-kinetic and pharmacokinetic parameters for CYP2B1-mediated bupropion metabolism were considerably reduced in MCD diet-fed rats; however, they were also similar between the HF diet-fed and control rats. These results may promote a better understanding of the influence of NAFLD on CYP2B1-mediated metabolism, which could have important implications for the safety and pharmacokinetics of drug substrates for the CYP2B subfamily in patients with NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22154902>Alpha-lipoic acid attenuates methionine choline deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis in C57BL/6 mice.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is a liver disease that causes fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis. Increased oxidative stress contributes to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis by upregulation of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. This study examined whether alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring thiol antioxidant, prevents steatohepatitis through the inhibition of several pathways involved in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.C57BL/6 mice were fed an MCD diet with or without ALA for 4weeks. Liver sections from mice on control or MCD diets with or without ALA were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, oil red O, and anti-4-HNE antibody. The effects of ALA on methionine-choline deficient MCD-diet induced plasma AST and ALT as well as tissue TBARS were measured. The effects of ALA on CYP2E1 expression, ER stress, MAPK levels, and NF-κB activity in MCD diet-fed mice liver were measured by northern and western blot analysis.Dietary supplementation with ALA reduced MCD diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, hepatic inflammation, TBARS, 4-HNE, and plasma ALT and AST levels. These effects were associated with a reduced expression of CYP2E1 and reduced ER stress and MAPK and NF-κB activity.Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that ALA attenuates steatohepatitis through inhibition of several pathways, and provide the possibility that ALA can be used to prevent the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients who have strong risk factors for .Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Currently there is no FDA approved and effective therapy available. We investigated the potential efficacy of those agents that stimulate glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis on the development of experimental steatohepatitis. Rats fed (ad libitum) amino acid based methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet were further gavaged with (1) vehicle (MCD), (2) S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), or (3) 2(RS)-n-propylthiazolidine-4(R)-carboxylic acid (PTCA).MCD diet significantly reduced hematocrit, and this abnormality improved in the treated groups (p < 0.01). Serum transaminases were considerably elevated (AST: 5.8-fold; ALT: 3.22-fold) in MCD rats. However, administration of GSH-enhancing agents significantly suppressed these abnormal enzyme activities. MCD rats developed severe liver pathology manifested by fatty degeneration, inflammation, and necrosis, which significantly improved with therapy. Blood levels of GSH were significantly depleted in MCD rats but normalized in the treated groups. Finally, RT-PCR measurements showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in tissue remodeling and fibrosis (matrix metalloproteinases, collagen-alpha1), suppressor of cytokines signaling1, and the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta) in the livers of rats fed MCD. GSH-enhancing therapies significantly attenuated the expression of deleterious proinflammatory and fibrogenic genes in this dietary model.

It is still unknown how only limited patients with fatty liver develop . Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is one of the key molecules in initiating the vicious circle of inflammations. Nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase; Nrd1), a zinc metalloendopeptidase of the M16 family, enhances ectodomain shedding of TNF-α, resulting in the activation of inflammatory responses. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of Nrd1 in the development of . Nrd1+/+ and Nrd1-/- mice were fed a control choline-supplemented amino acid-defined (CSAA) diet or a choline-deficient amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet. Fatty deposits were accumulated in the livers of both Nrd1+/+ and Nrd1-/- mice by the administration of the CSAA or CDAA diets, although the amount of liver triglyceride in Nrd1-/- mice was lower than that in Nrd1+/+ mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were increased in Nrd1+/+ mice but not in Nrd1-/- mice fed the CDAA diet. mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines were decreased in Nrd1-/- mice than in Nrd1+/+ mice fed the CDAA diet. While TNF-α protein was detected in both Nrd1+/+ and Nrd1-/- mouse livers fed the CDAA diet, secretion of TNF-α in Nrd1-/- mice was significantly less than that in Nrd1+/+ mice, indicating the decreased TNF-α shedding in Nrd1-/- mouse liver. Notably, fibrotic changes of the liver, accompanied by the increase of fibrogenic markers, were observed in Nrd1+/+ mice but not in Nrd1-/- mice fed the CDAA diet. Similar to the CDAA diet, fibrotic changes were not observed in Nrd1-/- mice fed a high-fat diet.

Bezafibrate (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) and GW501516 (10 mg/kg/day) were administered by gavage once a day for 5 weeks. Hepatic lipid contents, plasma triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations were evaluated, as were histopathological changes in the liver and hepatic mRNA expression levels. Bezafibrate and GW501516 inhibited the MCD-diet-induced elevations of hepatic triglyceride and thiobarbituric acid-reactants contents and the histopathological increases in fatty droplets within hepatocytes, liver inflammation and number of activated hepatic stellate cells. In this model, bezafibrate and GW501516 increased the levels of hepatic mRNAs associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation [acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), liver-fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) and peroxisomal ketothiolase], and reduced the levels of those associated with inflammatory cytokines or chemokine [transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB1]. In addition, bezafibrate characteristically reduced the elevation in the level of plasma ALT, but enhanced that in plasma adiponectin and increased the mRNA expression levels of its receptors (adiponectin receptors 1 and 2).

We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of hepatic vagus-mediated stimulation of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on Kupffer cells in  pathogenesis.Wild-type (WT) mice undergoing hepatic vagotomy (HV) were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 1 week. α7nAChR knockout (α7KO) chimeric mice were generated by transplanting α7KO bone marrow cells into irradiated and Kupffer cell-deleted WT recipients. Kupffer cells were isolated from WT mice and treated with α7nAChR agonist under stimulation by lipopolysaccharide and/or palmitic acid.HV aggravated MCD diet-induced  in both steatosis and inflammation. The hepatic inflammatory response, including the upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-12, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), was accelerated in HV mice, accompanied by the downregulation of PPARα pathway genes.

Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, ) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to  remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/ progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives  progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26017539>Mouse models of diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis reproduce the heterogeneity of the human disease.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), the potentially progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the pandemic liver disease of our time.

Mechanistically, we showed that murine hepatocytes express α and β adrenoceptors; that PRL directly induces hepatocyte injury and death as evidenced by increased release of lactate dehydrogenase, FASL and TNF-α from hepatocytes in the presence of PRL; and that PRL activated the apoptotic pathway in primary hepatocyte cultures, as indicated by upregulation of Fas receptor and caspase-8 proteins. The β-AR antagonist PRL therefore appears to enhance liver injury through induction of hepatocyte death via the death pathway.

As the contribution of specific caspases remains unclear, our aim was to ascertain the effect of caspase 3 suppression on liver injury and fibrogenesis.C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and caspase 3 knock out (Casp3 (-/-)) mice were placed on a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 6 weeks to induce steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. Thereafter, liver injury, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular apoptosis were quantified in liver sections. Additionally, expression of proteins associated with liver inflammation and fibrogenesis was analyzed.WT mice fed MCD diet showed marked activation of caspase 3 in hepatocytes, in conjunction with steatohepatitis and increased hepatic triglyceride levels, hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis. Casp3 (-/-) mice fed the MCD diet showed similar serum aminotransferase levels and NAFLD activity scores (NAS) compared with WT MCD-fed mice. However, Casp3 (-/-) mice on the MCD diet showed a marked reduction in expression of transcripts for profibrogenic genes, which translated into reduced hepatic collagen deposition. These changes were associated with decreased levels of apoptosis, and a significant reduction in the expression of cytokines involved in inflammatory signaling. Casp3 (-/-) mice on the MCD showed a reduction in expression of chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) leading to ameliorated infiltration of inflammatory lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c) positive monocytes.These findings support a prominent role for hepatocyte caspase 3 activation in -related apoptosis, fibrogenesis and fibrosis which in part is mediated via CCR2-dependent infiltration of Ly6c positive monocytes.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4853369>Noradrenaline uptake properties of the anococcygeus muscle of the rat.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23926252>Autonomic dysreflexia causes chronic immune suppression after spinal cord injury.</a></h2><p>Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), a potentially dangerous complication of high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) characterized by exaggerated activation of spinal autonomic (sympathetic) reflexes, can cause pulmonary embolism, stroke, and, in severe cases, death. People with high-level SCI also are immune compromised, rendering them more susceptible to infectious morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying postinjury immune suppression are not known. Data presented herein indicate that AD causes immune suppression. Using in vivo telemetry, we show that AD develops spontaneously in SCI mice with the frequency of dysreflexic episodes increasing as a function of time postinjury. As the frequency of AD increases, there is a corresponding increase in splenic leucopenia and immune suppression. Experimental activation of spinal sympathetic reflexes in SCI mice (e.g., via colorectal distension) elicits AD and exacerbates immune suppression via a mechanism that involves aberrant accumulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids. Reversal of postinjury immune suppression in SCI mice can be achieved by pharmacological inhibition of receptors for norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during the onset and progression of AD. In a human subject with C5 SCI, stimulating the micturition reflex caused AD with exaggerated catecholamine release and impaired immune function, thus confirming the relevance of the mouse data. These data implicate AD as a cause of secondary immune deficiency after SCI and reveal novel therapeutic targets for overcoming infectious complications that arise due to deficits in immune function.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132306>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids alleviate methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.</a></h2><p>The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are products of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases and have recently been found to have an anti-inflammatory activity. However, the role of EETs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the protective role of EETs in methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in mice and the potential mechanisms. We used 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea(TPPU), a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, to increase the endogenous EET level in mice. Upon TPPU treatment, the liver steatosis and inflammatory damage were significantly ameliorated in mice with steatohepatitis, paralleled by the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) as well as chemokines (CXCL1, MCP-1). Compared with untreated  mice, mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and inflammation relevant adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were downregulated, whereas mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α(PPAR-α) was elevated in TPPU-treated mice. In vitro, 11,12-EET treatment remarkably attenuated free fatty acid (FFA)-induced inflammation in HepG2 and THP-1 cells. Further, 11,12-EET inhibited the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway in macrophages from mice with steatohepatitis.

Experimental liver disease was induced by 8 weeks of MCD feeding in wild-type (WT) mice, either with or without commensal microbiota depletion, by continuous broad-spectrum antibiotic (AB) treatment. MCD diet induced steatohepatitis was accompanied by a reduced gut microbiota diversity, indicating intestinal dysbiosis. MCD treatment prompted macroscopic shortening of the intestine, as well as intestinal villi in histology. However, gut microbiota composition of MCD-treated mice, neither resembled human , nor did it augment the intestinal barrier integrity or intestinal inflammation. In the MCD model, AB treatment resulted in increased steatohepatitis activity, compared to microbiota proficient control mice. This phenotype was driven by pronounced neutrophil infiltration, while AB treatment only slightly increased monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) abundance.

Furthermore, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying the AP67- and AP72-induced relaxations. Isolated bovine PCA were set up for measurement of isometric tension in organ baths containing oxygenated Krebs solution. The relaxant action of H2S donors was studied on phenylephrine-induced tone in the absence or presence of enzyme inhibitors for the following pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX); H2S; nitric oxide and the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel. The H2S donors,  (1 nM - 10 μM), AP67 (1 nM - 10 μM) and AP72 (10 nM - 1 μM) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine-induced tone in isolated bovine PCA. While the COX inhibitor, flurbiprofen (3 μM) blocked significantly (p < 0.05) the inhibitory response elicited by AP67, it had no effect on relaxations induced by  and AP72. Both aminooxyacetic acid (30 μM) and propargylglycine (1 mM), enzyme inhibitors of H2S biosynthesis caused significant (p < 0.05) rightward shifts in the concentration-response curve to AP67 and AP72. Furthermore, the KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide (300 μM) and the NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME (100 μM) significantly attenuated (p < 0.05) the relaxation effect induced by AP67 and AP72 on PCA. We conclude that H2S donors can relax pre-contracted isolated bovine PCA, an effect dependent on endogenous production of H2S. The inhibitory action of only AP67 on pre-contracted PCA may involve the production of inhibitory endogenous prostanoids. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory action of H2S donors on PCA may depend on the endogenous biosynthesis of NO and by an action of KATP channels.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Agonists of the farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, which are nuclear receptors involved in  and HCC pathophysiology, have no effect on TUBA8 in HepG2 and LX-2 cells. In human HCC tissues of 18 patients TUBA8 is significantly upregulated when compared to the corresponding non-tumorous tissues. Compared to non-transformed hepatocytes, TUBA8 protein is strongly expressed in transformed cells. Thus, TUBA8 is a marker of HSC whose cell number is increased in , while higher levels in HCC may be related to induction of TUBA8 in parenchymal cells.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5648055>Renin release: relation to renal sodium load and dissociation from hemodynamic changes.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857839>Metabolomics-based search for therapeutic agents for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the commonest form of chronic liver disease in developed countries. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (), which represents advanced stage NAFLD, is increasingly being recognized as a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. However, no effective drugs against  have yet been developed. Therefore, we searched for candidate therapeutic agents based on the changes in levels of hepatic metabolites via gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolome analysis of livers from methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice, a mouse model of .The metabolites were extracted from the livers of the MCD diet-fed mice and then analyzed using GC/MS. Subsequently, the MCD diet-fed mice were supplemented with hypotaurine, and the therapeutic effects of hypotaurine against steatohepatitis were evaluated.Ninety-nine metabolites were detected in the livers of the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis model mice. Among these metabolites, hypotaurine exhibited the greatest decrease in its concentration in the mice. Supplementation with 2 mmol/kgBW hypotaurine attenuated liver injuries and fat accumulation caused by the MCD diet-induced steatohepatitis. Furthermore, 10 mmol/kgBW hypotaurine supplementation ameliorated fibrosis and oxidative stress induced by the MCD diet.The present metabolome analysis-based study demonstrated that hypotaurine is a novel candidate therapeutic agent for .Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Male Wistar rats underwent  induced by 8-week feeding with an MCD diet. Serum and hepatic biopsies at 2, 4 and 8 weeks were taken, and serum enzymes, ADMA and nitrate/nitrite (NOx), were evaluated. Hepatic biopsies were used for mRNA and protein expression analysis of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) and protein methyltransferases (PRMT-1), enzymes involved in ADMA metabolism and synthesis, respectively, and ADMA transporters (CAT-1, CAT-2A and CAT-2B). Lipid peroxides (TBARS), glutathione, ATP/ADP and DDAH activity were quantified. An increase in serum AST and ALT was detected in MCD animals. A time-dependent decrease in serum and tissue ADMA and increase in mRNA expression of DDAH-1 and PRMT-1 as well as higher rates of mRNA expression of CAT-1 and lower rates of CAT-2A and CAT-2B were found after 8-week MCD diet. An increase in serum NOx and no changes in protein expression in DDAH-1 and CAT-1 and higher content in CAT-2 and PRMT-1 were found at 8 weeks. Hepatic DDAH activity decreased with a concomitant increase in oxidative stress, as demonstrated by high TBARS levels and low glutathione content. In conclusion, a decrease in serum and tissue ADMA levels in the MCD rats was found associated with a reduction in DDAH activity due to the marked oxidative stress observed. Changes in ADMA levels and its transporters are innovative factors in the onset and progression of hepatic alterations correlated with MCD diet-induced .</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5705237>Selective blockade by mephentermine of reserpine-induced serotonin depletion.</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20395294>Specific contribution of methionine and choline in nutritional nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: impact on mitochondrial S-adenosyl-L-methionine and glutathione.</a></h2><p>The pathogenesis and treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () are not well established. Feeding a diet deficient in both methionine and choline (MCD) is one of the most common models of , which is characterized by steatosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, hepatocellular injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, the individual contribution of the lack of methionine and choline in liver steatosis, advanced pathology and impact on mitochondrial S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and glutathione (GSH), known regulators of disease progression, has not been specifically addressed. Here, we examined the regulation of mitochondrial SAM and GSH and signs of disease in mice fed a MCD, methionine-deficient (MD), or choline-deficient (CD) diet. The MD diet reproduced most of the deleterious effects of MCD feeding, including weight loss, hepatocellular injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, whereas CD feeding was mainly responsible for steatosis, characterized by triglycerides and free fatty acids accumulation. These findings were preceded by MCD- or MD-mediated SAM and GSH depletion in mitochondria due to decreased mitochondrial membrane fluidity associated with a lower phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine ratio. MCD and MD but not CD feeding resulted in increased ceramide levels by acid sphingomyelinase. Moreover, GSH ethyl ester or SAM therapy restored mitochondrial GSH and ameliorated hepatocellular injury in mice fed a MCD or MD diet. Thus, the depletion of SAM and GSH in mitochondria is an early event in the MCD model of , which is determined by the lack of methionine. Moreover, therapy using permeable GSH prodrugs may be of relevance in .</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20548286>Attenuated progression of diet-induced steatohepatitis in glutathione-deficient mice.</a></h2><p>In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), depletion of hepatic antioxidants may contribute to the progression of steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () by increasing oxidative stress that produces lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and fibrosis. We investigated whether depletion of glutathione (GSH) increases -associated hepatic pathology in mice fed a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD diet). Wild-type (wt) mice and genetically GSH-deficient mice lacking the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclm null mice), the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo synthesis of GSH, were fed the MCD diet, a methionine/choline-sufficient diet, or standard chow for 21 days. We assessed -associated hepatic pathology, including steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning, and used the NAFLD Scoring System to evaluate the extent of changes. We measured triglyceride levels, determined the level of lipid peroxidation products, and measured by qPCR the expression of mRNAs for several proteins associated with lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. MCD-fed GSH-deficient Gclm null mice were to a large extent protected from MCD diet-induced excessive fat accumulation, hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Compared with wt animals, MCD-fed Gclm null mice had much lower levels of F₂-isoprostanes, lower expression of acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, uncoupling protein-2, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase-1, transforming growth factor-β, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNAs, and higher activity of catalase, indicative of low oxidative stress, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis, and lower expression of profibrotic proteins. Global gene analysis of hepatic RNA showed that compared with wt mice, the livers of Gclm null mice have a high capacity to metabolize endogenous and exogenous compounds, have lower levels of lipogenic proteins, and increased antioxidant activity. Thus, metabolic adaptations resulting from severe GSH deficiency seem to protect against the development of steatohepatitis.</p><p>Keyword: NASH</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480733>Time-dependent changes and association between liver free fatty acids, serum lipid profile and histological features in mice model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h2><p>Methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet duration necessary for development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the dynamic of lipid profile and fatty acids are not completely established. The study examined dynamics and association between liver free fatty acids (FFA), serum lipid profile and liver morphological changes on MCD diet-induced NAFLD in mice.Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 28) were divided into four groups (n = 7 per group): control: fed with standard chow, MCD diet-fed groups: 2, 4 or 6 weeks. After treatment, liver and blood samples were taken for histopathology, serum lipid profile, and liver FFA composition.Hepatic FFA profile showed a decrease in saturated acids, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid, whereas proportions of docosapentaenoic, oleic and linoleic acid were increased. Total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides progressively decreased, whereas LDL level progressively increased. Focal fatty change in the liver appeared after 2 weeks, whereas diffuse fatty change with severe inflammation and ballooned hepatocytes were evident after 6 weeks.Six-week diet model may be appropriate for investigation of the role of lipotoxicity in the progression of NAFLD. Therefore, supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated acid like DHA, rather than DPA, especially in the initial stage of fatty liver disease, may potentially have preventive effects and alleviate development of NAFLD/ and may also potentially reduce cardiovascular risk by moderating dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2014 IMSS.
