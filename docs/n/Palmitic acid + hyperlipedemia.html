We have determined the fatty  composition of the individual plasma steryl esters from a newly discovered subject with phytosterolemia and xanthomatosis. For this purpose the intact steryl esters were subject to high temperature gas liquid chromatography (GLC) on a polar capillary column, which separated the major esters on the basis of molecular weight and degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids. The saturated and unsaturated sterols esterified to saturated, monoenic, dienoic and tetraenoic fatty acids were identified by GLC analysis of the sterol moieties of the corresponding AgNO3-TLC fractions of the steryl esters. The GLC results were confirmed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry via direct liquid inlet interface. It was found that, in general, each fatty  was esterified to the same complement of sterols, and that the esterified sterols possessed a composition comparable to that of the free plasma sterols, which was comprised of about 75% cholesterol, 6% campesterol, 4% 22,23-dihydrobrassicasterol and 15% beta-sitosterol. The fatty  composition of the steryl esters differed from that of the 2-position of the plasma phosphatidylcholines, which contained significantly less  and oleic and more linoleic . On the basis of these results and a review of the literature it is suggested that the plasma cholesteryl and plant steryl esters in phytosterolemia originate from both synthesis in plasma via the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and synthesis in tissues via the acylCoA-cholesterol acyltransferase.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27087279>EGFR Inhibition Blocks -induced inflammation in cardiomyocytes and Prevents -induced Cardiac Injury in Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity is often associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Previous studies suggest that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonism may be effective for the treatment of angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study was performed to demonstrate if EGFR plays a role in the pathogenesis of /obesity-related cardiac injuries. The in vivo studies using both wild type (WT) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) showed the beneficial effects of small-molecule EGFR inhibitors, AG1478 and 542, against obesity-induced myocardial injury. Administration of AG1478 and 542 significantly reduced myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and dysfunction in both two obese mouse models. In vitro, EGFR signaling was blocked by either siRNA silencing or small-molecule EGFR inhibitors in  (PA)-stimulated cardiomyocytes. EGFR inhibition attenuated PA-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis in H9C2 cells. Furthermore, we found that PA-induced EGFR activation was mediated by the upstream TLR4 and c-Src. This study has confirmed the detrimental effect of EGFR activation in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced cardiac inflammatory injuries in experimental mice, and has demonstrated the TLR4/c-Src-mediated mechanisms for PA-induced EGFR activation. Our data suggest that EGFR may be a therapeutic target for obesity-related cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2919125>Effects of ammonium chloride, salicylate, and carnitine on  oxidation in rat liver slices.</a></h2><p>To explore the possible association of  with hyperammonemia and aspirin ingestion, the effects of NH4+, salicylate, and carnitine on the oxidation of [1-14C] to -soluble products (ASP) and to CO2 were investigated in rat liver slices. DL-carnitine (5 mM) increased total oxidation (ASP + CO2) more than oxidation to CO2. KCN (1.5 mM) inhibited more than 90% of the oxidation. NH4Cl inhibited the oxidation that reached a maximum at about 40 mM, but the inhibition of oxidation to CO2 (63%) was larger than that of total oxidation (30%). Carnitine did not influence NH4+ inhibition, which is consistent with the results reported for isolated mitochondria. Salicylate effects depended on salicylate concentration as well as on the presence of carnitine. In the absence of carnitine, inhibition of total oxidation reached 90% at 3 mM salicylate but that of oxidation to CO2 reached 50%. Velocity calculated at saturating  concentration for total oxidation was slightly increased by 0.75 mM salicylate, but the increase for oxidation to CO2 was larger. At 3 mM salicylate, velocity at saturating  concentration for the oxidation was decreased, but the decrease for oxidation to CO2 was smaller than for total oxidation. Carnitine partially relieved the inhibition of total oxidation and further increased the formation of CO2. The combination of 20 mM NH4Cl and 0.75 mM salicylate inhibited total oxidation, which was more than additive of the individual effects, and carnitine partially relieved the inhibition. It is concluded that NH4+ exerted a stronger inhibition of oxidation to CO2 than of oxidation to ASP, whereas salicylate strongly inhibited the oxidation to ASP but increased the oxidation to CO2 by uncoupling mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, hyperammonemia and aspirin ingestion can inhibit fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism that could lead to the pathophysiology seen in some childhood diseases such as Reye's syndrome. Carnitine therapy might offer some benefits.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24454989>Astragalus polysaccharide suppresses skeletal muscle myostatin expression in diabetes: involvement of ROS-ERK and NF-κB pathways.</a></h2><p>The antidiabetes drug astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is capable of increasing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and improving whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as . However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this "metabolic" steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV) by incubation with increasing doses of  (C16:0) or oleic  (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV) were used as controls. Incubation with oleic  concentrations as high as 0.5 mM did not induce toxic effects in HCV or HCV cells. In contrast, incubation with  caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV compared to HCV cells. Further analysis with subtoxic  and oleic  concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV compared to HCV cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV compared to HCV cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV but not in HCV cells. In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids.

Nonesterified fatty  concentrations were lower up to 3 h after lard and IPO meals than after control or PO meals. Triacylglycerol increased less steeply after lard and IPO meals than after control and PO meals; the incremental AUCs (iAUCs) were 34% (95% CI: 7%, 124%; P < 0.05) and 26% (95% CI: 16%, 132%; P < 0.05) lower after lard than after control and PO meals, respectively.

Podocyte injury can lead to dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier, which is associated with proteinuria, a risk marker for the progression of CKD. Our previous studies demonstrated that  (PA) can induce podocyte apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we investigated the specific molecular mechanisms of PA-induced apoptosis in cultured podocytes.We cultured mouse podocytes and treated them with PA. Then, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay, lipid uptake was assessed by Oil Red O staining and boron-dipyrromethene staining, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, mitochondrial injury was assessed by JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy, and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using the MitoSOX Red reagent. The effects of PA on the mitochondria-mediated caspase activation pathway were investigated by examining the expression of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, Bid, cytochrome c, and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) using western blotting. The translocation of Bax and cytochrome c were detected by immunofluorescence.PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation and induced podocyte apoptosis. We investigated whether the two primary apoptosis signaling pathways (death receptor-mediated pathway and mitochondria-mediated pathway) were involved in the execution of PA-induced podocyte apoptosis, and found that the levels of FADD, caspase-8, and Bid did not significantly change during this process. Meanwhile, PA treatment induced an increase in Bax protein expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression, with Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Furthermore, PA treatment induced mitochondrial impairment, and triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, with a concomitant dose-dependent increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. Meanwhile, PA treatment increased mitochondrial production of ROS, and the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO significantly ameliorated PA-induced podocyte apoptosis.Our findings indicated that PA induced caspase-dependent podocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and mitochondrial ROS production participated in this process, thus potentially contributing to podocyte injury.© 2018 The Author(s).

Thus, searching for agents to promote pancreatic β-cell survival and improve its function could be a promising strategy to prevent and treat T2D. We investigated the effects of kaempferol, a small molecule isolated from ginkgo biloba, on apoptosis and function of β-cells and further determined the mechanism underlying its actions. Kaempferol treatment promoted viability, inhibited apoptosis and reduced caspase-3 activity in INS-1E cells and human islets chronically exposed to palmitate. In addition, kaempferol prevented the lipotoxicity-induced down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins Akt and Bcl-2. The cytoprotective effects of kaempferol were associated with improved insulin secretion, synthesis, and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) expression. Chronic  significantly diminished cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, protein kinase A (PKA) activation, cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and its regulated transcriptional activity in β-cells, all of which were restored by kaempferol treatment. Disruption of CREB expression by transfection of CREB siRNA in INS-1E cells or adenoviral transfer of dominant-negative forms of CREB in human islets ablated kaempferol protection of β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction caused by palmitate. Incubation of INS-1E cells or human islets with kaempferol for 48h induced PDX-1 expression. This effect of kaempferol on PDX-1 expression was not shared by a host of structurally related flavonoid compounds. PDX-1 gene knockdown reduced kaempferol-stimulated cAMP generation and CREB activation in INS-1E cells. These findings demonstrate that kaempferol is a novel survivor factor for pancreatic β-cells via up-regulating the PDX-1/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling cascade.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Signaling proteins become concentrated in these microdomains mainly by saturated fatty  modification, thus facilitating formation of protein complexes and activation of specific signaling pathways. High intake of saturated fatty acids promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, in part by disrupting insulin signaling pathway. Here we investigate whether lipid-induced toxicity in obesity correlates with altered composition of insulin signaling proteins in LRs in the brain. Our results showed that insulin receptor (IR) is highly concentrated in LRs fraction in comparison with soluble or postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions. Analysis of LRs domains from hippocampus of obese mouse showed a significant decrease of IR and its downstream signaling protein AKT, while in the PSD fraction we detected partial decrease of AKT and no changes in the IR concentration. No changes were shown in the soluble extract. In hypothalamus, genetic obesity also decreases interaction of AKT, but we did not detect changes in the IR distribution. However, in this structure genetic obesity increases recruitment of the IR negative regulator TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) into LRs and PSD fraction. No changes of AKT, IR and TBK1 were found in soluble fractions of obese in comparison with lean mice. In vitro studies showed that incubation with saturated  but not with unsaturated docosahexaenoic  (DHA) or palmitoleic  decreases association of IR and AKT and increases TBK1 recruitment into LRs and PSD domains, emulating what happens in the obese mice. TBK1 recruitment to insoluble domains correlates with decreases of IR tyrosine phosphorylation and ser473 AKT phosphorylation, markers of insulin resistance. These data support the hypothesis that  associated with genetic obesity alters targeting of TBK1 and insulin signaling proteins into insoluble LRs domains.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall effect was sustained as long as the drug was administered. The hypolipidemic effect of MEDICA 16 consisted of a 70 and 40% decrease in plasma triacylglycerols and cholesterol, respectively, and resulted from inhibition of liver lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis. Adipose reduction by MEDICA 16 treatment or calorie restriction consisted of a 75-90% decrease in the perirenal, omental, epididymal, and subcutaneous fat, with a 50% decrease in liver neutral lipids. The reduction in adiposity was accounted for by a respective decrease in the lipid content of individual adipocytes, with a concomitant decrease in the number of adipocytes of selected adipose tissues. The decrease induced in adiposity by MEDICA 16 treatment could not be accounted for by anorectic or cathartic effects of the drug. The hypoglycemic-hypoinsulinemic effect of MEDICA 16 consisted of amelioration of the tolerance of glucose with normalization of plasma insulin. It was accompanied by an eightfold increase in the number of insulin receptors in epididymal adipocytes, which was, however, counteracted by a decrease in their affinity for insulin. The receptor and postreceptor effects exerted by MEDICA 16 were similar to those of calorie restriction.

We investigated the impact of chronic  on Cx36 expression in pancreatic beta-cells. Prolonged exposure to the saturated free fatty  palmitate reduced the expression of Cx36 in several insulin-secreting cell lines and isolated mouse islets. The effect of palmitate was fully blocked upon protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition by H89 and (Rp)-cAMP, indicating that the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in the control of Cx36 expression. Palmitate treatment led to overexpression of the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER-1gamma), which bound to a functional cAMP-response element located in the promoter of the CX36 gene. Inhibition of ICER-1gamma overexpression prevented the Cx36 decrease, as well as the palmitate-induced beta-cell secretory dysfunction. Finally, freshly isolated islets from mice undergoing a long term high fat diet expressed reduced Cx36 levels and increased ICER-1gamma levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that chronic exposure to palmitate inhibits the Cx36 expression through PKA-mediated ICER-1gamma overexpression.

At 4 weeks of age, obese and lean rats have essentially identical basal and insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. By 8 weeks of age, however, the obese rats no longer exhibit such intake. Plasma insulin concentrations in the normal fed state show only small increases up to 4 weeks, with a rapid rise to a marked hyperinsulinemia thereafter, with an age at half-development of 5.5 weeks. Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations in fed obese rats are elevated at 3 weeks and rise rapidly thereafter. The triacylglycerol content of skeletal muscle is significantly elevated in the obese rats at 4 weeks of age. Histological examination of Oil Red O-stained muscle tissue and transmission electron microscopy shows the presence of intracellular lipid droplets. Treatment with the potent triacylglycerol-lowering agent MEDICA 16 (beta,beta'-tetramethylhexadecanedioic ) from 6 weeks of age reduces plasma lipids markedly, but it reduces body weight and insulin resistance only modestly. In contrast, treatment with MEDICA 16 from the time of weaning at 3 weeks of age results in the normalization of food intake and body weight to over 8 weeks of age. The development of hyperinsulinemia is also delayed until 8.5 weeks of age, and insulin levels remain strongly reduced. Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations remain at the same level as in lean rats, and neither an elevated muscle triacylglycerol content nor intracellular lipid droplets are found at 4 weeks of age. The results indicate that insulin resistance develops in the young animals and is not directly due to a genetically determined defect in insulin metabolism.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and  (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells.

These cells in presence of palmitate, but not UFA, exhibited time, and concentration-dependent emergence of insulin receptors, GLUT 4 expression, generation of ROS, cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and IRS-1. We conclude that both T-lymphocytes and HAEC share common characteristics in exhibiting activation of these cells to palmitate, but not to UFA, by developing insulin receptors and becoming insulin responsive tissues, a hitherto unknown response to palmitate. We hypothesize that these events may serve as protective defense mechanisms against acute effects of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity in these cells.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9129502>Dietary fat saturation effects on low-density-lipoprotein concentrations and metabolism in various animal models.</a></h2><p>Saturated vegetable oils (coconut, palm, and palm kernel oil) and fats (butter and lard) are hypercholesterolemic relative to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated vegetable oils. The increase in plasma low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations associated with consumption of saturated vegetable oils and fats is largely explained by a decrease in hepatic LDL receptor activity and an increase in the LDL-C production rate. Hepatic LDL receptor activity may be regulated by the messenger RNA concentration of the LDL receptor. The decrease in hepatic LDL receptor activity with saturated fat feeding is associated with decreased hepatic sterol O-acyltransferase activity and, therefore, a reduced inert pool of cholesteryl ester. A putative regulatory pool of cholesterol is increased with saturated fat feeding and suppresses LDL receptor activity, possibly through hepatic messenger RNA regulation. For most studies, an independent effect of a vegetable oil or fat could not be ascertained because there was no neutral control and at least two of the test oils or fats were varied. Animal data for the effects of individual fatty acids on plasma LDL-C concentrations and metabolism are sparse. The evidence suggests that caproic  (6:0), caprylic  (8:0), and capric  (10:0) are neutral with respect to their LDL-C-raising properties and their ability to modulate LDL metabolism. Lauric  (12:0), myristic  (14:0), and  (16:0) are approximately equivalent in their LDL-C-raising potential by reducing hepatic LDL receptor activity and increasing the LDL-C production rate, apparently via modulation of sterol O-acyltransferase activity. Stearic  (18:0) appears to be neutral in its LDL-C-raising potential and how it affects LDL metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421230>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidizability before and after LDL apheresis.</a></h2><p>Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a major role in the development of atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolemia has been associated with enhanced in vitro oxidation of LDL, and lipid-lowering therapy reduces LDL oxidizability. In the present study, we investigated whether LDL apheresis performed with different techniques affects in vitro diene formation (lag phase) and modification of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB). Baseline and posttreatment diene formation was correlated with the baseline pattern of plasma total fatty acids. We then performed a computer-simulation study to test the hypothesis that LDL apheresis-induced changes in LDL oxidizability are related to changes in the mass ratio between freshly produced and older LDL. In 19 patients aged 49+/-7 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) regularly treated with either immunoadsorption, heparin-induced LDL precipitation (HELP), or dextran sulfate (DS) adsorption, we determined lipoprotein levels, the lag phase, apoB modification, and the fatty  pattern in plasma samples drawn at the onset and termination of one LDL apheresis. LDL apheresis significantly decreased total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides by 50.4%, 14.9%, 62.6%, and 33.6%, respectively. The lag phase increased by a significant mean of 9.8%; the charge of apoB was not altered. The lag phase before treatment positively correlated with the baseline concentration of plasma total , myristic, and oleic . The increase in the lag phase during treatment correlated with a high pretreatment concentration of lauric, linoleic, and docosahexanoic . The simulation study indicates that a temporary imbalance between two LDL compartments, one representing freshly secreted LDL and the other representing older LDL, could explain the observed increase in the lag phase after LDL apheresis. In conclusion, in patients with heterozygous FH, LDL apheresis performed with different techniques decreases the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. This decrease may be related to a temporary mass imbalance between freshly produced and older LDL particles. Furthermore, the baseline fatty  pattern influences pretreatment and posttreatment susceptibility to oxidation.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625574>Mitochondria-targeted therapy rescues development and quality of embryos derived from oocytes matured under oxidative stress conditions: a bovine in vitro model.</a></h2><p>Can we use a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant (Mitoquinone) during in vitro embryo culture to rescue developmental competence of oocytes matured under lipotoxic conditions, exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress?Supplementation of embryo culture media with Mitoquinone reduced oxidative stress and prevented mitochondrial uncoupling in embryos derived from metabolically compromised oocytes in vitro, leading to higher blastocyst rates and lower blastomeric apoptosis.Maternal metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type-II diabetes are associated with  and elevated free fatty  (FFA) concentrations in the ovarian follicular fluid (FF). Oocyte maturation under these lipotoxic conditions results in increased oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced developmental competence and disappointing IVF results.A well-described bovine oocyte IVM model was used, where a pathophysiologically relevant elevated FF concentrations of  (PA; 150 μM or 300 μM) were added to induce oxidative stress. After fertilization (Day 0, D0), zygotes were in vitro cultured (IVC, from D1 to D8) in standard fatty -free media in the presence or absence of Mitoquinone or its carrier triphenyl-phosphonium.Embryo cleavage and fragmentation (D2) and blastocyst rates (D8) were recorded. Mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in cleaved embryos at D2 were determined using specific fluorogenic probes and confocal microscopy. D8 blastocysts were used to (i) examine the expression of marker genes related to mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPRmt; HSPD1 and HSPE1), mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UPR (ATF4, ATF6 and BiP) and oxidative stress (CAT, GPX1 and SOD2) using real time RT-PCR; (ii) determine cell differentiation and apoptosis using CDX-2 and cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining; and (iii) measure mtDNA copy numbers. This was tested in a series of experiments with at least three independent replicates for each, using a total of 2525 oocytes. Differences were considered significant if a P value was <0.05 after Bonferroni correction.Exposure to PA during IVM followed by culture under control conditions resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress in embryos at D2. This was associated with a significant reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential (uncoupling) compared with solvent control (P < 0.05). The magnitude of these effects was PA-concentration dependent. Consequently, development to the blastocysts stage was significantly hampered. Surviving blastocysts exhibited high apoptotic cell indices and upregulated mRNA expression indicating persistent oxidative stress, mitochondrial and ER UPRs. In contrast, supplementation of PA-derived zygotes with Mitoquinone during IVC (i) prevented mitochondrial uncoupling and alleviated oxidative stress at D2; and (ii) rescued blastocyst quality; normalized oxidative stress and UPR related genes and apoptotic cell indices (P > 0.01 compared with solvent control). Mitoquinone also improved blastocyst rate in PA-exposed groups, an effect that was dependent on PA concentration.N/A.This is a fundamental study performed using a bovine in vitro model using PA-induced lipotoxicity during oocyte maturation. PA is the most predominant FFA in the FF that is known to induce lipotoxicity; however, in vivo maturation in patients suffering from maternal metabolic disorders involve more factors that cannot be represented in one model. Nevertheless, focusing on the carryover oxidative stress as a known key factor affecting developmental competence, and considering the novel beneficial rescuing effects of Mitoquinone shown here, we believe this model is of high biological relevance.Human oocytes collected for IVF treatments from patients with maternal metabolic disorders are vulnerable to lipotoxicity and oxidative stress during in vivo maturation. The results shown here suggest that mitochondrial targeted therapy, such as using Mitoquinone, during IVC may rescue the developmental competence and quality of these compromised oocytes. After further clinical trials, this may be a valuable approach to increase IVF success rates for infertile patients experiencing metabolic disorders.This study was financially supported by a BOF/KP grant number 34399, from the University of Antwerp, Belgium.

RBO contains oleic  (38.4%), linoleic  (34.4%), and linolenic  (2.2%) as unsaturated fatty acids, and  (21.5%) and stearic (2.9%) acids as saturated fatty acids. The unsaponifiable fraction (4.2%) has total tocopherols (81.3 mg%), gamma-oryzanol (1.6%), and squalene (320 mg%). Oryzanol is a mixture of ferulic  esters of triterpene alcohols such as cycloartenol (CA) (106 mg%) and 24-methylene cycloartanol (494 mg%). Studies on experimental rats demonstrated a hypolipidemic effect of RBO. The unsaponifiable fraction of RBO lowers cholesterol levels. Feeding phytosterols, CA, and 24-methylene cycloartanol in amounts present in RBO to hypercholesterolemic rats for 8 weeks indicates that CA alone reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels significantly. Endogenous sterol excretion increases in animals given CA. The accumulation of CA in the liver inhibits cholesterol esterase activity, which in turn leads to reduction in circulating cholesterol levels. CA is structurally similar to cholesterol and may compete with the binding sites of cholesterol and sequestrate cholesterol, which is metabolized to its derivatives. RBO, which is rich in tocopherols and tocotrienols, may improve oxidative stability. Tocotrienols inhibit HMG CoA reductase, resulting in hypocholesterolemia. The hypolipidemic effect of RBO has also been established in human subjects.

Increasing evidence highlights the importance of postprandial measurements to evaluate atherogenic risk. Postprandial effects of alpha-linolenic  (ALA) in women are poorly characterized. We therefore studied the postprandial lipid response of women to an ALA-rich oil in comparison with olive oil and butter, and characterized the fatty  composition of total lipids, TAGs, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in plasma.A randomized crossover design (n = 19) was used to compare the postprandial effects of 3 meals containing 35 g fat. Blood samples were collected at regular intervals for 7 h. Statistical analysis was carried out with ANOVA (significant difference = P < 0.05).No significant difference was seen in incremental area under the curve (iAUC) plasma-TAG between the meals.

The delayed rectifier K(+) current (IK), is an important regulator of atrial repolarization. There is a paucity of studies on the functional role of IK in response to obesity. Here, we assessed the obesity-mediated functional modulation of IK in low-fat diet (LFD), and high-fat diet (HFD) fed adult guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were randomly divided into control and obese groups fed, ad libitum, with a LFD (10 kcal% fat) or a HFD (45 kcal% fat) respectively. Action potential duration (APD), and IK were studied in atrial myocytes and IKr and IKs in HEK293 cells using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. HFD guinea pigs displayed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol and total triglycerides within 50 days. Atrial APD at 30% (APD30) and 90% (APD90) repolarization were shorter, while atrial IK density was significantly increased in HFD guinea pigs.

Insulin and metabolism of fatty acids. Hypoglycemic effect of hyperlipemicpharmaceuticals].</a></h2><p>The regulation of metabolism of glucose is billions years older than system of insulin and biological function of locomotion (function of motion). Hence hypoglycemic effect of hormone is mediated by alteration of metabolism of fatty acids. The insulin in physiological way deprives mitochondrions a possibility to metabolize ketone bodies, short chain, medium chain and long chain fatty acids and 'forces" them to oxidize glucose which phylogenetically is not an optimal substrate. The relationships between fatty acids and glucose in the Rendle cycle have an effect only on autocrine level (in cell) determining alternation of biological reactions of exotrophia (after food intake) and endotrophia (beyond food intake) in biological function of alimentation (trophology). The most anti-diabetic pharmaceuticals are as insulin hyperlipemic by their mechanism of action. The decrease content of lipid substrates of oxidation in cytosol of cells and mitochondrions "are forced" to oxidize glucose. In these conditions, insulin enhances absorption of glucose by cells through glucose carriers--GLUT4. The derivatives of sulfonil-urea increase secretion of insulin by beta-cells of islets. The biguanidines bond in cytosol covalently and irreversibly ketone bodies taking them away from oxidation in mitochondrions. The fibrates, glitazones, flavonoids and flavones, lipoic tio-fatty acids. The endogenous eicosanoids, derivatives omega-3 and omega-6 of essential polyolefinic fatty acids and conjugated unsaturated fatty acids are the antagonists of receptors of activation of proliferation of peroxisomes. In peroxisomes, they enhance alpha-, beta- and omega-oxidation of all exogenous a physiological fatty acids and excess of  saturated fatty  forming hypolipidemia in cytozol. The hypolipidemic pharmaceuticals with effect of beta-blocker of oxidation stop absorption of fatty acids by mitochondrions. The omega-3 essential polvolefinic fatty acids, simultaneously with hypolipidemic effect, activate function of GLUT4. In patients of middle age, the diabetes mellitus type II is a symptom of syndrome of atherosclerosis. The reason is that in cells the deficiency of essential polyolefinic fatty acids and is determined by derangement of synthesis of phospholipids and function of GLUT4. It is valid to consider diabetes mellitus primarily as a pathology of metabolism of fatty acids and secondly as a pathology of content of glucose. It is necessary to take into account both under treatment (tactic activities) and strategic program of prevention of diabetes mellitus in population.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27592456> aggravates inflammation of pancreatic acinar cells by enhancing unfolded protein response induced CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β-CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein α activation.</a></h2><p>Hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for acute pancreatitis, in which the pathological mechanisms are not fully illustrated.

These tumor growth responses require hyperlipemia and are reversed by refeeding or insulin treatment, respectively. They do not occur in young tumor-bearing rats (less than about 150 g) that lack appreciable fat stores. A direct relationship between the increased rates of both [3H]thymidine incorporation and tumor growth and host hyperlipemia suggests that tumor cell renewal in vivo in fed rats is limited by substances that are present in hyperlipemic blood. In this study we used a procedure for perfusion of solid tumors in situ to measure the sensitivity of tumor [3H]thymidine incorporation to hyperlipemic blood and to identify the rate-limiting substances. Tissue-isolated Morris hepatomas (7288CTC) growing in young or adult Buffalo rats were perfused with blood from donor rats. Hyperlipemic blood for perfusion was obtained from 2-day starved tumor-bearing (Buffalo) or non-tumor-bearing (Buffalo or Lewis) rats.

Deuterium-labeled 16:0 and 18:0 were used to follow the metabolism of these fatty acids in young adult male subjects that were pre-fed diets containing two different levels of linoleic . Results indicate that absorption of 16:0 and 18:0 was similar when all components of the mixture used to formulate the deuterated fat mixture were kept above the melting point of tristearin. The percent of 18:0 desaturated to 9c-18:1 was higher than the percent of 16:0 desaturated to 9c-16:1 (9.2% vs. 3.9%). The subject-to-subject variability suggests that differences in ability to desaturate saturated fatty acids may be related to the variability observed in response of serum cholesterol levels to dietary saturated fatty acids. Data for the distribution of 16:0 and 18:0 between triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was markedly different.

In D group (n = 41) subjects followed AHA-Step-1 diet (<30% of total from fat, <10% of energy from saturated fat, and <300 mg cholesterol per day). D+F group (n = 37) followed Step-1 diet and were receiving gemfibrozil (300 mg/twice per day). Serum lipid levels and phospholipid serum and erythrocyte FA compositions were analyzed at the beginning and after 12 weeks of treatment. Alteration in serum and erythrocyte phospholipid FA profile were found in both groups. After both treatments we found significantly higher serum phospholipid percentages of n-3, n-6 and total polyunsaturated FA. Linoleic (LA, n-6) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, n-3) were higher in D group, but arachidonic (AA, n-6) and linolenic  (LNA, n-3) in D+F group. In erythrocyte phospholipid levels of stearic, palmitoleic (16 : 1, n-7) and LA were significantly higher in D group, but , AA and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, n-3) in D+F group. Stronger correlation between serum triglycerides with EPA and DHA in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid was found in D+F group. Markedly increased percentage of AA in serum and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid in hyperlipidemic patients receiving gemfibrozil on Step-1 diet is especially important for physiological functions (inflammation, vascular tone, hemostasis etc.) in relation to cardiometabolic risk.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21506380>[Prevention of atherosclerosis. Excess of  in food--a cause of hypercholesterolemia, inflammatory syndrome, insulin resistance in myocytes, and apoptosis].</a></h2><p>Unity of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome gives rise to impaired biological function of adaptation, altered biological function of exotrophy (external feeding) and endoecology ("purity" of the intercellular medium). Biological reactions of inflammation and hydrodynamic pressure, or blood pressure, are in vivo activated to compensate for intercellular debris accumulation by endogenous phlogogens--ligand-free low density lipoproteins (LDL). The biological reactions jointly remove LDL from blood to the intima of elastic type arteries, to interstitial tissue for the local pool of the intravascular medium. The causes of formation of aphysiological LDLs are a preponderance of palmitate-oleate-palmitate triglycerides in the latter and impaired hydrolysis upon exposure to post-heparin lipase to give rise to small, dense LDLs; intimal macrophages utilize the debris only partially and develop atheromatosis from polyenic fatty acids (FA) etherified by cholesterol alcohol. Excess of  saturated fatty  (sFA) is responsible for the lowered permeability of the plasma membrane, cell death via the mechanism similar to apoptosis. Aphysiological protein palmitoylation (covalent interaction with  sFA) increased the debris accumulation of the intercellular medium and the activity of both biological reactions. Elevated plasma  sFA and its enhanced passive absorption in the form of unetherified FA, as well as high C-reactive protein levels are a cause of insulin resistance. The only way to prevent atherosclerosis in the population is to normalize the biological function of exotrophy when the energy value ratio of FA, proteins and carbohydrates is 1:1:1 and that of sFA, monoenic, and polyenic FA is also 1:1:1. The lower amount of  sFA and the higher concentration of essential polyenic FA, the lower blood levels of cholesterol alcohol and triglycerides are. At the same time, simultaneously activations and the biological function of locomotion are a level of physical activity.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30048968>High Fat Diet Upregulates Fatty  Oxidation and Ketogenesis via Intervention of PPAR-γ.</a></h2><p>Systemic  and intracellular lipid accumulation induced by chronic high fat diet (HFD) leads to enhanced fatty  oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis. The present study was aimed to determine whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) by surplus free fatty acids (FA) in hyperlipidemic condition, has a positive feedback regulation over FAO and ketogenic enzymes controlling lipotoxicity and cardiac apoptosis.8 weeks old C57BL/6 wild type (WT) or PPAR-γ-/- mice were challenged with 16 weeks 60% HFD to induce obesity mediated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Treatment course was followed by echocardiographic measurements, glycemic and lipid profiling, immunoblot, qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of PPAR-γ and following mitochondrial metabolic enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2), mitochondrial β- hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4). In vivo model was translated in vitro, with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) treated with PPAR-γ agonist/antagonist and PPAR-γ overexpression adenovirus in presence of  (PA). Apoptosis was determined in vivo from left ventricular heart by TUNEL assay and immunoblot analysis.We found exaggerated circulating ketone bodies production and expressions of the related mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4 in HFD-induced diabetic hearts and in PA-treated NRCM. As a mechanistic approach we found HFD mediated activation of PPAR-γ is associated with the above-mentioned mitochondrial enzymes. HFD-fed PPAR-γ-/-mice display decreased hyperglycemia,  associated with increased insulin responsiveness as compared to HFD-fed WT mice PPAR-γ-/-HFD mice demonstrated a more robust functional recovery after diabetes induction, as well as significantly reduced myocyte apoptosis and improved cardiac function.PPAR-γ has been described previously to regulate lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. The present study suggests for the first time that increased PPAR-γ expression by HFD is responsible for cardiac dysfunction via upregulation of mitochondrial enzymes HMGCS2, BDH1 and PDK4. Targeting PPAR-γ and its downstream mitochondrial enzymes will provide novel strategies in preventing metabolic and myocardial dysfunction in diabetes mellitus.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

This randomized double-blinded three-parallel groups trial investigated the changes in various anthropometric and clinical biomarkers, and in plasma phospholipids fatty acids (PPFA) in volunteers at cardiovascular risk after a four-week intervention with 100 mL/day of (1) chokeberry juice with a high-dose of polyphenols (1177.11 mg gallic  equivalents, GAE); (2) chokeberry juice with a low-dose of polyphenols (294.28 mg GAE) and; (3) a nutritionally matched polyphenol-free placebo drink. Our results indicate that the intake of chokeberry juice containing either the low or the high dose of polyphenols cannot be linked with a reduction in total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol or in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in comparison with the consumption of the placebo drink. However, we found evidence of moderate changes in the PPFA, i.e., increased saturated fatty acids (SFA), mostly , and reduced n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), principally linoleic  (LA) with the intake of chokeberry against the placebo. These effects may be associated with the polyphenols but we could not differentiate a clear dose-response effect.

Hydrogen sulphide (H S) has antioxidative effect, but its regulation on mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in aortic endothelial cells under hyperglycaemia and  is unclear. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were treated with 40 mM glucose and 200 μM palmitate to imitate endothelium under hyperglycaemia and , and 100 μM NaHS was used as an exogenous H S donor. Firstly, we demonstrated that high glucose and palmitate decreased H S production and CSE expression in RAECs. Then, the antioxidative effect of H S was proved in RAECs under high glucose and palmitate to reduce mitochondrial ROS level. We also showed that exogenous H S inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis in RAECs under high glucose and palmitate. Using Mito Tracker and transmission electron microscopy assay, we revealed that exogenous H S decreased mitochondrial fragments and significantly reduced the expression of p-Drp-1/Drp-1 and Fis1 compared to high-glucose and high-palmitate group, whereas it increased mitophagy by transmission electron microscopy assay. We demonstrated that exogenous H S facilitated Parkin recruited by PINK1 by immunoprecipitation and immunostaining assays and then ubiquitylated mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), which illuminated the mechanism of exogenous H S on mitophagy. Parkin siRNA suppressed the expression of Mfn2, Nix and LC3B, which revealed that it eliminated mitophagy. In summary, exogenous H S could protect RAECs against apoptosis under high glucose and palmitate by suppressing oxidative stress, decreasing mitochondrial fragments and promoting mitophagy. Based on these results, we proposed a new mechanism of H S on protecting endothelium, which might provide a new strategy for type II diabetes vascular complication.© 2017 The Authors.

The Epanova for Lowering Very High Triglycerides (EVOLVE) trial showed that Epanova (omega-3 carboxylic acids [OM3-CA]) significantly lowered TG and apoCIII but raised LDL-C. However, it is unknown what subspecies of LDL were affected by treatment.To determine how lipoprotein subspecies are affected by omega-3 fatty  treatment, we studied the effect of OM3-CA on apoCIII concentrations in high density lipoprotein (HDL), LDL, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and on the concentrations of subspecies of HDL, LDL, and VLDL that contain or do not contain apoCIII.We analyzed plasma from a subset of subjects from the EVOLVE trial, a 12-week double-blind study of 399 subjects with fasting TG of 500 to 2000 mg/dL who were randomized to OM3-CA 2, 3, or 4 g/d or olive oil (placebo).OM3-CA significantly reduced plasma apoCIII relative to placebo, as well as apoCIII in HDL, and apoCIII in LDL. Treatment did not significantly affect the concentration of LDL with apoCIII, a subspecies highly associated with CVD risk. OM3-CA increased selectively the concentration of LDL that does not contain apoCIII, a subspecies with a weak relation to coronary heart disease.

The concentrations of apolipoproteins C-II and C-III were decreased in both the whole-serum and the VLDL fractions. Food consumption, rate of weight gain, fasting insulin levels, and the integrated insulin response to an intravenous glucose load remained unaffected. The decrease in plasma VLDL may be accounted for by inhibition of liver long-chain fatty  synthesis at the level of ATP citrate lyase, with a concomitant reduction of VLDL triglyceride production by the liver. This decrease in plasma VLDL production was accompanied by a twofold to threefold increase in the triglyceride and cholesterol components of the low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein fractions, together with a twofold to fourfold decrease in plasma apolipoprotein, indicating that activation of plasma VLDL catabolism may further account for the overall hypolipidemic effect induced by MEDICA 16.

We assessed postprandial β-cell function (by the insulinogenic index and the ratio of the insulin to glucose areas under the time-concentration curve) and insulin sensitivity (by the oral glucose and the minimal model insulin sensitivity indices) over four nonconsecutive, randomly assigned, high-fat meals containing a panel of SFA ( and stearic acids), MUFA (palmitoleic and oleic acids) and PUFA (linoleic and α-linolenic acids) in 14 subjects with normal and in 14 subjects with high fasting triglycerides. The proportions of each fatty  in the meals and the values for surrogate measures of postprandial β-cell function and insulin sensitivity were subjected to a Pearson correlation and hierarchical cluster analysis, which revealed two classes of dietary fatty acids for regulating postprandial glucose homeostasis. We successfully discriminated the adverse effects of SFA  from the beneficial effects of MUFA oleic  on postprandial β-cell function (r ≥ 0.84 for SFA  and r ≥ -0.71 for MUFA oleic ; P < 0.05) and insulin sensitivity (r ≥ -0.92 for SFA  and r ≥ 0.89 for MUFA oleic ; P < 0.001) both in subjects with normal and high fasting triglycerides.

To assess the effects of peroxisomal proliferation on FA oxidation independent of n-3 PUFA intake, mice were treated with the PPAR-α agonist WY-14643. n-3 PUFA-fed mice were protected from glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia compared to animals fed a lard-based high-fat diet. Most importantly, mice fed on the hyperlipidic diet based on fish oil as well as the WY-14643 treated mice showed twofold increase of odd, medium-chain, dicarboxylic acylcarnitines in the liver suggesting that not only β-oxidation, but also α- and ω-oxidation of FA were increased. Finally, an oxidation assay using liver homogenates and  as substrate revealed an over tenfold increased production of similar acylcarnitines, indicating that FA are their precursors.This study shows at the metabolite level that peroxisome proliferation induced either by fish oil or WY-14643 is associated with increased α- and ω-oxidation of FA producing specific acylcarnitines that can be utilized as biomarkers of peroxisomal FA oxidation.© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Dietary fatty- composition regulates lipids and lipoprotein metabolism and may confer CVD benefit. This review updates understanding of the effect of dietary fatty-acids on human lipoprotein metabolism. In elderly participants with , high n-3 polyunsaturated fatty-acids (PUFA) consumption diminished hepatic triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) secretion and enhanced TRL to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) conversion. n-3 PUFA also decreased TRL-apoB-48 concentration by decreasing TRL-apoB-48 secretion. High n-6 PUFA intake decreased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations by up-regulating VLDL lipolysis and uptake. In a study of healthy subjects, the intake of saturated fatty-acids with increased  at the sn-2 position was associated with decreased postprandial lipemia. Low medium-chain triglyceride may not appreciably alter TRL metabolism. Replacing carbohydrate with monounsaturated fatty-acids increased TRL catabolism. Trans-fatty- decreased LDL and enhanced high-density lipoprotein catabolism. Interactions between APOE genotype and n-3 PUFA in regulating lipid responses were also described. The major advances in understanding the effect of dietary fatty-acids on lipoprotein metabolism has centered on n-3 PUFA. This knowledge emphasizes the importance of regulating lipoprotein metabolism as a mode to improve plasma lipids and potentially CVD risk.

We used  (PA) to mimic  in endothelial cells to explore the cardio-protective mechanism of liraglutide and its impact on the role of leptin.Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with PA for 16 h and then were treated with liraglutide for 30 min.PA elevated not only phosphorylation of JNK and IKKα/β, but also the expression of IL-6 in HUVECs. These effects of PA were reversed by liraglutide. In addition, liraglutide increased phosphorylation of eNOS, AMPK, and the release of NO but had no effect on PKC phosphorylation. In addition, leptin elevated eNOS phosphorylation but was abrogated by PA. However, in the presence of liraglutide, leptin regained its function of elevating eNOS phosphorylation.

Hyperinsulinaemia and  are hallmarks of the insulin-resistant state. We sought to determine the contributions of high insulin and saturated fatty  exposure to mitochondrial function and biogenesis in cultured myocytes. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were left untreated or exposed to chronic high insulin or high palmitate. Mitochondrial function was determined assessing: oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content and ROS (reactive oxygen species) production. We also determined the expression of several mitochondrial genes. Chronic insulin treatment of myotubes caused insulin resistance with reduced PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signalling. Insulin treatment increased oxygen consumption but reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production. ATP cellular levels were maintained through an increased glycolytic rate. The expression of mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) subunits or Mfn-2 (mitofusin 2) were not significantly altered in comparison with untreated cells, whereas expression of PGC-1α (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1α) and UCPs (uncoupling proteins) were reduced. In contrast, saturated fatty  exposure caused insulin resistance, reducing PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation while increasing activation of stress kinases JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38. Fatty acids reduced oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential while up-regulating the expression of mitochondrial ETC (electron chain complex) protein subunits and UCP proteins. Mfn-2 expression was not modified by palmitate. Palmitate-treated cells also showed a reduced glycolytic rate. Taken together, our findings indicate that chronic insulin and fatty -induced insulin resistance differentially affect mitochondrial function. In both conditions, cells were able to maintain ATP levels despite the loss of membrane potential; however, different protein expression suggests different adaptation mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25986658>Fetuin A promotes lipotoxicity in β cells through the TLR4 signaling pathway and the role of pioglitazone in anti-lipotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Fetuin A (FetA), a secreted glycoprotein, is known to affect inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) in obese humans and animals.

Protein expression/activation were measured by Western blotting. Small interfering (si)RNAs for TLR4 were used. Cell apoptosis was quantified by TUNEL analysis or flow cytometry, respectively. Insulin release was assessed with an insulin ELISA.FetA dose-dependently aggravated  (PA)-induced βTC6 cell apoptosis, insulin secretion impairment, and inhibition of the expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1(PDX-1). Combined FetA + PA induced TLR4 expression, and subsequent inhibition of TLR4 signaling or expression was shown to prevent the strengthening effect of FetA on PA-induced lipotoxicity in βTC6 cells. FetA + PA induced p-JNK and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) subunit P65 expression, and inhibition of this activity reduced PA+ FetA lipotoxicity in βTC6 cells. PIO could ameliorate PA+ FetA-induced damage to βTC6 cells. Similarly, PIO improved insulin secretion disorder, reduced apoptosis, decreased FetA, TLR4, p-JNK, NF-κB subunit P65 and cleaved caspase 3 expression, and increased GPR40 and PDX-1 expression in islet β cells of diet-induced obese rats. The correlative bivariate analysis showed that increases in Fetuin A were directly proportional to the development of β cell injury.FetA can promote lipotoxicity in β cells through the TLR4-JNK-NF-κB signaling pathway. The protective effects of PIO on lipotoxicity in β cells may involve the inhibition of the activation of the FetA and TLR4 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are supposed to be major factors leading to age-related IR. Genipin, an extract from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit, has been reported to stimulate insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells by regulating mitochondrial function. In this study, we first investigated the effects of genipin on insulin sensitivity and the potential mitochondrial mechanisms in the liver of aging rats.

The aging rats showed hyperinsulinemia and , and insulin resistance as examined by the decreased glucose decay constant rate during insulin tolerance test (kITT). The hepatic tissues showed steatosis and reduced glycogen content. Hepatic malondialdehyde level and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were higher, and levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP were lower as compared with the normal control rats. Administration of genipin ameliorated systemic and hepatic insulin resistance, alleviated hyperinsulinemia, hyperglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, relieved hepatic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in aging rats. Furthermore, genipin not only improved insulin sensitivity by promoting insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and glycogen synthesis, inhibited cellular ROS overproduction and alleviated the reduction of levels of MMP and ATP, but also reversed oxidative stress-associated JNK hyperactivation and reduced Akt phosphorylation in palmitate-treated L02 hepatocytes.

Chicks estrogenized with diethylstilbestrol became grossly hypertriglyceridemic and had elevated levels of plasma free fatty . Within 5 min of administration of labeled palmitate, estrogenized hypertriglyceridemic birds converted approximately 10 times more plasma free fatty  to hepatic triglyceride than did controls. In addition, 2 hr after intraperitoneal injection of [14-C]acetate or [U-14-C]glucose, the specific activity of very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG) of estrogenized birds reached or exceeded that of the untreated controls, and the rapid enrichment of the vastly expanded plasma VLDL-TG pool with labeled triglyceride further indicated that increased production of triglyceride occurs with estrogenization. Furthermore, [14-C]acetate incorporation into VLDL-TG was calculated to be 1.6 and 6.6% of the injected dose in estrogenized birds compared with 0.1 and 0.2% in untreated birds. Increased production of plasma VLDL-TG was confirmed by a kinetic study of VLDL-TG metabolism, employing reinjected, endogenously prepared [14-C]triglyceride-labeled VLDL. The fractional turnover rate of VLDL-TG in estrogenized hypertriglyceridemic birds was substantially less than that in untreated controls (0.32 plus or minus 0.03 vs 0.71 plus or minus 0.03/hr), but the total turnover rate was nearly 50 times greater (244 plus or minus 52 vs. 5 plus or minus 1 mg/hr).</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30892088>Novel hypolipidemic conjugates of fatty  and bile  with lysine for linkage.</a></h2><p>Novel fatty -bile  conjugates (1a-1k) were designed and synthesized by coupling of the fatty acids to the 3-OH of bile acids using lysine for linkage.

In this study, we investigated whether SMS may exert a beneficial effect in diabetic cardiomyopathy through improvement of mitochondrial lipid metabolism.A leptin receptor-deficient db/db mouse model was utilized, and lean age-matched C57BLKS mice served as non-diabetic controls. Glucose and lipid profiles, myocardial structure, dimension, and function, and heart weight to tibial length ratio were determined. Myocardial ultrastructural morphology was observed with transmission electron microscopy. Protein expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex were assessed using western blotting and microplate assay kits. We also observed cellular viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, OXPHOS complex activity, and cellular ATP level in -stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Changes in the sirtuin (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) pathway and mitochondrial uncoupling signaling were assessed using western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR.Leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit obesity, hyperglycemia, and , accompanied by distinct myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS at a dose of 3 g/kg body weight contributed to a recovery of diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. SMS administration led to an effective restoration of mitochondrial structure and function both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, SMS markedly enhanced SIRT1 and p-AMPKα protein levels and decreased the expression of acetylated-PGC-1α and uncoupling protein 2 protein. SMS also restored the depletion of NRF1 and TFAM levels in diabetic hearts and H9C2 cardiomyocytes.The results indicate that SMS may alleviate diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction by improving mitochondrial lipid metabolism.© 2018 The Author(s).

Clarification of the molecular mechanism of metabolic disorder and exploration of drug targets are crucial for the treatment of T2DM.  We examined miR-125a-5p levels in -induced AML12 cells and the livers of type 2 diabetic rats and mice, and then validated its target gene. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, the effects of miR-125a-5p via targeting of STAT3 on regulating glycolipid metabolism were further illustrated  and .  We found that miR-125a-5p was significantly decreased in the livers of diabetic mice and rats, and STAT3 was identified as the target gene of miR-125a-5p. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p in C57BL/6 mice decreased STAT3 level and downregulated the expression levels of p-STAT3 and SOCS3. Consequently, SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis pathway was inhibited, and PI3K/AKT pathway was activated. Moreover, silencing of miR-125a-5p significantly increased the expression levels of STAT3, p-STAT3 and SOCS3, thus activating SREBP-1c pathway and suppressing PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore, hyperglycemia,  and decreased liver glycogen appeared in C57BL/6 mice. In -induced AML12 cells, miR-125a-5p mimic markedly increased glucose consumption and uptake and decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets by regulating STAT3 signaling pathway. Consistently, miR-125a-5p overexpression obviously inhibited STAT3 expression in diabetic KK-Ay mice, thereby decreasing blood glucose and lipid levels, increasing hepatic glycogen content, and decreasing accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets in diabetic mice. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-125a-5p in KK-Ay mice aggravated glycolipid metabolism dysfunction through regulating STAT3.  Our results confirmed that miR-125a-5p should be considered as a regulator of glycolipid metabolism in T2DM, which can inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis and elevate glycogen synthesis by targeting STAT3.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24734256>P38 plays an important role in glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in INS-1 cells.</a></h2><p>The mechanism underlying the regulation of glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis by MAPKs was examined in INS-1 cells.The rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 was cotreated with glucose (30 mM) and  (0.2 mM) (GLU+PA).

J. Lipid Res. 33: 97-109). The present studies investigated whether saturated fatty acids of varying chain lengths have differential effects on LDL metabolism. Guinea pigs were fed 15% (w/w, 35% calories) fat diets containing either palm kernel oil (PK), 52% lauric /18% myristic ; palm oil (PO), 43% /4% stearic ; or beef tallow (BT), 23% /14% stearic . Plasma LDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher for animals fed the PK diet (P < 0.001) with values of 83 +/- 19 (n = 12), 53 +/- 8 (n = 12) and 44 +/- 16 (n = 10) mg/dl for PK, PO, and BT diets, respectively. The relative percentage composition of LDL was modified by fat type; however, LDL diameters and peak densities were not different between diets, indicating no effect of saturated fatty  composition on LDL size. ApoB/E receptor-mediated LDL fractional catabolic rates (FCR) were significantly lower in animals fed the PK diet (P < 0.01) and LDL apoB flux rates were reduced (P < 0.01) in animals fed the BT diet. A correlation was found between plasma LDL levels and receptor-mediated LDL catabolism (r = -0.66, P < 0.01). A higher apoB/E receptor number (Bmax), determined by in vitro LDL binding to guinea pig hepatic membranes, was observed for animals fed BT versus PK or PO diets and Bmax values were significantly correlated with plasma LDL levels (r = -0.776, P < 0.001). These results indicate that saturated fatty acids of varying chain length have differential effects on hepatic apoB/E receptor expression and on LDL apoB flux rates which in part account for differences in plasma LDL cholesterol levels of guinea pigs fed these saturated fats.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621707>Plasma lipidomic signatures of spontaneous obese rhesus monkeys.</a></h2><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and arachidonic  (C20:4), FFA especially  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys.

We examined palmitate effects on pancreatic islet function in relation to FFA receptor GPR40, NO generation, insulin release, and the PPARgamma agonistic thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone.Rosiglitazone suppressed acute palmitate-stimulated GPR40-transduced PI hydrolysis in HEK293 cells and insulin release from MIN6c cells and mouse islets. Culturing islets 24 h with palmitate at 5 mmol/l glucose induced beta-cell iNOS expression as revealed by confocal microscopy and increased the activities of ncNOS and iNOS associated with suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin response. Rosiglitazone reversed these effects. The expression of iNOS after high-glucose culturing was unaffected by rosiglitazone. Downregulation of GPR40 by antisense treatment abrogated GPR40 expression and suppressed palmitate-induced iNOS activity and insulin release.We conclude that, in addition to mediating acute FFA-stimulated insulin release, GPR40 is an important regulator of iNOS expression and dysfunctional insulin release during long-term exposure to FFA.

Leukocytes from the patients incorporated 9.82 plus or minus 1.7 (S.E.M.) nanomoles of glucose into cellular lipid per 10-8 cells per hour. When the cell lipid extract was sugjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis, 92 per cent of the glucose radioactivity was recovered in the glycerol backbone of the lipid esters. Comparison of specific yields of CO2 from glucose labeled in the 1- or 6- position revealed that 0.53 plus or minus 0.02 per cent was metabolized via the pentose cycle. The leukocytes from hypertriglyceridemic persons incorproated 140 plus or minus 6.9 nanomoles of [1-14C]-palmitate per 10-8 cells per hour. Eighty-four per cent of the radioactivity was in triglycerides and 14 per cent in phospholipids. The major phospholipid into which palmitate was incorporated was phosphatidyl choline. The leukocytes oxidized palmitate at a rate of 2.88 plus or minus 0.23 nanomoles per 10-8 cells per hour. There were no differences in any of the above values between leukocytes from hypertriglyceridemic patients and normal subjects. Likewise, there was no correlation between the plasma triglyceride concentration and glucose or palmitate incorporation into triglycerides.

Interestingly, it is an accumulation of M2 macrophages that is observed in the adipose, liver and lung tissues, as well as in the circulation, of patients who have had major traumas such as a burn injury or sepsis; however, the trigger for the M2 polarization observed in these patients has not yet been identified. In the current study, we explored the effects of chronic palmitate and high glucose treatment on macrophage differentiation and function in murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. We found that chronic treatment with palmitate decreased phagocytosis and HLA-DR expression in addition to inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic palmitate treatment of bone marrows also led to M2 polarization, which correlated with the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ signalling pathway. Furthermore, we found that chronic palmitate treatment increased the expression of multiple endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, including binding immunoglobulin protein. Preconditioning with the universal ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate attenuated ER stress signalling and neutralized the effect of palmitate, inducing a pro-inflammatory phenotype. We confirmed these results in differentiating human macrophages, showing an anti-inflammatory response to chronic palmitate exposure. Though alone it did not promote M2 polarization, hyperglycaemia exacerbated the effects of palmitate. These findings suggest that the dominant accumulation of M2 in adipose tissue and liver in patients with critical illness may be a result of  and hyperglycaemia, both components of the hypermetabolism observed in critically ill patients.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31505108>[How surplus of  fatty  in food initiates hypertriglyceridemia, increases cholesterol of low density lipoproteins, triggers atherosclerosis and develops atheromatosis.]</a></h2><p>In phylogenesis, the first transfer of all fatty acids to cells is implemented by high density lipoproteins.

A randomized, crossover single-blind study (n = 10 healthy men) was designed to compare the effects of a high-fat load (50 g fat), rich in  from both plant (palm olein) or animal source (lard) versus an oleic -rich fat (virgin olive oil) on lipemia, plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines. Serum triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations were significantly lower after the lard meal than after the olive oil and palm olein meals (meal effect P = 0.003; time effect P < 0.001). The greater reduction in the plasma non-esterified free fatty acids levels in the lard group compared to the olive oil meal was mirrored by the changes observed for serum TAG levels (P < 0.05). The magnitude of response for plasma glucose, insulin and adipocytokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and leptin] were not altered by the type of dietary fats. A significant difference in plasma IL-1β was found over time following the three high fat loads (time effect P = 0.036). The physical characteristics and changes in TAG structure of lard may contribute to the smaller increase in postprandial lipemia compared with palm olein.

The stearic--induced lipotoxicity and reduction in insulin secretion were alleviated by AMO-34a-5p.

Fat interesterification is a process that implies a positional distribution of fatty acids (FAs) within the TAG molecules, generating new TAG species, without affecting the FA - natural balance. The interesterified (IE) fats, frequently used in the food industry comprise fats that are rich in long-chain saturated FAs, such as  (16:0) and stearic  (18:0). Within the interesterified fats, a critical role is played by FA occupying the -2 position; in fact, the presence of an unsaturated FA in this specific position influences early metabolic processing and postprandial clearance that in turn could induce atherogenesis and thrombogenesis events.

Meteorin-like protein (METRNL), a novel secreted protein homologous to the neurotrophin Metrn, is induced after exercise in the skeletal muscle. Herein, we investigated the effects of METRNL on lipid-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ). Treatment with METRNL suppressed inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor κB (NFκB) nuclear translocation, inhibitory κBα (IκBα) phosphorylation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and MCP-1). METRNL treatment also attenuated the impaired insulin response both in palmitate-treated differentiated C2C12 cells and the skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Furthermore, METRNL administration rescued glucose intolerance and reduced HFD-induced body weight gain in mice; however, METRNL did not affect calorie intake. METRNL treatment increased AMPK phosphorylation and PPARδ expression both in differentiated C2C12 cells and mouse skeletal muscle. siRNA-mediated suppression of AMPK and PPARδ abrogated the suppressive effects of METRNL on palmitate-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. Moreover, METRNL augmented the mRNA expression of fatty  oxidation-associated genes, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), and fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3). siRNAs for AMPK and PPARδ reversed these changes.

The present study was designed to test whether this NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the "two-hit" injury during nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether it can be a therapeutic target for the action of Fufang Zhenzhu Tiaozhi (FTZ), a widely used herbal remedy for  and metabolic syndrome in China. We first demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation as well as lipid deposition occurred in the liver of mice on the high-fat diet (HFD), as shown by increased NLRP3 aggregation, enhanced production of IL-1 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and remarkable lipid deposition in liver cells. FTZ extracts not only significantly reduced the NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation but also attenuated the liver steatosis and fibrogenic phenotype changed. In  studies,  (PA) was found to increase colocalization of NLRP3 components and enhanced caspase-1 activity in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), indicating enhanced formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by PA. PA also increased lipid deposition. Nlrp3 siRNA can reverse this effect by silencing the NLRP3 inflammasome and both with FTZ. In FTZ-treated cells, not only inflammasome formation and activation was substantially attenuated but also lipid deposition in HSCs was blocked. This inhibition of FTZ on lipid deposition was similar to the effects of glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, stimulated membrane raft redox signaling platform formation and increased O production by PA to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes in HSCs was blocked by FTZ treatment.

Fatty  metabolism is a significant mechanism for creating energy for the heart. However, cardiomyocytes are able to switch the fatty acids or glucose, depending on different situations, such as ischemia or anoxia.

Our results show PA induces time- and dose-dependent lipotoxicity in H9c2 cells. Moreover, PA enhances cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and reduces glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) pathway protein levels following a short period of treatment, but cells switch from CD36 back to the GLUT4 pathway after during long-term exposure to PA. As sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) play important roles in CD36 and GLUT4 translocation, we used the SIRT1 activator resveratrol and si-PKCζ to identify the switches in metabolism. Although PA reduced CD36 and increased GLUT4 metabolic pathway proteins, when we pretreated cells with resveratrol to activate SIRT1 or transfected si-PKCζ, both were able to significantly increase CD36 metabolic pathway proteins and reduce GLUT4 pathway proteins. High-fat diets affect energy metabolism pathways in both normal and aging rats and involve switching the energy source from the CD36 pathway to GLUT4. In conclusion, PA and high-fat diets cause lipotoxicity in vivo and in vitro and adversely switch the energy source from the CD36 pathway to the GLUT4 pathway.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the suppression of postprandial lipidemia is valuable for disease management. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR ) is a key regulator in the lipid metabolism of peripheral tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle, whose activation enhances fatty  oxidation and decreases circulating lipid level. Recently, we have shown that bezafibrate, an agonistic compound for PPAR , suppresses post-prandial lipidemia by enhancing fatty  oxidation in intestinal epithelial cells under physiological conditions. However, it was not elucidated whether the effect of PPAR on postprandial lipidemia is also observed under obese conditions, which change lipid metabolisms in various tissues and cells. Here, we observed that bezafibrate enhanced fatty  oxidation in intestinal epithelial cells of obese diabetic KK-Ay mice. Bezafibrate treatment increased the mRNA expression levels of fatty  oxidation-related genes, which are targets of PPAR , and enhanced CO2 production from [14C]-. The bezafibrate-treated mice showed the suppression of increasing serum triacylglyceride level after the oral administration of olive oil. Moreover, the effects of bezafibrate on mRNA expression and fatty  oxidation were shown in only the proximal intestinal epithelial cells. These findings indicate that PPAR activation suppresses postprandial lipidemia under obese conditions through the enhancement of fatty  oxidation, and that only the proximal intestine con-tributes to the effects in mice, suggesting that intestinal PPAR can be a target for prevention of obese-induced postprandial lipidemia.© 2013 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.

TG content, ACC, and AMPK were examined in the liver and skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant JCR:LA-cp rats during the time frame when insulin resistance develops. At 12 weeks of age, there was a threefold elevation in liver TG content and a sevenfold elevation in skeletal muscle TG content.

Lipid peroxidation can also be demonstrated in other diseases: we found very high MDA concentration in 11 alcoholic patients (alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis) and 6 patients with inflammatory conditions such as Crohn disease.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8074602>Individual responsiveness to a cholesterol-lowering diet in postmenopausal women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>The efficacy of the step 1 diet in outpatient women with hypercholesterolemia has been debated.Forty-one normotriglyceridemic women whose low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were 3.62 to 5.17 mmol/L (140 to 200 mg/dL) participated in a two-period outpatient diet counseling study that used a 1-month high-fat, high-saturated fatty  period (Hi-Sat diet) and a 4-month low-fat, low-saturated fatty  period (step 1 diet). All women were postmenopausal and were not taking hormone replacement therapy. Levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and plasma triglyceride fatty acids were measured five times during the last 2 weeks of each dietary period. Dietary intake was assessed by 7-day food records.The mean reduction in total cholesterol level achieved by the step 1 diet was 0.36 mmol/L (14 mg/dL). The reduction in total cholesterol level was seen in both LDL cholesterol levels (0.28 mmol/L [11 mg/dL]; P < .005) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (0.08 mmol/L [3 mg/dL]; P = .08). Although individual LDL responsiveness to diet was normally distributed, there was marked variation in response, which could be explained only partially by compliance (change in saturated fat intake, 10%), change in body weight (3%), and an interaction between the  content of the plasma and body weight (3%).A step 1 diet lowers total and LDL cholesterol levels in postmenopausal women. A nonsignificant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was also observed. Since some women achieved LDL cholesterol levels low enough to obviate the need for drug therapy as primary prevention of coronary heart disease, dietary therapy should remain the first step in the management of hypercholesterolemia in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8243016>[Preliminary evaluation of an association of polyunsaturated acids in primary hypertriglyceridemia].</a></h2><p>The above study was intended to evaluate changes in triglyceride blood level in subjects treated with a polyunsaturated fatty  combination: docosahexanoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) , compared to changes observed in patients treated with arachidonic .

Cells incubated with hypercholesterolemic LDL accumulated 2-3 times more cholesteryl ester than did cells incubated with the same amount of normal LDL. Cholesteryl oleate was the principal cholesteryl ester species to accumulate in cells incubated with both normal and hypercholesterolemic LDL. Efflux of this accumulated cholesterol was absolutely dependent on the presence of a cholesterol acceptor in the culture medium. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was the most potent promoter of cholesterol efflux tested, with maximum efflux occurring at LPDS concentrations greater than 1.5 mg protein/ml. Upon addition of efflux medium containing LPDS, there was a reduction in both the free and esterified cholesterol concentration of the cells. Greater than 90% of the cholesteryl esters that were lost from the cells appeared in the culture medium as free cholesterol, indicating that hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters preceded efflux. Efflux was not inhibited by chloroquine, however, suggesting a mechanism independent of lysosomes. Loss of cellular free cholesterol was maximum by 6 hr and changed very little thereafter up to 72 hr. Cholesteryl ester loss from cells decreased in a log linear fashion for efflux periods of 6-72 hr, with an average half-life for cholesteryl ester efflux of 30 hr, but with a range of 20-50 hr, depending upon the specific cell line. The rate of efflux of cellular cholesteryl esters was similar for cells loaded with normal or hypercholesterolemic LDL. In cells loaded with cholesteryl esters, cholesterol synthesis was suppressed and cholesterol esterification and fatty  synthesis were enhanced. During efflux, cholesterol synthesis remained maximally suppressed while cholesterol esterification decreased for the first 24 hr of efflux, then plateaued at a level approximately 5-fold higher than control levels, while fatty  synthesis was slightly stimulated. There was little difference in the rate of efflux of individual cholesteryl ester species. There was, however, the suggestion that reesterification of cholesterol principally to  occurred during efflux. Since the rate of cellular cholesteryl ester efflux was similar regardless of whether the cells had been loaded with cholesterol by incubation with normal LDL or hypercholesterolemic LDL, the greater accumulation of cholesterol in cells incubated with hypercholesterolemic LDL cannot be explained by differences in rates of efflux.-St. Clair, R.

High fat diets have been shown to induce obesity and . Despite considerable advances in our understanding of cholesterol metabolism, the regulation of liver cholesterol biosynthesis in response to high fat diet feeding has not been fully addressed. The aim of the present study was to investigate mechanisms by which a high fat diet caused activation of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) leading to increased cholesterol biosynthesis. Mice were fed a high fat diet (60% kcal fat) for 5weeks. High fat diet feeding induced weight gain and elevated lipid levels (total cholesterol and triglyceride) in both the liver and serum. Despite cholesterol accumulation in the liver, there was a significant increase in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and protein expression as well as enzyme activity. The DNA binding activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 and specific protein 1 (Sp1) were also increased in the liver of mice fed a high fat diet. To validate the in vivo findings, HepG2 cells were treated with . Such a treatment activated SREBP-2 as well as increased the mRNA and enzyme activity of HMG-CoA reductase leading to intracellular cholesterol accumulation. Inhibition of Sp1 by siRNA transfection abolished -induced SREBP-2 and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression. These results suggest that Sp1-mediated SREBP-2 activation contributes to high fat diet induced HMG-CoA reductase activation and increased cholesterol biosynthesis.

We investigated the dynamic changes and the underlying regulatory mechanism of postprandial FFA profile in  (HLP) and their relation with insulin sensitivity in both humans and mice. We found that serum stearic  (SA) is the only fatty  that is increased dramatically in the postprandial state. The elevation of SA is due to increased insulin-stimulated de novo synthesis mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase/fatty  synthase/elongation of long-chain fatty  family member 6 (ELOVL6) and the elongation of  (PA) catalyzed by ELOVL6. Downregulation of SREBP-1c or ELOVL6 by small interfering RNA can reduce SA synthesis in liver and serum SA level, followed by amelioration of IR in HLP mice. However, inhibition of SREBP-1c is more effective in improving IR than suppression of ELOVL6, which resulted in accumulation of PA. In summary, increased postprandial SA is caused by the insulin-stimulated SREBP-1c pathway and elongation of PA in HLP. Reduction of postprandial SA is a good candidate for improving IR, and SREBP-1c is potentially a better target to prevent IR and diabetes by decreasing SA.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758650>Elucidation of mechanisms of actions of thymoquinone-enriched methanolic and volatile oil extracts from Nigella sativa against cardiovascular risk parameters in experimental .</a></h2><p>Nigella sativa belonging to the Ranunculaceae family has been reported to use for thousands of years as protective and curative traditional medicine against a number of diseases.

An abnormal platelet function is one of the mechanisms proposed to participate in atherogenesis. This study was undertaken to find out whether hypercholesterolemia in hypertensive patients can change platelet lipid composition and reactivity. Twenty-nine untreated hypertensive patients were distributed into 3 age, body mass index and blood pressure-matched groups according to their plasma cholesterol levels (normal, borderline or elevated, group NC, BC and HC respectively). Their platelet lipid composition, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, cyclic AMP content and aggregating response to ADP and collagen were determined. Platelet from group HC patients were characterized by reduced cyclic AMP content (evaluated in the presence and absence of a platelet phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and aggregating responses to ADP and collagen, increased  content and decreased arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosatetraenoic and pentaenoic  content, resulting in a lowered polyunsaturated to saturated fatty  ratio (P less than 0.001). In contrast, platelet cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, DPH steady-state anisotropy and cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio were not significantly changed. This indicates that hypercholesterolemia is accompanied in hypertensive patients by marked changes in platelet fatty  composition, cyclic AMP content and response to aggregating agents.

Stable isotope tracers [1-(13)C]palmitate and [1,1,2,3,3-(2)H5]glycerol were continuously infused with blood and breath collection during 1-h rest, 70-min submaximal exercise (50% VO2 peak), and 1-h recovery. Body composition was evaluated using DEXA, MRI, and MRS, and 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests with insulin monitoring were used to evaluate glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Lipolytic and FA oxidation rates were similar during rest and recovery in all groups; however, they were lower during moderate exercise in both HIV-infected groups [glycerol Ra: HIV+RTV 5.1+/-1.2 vs. HIV+no PI 5.9+/-2.8 vs. Control 7.4+/-2.2 micromol.kg fat-free mass (FFM)-1.min-1; palmitate oxidation: HIV+RTV 1.6+/-0.8 vs. HIV+no PI 1.6+/-0.8 vs. Control 2.5+/-1.7 micromol.kg FFM.min, P<0.01]. Fasting and orally-challenged glucose and insulin values were similar among groups. Lipolytic and FA oxidation rates were blunted during moderate exercise in HIV-positive subjects taking HAART. Lower FA oxidation during exercise was primarily due to impaired plasma FA oxidation, with a minor contribution from lower nonplasma FA oxidation. Regional differences in adipose tissue lipolysis during rest and moderate exercise may be important in HIV and warrant further study.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/930182>[Effects of various modes of therapy on the fatty  spectrum in hyperlipoproteinemia].</a></h2><p>Gas-chromatographic investigations of the fatty  pattern of the fractions of serum triglyceride and serum cholesterol ester revealed characteristic changes under different therapeutic measures in altogether 120 patients with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia of the types IIa, IIb and IV.

Obesity and  are also associated with tissue insulin resistance and can compromise insulin delivery to muscle. The muscle/fat microvascular endothelium mediates insulin delivery and facilitates monocyte transmigration, yet its contribution to the consequences of  is poorly understood. Using primary endothelial cells from human adipose tissue microvasculature (HAMEC), we investigated the effects of physiological levels of fatty acids on endothelial inflammation and function. Expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules was measured by RT-qPCR. Signaling pathways were evaluated by pharmacological manipulation and immunoblotting. Surface expression of adhesion molecules was determined by immunohistochemistry. THP1 monocyte interaction with HAMEC was measured by cell adhesion and migration across transwells. Insulin transcytosis was measured by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Palmitate, but not palmitoleate, elevated the expression of IL-6, IL-8, TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). HAMEC had markedly low fatty  uptake and oxidation, and CD36 inhibition did not reverse the palmitate-induced expression of adhesion molecules, suggesting that inflammation did not arise from palmitate uptake/metabolism. Instead, inhibition of TLR4 to NF-κB signaling blunted palmitate-induced ICAM-1 expression. Importantly, palmitate-induced surface expression of ICAM-1 promoted monocyte binding and transmigration. Conversely, palmitate reduced insulin transcytosis, an effect reversed by TLR4 inhibition. In summary, palmitate activates inflammatory pathways in primary microvascular endothelial cells, impairing insulin transport and increasing monocyte transmigration. This behavior may contribute in vivo to reduced tissue insulin action and enhanced tissue infiltration by immune cells.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24194305>Lipid-stimulated somatostatin secretion in rainbow trout,Oncorhynchus mykiss.</a></h2><p>Previous work has shown that somatostatins (SS) affect teleost lipid metabolism indirectly by inhibition of insulin (INS) and directly by stimulation of hepatic lipolysis.

The fatty liver in fld/fld mice spontaneously resolves between the age of 14-18 days, at which point the animals develop a neuropathy associated with abnormal myelin formation in peripheral nerve. We have investigated the morphological and biochemical alterations that occur in the fatty liver of neonatal fld/fld mice. Studies at the light and electron microscopic level demonstrated the accumulation of lipid droplets and hypertrophic parenchymal cells in fld neonates, with no apparent liver pathology after resolution of the fatty liver. To better characterize the biochemical basis for the development of fatty liver in fld mice, we compared protein expression patterns in the fatty liver of fld mice and in the liver of phenotypically normal (wild-type) littermates using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We detected 24 proteins with significantly altered expression levels (P < 0.001) in the fld fatty liver, 15 of which are proteins that are altered in abundance by peroxisome proliferating chemicals. As these compounds characteristically elicit changes in the expression of mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes involved in fatty  oxidation, we quantitated rates of fatty  oxidation in hepatocytes isolated from fld and wild-type mice. These studies revealed that hepatic fatty  oxidation in fld neonates is reduced by 60% compared to wild-type littermates. In hepatocytes from adult fld mice that no longer exhibit a fatty liver, oxidation rates were similar to those in hepatocytes from age-matched wild-type mice. These findings indicate that altered expression of proteins involved in fatty  oxidation is associated with triglyceride accumulation in the fld fatty liver.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6405546>[Clinico-experimental long-term study on the combined effect of clofibrin and nicotinic  on abnormal fatty  patterns in lipid metabolism disorders in the aged].</a></h2><p>Seventy-one patients (forty-two males and twenty-nine females aged forty-five to seventy-six) with disturbances of fat metabolism were treated for three years with clofibric  and nicotinic  derivatives.

Peroxisome proliferator drugs, including the fibrates used to treat , may be useful in this regard, as they induce malic enzyme, the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase I in rodent hepatocytes. An agent of this class, MEDICA 16, has the additional property of potently inhibiting both citrate lyase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. As a result, methyl-substituted diacarboxylic acids (MEDICA) 16 can be expected to disinhibit hepatic fatty  oxidation while up-regulating electron shuttle mechanisms, and thus should stimulate reverse electron transport. This may explain the remarkable 40% increase in basal metabolic rate observed in normal rats ingesting MEDICA 16--an effect not associated with any compensatory increase in food intake. Relative to controls, the MEDICA 16-treated rats achieved a 50% reduction in body fat and a modest increase in lean mass, such that weight and growth were not changed. In other rodent strains, MEDICA 16 has prevented obesity diabetes and atherogenesis. However, whether MEDICA 16 and other peroxisome proliferator drugs will have clinical utility in reverse-electron-transport therapy may hinge on their ability to induce key enzymes in human hepatocytes; cell culture studies to evaluate this are required.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128402>An anti-inflammatory chalcone derivative prevents heart and kidney from -induced injuries by attenuating inflammation.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a growing pandemic in both developed and developing countries. Lipid overload in obesity generates a chronic, low-grade inflammation state. Increased inflammation in heart and renal tissues has been shown to promote the progression of heart and renal damage in obesity. Previously, we found that a novel chalcone derivative, L6H21, inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response. In the present study, we investigated the effects of L6H21 on inflammatory responses in culture and in animal models of lipid overload. We utilized  (PA) challenging in mouse peritoneal macrophages and apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE) mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) to study whether L6H21 mitigates the inflammatory response. Our studies show that L6H21 significantly reduced PA-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) signaling pathways. L6H21 also reduced fibrosis in the kidney and heart tissues, and indices of inflammatory response in the ApoE mice fed a HFD. These effects in vivo were also associated with inhibition of MAPK and NFκB signaling by L6H21. These findings strongly suggest that L6H21 may be a potential agent for high fat diet-induced injuries in heart and kidney.Copyright © 2017.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of 4HD, XAG, CAR, and FKB to reduce lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. When HepG2 cells were treated with a mixture of fatty acids (FAs;  : oleic  = 1 : 2 ratio), significant lipid accumulation was observed. Under the same experimental conditions, addition of chalcones at 5 μM significantly suppressed the FA-induced lipid accumulation. We found that the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a key molecule involved in lipogenesis, was decreased in these chalcone-treated cells. We also found that these chalcones increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which is involved in FA oxidation. Moreover, these chalcones increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1), upstream regulators of SREBP-1 and PPARα. We confirmed that an AMPK inhibitor, compound C, reversed chalcone-induced changes in SREBP-1 and PPARα expression in the HepG2 cells.

This study aimed at establishing whether phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and its subcellular location play a role in FFA-induced endothelial oxidative stress.Exposing human endothelial cells (ECs) with FFA activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6K pathway, and upon activation, S6K directly phosphorylated PTEN at S380. Phosphorylation of PTEN increased its interaction with its deubiquitinase USP7 in the nucleus, leading to PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear export. The reduction of PTEN in the nucleus, in turn, decreased p53 acetylation and transcription, reduced the expression of the p53 target gene glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1), resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and endothelial damage. Finally, C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat atherogenic diet (HFAD) showed PTEN nuclear export, decreased p53 and GPX1 protein expressions, elevated levels of ROS, and significant lesions in aortas.

The precise anatomical locus that controls the biochemical and physiological adaptations to optimise nutrient use is unknown. We explored the changes in liver oxidative lipid handling, such as β-oxidation and its regulation, as well as adaptations in the lipoprotein profile. It was found that daytime restricted feeding promoted an elevation of circulating ketone bodies before mealtime, an altered hepatic daily rhythmicity of 14CO2 production from radioactive , and an up-regulation of the fatty  oxidation activators, the α-subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the deacetylase silent mating type information regulation homolog 1, and the transcriptional factor PPARγ-1α coactivator. An increased localisation of phosphorylated α-subunit of AMPK in the periportal hepatocytes was also observed. Liver hepatic lipase C, important for lipoprotein transformation, showed a change of daily phase with a peak at the time of food access. In serum, there was an increase of LDL, which was responsible for a net elevation of circulating cholesterol. We conclude that our results indicate an enhanced fasting response in the liver during daily synchronisation to food access, which involves altered metabolic and cellular control of fatty  oxidation as well a significant elevation of serum LDL.

Some authorities advise the restriction of fat intake to the extreme of less than 10% of daily energy on the assumption that more fat restriction is better. The two studies described herein address questions relating to whether increasing fat restriction produces proportionally increasing benefit on cardiovascular risk factors in hyperlipidemic subjects. The first study is the Dietary Alternatives Study (DAS). The DAS was conducted in 531 male Boeing employees over a 2-year period. Subjects were defined as hypercholesterolemic (HC) or combined hyperlipidemic (CHL) based on age-specific 75th percentiles for plasma LDL-C and triglyceride levels. Hypothesis test analyses were performed at 1 year. HC subjects were randomized to diets taught to attain fat intakes of 30, 26, 22, and 18% (Diets levels 1-4, respectively). CHL subjects (slightly fewer in number) were randomized to Diets 1-3.

Surprisingly, plasma triglyceride concentrations rose in HC subjects 20% and 40% above baseline on Diets 3 and 4, respectively, with reciprocal reductions in HDL cholesterol of 2.5% and 3%, respectively. Furthermore, apo B reductions were attenuated below Diet 2 in HC subjects and Diet 1 in CHL subjects, and no further reductions were seen in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, blood pressure, or body weight. Measurements of plasma total fatty  composition showed a slight increase in plasma palmitate, whereas stearate decreased slightly, supporting the idea that de novo synthesis of  was increased in the chronic high-carbohydrate feeding condition.

To answer this question, men and women Boeing employees were taught the closely similar National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step II diet. After 6 and 12 months, equivalent reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed in women compared with men. HDL cholesterol levels in men were unchanged from baseline at 6 and 12 months, but were reduced 8% in HC women, with accompanying decreases of 18% in HDL2-cholesterol and 5% in apoprotein A-I (all P < 0.01). These data indicate that intakes of fat below about 25 en% and carbohydrate intake above approximately 60 en% yield no further LDL-C lowering in HC and CHL male subjects and can be counterproductive to triglyceride, HDL-C, and apo B levels. This lack of benefit appears to be explained by an enhanced endogenous synthesis of , which negates the benefit of further saturated fat restriction. The HDL-C decrease in HC women may have a similar cause and points to an underlying male-female difference. Alternative dietary approaches to limit saturated fat intake deserve intensive study.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7077155>Changes in the metabolism of fatty acids in adipose tissue in obese patients with primary hypertriacylglycerolemia.</a></h2><p>Changes in the release and esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) in adipose tissue were looked for as a cause of moderate primary hypertriacylglycerolemia (HTG) in five obese subjects. Comparison was made with six obese normolipidemic subjects. The two groups were matched for body weight, tolerance of intravenous glucose, fat cell size, fasting levels of serum immunoreactive insulin, and serum insulin response to an intravenous glucose load. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was incubated in vitro with [1-14C] for 30, 60, and 120 min. There was a significant, twofold increase in the rate of FFA mobilization, but no change of glycerol release in HTG patients. The adipose tissue levels of mono- and diacylglycerols were similar in the two groups of subjects and did not change during incubation. Re-esterification of FFA, calculated from the net changes in medium and in tissue FFA and glycerol release, was lower in HTG patients than in the controls (3 and 12 mumol/10(7) cells/hr, respectively; P less than 0.025). In adipose tissue of HTG patients, the amount of radioactive fatty acids incorporated into triacylglycerols (TG) was 50% lower (P less than 0.025), whereas that incorporated into tissue FFA was three times higher (P less than 0.01) when compared with control patients. It is concluded that, in adipose tissue of obese patients with primary hypertriacylglycerolemia, the esterification of free fatty acids to triacylglycerol is decreased. As a consequence, free fatty acids are mobilized at an increased rate.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23911664>GPR40 protein levels are crucial to the regulation of stimulated hormone secretion in pancreatic islets. Lessons from spontaneous obesity-prone and non-obese type 2 diabetes in rats.</a></h2><p>The role of islet GPR40 protein in the pathogenesis of diabetes is unclear. We explored the influence of GPR40 protein levels on hormone secretion in islets from two rat models of spontaneous type 2 diabetes displaying either  or hyperglycaemia. GPR40 expression was analysed by confocal microscopy, Western blot and qPCR in islets from preobese Zucker (fa/fa) rats, diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, and controls. Confocal microscopy of control islets showed expression of GPR40 protein in insulin, glucagon and somatostatin cells. GPR40 expression was strongly increased in islets of hyperlipidaemic fa/fa rats and coincided with a concentration-related increase in palmitate-induced release of insulin and glucagon and its inhibition of somatostatin release. Conversely, hyperglycaemic GK islets displayed an extremely faint expression of GPR40 as did high-glucose-cultured control islets. This was reflected in abolished palmitate-induced hormone response in GK islets and high-glucose-cultured control islets. The palmitate antagonist rosiglitazone promoted reappearance of GPR40 in high-glucose-cultured islets and served as partial agonist in glucose-stimulated insulin release. GPR40 protein is abundantly expressed in pancreatic islets and modulates stimulated hormone secretion. Mild  in obesity-prone diabetes creates increased GPR40 expression and increased risk for an exaggerated palmitate-induced insulin response and lipotoxicity, a metabolic situation suitable for GPR40 antagonist treatment. Chronic hyperglycaemia creates abrogated GPR40 expression and downregulated insulin release, a metabolic situation suitable for GPR40 agonist treatment to avoid glucotoxicity. GPR40 protein is interactively modulated by both free fatty acids and glucose and is a promising target for pharmacotherapy in different variants of type 2 diabetes.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study examines the synergistic effects of glucose and FFA on β-cell apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms involved. Mouse insulinoma cells and primary islets were treated with palmitate at increasing glucose and effects on apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) signaling were examined.Increasing glucose (5-25 mM) with palmitate (400 µM) had synergistic effects on apoptosis. Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation peaked at the lowest glucose concentration, in contrast to a progressive reduction in IRS2 protein and impairment of insulin receptor substrate signaling. A synergistic effect was observed on activation of ER stress markers, along with recruitment of SREBP1 to the nucleus. These findings were confirmed in primary islets. The above effects associated with an increase in glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk3β) activity and were reversed along with apoptosis by an adenovirus expressing a kinase dead Gsk3β.Glucose in the presence of FFA results in synergistic effects on ER stress, impaired insulin receptor substrate signaling and Gsk3β activation.

This study characterizes -induced lipotoxicity (PA-LTx) in Schwann cell cultures grown in normal and high glucose concentrations. The study shows for the first time that Schwann cell (SC) cultures exposed to elevated levels of PA exhibit a dose- and time-dependent loss in cell viability. Hoescht and Annexin V/7AAD staining confirmed cell death through apoptosis and the lipotoxic effect was more dramatic in SC cultures grown under high glucose conditions. The first indication of cellular dysfunction in treated SC cultures was a decrease in Ca(++) levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, [Ca(++)](ER)) observed five minutes following the initial challenge with PA. This decrease in [Ca(++) ](ER) was followed by a significant increase in the expression of ER stress signature genes CHOP, Xbp1 and GRP78. The early ER stress response induced by PA-LTx was followed by a strong mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Flow cytometry using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) showed an increase in oxidative stress within three to six hours after PA treatment. Treatment of cultures undergoing PA-LTx with the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and the anti-oxidant MCI-186 significantly reversed the lipotoxic effect by decreasing the generation of ROS and significantly increasing cell viability. We conclude that lipotoxicity in Schwann cells results in cellular dysfunction and cell death that involves a robust ER stress response, mitochondrial dysfunction and an augmented state of cellular oxidative stress (ASCOS).Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although efforts to explain this have focused on finding a branch point in insulin signaling where hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism diverge, we hypothesized that hepatic triglyceride synthesis could be driven by substrate, independent of changes in hepatic insulin signaling. We tested this hypothesis in rats by infusing [U-(13)C] palmitate to measure rates of fatty  esterification into hepatic triglyceride while varying plasma fatty  and insulin concentrations independently. These experiments were performed in normal rats, high fat-fed insulin-resistant rats, and insulin receptor 2'-O-methoxyethyl chimeric antisense oligonucleotide-treated rats. Rates of fatty  esterification into hepatic triglyceride were found to be dependent on plasma fatty  infusion rates, independent of changes in plasma insulin concentrations and independent of hepatocellular insulin signaling.

Therefore, we in the present study investigated whether HDL can reverse PA induced lipotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells. In this study, we treated H9c2 cells with PA to create a  model in vitro and analyzed for CD36 and GLUT4 metabolic pathway proteins. CD36 metabolic pathway proteins (phospho-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC1α, PPARα, CPT1β, and CD36) were decreased by high PA (150 and 200 μg/μl) concentration. Interestingly, expression of GLUT4 metabolic pathway proteins (p-PI3K and pAKT) were increased at low concentration (50 μg/μl) and decreased at high PA concentration. Whereas, phospho-PKCζ, GLUT4 and PDH proteins expression was increased in a dose dependent manner. PA treated H9c2 cells were treated with HDL and analyzed for cell viability. Results showed that HDL treatment induced cell proliferation efficiency in PA treated cells. In addition, HDL reversed the metabolic effects of PA: CD36 translocation was increased and reduced GLUT4 translocation, but HDL treatment significantly increased CD36 metabolic pathway proteins and reduced GLUT4 pathway proteins.

The action of insulin is realized in the biologic reaction of exotrophy only. The phylogenetic late insulin manages the function of phylogenetic early mitochondrion in the biologic reaction of exotrophy. In the biologic reaction of exotrophy, the cells activatedly absorb glucose under effect of insulin through glucose carriers-4 and actively absorb fat acids in the form of nonpolar triglycerides in olein lipoproteins of very low density by force of receptor endocytosis. These mechanisms formed on late stages of phylogenesis in the becoming of biologic function of locomotion--the function of movement. In the biologic reaction of endotrophy the cells absorb passively glucose under effect of glycaemia in intercellular medium through glucose carriers and passively (on gradient of concentration) absorb the fat acids in polar form under passive diffusion through plasmatic membrane. These reactions are worked out on the early stages of phylogenesis in the becoming of biologic function of homeostasis. The syndrome of resistance to insulin is formed only in biologic reaction of exotrophy but the disorders can persist and during realization of biologic reaction of endotrophy.

The TAG structure of fats can be manipulated by the process of interesterification, which is of increasing commercial importance, as it can be used to change the physical characteristics of a fat without the generation of trans-fatty acids. Interesterified fats rich in long-chain SFA are commercially important, but few studies have investigated their health effects. Evidence from animal and human infant studies suggests that TAG structure and interesterification affect digestibility, atherogenicity and fasting lipid levels, with fats containing  and stearic  in the sn-2 position being better digested and considered to be more atherogenic. However, chronic studies in human adults suggest that TAG structure has no effect on digestibility or fasting lipids. The postprandial effects of fats with differing TAG structure are better characterised but the evidence is inconclusive; it is probable that differences in the physical characteristics of fats resulting from interesterification and changes in TAG structure are key determinants of the level of postprandial lipaemia, rather than the position of fatty acids in the TAG.

However, the effect of procyanidin B2 on free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced hepatic steatosis remains obscure. The present study is therefore aimed to elucidate the protective effect of procyanidin B2 against hepatic steatosis and its underlying mechanism. Herein, we reported that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced lipid accumulation and its associated oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS and superoxide anion radicals, blocking loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring glutathione content, and increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD and CAT) in hepatocytes. Procyanidin B2 mechanistically promoted lipid degradation via modulation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathway. Molecular docking analysis indicated a possible ligand-binding position of procyanidin B2 with TFEB. In addition, administration of procyanidin B2 resulted in a significant reduction of hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and also ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities, including  and hyperglycemia. It was confirmed that procyanidin B2 prevented HFD-induced hepatic fat accumulation through down-regulating lipogenesis-related gene expressions (PPARγ, C/EBPα and SREBP-1c), inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines production (IL-6 and TNF-α) and increasing antioxidant enzymes activity (GPx, SOD and CAT). Moreover, hepatic fatty acids analysis indicated that procyanidin B2 caused a significant increase in the levels of , oleic  and linoleic . Intriguingly, procyanidin B2 restored the decreased nuclear TFEB expression in HFD-induced liver steatosis and up-regulated its target genes involved in lysosomal pathway (Lamp1, Mcoln, Uvrag), which suggested a previously unrecognized mechanism of procyanidin B2 on ameliorating HFD-induced hepatic steatosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that procyanidin B2 attenuated FFAs-induced hepatic steatosis through regulating TFEB-mediated lysosomal pathway and redox state, which had important implications that modulation of TFEB might be a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and procyanidin B2 could represent a promising novel agent in the prevention and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Results showed that plasma levels of Gla-Gas6 protein and VK were significantly lower in hyperlipidemic subjects compared to control. Moreover, Gla-Gas6 levels were significantly and positively correlated with VK (P=.034, r=0.452) and negatively with triglyceride (P=.022, r=-0.485) and total cholesterol (P=.043, r=-0.435) in hyperlipidemic subjects, which suggest that VK supplementation may have a positive effect in activating Gas6 protein and thereby reducing the aberrant plasma lipid levels. Further studies with high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animal model of  demonstrated that VK supplementation (5 μg/kg body weight, 8 weeks) reduced the plasma lipid levels, stimulated both the plasma levels and the hepatic protein expression of Gla-Gas6 protein, and regulated the AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα signaling pathways of hepatic lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, by using  (PA, 0.75 mM)-treated both control and GGCX knockdown hepatocytes, this study dissected the direct role of Gla-Gas6 in mediating the positive effect of VK on preventing the PA-induced impaired hepatic lipid metabolism via regulating AMPK/SREBP1/PPARα pathways. Combining all, the present study demonstrated the beneficial effect of VK supplementation in preventing the impaired lipid homeostasis via activating VK-dependent Gas6 protein.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Serum cholesterol levels in normolipidemic Sprague Dawley male rats were reduced 45% after 8 weeks at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day of compound, orally. Serum triglyceride levels were reduced 38-49% at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, orally. In vitro liver enzyme activities studies in normolipidemic CF1 mice showed the compound inhibited mitochondrial citrate exchange, acetyl CoA synthetase, HMG CoA reductase, acyl CoA cholesterol acyl transferase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyl transferase, phosphatidylate phosphohydrolase and heparin-induced lipoprotein lipase activities with increases in the activities of cholesterol ester hydrolase and ATP-dependent citrate lyase. Similar enzyme activities were inhibited in vivo except HMG CoA reductase activity was not inhibited in rat liver or small intestinal mucosa after 8 weeks drug administration. Cholesterol levels were reduced in tissues after 8 weeks administration of compound 4 in normolipidemic rats. Bile cholesterol and triglyceride levels were elevated after two weeks administration to rats at 20 mg/kg/day. Serum lipoprotein levels in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic rats showed the cholesterol levels in VLDL and LDL fractions after 4, 6 and 8 weeks at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day were reduced whereas HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly elevated.

However, the role of HPS in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle under obesity remains unclear. The effect of  on hepatic HPS expression was evaluated in primary hepatocytes and liver of mice. HPS-mediated signal pathways were explored using small interfering (si) RNAs of specific genes or inhibitors. We found that treatment of primary hepatocytes with palmitate could induce HPS expression through C/EBPβ-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, increased HPS expression was observed in the liver of high fat diet (HFD)-fed or tunicamycin-treated mice. Pretreatment with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-BPA) (an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor) and suppression of p38 by siRNA abrogated the effect of palmitate on HPS expression in primary hepatocytes. Treatment of differentiated C2C12 cells with recombinant HPS caused c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and impairment of insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK reduced the effect of HPS on insulin signaling. Furthermore, the suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by siRNA mitigated both HPS-induced JNK phosphorylation and insulin resistance. In addition, HPS did not affect inflammation and ER stress in differentiated C2C12 cells. In conclusion, we elucidated that ER stress induced by palmitate could increase the expression of HPS in hepatocytes and further contribute to the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle via EGFR/JNK-mediated pathway. Taken together, we suggest that HPS could be a therapeutic target for obesity-linked insulin resistance.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the hypothesis that high-fat meals rich in interesterified palm olein (IPO) decrease lipemia and alter plasma lipoprotein fraction composition compared to native palm olein (NPO) in men aged 40-70 years with fasting TAG concentrations ≥1.2 mmol/L. Postprandial changes in plasma lipids following meals containing 75 g fat (NPO and IPO) were compared using a randomized, double-blind crossover design (n = 11). Although there were no significant differences in plasma TAG concentrations between meals over the total 6-h postprandial measurement period, IPO resulted in a decreased plasma TAG response during the first 4 h of the postprandial period (iAUC 1.65 mmol/L h, 95% CI 1.01-2.29) compared to NPO (iAUC 2.33 mmol/L h, 95% CI 1.58-3.07); meal effect P = 0.024. Chylomicron fraction TAG concentrations at 4-6 h were slightly reduced following IPO compared to NPO [NPO-IPO mean difference 0.29 mmol/L (95% CI -0.01-0.59), P = 0.055]. There were no differences in IDL fraction TAG, cholesterol or apolipoprotein B48 concentrations following IPO compared with NPO.

We hypothesized that  and hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus may induce excessive NEP activity and thereby diminish normal response to injury. Human microvascular endothelial cells were treated with five different fatty acids (40 microM) with varying degrees of saturation, including oleic , linoleic , , stearic , and linolenic  and/or glucose (40 mM) for 48 h. The effect of the antioxidative agents vitamin E and C on NEP enzyme activation was determined by treating the cultured cells with alpha-tocopherol succinate and/or L-ascorbic . Cell membrane preparations were assayed for NEP activity by incubation with glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methoxy-beta naphthylamide to generate a fluorescent degradation product methoxy 2 naphthylamine. High glucose or fatty  concentration upregulated NEP activity. The highest NEP activity was observed with combined elevated glucose, linoleic , and oleic  (P < 0.05). Antioxidant vitamin E and C treatment significantly reduced NEP enzyme activity after fatty  exposure (P < 0.05). Thus, hyperglycemia and  associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus may increase endothelial cell NEP activity and thereby decrease early pro-inflammatory responses.

LXR are expressed also in skeletal muscle, however, their role in this tissue is poorly investigated and the vast majority of available data comes from studies on cultured myotubes. Therefore, we aimed to examine effects of in vivo LXR activation on muscle lipid metabolism. The experiments were performed on male Wistar rats fed on a standard rodent chow. The animals were divided into two groups (n=10) receiving either LXR activator (T0901317, 10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for one week. Samples of the soleus as well as red and white sections of the gastrocnemius muscle were excised. T0901317 increased muscle expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ and its target genes involved in fatty  uptake and oxidation. In addition, LXR agonist enhanced palmitate oxidation (by 55%) in isolated soleus muscle. However, palmitate incorporation into triacylglycerol was decreased (by 38%), which was associated with reduced diacylglycerol acyltransferase expression (by 66%). Despite markedly increased plasma lipid concentration upon T0901317 treatment, muscle triacylglycerol level was elevated only in the red section of the gastrocnemius muscle.

Endocannabinoids mediate their physiological and behavioral effects by activating specific cannabinoid receptors, mainly cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB(1)R). Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is induced by , and renal proximal tubule cells are an important site for the onset of DN. However, the pathophysiology of CB(1)R, especially in the  of DN, has not been elucidated. Therefore, we examined the effect of  (PA) on CB(1)R expression and its related signal pathways in human renal proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells). PA significantly increased CB(1)R mRNA and protein levels and induced CB(1)R internalization. PA-induced activation of CB(1)R is prevented by the treatment of AACOCF(3) (a cPLA(2) inhibitor), indomethacin and NS398 (a COX 2 inhibitors). Indeed, PA increased cPLA(2), and COX-2 but not COX-1. We also investigated whether the PA-induced activation of CB(1)R is linked to apoptosis. As a result, AM251 (a CB(1)R antagonist) attenuated PA-mediated apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PA decreased GRP78 expression and induced increases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathways p-PERK, p-eIF2α, p-ATF4, and CHOP, which were blocked by AM251 treatment. Moreover, PA increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved PARP, and caspase-3 levels. The PA-induced apoptotic effects were decreased with CB(1)R-specific antagonist (AM251) treatment and CB1 si-RNA transfection. In conclusion, PA induced apoptosis through ER stress via CB(1)R expression in human proximal tubule cells.

Then, slower and more durational decreasing of level of spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density occurs. The value of spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density is primarily determined by content of  saturated fatty  in food, its endogenous synthesis from glucose and concentration of  triglycerides and lipoproteins of very low density of the same name in blood plasma. The effect of preparations is biologically valid and corresponds to alternative hypolipidemic preparations. All these preparations have an effect following a common algorithm: they activate, using different mechanisms, receptor absorption of lipoproteins of very low density or lipoproteins of low density by cells. The level of spirit cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density in full measure depends on content of triglycerides in blood. The concentration of spirit cholesterol in blood plasma has a reliable diagnostic significance only under physiological content of triglycerides.

We investigated cell type- and stimulus-specific signaling pathways induced by PA in renal proximal tubular cells and whether oxidative stress leads to ER stress or vice versa and which pathways predominate in signaling for PA-induced apoptosis and necrosis.

We found that (i) PA causes both oxidative and ER stress leading to apoptosis which is mediated by phosphorylated JNK; (ii) oxidant-induced apoptosis generated by H(2)O(2) involves ER stress signaling and CHOP expression; (iii) the ER stress mediated by PA is largely independent of oxidative stress; (iv) in contrast, the apoptosis produced by PA is mediated partly via oxidative stress.

The pathogenic mechanisms of obesity-associated renal injury are recognized to at least involve a lipid-rich and pro-inflammatory state of the renal tissues, but specific mechanisms establishing causal relation remain unknown. Saturated fatty acids are elevated in obesity, and known to induce chronic inflammation in kidneys. Myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) is an important protein in lipopolysaccharide-induced innate immunity response and inflammation. We suggested that obesity-associated renal injury is regulated by MD2 thereby driving an inflammatory renal injury. The used three mouse models for in vivo study: MD2 knockout mice (KO) maintained on high fat diet (HFD), wild-type mice on HFD plus L6H21, a specific MD2 inhibitor and KO mice given  (PA) by IV injection. The in vitro studies were carried out in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells, mouse mesangial cells and primary macrophages, respectively. The HFD mice presented with increased , serum creatinine and proteinuria. Renal tissue from HFD mice had increased fibrosis, inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. This HFD-induced renal injury profile was not observed in KO mice or L6H21-treated mice. Mice given PA mimmicked the HFD-induced renal injury profiles, which were prevented by MD2 knockout. The in vitro data further confirmed MD2 mediates PA-induced inflammation. MD2 is causally related with obesity-associated renal inflammatory injury. We believe that MD2 is an attractive target for future therapeutic strategies in obesity-associated kidney diseases.© 2017 The Authors.

Production and removal rates of VLDL triacylglycerol were measured in diabetic rabbits by injection of [3H]palmitate-labelled VLDL. Similarly, triacylglycerol total removal rates were determined in non-diabetic rabbits which were infused with Intralipid to mimic the plasma triacylglycerol concentrations of diabetic rabbits. Compared to nondiabetic rabbits, triacylglycerol removal rats were decreased in diabetic rabbits, particularly at higher levels of plasma triacylglycerol. During cholesterol and triacylglycerol supplementation of the diet, post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activity of diabetic rabbits with severe hypertriglyceridemia averaged 36% of that of nondiabetics, suggesting an impaired triacylglycerol removal capacity. Furthermore, plasma triacylglycerol was inversely related to post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activity among diabetic rabbits. VLDL triacylglycerol production increased with increasing plasma triacylglycerol concentration among diabetic cholesterol-fed rabbits with moderately severe hypertriglyceridemia, but reached an apparent plateau among rabbits with plasma triacylglycerol concentrations from approx. 2000-9000 mg/dl. Thus, severe hypertriglyceridemia in this model of insulin deficiency can be attributed only partially to VLDL hypersecretion, whereas a removal defect, resulting in saturation of the triacylglycerol removal mechanism, appears to be largely responsible. The impaired removal of plasma triacylglycerol is also related to the presence of cholesterol predominantly in lipoproteins of increased size.

Previously we have shown that acute treatment of pancreatic islets with fatty acids (FA) decreases acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion. This acetylcholine response is mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors, which play a key role in regulating β-cell function. Here we examine whether chronic FA exposure also inhibits acetylcholine-potentiated insulin secretion using mouse and human islets.Islets were cultured for 3 or 4 days at different glucose concentration with 0.5 mM  (PA) or a 2:1 mixture of PA and oleic  (OA) at 1% albumin (PA/BSA molar ratio 3.3). Afterwards, the response to glucose and acetylcholine were studied in perifusion experiments.FA-induced impairment of insulin secretion and Ca signaling depended strongly on the glucose concentrations of the culture medium. PA and OA in combination reduced acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion more than PA alone, both in mouse and human islets, with no evidence of a protective role of OA. In contrast, lipotoxicity was not observed with islets cultured for 3 days in medium containing less than 1 mM glucose and a mixture of glutamine and leucine (7 mM each). High glucose and FAs reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca storage capacity; however, preserving ER Ca by blocking the IP3 receptor with xestospongin C did not protect islets from glucolipotoxic effects on insulin secretion. In contrast, an inhibitor of casein kinase 2 (CK2) protected the glucose dependent acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion in mouse and human islets against glucolipotoxicity.These results show that chronic FA treatment decreases acetylcholine potentiation of insulin secretion and that this effect is strictly glucose dependent and might involve CK2 phosphorylation of β-cell M3 muscarinic receptors.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

We investigated the effect of ART on blood lipid concentrations in the fasting state and after consumption of a meal containing [1-13C] in HIV-positive men receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, n 7), NRTI combined with protease inhibitors (PI; NRTIPI, n 6), in HIV-positive but therapy-naïve men (noART, n 5) and in HIV-seronegative men (controls, n 6). HIV-positive subjects had higher fasting TAG concentrations and resting energy expenditure than controls. Subjects receiving NRTIPI therapy had higher fasting NEFA concentrations than the other groups. There were no significant differences in postprandial lipid metabolism between noART subjects and controls. NRTI therapy impaired hydrolysis of meal-derived TAG, most evidently when combined with PI (the NRTIPI group). Accumulation of 13C-label in the NEFA fraction was not different between groups. In the NRTIPI group, fasting and postprandial NEFA concentrations were significantly higher than other groups. Postprandial glucose and insulin responses in HIV-positive subjects did not differ from controls. These findings suggest that ART dyslipidaemia is associated with impaired postprandial TAG clearance, which is exacerbated by NRTIPI therapy. If dyslipidaemia is to be minimised in ART, the specific adverse effects of particular combinations during the fed state should be considered.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1387324>Gestational  in the rat is characterized by accumulation of n - 6 and n - 3 fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic .</a></h2><p>We have evaluated the relative and quantitative changes in long-chain fatty acids in maternal liver, serum, carcass and conceptus (fetuses plus placentae) during pregnancy in the rat, to ascertain whether previous concern over lower proportions of n - 6 and n - 3 fatty acids in maternal serum could be indicative of suboptimal n - 6 or n - 3 fatty  status. Gestational  was characterized by proportional decreases in linoleic, stearic and arachidonic acids but increases in  and docosahexaenoic acids. However, the quantitative amount (microgram/ml) of linoleic, arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids in serum lipids actually increased 2-5-fold from mid-pregnancy to term. Compared to non-pregnant rats, gestational  was also associated with a lower proportion but similar quantity of linoleic  in maternal carcass and adipose stores. We conclude that gestational  in the rat is characterized by a relative but not quantitative decrease in whole-body stores of n - 6 fatty acids and a marked proportional and quantitative increase in docosahexaenoic  in maternal organs and in the conceptus.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7332611>Fatty  and lipid composition of the monkey retina in diet-induced hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>We determined the fatty  composition of the lipids of cynomolgus monkey retina in animals fed commercial chow or a saturated fat, cholesterol-enriched atherogenic diet for 100 days. Doxosahexaenoic  (22 : 6) accounted for 25.8% of the ethanolamine phosphoglyceride fatty acids, 17.6% of the serine plus inositol phosphoglyceride fatty acids, 8.4% of the choline phosphoglyceride fatty acids and 5.8% of the neutral lipid fatty acids in the retinas of the chow-fed animals. Therefore, monkey retinas, like those of other mammalian species, ordinarily contain large amounts of 22 : 6. Retinas from the monkeys fed the atherogenic diet contained less 22 : 6 as well as other polyunsaturates in each of the phospholipid classes. The decrease in polyunsaturates was compensated for by increases in , stearic, and oleic acids. There was no difference in the amount of phospholipid, the distribution of phospholipid classes, or the amount of cholesterol in the retinas of the monkeys fed the atherogenic diet. These results indicate that the single type of lipid alteration produced in the retina by a diet enriched in saturated fat and cholesterol is a decrease in the polyunsaturation of the retinal phospholipids. The reduction in retinal 22 : 6 content might have significance for photoreceptor function.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253137>Acclimation of CC myoblasts to physiological glucose concentrations for in vitro diabetes research.</a></h2><p>The interplay between hyper-glycemia and -lipidemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) is important in simulating diabetic conditions. However, cell culture media typically contain supraphysiological levels of glucose to stimulate cellular growth, which also desensitizes cells to elevated glucose levels. Moreover, creating hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro requires specialized carriers because unbound lipids form micelles when introduced to liquid media. This study sought to develop a novel method for simulating DM conditions in vitro.We acclimated the CC mouse myoblasts to culture medium with 5.6 mM glucose, which mimics physiological levels, and created a bovine serum albumin- conjugate for lipid transport to explore the effects of . We simulated diabetic conditions in vitro by using both hyper-glycemic and -lipidemic conditions and compared the results to that of only hyperglycemic or hyperlipidemic conditions.Acclimated cells exposed to these hyper-glycemic (15 mM glucose) and/or -lipidemic (0.25 mM palmitate) conditions for 2 h showed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and membrane potential as well as elevated reactive oxygen species production compared to control cells. These findings suggest altered mitochondrial morphology and function, which have been confirmed using isolated rat flexor digitorum brevis myofibers. Hyper-glycemic and/or -lipidemic stimulations for 24 h significantly increased mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK 1/2 protein expression, upregulated the early pro-apoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and induced apoptosis.Our results further support and confirm the utility of this method which will allow for subsequent investigations studying the effects of hyper-glycemia and/or -lipidemia in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the content of platelet glycoprotein IIb was determined by radioimmunoassay. Fibrinogen was bound in significantly higher amounts (P < 0.02) to hyperlipidaemic platelets activated by ADP than to control ones (107,112 +/- 16,371 and 45,612 +/- 6495 molecules per platelet, respectively). The mean content of GPIIb was the same in hyperlipidaemic and in control platelets (2.06 +/- 0.16 and 1.94 +/- 0.21 micrograms/10(8) platelets, respectively). The amount of fibrinogen bound to the activated hyperlipidaemic platelets showed a positive correlation with total plasma cholesterol and LDL (r = 0.45 and 0.47, respectively) whereas a negative correlation with plasma HDL was found (r = -0.50). The increased expression of fibrinogen binding sites similar to that of hyperlipidaemic platelets could be produced by preincubation of normal platelets with . This was evidenced by a significant increase of fibrinogen binding sites in control platelets. This suggests that either palmitoylation of the receptor or microenvironment changes in the membrane lipid bilayer may be responsible for the enhanced platelet receptor capacity to bind fibrinogen.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29794461>The CCL5/CCR5 Axis Promotes Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation and Atherogenic Phenotype Switching.</a></h2><p> induces dysfunction in the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the blood vessels, and the vascular remodeling that ensues is a key proatherogenic factor contributing to cardiovascular events. Chemokines and chemokine receptors play crucial roles in vascular remodeling. Here, we examined whether the -derived chemokine CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 influence vascular SMC proliferation, phenotypic switching, and explored the underlying mechanisms.Thoracoabdominal aorta were isolated from wild-type, CCL5 and CCR5 double-knockout mice (CCL5-/-CCR5-/-) fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Expression of the contractile, synthetic, and proliferation markers were assayed using immunohistochemical and western blotting. The effects of CCL5 and  on cultured SMC proliferation and phenotypic modulation were evaluated using flow cytometry, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), and western blotting.Wild-type mice fed an HFD showed markedly increased total cholesterol, triglyceride, and CCL5 serum levels, as well as significantly increased CCL5 and CCR5 expression in the thoracoabdominal aorta vs. normal-diet-fed controls. HFD-fed CCL5-/-CCR5-/- mice showed significantly decreased expression of the synthetic phenotype marker osteopontin and the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and increased expression of the contractile phenotype marker smooth muscle α-actin in the thoracoabdominal aorta vs. wild-type HFD-fed mice. Human aorta-derived SMCs stimulated with  showed significantly increased expression of CCL5, CCR5, and synthetic phenotype markers, as well as increased proliferation. CCL5-treated SMCs showed increased cell cycle regulatory protein expression, paralleling increased synthetic and decreased contractile phenotype marker expression. Inhibition of CCR5 activity by the specific antagonist maraviroc or its expression using small interfering RNA significantly inhibited human aortic SMC proliferation and synthetic phenotype formation. Therefore, CCL5 induces SMC proliferation and phenotypic switching from a contractile to synthetic phenotype via CCR5. CCL5-mediated SMC stimulation activated ERK1/2, Akt/p70S6K, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB signaling. NF-κB inhibition significantly reduced CCR5 expression along with CCR5-induced SMC proliferation and synthetic phenotype formation.-induced CCL5/CCR5 axis activation serves as a pivotal mediator of vascular remodeling, indicating that CCL5 and CCR5 are key chemokine-related factors in atherogenesis. SMC proliferation and synthetic phenotype transformation attenuation by CCR5 pharmacological inhibition may offer a new approach to treatment or prevention of atherosclerotic diseases associated with .© 2018 The Author(s).

The animals intoxicated with acetaminophen showed significant elevation in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and free fatty  in both serum and liver tissue. The levels of tissue total lipids and serum LDL-cholesterol were also elevated with depleted levels of serum HDL-cholesterol and tissue phospholipid. The acetaminophen-induced animals showed significant alterations in the activities of lipid metabolizing enzymes serum lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL). The levels of liver tissue fatty acids (saturated, mono and polyunsaturated) such as , stearic , oleic , linoleic , arachidonic  and linolenic  monitored by gas chromatography were considerably altered in acetaminophen intoxicated animals when compared with control animals. The prior oral administration of Sargassum polycystum (200 mg/kg body wt./day for a period of 15 days) crude extract showed considerable prevention in the severe disturbances of lipid profile and metabolizing enzymes triggered by acetaminophen during hepatic injury. Liver histology also showed convincing supportive evidence regarding their protective nature against fatty changes induced during acetaminophen intoxication. Thus the present study indicates that the protective nature of Sargassum polycystum extract may be due to the presence of active compounds possessing antilipemic property against acetaminophen challenge.(Mol Cell Biochem 276: 89-96, 2005).</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16756155>[Fibrate-induced changes in the serum lipid contents of individual C16 and C18 fatty acids in patients with ].</a></h2><p></p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355732>-Enriched Diet Induces Hepatic Steatosis and Injury in Adult Zebrafish.</a></h2><p> (PA) is the most abundant saturated fatty  in fast foods and is known to induce inflammation and cellular injury in various tissues. In this study, we investigated whether a PA-enriched diet can induce hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish. The adult zebrafish exhibited increased body weight, , hyperglycemia, and steatosis and a hepatic injury phenotype after being fed with a PA-enriched diet for 6 weeks. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that genes associated with hepatic injury were all significantly increased in the liver. Furthermore, livers from the PA-fed group showed an increased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression associated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. We also found significant upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and triacylglyceride accumulation. Ultrastructural analysis revealed mitochondrial cristae injury and a dilated ER phenotype in the PA-fed hepatocytes, which can be causes of hepatic injury. PA-enriched diet induced hepatic steatosis and injury in adult zebrafish that recapitulated typical metabolic changes and pathophysiological changes as well as increased oxidative stress and ER stress observed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10423617>Effect of probucol therapy on plasma fatty  composition during postprandial lipemia in hypertriglyceridemia.</a></h2><p>To determine the effect of probucol (PR) on fatty  composition of plasma lipids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia during the fasting and postprandial states.Open-label, single-center, 6-week treatment, baseline-controlled trial.Outpatient clinical research center.Six patients with established hypertriglyceridemia and no complicating medical conditions.Step 1 American Heart Association diet and no lipid-lowering medications for at least 4 weeks.

After 6 weeks of treatment with 500-mg of PR twice daily and diet, the meal tests were repeated.The clinical status, 3-day food records, postprandial blood samplings (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours) for lipid and fatty acids in whole plasma, triglyceride (TG), phospholipid (PL), and cholesteryl ester (CE) fractions.PR had the following effects: (1) In plasma, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) A1, and ApoB were decreased postprandially. ApoC111 ratio (heparin-treated plasma versus precipitate) was decreased in the fasting state. (2) The saturated/unsaturated (S/U) fatty  ratios in the PL, TG, and CE fractions were elevated postprandially and increased in CE in the fasting state. In the PL fraction it was due to an increase in the percentage of myristic, , stearic, and oleic acids and a decrease in linolenic, eicosatrienoic, and arachidonic acids. In the TG and CE fractions the changes were not due to any particular patterns of fatty acids. The ratio of arachidonic/eicosatrienoic  was decreased postprandially in PL and CE fractions. The ratio of eicosatrienoic/linoleic  was decreased in PL and increased in CE fractions. (3) The S/U ratio in the lipoprotein (Lp) B and LP(a) lipid components decreased in PL and CE. Lp(a) was more saturated with respect to fatty acids than LpB.PR treatment for 6 weeks increased postprandial S/U fatty  ratios. This was due to a combination of an increase in saturated and monounsaturated levels and a decrease in polyunsaturated levels. The effect was most notable in the PL fraction. In those systems dependent on the pattern of fatty acids, the fatty  compositional change could modify biological responses in clinically important ways during lipid-lowering therapy. The change toward saturation of fatty acids in the postprandial state may contribute to the antioxidant properties of probucol.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8988911>Comparison of the effects of medium-chain triacylglycerols, palm oil, and high oleic  sunflower oil on plasma triacylglycerol fatty acids and lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in humans.</a></h2><p>Although medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs, composed of medium-chain fatty acids 8:0 and 10:0) have long been described as having neutral effects on serum cholesterol concentrations, experimental evidence supporting this claim is limited. In a randomized, crossover, metabolic-ward study, we compared the lipid effects of a natural food diet supplemented with either MCTs, palm oil, or high oleic  sunflower oil in nine middle-aged men with mild hypercholesterolemia. Rather than having a neutral effect, MCT oil produced total cholesterol concentrations that were not significantly different from those produced by palm oil (MCT oil: 5.87 +/- 0.75 mmol/L; palm oil: 5.79 +/- 0.72 mmol/L) but significantly higher than that produced by high oleic  sunflower oil (5.22 +/- 0.52 mmol/L). Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations paralleled those of total cholesterol. MCT oil tended to result in higher triacylglycerol concentrations than either palm oil or high oleic  sunflower oil, but this difference was not significant. There were no differences in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The  and total saturated fatty  content of plasma triacylglycerols in the MCT-oil diet was not significantly different from that in the palm oil diet.

Overexpression of PGC-1alpha impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). However, it is not well known which metabolic events lead to upregulation of PGC-1alpha in the beta-cells under pathophysiological condition. In present study, we have investigated effects of chronic  and hyperglycemia on PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in isolated rat islets. Isolated rat islets are chronically incubated with 0, 0.2 and 0.4 mM oleic / (free fatty acids, FFA) or 5.5 and 25 mM glucose for 72 h. FFA dose-dependently increases PGC-1alpha mRNA expression level in isolated islets. FFA also increases PGC-1alpha expression in mouse beta-cell-derived beta TC3 cell line. In contrast, 25 mM glucose decreases expression level of PGC-1alpha. Inhibition of PGC-1alpha by siRNA improves FFA-induced impairment of GSIS in islets. These data suggest that  and hyperglycemia regulate PGC-1alpha expression in islets differently, and elevated PGC-1alpha by FFA plays an important role in chronic -induced beta-cell dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p></html>
