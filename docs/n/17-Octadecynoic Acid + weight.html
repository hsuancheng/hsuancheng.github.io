However, acetylcholine (10 microM) and A23187 (3 microM) each significantly increased the tissue level of cGMP in the absence but not in the presence of L-NOARG, suggesting that NO is released from the vascular endothelium in this blood vessel. Treatment with the potassium (K) channel inhibitors charybdotoxin (0.1 microM) plus apamin (0.1 microM), a toxin mixture previously shown to inhibit relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in this artery, had no effect on the A23187-induced relaxation but slightly inhibited the response to acetylcholine (Emax was reduced by 24%). When the action of EDHF was prevented by these K channel inhibitors, the remaining relaxation was abolished by either ODQ (1 microM) or L-NOARG (0.3 mM), indicating that NO, apart from EDHF, contributes to the endothelium-dependent relaxations. Furthermore, ODQ (10 microM) abolished the relaxation induced by the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. Thus, activation of soluble guanylate cyclase seems to be the only mechanism through which NO causes relaxation in this artery. When vessels were exposed to grave hypoxia (pO2 = 6 mm Hg), the NO-mediated relaxation (induced by acetylcholine in the presence of charybdotoxin plus apamin) disappeared. In contrast, EDHF-mediated responses (elicited by acetylcholine in the presence of L-NOARG) were only marginally affected by hypoxia (Emax was reduced by 16%).  (50 microM) and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (10 microM), inhibitors of cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation of arachidonic acid, failed to inhibit the acetylcholine-induced relaxation in the presence of L-NOARG. The cytochrome P450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolite 11,12-epoxyecosatrienoic acid (0.3-3.0 microM) had no relaxant effect per se. In conclusion, EDHF and NO are both mediators of endothelium-dependent relaxations in the guinea pig basilar artery. However, during grave hypoxia, EDHF alone mediates acetylcholine-induced relaxation. The results further suggest that EDHF is not a metabolite of arachidonic acid formed by cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase or generated by another oxygen-dependent enzyme in this artery.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10493105>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and renal function in Lyon hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolites of arachidonic acid in the increased renal vascular resistance and blunted pressure-natriuresis response exhibited by Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats, the effects of an intrarenal infusion of  (3 microM), an inhibitor of the formation of epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, were compared in 8-week-old LH and low blood pressure (LL) control rats.  failed to affect renal function in LL rats. In contrast, it reduced renal vascular resistance and shifted the pressure-natriuresis relationship to lower pressures in LH rats. Blockade of thromboxane-endoperoxide (TP) receptors with GR 32191B prevented the renal vasodilator response to  but not its natriuretic action. Miconazole (1 microM), an inhibitor of epoxygenase activity, had no effect on renal function in LH rats. These results indicate that CYP450 metabolites of arachidonic acid, likely 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, contribute to the resetting of the pressure-natriuresis relation in LH rats and that the renal vasoconstrictor effects of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in LH rats may be related to activation of TP receptors.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12388303>Oxidant stress-induced increase in myogenic activation of skeletal muscle resistance arteries in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>This study characterized myogenic activation of skeletal muscle (gracilis) resistance arteries from lean (LZR) and obese Zucker rats (OZR). Arteries from OZR exhibited increased myogenic activation versus LZR; this increase was impaired by endothelium denudation or nitric oxde synthase inhibition. Treatment of vessels with  impaired responses in both strains by comparable amounts. Dihydroethidine microfluorography indicated elevated vascular superoxide levels in OZR versus LZR; immunohistochemistry demonstrated elevated vascular nitrotyrosine levels in OZR, indicating increased peroxynitrite presence. Vessel treatment with oxidative radical scavengers (polythylene glycol-superoxide dismutase/catalase) or inhibition of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (K(Ca)) channels (iberiotoxin) did not alter myogenic activation in LZR but normalized activation in OZR. Application of peroxynitrite to vessels of OZR caused a greater vasoconstriction versus LZR; the response was impaired in OZR by elevated intraluminal pressure and was abolished in both strains by iberiotoxin. These results suggest that enhanced myogenic activation of gracilis arteries of OZR versus LZR 1) is not due to alterations in cytochrome P-450 contribution, and 2) may be due to elevated peroxynitrite levels inhibiting K(Ca) channels following increased intraluminal pressure.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p></html>
