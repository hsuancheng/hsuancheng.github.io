We therefore compared sympathetic nervous system activity at rest and during an oral glucose tolerance test in obese  (MetS) subjects classified as glucose intolerant (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]; n = 17) or treatment-naive T2D (n = 17). Untreated subjects, matched for age (mean 59 ± 1 year), sex, BMI (32.4 ± 0.6 kg/m(2)), and family history of diabetes were studied. We measured resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) by microneurography, whole-body norepinephrine kinetics by isotope dilution, insulin sensitivity by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (steady-state glucose utilization adjusted for fat-free mass and steady-state insulin concentration [M/I]), and MetS components. T2D subjects had higher resting MSNA burst incidence (67 ± 4 versus 55 ± 3 bursts per 100 heartbeats; P = 0.05) and arterial norepinephrine levels (264 ± 33 versus 167 ± 16 pg/mL; P = 0.02), lower plasma norepinephrine clearance (by 17%; P = 0.03), and reduced neuronal reuptake compared with IGT subjects (by 46%; P = 0.04). Moreover, norepinephrine spillover responses to glucose ingestion were blunted in T2D subjects. The M/I value independently predicted whole-body norepinephrine spillover (r = -0.47; P = 0.008), whereas fasting insulin level related to neuronal norepinephrine reuptake (r = -0.35, P = 0.047). These findings demonstrate that progression to T2D is associated with increased central sympathetic drive, blunted sympathetic responsiveness, and altered norepinephrine disposition.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29846720>Neuroendocrine Regulation of Air Pollution Health Effects: Emerging Insights.</a></h2><p>Air pollutant exposures are linked to cardiopulmonary diseases, diabetes, , neurobehavioral conditions, and reproductive abnormalities. Significant effort is invested in understanding how pollutants encountered by the lung might induce effects in distant organs. The role of circulating mediators has been predicted; however, their origin and identity have not been confirmed. New evidence has emerged which implicates the role of neuroendocrine sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axes in mediating a wide array of systemic and pulmonary effects. Our recent studies using ozone exposure as a prototypical air pollutant demonstrate that increases in circulating adrenal-derived stress hormones (epinephrine and cortisol/corticosterone) contribute to lung injury/inflammation and  effects in the liver, pancreas, adipose, and muscle tissues. When stress hormones are depleted by adrenalectomy in rats, most ozone effects including lung injury/inflammation are diminished. Animals treated with antagonists for adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptors show inhibition of the pulmonary and systemic effects of ozone, whereas treatment with agonists restore and exacerbate the ozone-induced injury/inflammation phenotype, implying the role of neuroendocrine activation. The neuroendocrine system is critical for normal homeostasis and allostatic activation; however, chronic exposure to stressors may lead to increases in allostatic load. The emerging mechanisms by which circulating mediators are released and are responsible for producing multiorgan effects of air pollutants insists upon a paradigm shift in the field of air pollution and health. Moreover, since these neuroendocrine responses are linked to both chemical and nonchemical stressors, the interactive influence of air pollutants, lifestyle, and environmental factors requires further study.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590214>Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with insulin clearance in obese individuals with .</a></h2><p>Impaired insulin clearance contributes to the hyperinsulinemia of obesity, yet relatively little is known concerning the pathophysiological determinants of insulin clearance in obese populations.To examine the cross-sectional relationship between insulin clearance and resting sympathetic nervous system activity in a cohort of obese subjects with .Unmedicated, nonsmoking subjects (31 male, 27 female; aged 56 ± 1 year; body mass index 33.7 ± 0.6 kg/m(2)) underwent euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine insulin sensitivity (M) and insulin clearance, assessment of norepinephrine kinetics, peripheral arterial tonometry, Doppler echocardiography, and oral glucose tolerance test.Univariate correlation analyses showed inverse associations between insulin clearance and arterial norepinephrine concentration (r = -0.44, P = .0006), calculated norepinephrine spillover rate (r = -0.33, P = .01), augmentation index (AI, r = -0.37, P = .005), and positive associations with M (r = 0.30, P = .02), Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (r = 0.27, P = .04), and cardiac output (r = 0.27, P = .04). Insulin clearance and sensitivity did not differ between genders, however females had higher AI compared to males (35 ± 3% versus 14 ± 2%, P < .001). In age and gender adjusted stepwise regression analyses, arterial norepinephrine concentration alone explained 19% of the variance in insulin clearance. When all significant variables were entered into the regression model, arterial norepinephrine, AI, gender, and M were independent predictors of insulin clearance, together explaining 41% of the variance.Arterial norepinephrine concentration is inversely and independently associated with whole-body insulin clearance rate in obese individuals with .

Accordingly, this study evaluated the renal effects of nebivolol, a third-generation β-blocker with additional vasodilating activity, versus those of atenolol in an animal model of diabetic nephropathy.Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and control lean Zucker rats (LZRs) were treated for 6 months with either nebivolol or atenolol. Blood pressure, circulating insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose, as well as proteinuria and creatinine clearance were evaluated. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive species, reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, CuZn superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were determined as biomarkers of oxidative stress in kidney homogenates. Expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen type I and III, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), vascular and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1 and PECAM-1, respectively) were determined by immunohistochemistry. Fibrosis was evaluated by light microscopy.Both drugs induced a similar control of blood pressure throughout the study. Contrary to atenolol, nebivolol showed a beneficial impact on lipid profile, preserved glomerular filtration rate, reduced proteinuria and induced a positive regulation of structural podocyte proteins (nephrin and podocin) expression. Additionally nebivolol decreased oxidative stress biomarkers, induced a substantial reduction in the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, down-regulated the renal expression of VCAM-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), ED1, α-SMA, TGF-β1 and PAI-1 and up-regulated the expression of PECAM-1.Our current finding underscores the importance of this therapy in hypertensive states concomitant with altered lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256679>Improved glucose homeostasis in male obese Zucker rats coincides with enhanced baroreflexes and activation of the nucleus tractus solitarius.</a></h2><p>Young adult male obese Zucker rats (OZR) develop insulin resistance and hypertension with impaired baroreflex-mediated bradycardia and activation of nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Because type 1 diabetic rats also develop impaired baroreflex-mediated NTS activation, we hypothesized that improving glycemic control in OZR would enhance compromised baroreflexes and NTS activation. Fasting blood glucose measured by telemetry was comparable in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) at 12-17 wk. However, with access to food, OZR were chronically hyperglycemic throughout this age range. By 15-17 wk of age, tail samples yielded higher glucose values than those measured by telemetry in OZR but not LZR, consistent with reports of exaggerated stress responses in OZR. Injection of glucose (1g/kg ip) produced larger rises in glucose and areas under the curve in OZR than LZR. Treatment with metformin (300 mg·kg·day) or pioglitazone (5 mg·kg·day) in drinking water for 2-3 wk normalized fed glucose levels in OZR with no effect in LZR. After metformin treatment, area under the curve for blood glucose after glucose injection was reduced in OZR and comparable to LZR. Hyperinsulinemia was slightly reduced by each treatment in OZR, but insulin was still greatly elevated compared with LZR. Neither treatment reduced hypertension in OZR, but both treatments significantly improved the blunted phenylephrine-induced bradycardia and NTS c-Fos expression in OZR with no effect in LZR. These data suggest that restoring glycemic control in OZR enhances baroreflex control of heart rate by improving the response of the NTS to raising arterial pressure, even in the presence of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20208379>Adrenaline-induced lipolysis in isolated rat mesenteric adipocytes is higher in the large intestine than in the small intestine.</a></h2><p>We determined adrenaline-induced lipolysis in mesenteric adipocytes separated from the small and large intestinal parts, because there are large differences in absorbed nutrients and substances between these two intestinal segments.

They exhibit associated micro- and macrovascular disease and end-stage ischemic myocardial lesions and are highly stress sensitive. We subjected male cp/cp rats to pair feeding (providing the rats each day with the amount of food eaten by matched freely fed animals), a procedure that alters the diurnal feeding pattern, leading to a state of intermittent caloric restriction. Effects on insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism, response to restraint stress, aortic contractile/relaxant response, and myocardial lesion frequency were investigated. Pair-fed young (12-wk-old) cp/cp rats had lower insulin and glucose levels (basal and following restraint), consistent with increased insulin sensitivity, but a greater increase in plasma nonesterified fatty acids in response to restraint. These effects were unrelated to lipolytic rates in adipose tissue but may be related to reduced fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Older (24-wk-old) pair-fed cp/cp rats had significantly reduced plasma triglyceride levels, improved micro- and macrovascular function, and reduced severity of ischemic myocardial lesions. These changes indicate a significant amelioration of end-stage disease processes in this animal model and the complexity of /physiological responses in studies involving alterations in food intake. The effects illustrate the sensitivity of the JCR:LA-cp rat, an animal model for the  and associated cardiovascular disease, to the environmental and experimental milieu.

At rest, compared to CONT, despite similar physical activity, DS with chronotropic incompetence had significantly higher subcutaneous fat mass (p<0.001), lower epinephrine concentration (p<0.01), and higher leptin (p<0.01) and insulin concentrations (p<0.05). At peak exercise, all DS had lower heart rate, oxygen uptake and blood lactate concentrations than controls (p<0.001). During a 'Submaximal incremental test', DS with chronotropic incompetence had lower HR and lactate values (p<0.001) compared to CONT and DS without chronotropic incompetence (p<0.01).

NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide  (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo.

Consecutive patients received an intramuscular injection of octreotide-LAR, 50 g of albumin three times per week and midodrine titrated to increase the systolic blood pressure for 1 month.Ten patients with RA were enrolled and eight with complete data to 1 month post-treatment were included in the analysis. There was no change in renal function but there was a trend towards a reduction in the volume of ascites removed by paracentesis (P=0.08) and a significant reduction in the plasma renin (P=0.01) and aldosterone concentrations (P=0.01). Interestingly, there was a transient worsening in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (P=0.01).

Here we performed lipidomic analyses of adipose tissue in twin pairs discordant for obesity but still metabolically compensated. In parallel we studied more evolved states of obesity by investigating a separated set of individuals considered to be morbidly obese. Despite lower dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, the obese twin individuals had increased proportions of palmitoleic and arachidonic acids in their adipose tissue, including increased levels of  plasmalogens containing arachidonic acid. Information gathered from these experimental groups was used for molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers combined with dependency network analysis of combined clinical, lipidomics, and gene expression data. The simulations suggested that the observed lipid remodeling maintains the biophysical properties of lipid membranes, at the price, however, of increasing their vulnerability to inflammation. Conversely, in morbidly obese subjects, the proportion of plasmalogens containing arachidonic acid in the adipose tissue was markedly decreased. We also show by in vitro Elovl6 knockdown that the lipid network regulating the observed remodeling may be amenable to genetic modulation. Together, our novel approach suggests a physiological mechanism by which adaptation of adipocyte membranes to adipose tissue expansion associates with positive energy balance, potentially leading to higher vulnerability to inflammation in acquired obesity. Further studies will be needed to determine the cause of this effect.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26554714>Plasma levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide are confounded by impaired kidney function and poor  control.</a></h2><p>After ingestion of phosphatidylcholine, l-carnitine or betaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is formed by gut microbiota and liver enzymes.

However, dysfunctions of, for example, the glucose-insulin axis are not readily detectable by conventional tests early in life, making it difficult to identify individuals at risk. Thus, other methods are required. We hypothesised that prenatally undernourished individuals (but not postnatally overnourished ones) are adapted to a life with limited food availability, which would be evident under conditions reflecting starvation, stress and short-term abundance of food. In this study, twin-pregnant sheep were fed diets meeting 100% (NORM) or 50% (LOW) of energy and protein requirements during the last trimester. Twin offspring were fed either a normal moderate (CONV) diet or a high-carbohydrate-high-fat (HCHF) diet from 3 days to 6 months of age (approximately puberty) and the same moderate diet thereafter until 2 years of age (young adulthood; only females), resulting in four groups: NORM-CONV, LOW-CONV, NORM-HCHF and LOW-HCHF. At the age of 6 months and 2 years respectively, they were subjected to fasting and propionate (nutrient abundance) and adrenalin challenges. At 6 months of age, postnatal HCHF diet exposure caused  alterations, reflecting hypertriglyceridaemia and altered pancreatic β-cell secretion. Irrespective of postnatal diet, prenatal undernutrition was found to be associated with unexpected endocrine responses of leptin, IGF1 and cortisol during fasting (lack of or the opposite response compared with the controls) in 2-year-old adults. In conclusion, a HCHF diet interfered with β-cell function, whereas maternal undernutrition did not lead to any changes in the LOW offspring, except to abnormal hormone responses, suggesting that fetal programming interferes with hypothalamic integration of important endocrine axis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28430139>The Metalloproteinase ADAM28 Promotes  Dysfunction in Mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity and diabetes are major causes of morbidity and mortality globally.

Choline and its derivatives serve as components of structural lipoproteins, blood and membrane lipids, and as a precursor of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Pre-and postnatal choline availability is important for neurodevelopment in rodents. Choline is oxidized to betaine that serves as an osmoregulator and is a substrate in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase reaction, which links choline and betaine to the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism. Choline and betaine are important sources of one-carbon units, in particular, during folate deficiency. Choline or betaine supplementation in humans reduces concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy), and plasma betaine is a strong predictor of plasma tHcy in individuals with low plasma concentration of folate and other B vitamins (B₂, B₆, and B₁₂) in combination TT genotype of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C->T polymorphism. The link to one-carbon metabolism and the recent availability of food composition data have motivated studies on choline and betaine as risk factors of chronic diseases previously studied in relation to folate and homocysteine status. High intake and plasma level of choline in the mother seems to afford reduced risk of neural tube defects. Intake of choline and betaine shows no consistent relation to cancer or cardiovascular risk or risk factors, whereas an unfavorable cardiovascular risk factor profile was associated with high choline and low betaine concentrations in plasma.

Telmisartan (5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) or pioglitazone (2.5 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) was orally administered to male SHRSP-fatty rats for 8 weeks. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were determined, and the oral glucose tolerance test was performed to evaluate insulin resistance.

CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2) catalyzes the formation of CDP-, which is often the rate regulatory step in the PE-Kennedy pathway. In the current investigation, we show that the reduced CDP- formation in Pcyt2(+/-) mice limits the rate of PE synthesis and increases the availability of diacylglycerol. This results in the increased formation of triglycerides, which is facilitated by stimulated de novo fatty acid synthesis and increased uptake of pre-existing fatty acids.

Both the spontaneous and NA-induced release of IL-1β and IL-6 were higher in sedentary obese (ObSZ) rats than in healthy LZ rats (a significant lower spontaneous production of TNFα was also found in the ObSZ rats). While the NA-induced release of IL-1β was higher in the exercised obese (ObTZ) rats, the NA-induced production of IL-6 was lower compared with ObSZ rats. In addition, NA has an inhibitory role on the release of IL-1β and TNFα (with respect to the spontaneous release) in both lean and obese (sedentary and exercised) rats. However, NA inhibits the IL-6 production by macrophages from lean and exercised obese animals, but promotes IL-6 release in the sedentary obese rats.

Repeated blood analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry confirmed high concentrations of both tramadol and its main metabolite O-desmethyltramadol.

HF mothers presented increased total body fat content after 8 weeks (+27%, P < 0.05) and a similar fat content at the end of lactation. In consequence, the breast milk from the HF group had higher concentration of protein (+18%, P < 0.05), cholesterol (+52%, P < 0.05) and triglycerides (+86%, P < 0.05). At weaning, HF offspring had increased body weight (+53%, P < 0.05) and adiposity (2 fold, P < 0.05), which was associated with lower β3-adrenoreceptor content in adipose tissue (-40%, P < 0.05). The offspring also presented hyperglycaemia (+30%, P < 0.05) and hyperleptinaemia (+62%, P < 0.05). In the leptin signalling pathway in the hypothalamus, we found lower p-STAT3/STAT3 (-40%, P < 0.05) and SOCS3 (-55%, P < 0.05) content in the arcuate nucleus, suggesting leptin resistance. HF offspring also had higher adrenal catecholamine content (+17%, P < 0.05), liver glycogen content (+50%, P < 0.05) and hyperactivity of the thyroid axis at weaning. Our results suggest that a high fat diet increases maternal body fat and this additional energy is transferred to the offspring during lactation, since at weaning the dams had normal fat and the pups were obese. The higher fat and protein concentrations in the breast milk seemed to induce early overnutrition in the HF offspring. In addition to storing energy as fat, the HF offspring had a larger reserve of glycogen and hyperglycaemia that may have resulted from increased gluconeogenesis. Hyperleptinaemia may stimulate both adrenal medullary and thyroid function, which may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases. These early changes induced by the maternal high-fat diet may contribute to development of .</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22134222>Choline metabolism provides novel insights into nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its progression.</a></h2><p>Choline is an essential nutrient and the liver is a central organ responsible for choline metabolism. Hepatosteatosis and liver cell death occur when humans are deprived of choline. In the last few years, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that influence choline requirements in humans and in our understanding of choline's effects on liver function. These advances are useful in elucidating why nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs and progresses sometimes to hepatocarcinogenesis.Humans eating low-choline diets develop fatty liver and liver damage. This dietary requirement for choline is modulated by estrogen and by single-nucleotide polymorphisms in specific genes of choline and folate metabolism. The spectrum of choline's effects on liver range from steatosis to development of hepatocarcinomas, and several mechanisms for these effects have been identified. They include abnormal phospholipid synthesis, defects in lipoprotein secretion, oxidative damage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, the hepatic steatosis phenotype can be characterized more fully via metabolomic signatures and is influenced by the gut microbiome. Importantly, the intricate connection between liver function, one-carbon metabolism, and energy metabolism is just beginning to be elucidated.Choline influences liver function, and the dietary requirement for this nutrient varies depending on an individual's genotype and estrogen status. Understanding these individual differences is important for gastroenterologists seeking to understand why some individuals develop NAFLD and others do not, and why some patients tolerate total parenteral nutrition and others develop liver dysfunction.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124970>Epinephrine and the .</a></h2><p>Epinephrine is the prototypical stress hormone. Its stimulation of all α and β adrenergic receptors elicits short-term systolic hypertension, hyperglycemia, and other aspects of the . Acute epinephrine infusion increases cardiac output and induces insulin resistance, but removal of the adrenal medulla has no consistent effect on blood pressure. Epinephrine is the most effective endogenous agonist at the β2 receptor. Transgenic mice that cannot make epinephrine and mice that lack the β2 receptor become hypertensive during exercise, presumably owing to the absence of β2-mediated vasodilatation. Epinephrine-deficient mice also have cardiac remodeling and poor cardiac responses to stress, but do not develop resting hypertension. Mice that cannot make epinephrine have a normal metabolism on a regular 14% fat diet but become hyperglycemic and insulin resistant when they eat a high fat diet. Vigorous exercise prevents diabetes in young mice and humans that overeat. However, exercise is a less effective treatment in older type 2 human diabetics and had no effect on glucose or insulin responses in older, diabetic mice. Sensitivity of the β2 receptor falls sharply with advancing age, and adrenal epinephrine release also decreases. However, treatment of older diabetic mice with a β2 adrenergic agonist improved insulin sensitivity, indicating that β2 subsensitivity can be overcome pharmacologically. Recent studies show that over the long term, epinephrine prevents hypertension during stress and improves glucose tolerance. The hyperglycemic influence of epinephrine is short-lived. Chronic administration of epinephrine and other β2 agonists improves cellular glucose uptake and metabolism.

Rats receiving an acute isoproterenol (ISO) overdose (OV) suffer cardiac apex ischemia-reperfusion damage and arrhythmia, and then undergo cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Nevertheless, the subcellular mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction after acute damage subsides are not thoroughly understood. To address this question, Wistar rats received a single ISO injection (67 mg/kg). We found in vivo moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction at 2 wk post-ISO-OV; however, systolic dysfunction recovered after 4 wk, while diastolic dysfunction worsened. At 2 wk post-ISO-OV, cardiac function was assessed ex vivo, while mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and stress were assessed in vitro, and Ca(2+) handling in ventricular myocytes. These were complemented with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban (PLB), and RyR2 expression studies. Ex vivo, basal mechanical performance index (MPI) and oxygen consumption rate (MVO2) were unchanged. Nevertheless, upon increase of  demand, by β-adrenergic stimulation (1-100 nM ISO), the MPI versus MVO2 relation decreased and shifted to the right, suggesting MPI and mitochondrial energy production uncoupling. Mitochondria showed decreased oxidative metabolism, membrane fragility, and enhanced oxidative stress. Myocytes presented systolic and diastolic Ca(2+) mishandling, and blunted response to ISO (100 nM), and all these without apparent changes in SERCA, PLB, or RyR2 expression. We suggest that post-ISO-OV mitochondrial dysfunction may underlie decreased cardiac contractility, mainly by depletion of ATP needed for myofilaments and Ca(2+) transport by SERCA, while exacerbated oxidative stress may enhance diastolic RyR2 activity.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23459139>Tysnd1 deficiency in mice interferes with the peroxisomal localization of PTS2 enzymes, causing lipid  abnormalities and male infertility.</a></h2><p>Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles involved in lipid  processes, including those of very-long-chain fatty acids and branched-chain fatty acids, among others. Peroxisome matrix proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm. Targeting signals (PTS or peroxisomal targeting signal) at the C-terminus (PTS1) or N-terminus (PTS2) of peroxisomal matrix proteins mediate their import into the organelle. In the case of PTS2-containing proteins, the PTS2 signal is cleaved from the protein when transported into peroxisomes. The functional mechanism of PTS2 processing, however, is poorly understood. Previously we identified Tysnd1 (Trypsin domain containing 1) and biochemically characterized it as a peroxisomal cysteine endopeptidase that directly processes PTS2-containing prethiolase Acaa1 and PTS1-containing Acox1, Hsd17b4, and ScpX. The latter three enzymes are crucial components of the very-long-chain fatty acids β-oxidation pathway. To clarify the in vivo functions and physiological role of Tysnd1, we analyzed the phenotype of Tysnd1(-/-) mice. Male Tysnd1(-/-) mice are infertile, and the epididymal sperms lack the acrosomal cap. These phenotypic features are most likely the result of changes in the molecular species composition of choline and  plasmalogens. Tysnd1(-/-) mice also developed liver dysfunctions when the phytanic acid precursor phytol was orally administered.

To see whether there is a relationship between the previously described changes in follicular development and  changes similar to those in women with polycystic ovary, we have studied the effect of chronic cold stress (4 degrees C for 3 h/day, Monday to Friday, for 4 wk) on insulin sensitivity and the effect of insulin on sympathetic ovarian activity. Although cold-stressed rats ate more than the controls, they did not gain more weight. Insulin sensitivity, determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, was significantly increased in the stressed animals. Insulin in vitro increased the basal release of norepinephrine from the ovaries of control rats but not from those of stressed rats, suggesting a local neural resistance to insulin in stressed rats. The levels of mRNA and protein for IRS1 and SLC2A4 (also known as GLUT4), molecules involved in insulin signaling, decreased significantly in the ovaries but not in the muscle of stressed rats. This decrease was preferentially located in theca-interstitial cells compared with granulosa cells, indicating that theca cells (the only cells directly innervated by sympathetic nerves) are responsible for the ovarian insulin resistance found in stressed rats.

Neonatal rats exposed to sympathetic stress during gestation had a lower number of primary, primordial, and secondary follicles in the ovary and a lower recruitment of primary and secondary follicles derived from the primordial follicular pool. The expression of the FSH receptor and response of the neonatal ovary to FSH were reduced. A decrease in nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA was found without change in the low-affinity NGF receptor. The FSH-induced development of secondary follicles was decreased. At puberty, estradiol plasma levels decreased without changes in LH plasma levels. Puberty onset (as shown by the vaginal opening) was delayed. Ovarian norepinephrine (NE) was reduced; there was no change in its metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, in stressed rats and no change in NE turnover. The changes in ovarian NE in prepubertal rats stressed during gestation could represent a lower development of sympathetic nerves as a compensatory response to the chronically increased NE levels during gestation and hence participate in delaying reproductive performance in the rat.© 2014 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110484>Upregulated expression of brain enzymatic markers of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid metabolism in a rat model of the .</a></h2><p>In animal models, the  elicits a cerebral response characterized by altered phospholipid and unesterified fatty acid concentrations and increases in pro-apoptotic inflammatory mediators that may cause synaptic loss and cognitive impairment.

Recently, an inducible tafazzin shRNA knockdown mouse model was generated to deconvolute the complex bioenergetic phenotype of this disease. To investigate the underlying cause of hemodynamic dysfunction in Barth , we interrogated the cardiac structural and signaling lipidome of this mouse model as well as its myocardial bioenergetic phenotype. A decrease in the distribution of cardiolipin molecular species and robust increases in monolysocardiolipin and dilysocardiolipin were demonstrated. Additionally, the contents of choline and  glycerophospholipid molecular species containing precursors for lipid signaling at the sn-2 position were altered. Lipidomic analyses revealed specific dysregulation of HETEs and prostanoids, as well as oxidized linoleic and docosahexaenoic metabolites. Bioenergetic interrogation uncovered differential substrate utilization as well as decreases in Complex III and V activities. Transgenic expression of cardiolipin synthase or iPLA2γ ablation in tafazzin-deficient mice did not rescue the observed phenotype. These results underscore the complex nature of alterations in cardiolipin metabolism mediated by tafazzin loss of function. Collectively, we identified specific lipidomic, bioenergetic, and signaling alterations in a murine model that parallel those of Barth  thereby providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of this debilitating disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18789021>[Heart rate variability dynamics during treatment of arterial hypertension].</a></h2><p>Investigation of the dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) in anti-hypertension therapy can facilitate the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment.to compare anti-hypertension effect of monotherapy with nebivolol and dilatrend with dynamics of HRV and the estimation of the state of patients with mild arterial hypertension (AH) and  (MS).HRV was studied in 42 patients with mild AH and MS at the age of 32-60. Eighteen of them were treated with 5 mg of nebivolol during 24 weeks, and twenty-four with 25-50 mg of dilatrend during 16 weeks. All the patients were subjected to 24-hour ECG monitoring with analysis of HRV and arterial pressure (AP) before and after treatment. The main feature of HRV analysis was investigation of dependence of sinus arrhythmia on the mean value of heart rate (HR) RESULTS: With nebivolol treatment AP decreased in 11 patients, HRV became better in 9 patients. 7 cases manifested coincidence of AP reduction and HRV improvement. In 6 cases out of 7 when AP did not decrease, HRV did not change. Worsened HRV was observed in 3 cases: in one case with growing AP and in 2 cases with decreasing AP. All the patients, except one, regarded their state as improved. With dilatrend treatment AP lowered in 16 cases. In 9 cases HRV became better, in 11 cases it remained the same, and in 4 cases it became worse. Positive HRV dynamics in 7 cases out of 9 was accompanied by lowering of AP, while negative dynamics was observed in one case with rise of AP and in three cases with very low AP or in the absence of AP dynamics. 14 patients felt better, 6 of them manifested better level both of AP and HRV.The method of 24-hour HRV analysis based on assessment of dependence of the value of sinus arrhythmia on HR is useful in evaluating the effectiveness of anti-hypertension therapy. As a rule, an effective decrease in AP is accompanied with improvement of HRV. The absence of improvement of deterioration of HRV in anti-hypertension therapy is a factor which should be taken into consideration when choosing the mode of therapy.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668463>Changes to trimethylamine-N-oxide and its precursors in nascent .</a></h2><p>Background  (MetS), a cardio- cluster afflicting 35% of American adults, increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type-2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. Increased levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite derived from choline and L-carnitine, correlates with CVD and T2DM. However, the precise role of TMAO and its precursors in MetS remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that choline, L-carnitine and TMAO in MetS patients without CVD or T2DM would be altered and correlate with inflammatory markers. Materials and methods This was an exploratory study of 30 patients with nascent MetS (without CVD or T2DM) and 20 matched controls. MetS was defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. TMAO and its precursors were evaluated from each patient's frozen early morning urine samples and quantified using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These amines were correlated with a detailed repertoire of biomarkers of inflammation and adipokines. Results L-carnitine was significantly increased (p = 0.0002) compared to controls. There was a trend for a significant increase in TMAO levels (p = 0.08). Choline was not significantly altered in MetS. L-carnitine correlated significantly with soluble tumor necrosis factor 1 (sTNFR1) and leptin, and inversely to adiponectin. TMAO correlated with IL-6, endotoxin and chemerin. Neither choline, nor L-carnitine significantly correlated with TMAO. Conclusion L-carnitine is directly correlated with markers of inflammation in nascent MetS. Cellular L-carnitine could be a biomediator or marker of inflammation in the pathogenesis of MetS, and the sequelae of CVD and T2DM.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23027821>Altered neurovascular control of the resting circulation in human .</a></h2><p>Young healthy adults exhibit an inverse linear relationship between muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and α-adrenergic responsiveness.

We hypothesized humans with MetSyn would demonstrate increased α-adrenergic vasoconstriction and the inverse relationship between MSNA and adrenergic responsiveness would be lost. We measured MSNA (microneurography of the peroneal nerve) and forearm blood flow (FBF, Doppler ultrasound) in 16 healthy control subjects (31 ± 3 years) and 14 adults with MetSyn (35 ± 3 years; P > 0.05) during local administration of α-adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine (PE), α(1); clonidine (CL), α(2)). MSNA was greater in MetSyn subjects than in healthy controls (P < 0.05). A group difference in vasoconstriction to PE was not detected (P = 0.08). The level of α(1)-mediated vasoconstriction was inversely related to MSNA in control subjects (r = 0.5, P = 0.04); this balance between MSNA and α(1) responsiveness was lost in adults with MetSyn. MetSyn subjects exhibited greater vasoconstriction to CL infusion as compared with healthy controls (P < 0.01). A relationship between MSNA and α(2)-mediated vasoconstriction was not detected in either group. In summary, altered neurovascular control in human MetSyn is receptor specific.

We employed caudate microdialysis and no net flux (NNF) in post-weaning rats to determine if ID decreased the extraction fraction (E(d)). Five micromolar quinpirole, a dopamine D(2) receptor agonist, resulted in 80% decrease in extracellular DA and 45% higher E(d) in control animals. The D(2) agonist had no effect on E(d) in ID animals despite a reduction in basal DA. DAT mRNA levels were reduced by 58% with ID, while DAT protein in ventral midbrain and caudate and membrane associated DAT were also reduced by ID. Carbidopa/l-DOPA was administered to determine if elevated extracellular DA in ID was due to increased release. The DA response to l-DOPA in ID rats was 50% smaller and delayed, whereas the NE response was threefold higher. The caudate concentration of NE was also elevated in ID. Elevated dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity in ID provides a tentative explanation for the increased NE response to l-DOPA.

Information was recorded pertaining to clinical symptoms at presentation, examination findings, biochemical and hematological investigation, and treatment outcome. Presence of malarial parasite on thick and thin smears and/or positive parasite lactate dehydrogenase (p-LDH) based rapid malaria antigen test was considered diagnostic of 'malaria'. Based on the etiology, children were categorized into three groups: P.vivax, Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) and mixed infection. Children diagnosed with 'severe malaria' (World Health Organization, 2000), were started on intravenous artesunate followed by artemether-lumefantrine combination.Thirty-five children with a diagnosis of severe malaria were enrolled [18 (51·4%) P. vivax, nine (25·7%) mixed infection, eight (22·8%) P. falciparum]. Clinical features of severe vivax malaria (n = 18) were abnormal sensorium [9 (50%)], multiple seizures [8 (44·4%)], jaundice [5 (27·8%)], severe anaemia [5 (27·8%)], and shock [3 (16·7%)]. Two children [2/18 (11·1%)] infected with P. vivax had died of cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress , shock, and  acidosis. The clinical presentation and outcome of severe vivax malaria was found to be similar to severe malaria caused by P. falciparum and mixed infection, except for higher chances of severe anaemia among the children infected with P. falciparum (P = 0·04).The present study highlights P. vivax as an increasingly recognized causative agent for severe malaria in children from Rohtak, with similar clinical presentation and outcome to that caused by P. falciparum.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20616307>Reduced baroreflex sensitivity and pulmonary dysfunction in alcoholic cirrhosis: effect of hyperoxia.</a></h2><p>Patients with cirrhosis exhibit impaired regulation of the arterial blood pressure, reduced baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and prolonged QT interval. In addition, a considerable number of patients have a pulmonary dysfunction with hypoxemia, impaired lung diffusing capacity (Dl(CO)), and presence of hepatopulmonary  (HPS). BRS is reduced at exposure to chronic hypoxia such as during sojourn in high altitudes. In this study, we assessed the relation of BRS to pulmonary dysfunction and cardiovascular characteristics and the effects of hyperoxia. Forty-three patients with cirrhosis and 12 healthy matched controls underwent hemodynamic and pulmonary investigations. BRS was assessed by cross-spectral analysis of variabilities between blood pressure and heart rate time series. A 100% oxygen test was performed with the assessment of arterial oxygen tensions (Pa(O(2))) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. Baseline BRS was significantly reduced in the cirrhotic patients compared with the controls (4.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 10.3 +/- 2.0 ms/mmHg; P < 0.001). The frequency-corrected QT interval was significantly prolonged in the cirrhotic patients (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in BRS according to presence of HPS, Pa(O(2)), Dl(CO), or Child-Turcotte score, but BRS correlated with  and hemodynamic characteristics. After 100% oxygen inhalation, BRS and the QT interval remained unchanged in the cirrhotic patients. In conclusion, BRS is significantly reduced in patients with cirrhosis compared with controls, but it is unrelated to the degree of pulmonary dysfunction and portal hypertension. Acute hyperoxia does not significantly revert the low BRS or the prolonged QT interval in cirrhosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23258917>Comment on: Straznicky et al. neuroadrenergic dysfunction along the diabetes continuum: a comparative study in obese  subjects.

Nebivolol, a beta(1)-antagonist, has recently been shown to reduce albuminuria, in part, through reductions in renal oxidative stress. Accordingly, we hypothesized that nebivolol therapy would attenuate PTC damage and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.Young Ren2 (R2-N) and SD (SD-N) rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (R2-C; SD-C) for 3 weeks. PTC structure and function were tested using transmission electron microscopy and functional measurements.Nebivolol treatment decreased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, tubulointerstitial ultrastructural remodeling and fibrosis, NADPH oxidase activity, 3-nitrotyrosine levels, and increased megalin and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 immunostaining in PTCs. Ultrastructural abnormalities that were improved with therapy included altered canalicular structure, reduced endosomes/lysosomes and PTC vacuoles, basement membrane thickening, and mitochondrial remodeling/fragmentation.These observations support the notion that nebivolol may improve PTC reabsorption of albumin and other glomerular filtered small molecular weight proteins in association with the attenuation of oxidative stress, tubulointerstitial injury and fibrosis in this rat model of  kidney disease.2010 S.

Formoterol, a highly selective β2-adrenoceptor therapeutic drug, gives potential anabolic responses in the context of skeletal muscles and was widely confirmed to possess anti-cachexia effects. However, the possible  pathways and the metabolite changes that initiate and maintain these anabolic responses remain poorly understood. In the present study, a (1)H NMR-metabonomics model was established to investigate the  features of cancer cachexia and the contribution of formoterol to serum metabolites in a mouse model bearing CT26 carcinoma cells. Among the  processes found in serum, the ones associated with cancer are glycolysis and lipid lipolysis. However, the citrate cycle and amino acid metabolism are the major  characteristics of cachexia. Furthermore, formoterol stimulated skeletal muscle growth, increased the body weight and altered the  profile. Amino acids, ketone bodies and citrate cycle metabolites are potential biomarkers associated with these functional pathways. Taking the pathways of cancer cachexia into account, formoterol could regulate the imbalance in glycolysis, the citrate cycle, and in lipid and amino acid metabolism.

The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in AgRP neurons serves as a major signaling molecule for leptin and insulin, the hormones regulating feeding behavior, energy homeostasis and circulation. However, it is unclear whether PDK1 in AGRP neurons is also involved in regulation of blood pressure. This study explored it by generating and analyzing AgRP neuron-specific PDK1 knockout (Agrp-Pdk1) mice and effect of high salt diet on blood pressure in KO and WT mice was analyzed. Under high salt diet feeding, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of Agrp-Pdk1 mice was significantly elevated compared to Agrp-Cre mice. When the high salt diet was switched to control low salt diet, SBP of Agrp-Pdk1 mice returned to the basal level observed in Agrp-Cre mice within 1 week. In Agrp-Pdk1 mice, urinary noradrenalin excretion and NUCB2 mRNA expression in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were markedly upregulated.

This risk is greatly enhanced in the case of pharmacological interactions. We present two cases of HIV-infected patients who developed Cushing-like symptoms as a result of a pharmacological interaction. Their antiretroviral treatment regimen consisted of atazanavir, ritonavir, tenofovir and emtricitabine. One patient received salmeterol/fluticasone inhalations for asthmatic bronchitis. The other was treated with intra-articular triamcinolonacetonide injections for ongoing shoulder complaints. Ritonavir exhibits strong inhibition of hepatic enzyme CYP 3A4, which is part of the major  pathway of most glucocorticoids. As a result of this interaction even locally administered glucocorticoids can cause symptoms of overdose, e.g. Cushing-like symptoms. Beclomethasone is a safe alternative for inhaled glucocorticoids as it is not metabolized by CYP 3A4. There is no substitute for intra-articular administration of triamcinolonacetonide. Depending on necessity of the administration of the drug, changing ritonavir-containing antiretroviral therapy to a non-interacting compound, e.g., an integrase inhibitor, is an option.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699450>Calorie restriction inhibits sympathetic nerve activity via anti-oxidant effect in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of obesity-induced hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>In the patients and animals with  (MetS), sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) is increased. We have demonstrated that oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a vasomotor center in the brainstem, increases SNA. The aim of the present study was to determine whether calorie restriction inhibits SNA via anti-oxidant effect in the RVLM of obesity-induced obesity rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed on a high-fat diet and segregated into obesity-prone (OP) showing a MetS profile and obesity-resistant (OR) after 13 weeks. Obesity-prone was divided into OP treated with calorie restriction (CR-OP) for 8 weeks and control (CTR-OP). Systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), SNA, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels as a marker of oxidative stress in the RVLM were significantly higher and the depressor effects due to the microinjection of tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic into the RVLM, were significantly greater in OP than in OR. Body weight was significantly lower in CR-OP than in CTR-OP. SBP, HR, SNA, TBARS, and the depressor effects due to the microinjection of tempol into the RVLM were significantly lower in CR-OP than in CTR-OP.

Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man's life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder.

Higher production of nonesterified fatty acid and changes in adipocytokine release may trigger insulin resistance. Many studies have suggested that calcium (Ca) deficiency is associated with insulin resistance; however, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We examined the effects of Ca deficiency on adrenaline-induced lipolysis and adipocytokine release in the early stages after weaning using freshly isolated adipocytes from mesenteric fat tissue of 3-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a normal-Ca (5 g/kg diet) or low-Ca (1 g/kg diet) diet for 4 weeks. The release rate of nonesterified fatty acid in the mesenteric adipocytes after stimulation with a low level of adrenaline (0.2 microg/mL) was much higher in the Ca-deficient group than in the control group. In contrast, adiponectin release in the mesenteric fat cells was lower in Ca-deficient rats. Leptin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion showed a similar tendency without significant intergroup differences, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 release was not affected by Ca deficiency. We found that Ca deficiency reduced the average size of fat cells through a large increase in the number of cells slightly smaller than the average size, which may be associated with the changes in the properties of the mesenteric adipose tissue.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an objective method of determining brain metabolites and has the potential to identify disease biomarkers with utility in evaluating current and novel therapies. MRS studies from seven patients with MPSII all receiving enzyme replacement therapy were compared with a large cohort of children with various neurocognitive disorders with normal MR imaging. All studies were completed on 1.5Tesla clinical MR scanners. Brain metabolite concentrations were determined from basal ganglia and parieto-occipital white matter using LCModel quantification. Serial trends in brain metabolites were analysed. Examination of mean spectra and quantitative metabolite concentrations demonstrated significantly decreased white matter N-acetylaspartate (a neuronal marker), total choline and glutamate, and elevated myo-inositol (glial marker) in MPSII patients. Analysis of serial determinations of white matter N-acetylaspartate demonstrated no change in two patients with stable MR imaging features but decreasing N-acetylaspartate in two patients more severely affected or deteriorating.

However, the mechanisms of the pathogenesis remain unknown. In adult mice, stress activates NPY and its Y2R in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner in the abdominal fat. This increased adipogenesis and angiogenesis, leading to abdominal obesity and  which were inhibited by intra-fat Y2R inactivation. To determine whether stress elevates NPY system and accelerates adipogenic potential of embryo, here we "stressed" murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in vitro with epinephrine (EPI) during their adipogenic differentiation. EPI was added during the commitment stage together with insulin, and followed by dexamethasone in the standard adipogenic differentiation medium. Undifferentiated embryonic bodies (EBs) showed no detectable expression of NPY. EPI markedly up-regulated the expression NPY and the Y1R at the commitment stage, followed by increased Y2R mRNA at the late of the commitment stage and the differentiation stage. EPI significantly increased EB cells proliferation and expression of the preadipocyte marker Pref-1 at the commitment stage. EPI also accelerated and amplified adipogenic differentiation detected by increasing the adipocyte markers FABP4 and PPARγ mRNAs and Oil-red O-staining at the end of the differentiation stage. EPI-induced adipogenesis was completely prevented by antagonists of the NPY receptors (Y1R+Y2R+Y5R), indicating that it was mediated by the NPY system in mESC's. Taken together, these data suggest that stress may play an important role in programming ESCs for accelerated adipogenesis by altering the stress induced hormonal regulation of the NPY system.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22353614>Differential effects of nebivolol and metoprolol on insulin sensitivity and plasminogen activator inhibitor in the .</a></h2><p>Early-generation β-blockers lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular morality in coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure but worsen glucose homeostasis and fibrinolytic balance. Nebivolol is a third-generation β-blocker that increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide.

Subjects underwent a frequently sampled IV glucose tolerance test after 3-week washout and placebo treatment and after randomized treatment with study drug. After 12-week treatment, nebivolol and metoprolol equivalently decreased systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Neither drug affected β-cell function, disposition index, or acute insulin response to glucose. Metoprolol significantly decreased the insulin sensitivity index. In contrast, nebivolol did not affect insulin sensitivity, and the decrease in sensitivity was significantly greater after metoprolol than after nebivolol (-1.5±2.5×10(-4)×min(-1) per milliunit per liter versus 0.04±2.19×10(-4)×min(-1) per milliunit per liter after nebivolol; P=0.03).

We compared structure and  activity of the right AHC of 22 individuals with AS and 22 healthy controls aged 10-50 years and examined the effects of age between groups. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to measure the volume of the AHC, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to measure concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine+phosphocreatine (Cr+PCr), myo-inositol (mI) and choline (Cho). The bulk volume of the amygdala and the hippocampus did not differ significantly between groups, but there was a significant difference in the effect of age on the hippocampus in controls. Compared with controls, young (but not older) people with AS had a significantly higher AHC concentration of NAA and a significantly higher NAA/Cr ratio. People with AS, but not controls, had a significant age-related reduction in NAA and the NAA/Cr ratio. Also, in people with AS, but not controls, there was a significant relationship between concentrations of choline and age so that choline concentrations reduced with age. We therefore suggest that people with AS have significant differences in neuronal and lipid membrane integrity and maturation of the AHC.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This pleiotropic effect is achieved via coupling to different receptor/effector systems. In epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) of Wistar rats, we showed that epinephrine stimulated protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation on Ser(473). Epinephrine further increased the glucose incorporation into glyceride-glycerol without decreasing glucose availability for other  pathways (i.e. lactate production). Wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) treatment significantly decreased glucose incorporation into glyceride-glycerol and elevated the epinephrine-induced release of free fatty acids (FFA) from the adipose tissue without any change in the intensity of lipolysis measured as glycerol release. Using specific cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogs we demonstrated that cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signalling resulted in a strong PKB dephosphorylation and significantly lowered the glucose availability in EWAT. Specific activation of the Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP)-dependent pathway had only a moderately negative effect on PKB phosphorylation and glucose metabolism. In contrast, α(1) agonist methoxamine increased PKB phosphorylation and lactate production. This effect of methoxamine was additive to the effect of insulin and it was abolished by wortmannin treatment. In EWAT of spontaneously dyslipidemic hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HHTg) rats, we demonstrated significantly lower epinephrine-induced glucose utilization but higher sensitivity to its lipolytic effect. We conclude that in EWAT, epinephrine controls two opposite processes (FFA release and FFA retention) via two different effector systems.

Particular emphasis is given to the background and results of recent therapeutic approaches based on carotid baroreceptor stimulation and radiofrequency ablation of the renal nerves.© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26805814>VLDL from  Individuals Enhanced Lipid Accumulation in Atria with Association of Susceptibility to Atrial Fibrillation.</a></h2><p> (MetS) represents a cluster of  derangements. Dyslipidemia is an important factor in MetS and is related to atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in MetS (MetS-VLDL) may induce atrial dilatation and vulnerability to AF. VLDL was therefore separated from normal (normal-VLDL) and MetS individuals. Wild type C57BL/6 male mice were divided into control, normal-VLDL (nVLDL), and MetS-VLDL (msVLDL) groups. VLDL (15 µg/g) and equivalent volumes of saline were injected via tail vein three times a week for six consecutive weeks. Cardiac chamber size and function were measured by echocardiography. MetS-VLDL significantly caused left atrial dilation (control, n = 10, 1.64 ± 0.23 mm; nVLDL, n = 7, 1.84 ± 0.13 mm; msVLDL, n = 10, 2.18 ± 0.24 mm; p < 0.0001) at week 6, associated with decreased ejection fraction (control, n = 10, 62.5% ± 7.7%, vs. msVLDL, n = 10, 52.9% ± 9.6%; p < 0.05). Isoproterenol-challenge experiment resulted in AF in young msVLDL mice. Unprovoked AF occurred only in elderly msVLDL mice. Immunohistochemistry showed excess lipid accumulation and apoptosis in msVLDL mice atria.

Blood sample collection, and MRS were carried out before and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks after SIV inoculation. Significant reduction of N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho)/Cr ratios in prefrontal gray matter (PGM) and glutamate/glutamine(Glx)/Cr ratio in striatum, and increase of myo-inositol (mI)/Cr in striatum were observed during acute SIV infection. The metabolite alterations during the SIVsmmFGb infection are largely in agreement with previous findings in other non-human primate models and HIV patients. Also, NAA/Cr in PGM and striatum and Glx/Cr in striatum are negatively correlated with the percentage of CD8+ T cells after the SIV infection, suggesting the interaction between brain metabolite and immune dysfunction. The present study complements previous studies by describing the time course of alterations of brain metabolites during SIVsmmFGb infection. The findings further demonstrate the efficacy of the SIVsmmFGb-infected macaque as a model to characterize central nervous system infection using novel neuroimaging approaches and also as a tool for exploration of novel and advanced neuroimaging techniques in HIV/AIDS studies.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111740>Anaesthetic-induced cardioprotection in an experimental model of the Takotsubo  - isoflurane vs. propofol.</a></h2><p>Takotsubo  (TS) is an acute cardiac condition with a substantial mortality for which no specific treatment is available. We have previously shown that isoflurane attenuates the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in an experimental TS-model. We compared the effects of equi-anaesthetic doses of isoflurane, propofol and ketamine+midazolam on haemodynamics, global and regional LV systolic function and the activation of intracellular  pathways in experimental TS. We hypothesized that cardioprotection in experimental TS is specific for isoflurane.Forty-five rats were randomized to isoflurane (0.6 MAC, n = 15), propofol (bolus 200 mg/kg+360 mg/kg/h, n = 15) or ketamine (100 mg/kg)+midazolam (10 mg/kg, n = 15) anaesthesia. Arterial pressure, heart rate and body temperature were continuously measured and arterial blood gas analysis was performed intermittently. TS was induced by intraperitoneal injection of isoprenaline, 50 mg/kg. LV echocardiography was performed 90 min after isoprenaline injection. Apical cardiac tissue was analysed by global discovery proteomics and pathway analysis.Isoprenaline-induced changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate or body temperature did not differ between groups. LV ejection fraction was higher and extent of LV akinesia was lower with isoflurane, when compared with the propofol and the ketamine+midazolam groups. In this TS-model, the proteomic analysis revealed an up-regulation of pathways involved in inflammation, coagulation, endocytosis and lipid metabolism. This up-regulation was clearly attenuated with isoflurane compared to propofol.In an experimental model of TS, isoflurane, but not propofol, exerts a cardioprotective effect.

Besides effective control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension, third-generation beta-blockers such as nebivolol offer additional benefits for central hemodynamics and neutral or beneficial effects on metabolism. Emerging clinical data suggest that nebivolol also has similar effects on metabolism in obese hypertensive and hypertensive diabetic patients. The present article will provide a systematic analysis of the pathophysiological links among hypertension, insulin resistance, and . We will also summarize the available clinical evidence regarding the  effects of beta-blockers in hypertensive patients, with an emphasis on nebivolol. Nebivolol exerts neutral or beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in hypertensive patients, owing to its nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatory and antioxidative properties. Thus, nebivolol could be a favorable therapeutic option for the treatment of hypertension in patients with impaired glucose and lipid metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23271752>The relation of glucose metabolism to left ventricular mass and function and sympathetic nervous system activity in obese subjects with .</a></h2><p>Altered cardiac structure and function have been reported in prediabetic and diabetic populations; however, the contribution of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to these changes has yet to be delineated.Our objective was to examine interrelationships between glucose metabolism, left ventricular mass and function, and SNS activity in obese  subjects.Unmedicated impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) (n = 31) or treatment-naive type 2 diabetic (T2D) (n = 25) subjects, matched for age (mean 58 ± 1 years), gender, body mass index (32.2 ± 0.5 kg/m(2)), and blood pressure, participated. They underwent echocardiography and assessments of whole-body norepinephrine kinetics, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and insulin sensitivity by euglycemic clamp (M value).T2D subjects had higher left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (93.6 ± 3.5 vs 77.2 ± 3.4 g/m(2), P = .002) and Doppler-derived isovolumetric relaxation and deceleration times (both P < .05) and lower early/late transmitral inflow velocities (E/A) (P = .02) compared with IGT. Total muscle sympathetic nerve activity and arterial norepinephrine concentration were higher in the T2D group (by 18% and 32%, respectively, both P ≤ .05), whereas plasma norepinephrine clearance was reduced (1.94 ± 0.11 vs 2.26 ± 0.10 L/min, P = .02).

However, the effects of restraint stress on cardiovascular and  disorders in  (MetS) have remained unclear. We investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress and β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) blockade on cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and  disorders in a rat model of MetS. DahlS.Z-Lepr(fa)/Lepr(fa) (DS/obese) rats, derived from a cross between Dahl salt-sensitive and Zucker rats. Rats were exposed to restraint stress (restraint cage, 2 h/day) for 4 wk from 9 wk of age with or without daily subcutaneous administration of the β-AR blocker propranolol (2 mg/kg). Age-matched homozygous lean littermates of DS/obese rats (DahlS.Z-Lepr(+)/Lepr(+) rats) served as control animals. Chronic restraint stress exacerbated hypertension as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress in a manner sensitive to propranolol treatment. Restraint stress attenuated body weight gain in DS/obese rats, and this effect tended to be reversed by propranolol (P = 0.0682). Restraint stress or propranolol did not affect visceral or subcutaneous fat mass. However, restraint stress potentiated cardiac and visceral adipose tissue inflammation in DS/obese rats, and these effects were ameliorated by propranolol. Restraint stress also exacerbated glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid metabolism in a manner sensitive to propranolol. In addition, restraint stress increased urinary norepinephrine excretion, and propranolol attenuated this effect. Our results thus implicate β-ARs in the exacerbation of cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism induced by restraint stress in this model of MetS.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22769014>Platelet activating factor levels and metabolism in Tangier disease: a case study.</a></h2><p>Tangier disease (TD) is a phenotypic expression of rare familial  with mutations in the ABCA1 transporter. The risk of coronary artery disease in patients with TD is variable. On the other hand the pivotal role of Platelet-Activating Factor (PAF) mediator in atheromatosis was found. Plasma lipoproteins are transporters of the PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in cells and known as lipoprotein-phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in plasma and regulators of PAF levels in blood. In addition, PAF can be biosynthesized from the remodeling and the de novo pathways in which Lyso-platelet activating factor-acetyltransferase (Lyso-PAF-AT) and platelet activating factor-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) are the regulatory enzymes. The aim of this study is to investigate in a TD patient with a unique mutation (C2033A), the concentration of PAF in blood, the Equivalent Concentration for 50% aggregation (EC50) values of platelet rich plasma (PRP) toward PAF, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin, and the activities of PAF  enzymes Lp-PLA2, PAF-AH, Lyso-PAF-AT and PAF-CPT.The EC50 value of PRP was measured by an aggregometer. The determination of the specific activity of PAF-CPT and Lyso-PAF-AT was made after in vitro enzymatic assay, chromatographic separation and measurement of the produced PAF in a biological assay with washed rabbit platelets. The determination of PAF-AH and Lp-PLA2 was made after an in vitro enzymatic assay from the decay of radioactive PAF.The TD patient had lower bound-PAF values in blood, decreased specific activity of PAF-CPT and Lyso-PAF-AT, increased specific activity of PAF-AH in platelets and leukocytes and Lp-PLA2 activity in plasma compared to healthy women. The EC50 of PAF and Thrombin were higher compared to healthy women.The increased Lp-PLA2 activity, as well as, the decreased activities of PAF-CPT and Lyso-PAF-AT, explain the decreased bound-PAF level in TD patient and the EC50 of PAF. However, total PAF is in a normal range and this probably can explain one of the reasons this TD patient has no CAD.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22798210>Influence of exercise on NA- and Hsp72-induced release of IFNγ by the peritoneal suspension of macrophages and lymphocytes from genetically obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Regular physical exercise is recognized as a nonpharmacological therapeutic strategy in the treatment of , and has been proposed for improving obesity, diabetic status, insulin resistance, and immune response. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a regular exercise program (treadmill running, 5 days/week for 14 weeks at 35 cm/s for 35 min in the last month) on the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ) by peritoneal cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) from obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) in response to noradrenaline (NA) and heat shock proteins of 72 kDa (Hsp72), and the possible adaptation due to training for a bout acute exercise (a single session of 25-35 min at 35 cm/s). In healthy (lean Fa/fa) and obese animals, peritoneal cells released greater concentrations of IFNγ in response to Hsp72 and lower concentrations in response to NA. The regular exercise training protocol, evaluated in the obese animals, produced a clear change in the regulation of the release of IFNγ. Peritoneal immune cells from trained animals released more IFNγ in response to NA, but there was a reduction in the release of IFNγ in response to Hsp72. In the obese animals, regular exercise caused a change in the inhibitory effect of NA (which now becomes stimulatory) and the stimulatory effect of Hsp72e (which now becomes inhibitory) in relation to the release of IFNγ. This reflects that Hsp72, induced by the prior release of NA following exercise-induced stress, plays a role in the homeostatic balance of release of IFNγ by peritoneal immune cells in obese animals during exercise.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18076476>Noradrenaline and angiotensin II modify vascular prostanoid release in fructose-fed hypertensive rats.</a></h2><p>1 A fructose-enriched diet induces hypertension,  alterations and insulin resistance in rats, resembling human . Previously, we found that prostanoid production was altered in fructose-fed rats. 2 This study analysed the effects of incubation with noradrenaline (NA) and angiotensin II (Ang II) on prostanoid release in mesenteric vascular beds from control and fructose-fed rats. Animals which received fructose solution (10% w/v) for 22 weeks showed higher systolic blood pressure and triglyceridaemia. 3 In controls, NA increased 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F(1)alpha (prostacyclin metabolite) and thromboxane (TX) production. Ang II increased only TX release. In fructose-fed animals, NA increased 6-keto-PG F(1)alpha and TX. PGF(2)alpha (vasoconstrictor) was also elevated. Ang II also increased PGF(2)alpha and PGE(2) levels. 4 In conclusion, in fructose rats Ang II in vitro stimulates a vasoconstrictor prostanoid not stimulated in controls. This could be related to the observed in vivo blood pressure increase. In fructose-fed animals, NA and Ang II also augment vasodilator prostanoids, suggesting a compensatory mechanism because of long-term hypertension.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27755119>Sympathetic nerves and hypertension in stress, sleep apnea, and caregiving.</a></h2><p>The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates short-term increases in blood pressure.

On the other hand, norepinephrine is chronically elevated in OSA and among markedly stressed caregivers, and they have an increased incidence of hypertension. This is most striking in OSA, which causes a nocturnal diuresis.

Gaining the ability to noninvasively image the presence or onset of cachexia is important to better treat this condition, to improve the design and optimization of therapeutic strategies, and to detect the responses to such treatments. In this study, we employed noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) to identify  signatures typical of cachectic tumors, using this information to analyze the types and extents of  changes induced by the onset of cachexia in normal tissues. Cachexia was confirmed by weight loss as well as analyses of muscle tissue and serum. In vivo, cachexia-inducing murine adenocarcinoma (MAC)16 tumors were characterized by higher total choline (tCho) and higher (18)FDG uptake than histologically similar noncachectic MAC13 tumors. A profound depletion of the lipid signal was observed in normal tissue of MAC16 tumor-bearing mice but not within the tumor tissue itself. High-resolution (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) confirmed the high tCho level observed in cachectic tumors that occurred because of an increase of free choline and phosphocholine. Higher succinate and lower creatine levels were also detected in cachectic tumors. Taken together, these findings enhance our understanding of the effect of cancer on host organs and tissues as well as promote the development of noninvasive biomarkers for the presence of cachexia and identification of new therapeutic targets.©2011 AACR</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20411618>Cardiovascular protective effects of nebivolol in Zucker diabetic fatty rats.</a></h2><p>Although effective in reducing blood pressure, therapy with a first-generation [beta]-blocker is currently controversial in  due to its negative impact on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.We evaluated the effects of nebivolol, a third-generation highly selective [beta]-blocker with additional vasodilating activity, versus the traditional [beta]-blocker atenolol in controlling functional and morphological cardiovascular damage in a rat model of .During 6 months, Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and control lean Zucker rats (LZR) were studied.

Small veins (150-500 μm) draining the digital laminae from healthy horses or ponies were investigated by wire myography. Concentration response curves were constructed for noradrenaline (NA), phenylephrine (PE), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the presence of either cortisol (10(-6 ) m) or insulin (1000 μIU/mL). Cortisol significantly increased the maximum contractility of laminar veins to the vasoconstrictors NA and 5-HT but decreased the maximal contraction to ET-1. Insulin decreased the contractility of vessels to PE and ET-1. It is possible that short-term cortisol excess could enhance venoconstrictor responses to 5-HT and NA in laminar veins in vivo, thereby predisposing to laminitis. Additionally, a reduction in the ability of insulin to counteract alpha-adrenoreceptor and ET-1-mediated contraction, likely to occur in subjects with insulin resistance, may further exacerbate venoconstriction in animals prone to laminitis. These mechanisms may also predispose horses with disorders such as equine Cushing's disease and equine  to laminitis.© 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23665100>Effects of bariatric surgery on human small artery function: evidence for reduction in perivascular adipocyte inflammation, and the restoration of normal anticontractile activity despite persistent obesity.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bariatric surgery on small artery function and the mechanisms underlying this.In lean healthy humans, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) exerts an anticontractile effect on adjacent small arteries, but this is lost in obesity-associated conditions such as the  and type II diabetes where there is evidence of adipocyte inflammation and increased oxidative stress.Segments of small subcutaneous artery and perivascular fat were harvested from severely obese individuals before (n = 20) and 6 months after bariatric surgery (n = 15). Small artery contractile function was examined in vitro with wire myography, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) morphology was assessed with immunohistochemistry.The anticontractile activity of PVAT was lost in obese patients before surgery when compared with healthy volunteers and was restored 6 months after bariatric surgery. In vitro protocols with superoxide dismutase and catalase rescued PVAT anticontractile function in tissue from obese individuals before surgery. The improvement in anticontractile function after surgery was accompanied by improvements in insulin sensitivity, serum glycemic indexes, inflammatory cytokines, adipokine profile, and systolic blood pressure together with increased PVAT adiponectin and nitric oxide bioavailability and reduced macrophage infiltration and inflammation. These changes were observed despite the patients remaining severely obese.Bariatric surgery and its attendant improvements in weight, blood pressure, inflammation, and metabolism collectively reverse the obesity-induced alteration to PVAT anticontractile function.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19515393>Differential sympathetic activation in muscle and skin neural districts in the .</a></h2><p>The present study was designed to determine whether and to what extent the activation of the sympathetic nervous system reported in the  is generalized to the whole cardiovascular system or if it is rather confined to selected vascular districts.

Albumin and in vitro prepared AGE-BSA have vascular effects; however, recent studies indicate that some effects of in vitro prepared AGEs are due to the conditions in which they were generated. We produced AGEs by incubating glucose with BSA for 60 days under sterile conditions in darkness and at 37 degrees C. To develop MS rats, male Wistar animals were given 30% sucrose in drinking water since weanling. Six month old animals were used. Blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides, and serum albumin were increased in MS rats. Contraction of aortic rings elicited with norepinephrine was stronger. There were no effects of nonglycated BSA or AGE-BSA on contractions in control or MS rats; however, both groups responded to L-NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis. Arterial relaxation induced using acetylcholine was smaller in MS rats. Nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA significantly diminished relaxation in a 35% in the control group but the decrease was similar when using nonglycated BSA and AGE-BSA. This decrease was not present in the MS rats and was not due to increased RAGEs or altered biochemical characteristics of BSA. In conclusion, both BSA and AGE-BSA inhibit vascular relaxation in control artic rings. In MS rats the effect is lost possibly due to alterations in endothelial cells that are a consequence of the illness.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902449>Is N,N-dimethylglycine N-oxide a choline and betaine metabolite?</a></h2><p>Choline metabolism is by oxidation to betaine, which is demethylated to N,N-dimethylglycine; dimethylglycine is oxidatively demethylated to sarcosine. This pathway is important for osmoregulation and as a source of methyl groups. We asked whether another metabolite was involved. We synthesized the N-oxide of dimethylglycine (DMGO) by oxidizing dimethylglycine with peracetic acid, and measured DMGO in human plasma and urine by HPLC-MS/MS with positive ion detection, using two chromatography procedures, based on ion exchange and HILIC separations. The molecular ion DMGOH+ (m/z=120) yielded four significant fragments (m/z=103, 102, 58 and 42). The suspected DMGO peak in human body fluids showed all these fragments, and co-chromatographed with added standard DMGO in both HPLC systems. Typical plasma concentrations of DMGO are under 1 μmol/l. They may be lower in  patients. Urine concentrations are higher, and DMGO has a higher fractional clearance than dimethylglycine, betaine and choline. It was present in all of over 80 human urine and plasma samples assayed. Plasma DMGO concentrations correlate with plasma DMG concentrations, with betaine and choline concentrations, with the osmolyte myo-inositol, and strongly with urinary DMGO excretion. We conclude that DMGO is probably a normal human metabolite.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23131487>Lactic acidosis following intentional overdose by inhalation of salmeterol and fluticasone.</a></h2><p>Salmeterol, a long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, has an adverse effects profile that is similar to that of salbutamol and other β2-agonists. We report a sympathomimetic  with  acidosis and hyperlactatemia after intentional inhalation of salmeterol in a suicide attempt. A 16-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department approximately 2 hours after having inhaled 60 puffs of a combination of salmeterol xinafoate 25 μg and fluticasone propionate 50 μg. She presented in an anxious state with complaints of palpitations and chest pain. The electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia and ST-segment depression in the inferior and anterolateral leads. Laboratory findings showed hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and lactic acidosis. Cardiac troponin I and creatine kinase MB remained within the normal range. Treatment was supportive and included intravenous fluids and cautious potassium supplementation. The next day, electrocardiographic and laboratory findings returned to normal. We hypothesize that stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors by inhalation of salmeterol caused this patient's lactic acidosis. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the hyperlactatemia observed during asthma attacks is due in part to the administration of high doses of β2-agonists. Salmeterol overdose by inhalation appears to be sufficient to cause lactic acidosis.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119778>Angiotensin-(1-7) Mas-receptor deficiency decreases peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression in adipocytes.</a></h2><p>The renin-angiotensin system is an important link between  and cardiovascular diseases. Besides angiotensin II, other angiotensin peptides such as angiotensin-(1-7), have important biological activities. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-(1-7), acting through the G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the Mas protooncogene have important actions on the cardiovascular system. However, the role of angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas axis in lipidic profile is not well established. In the present study, the adipocyte metabolism was investigated in wild type and FVB/N Mas-deficient male mice. The gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the amount of fatty acid synthase protein were reduced in the Mas-knockout mice. Serum nonesterified fatty acids of Mas-knockout showed a 50% increase in relation to wild type group. Basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was similar between the groups, however, a significant decrease of the glycerol release (lipolytic index) in response to insulin was observed in wild type animals, while no effect of the insulin action was observed in a Mas-knockout group. The data suggest that the lack of angiotensin-(1-7) action through Mas receptor alters the response of adipocytes to insulin action. These effects might be related to decreased expression of PPARγ.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the impact of PVAT on phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction in the aorta of obese Zucker rats (OZR) and their lean littermates (LZR) by comparing aortic rings with or without PVAT. Subsequently we placed OZR and LZR on a control (C) or an 8% wild blueberry (WB) diet and evaluated the effect of WB consumption on such response. PVAT-released adipokine concentrations were also measured as a function of WB diet. Maximal constrictor force (Fmax) in aortic rings without PVAT was significantly lower in OZR-C compared with LZR-C (0.41 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.06 g, respectively). Following WB diet, Fmax significantly increased in OZR (0.54 ± 0.06 g). In aortas with intact PVAT, Fmax was significantly lower in all groups (0.31 ± 0.06 OZR-C, 0.30 ± 0.05 OZR-WB, 0.29 ± 0.03 LZR-C, and 0.30 ± 0.04 g LZR-WB), but no difference was observed between treatments. PVAT concentrations of monocyte chemoactractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and adiponectin were significantly higher in OZR compared with LZR (+102%, +108%, and +45%, respectively). Following WB diet, PVAT concentrations of interleukin-8 were significantly lower in both OZR (-37%) and LZR (-30%), while adiponectin concentrations significantly increased in both OZR (+11%) and LZR (+16%). MCP-1 concentrations significantly decreased (-31%) in the PVAT of OZR with the WB diet.

We used K5.hTGF-β1 transgenic mice, which exhibit an inflammatory skin disorder and molecular and cytokine abnormalities with strong similarities to human psoriasis, to study the pathogenic role of PAF. We found that injecting PAF into the skin of transgenic mice led to inflammation and accelerated manifestation of the psoriatic phenotype by a local effect. In contrast, injecting mice with PAF receptor antagonist PCA-4248 lowered the PAF level (most likely by depressing an autocrine loop) and neutrophil, CD68(+) cell (monocyte/macrophage), and CD3(+) T-cell accumulation in the skin and blocked progression of the psoriasis-like phenotype. This effect of PAF blockade was specific and similar to that of psoralen-UV-A and was paralleled by a decrease in abnormally elevated mRNA and/or protein levels of T-helper type 17 cell-related cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23, IL-12A, and IL-6 and its transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. In contrast, PCA-4248 treatment up-regulated mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-10 in dorsal skin and release of IL-10 in serum and skin. Interfering with PAF may offer the opportunity to develop novel therapeutic strategies for inflammatory psoriasis and associated comorbidities, including  and atherosclerosis, in which the IL-17 axis may be involved.Copyright © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The liver is important for both xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. However, the responses of an injured liver to subsequent environmental insults has not been investigated. The current study aims to evaluate the role of a compromised liver in PCB-induced toxicity and define the implications on overall body homeostasis. Male C57Bl/6 mice were fed either an amino acid control diet (CD) or a methionine-choline deficient diet (MCD) during the 12-week study. Mice were subsequently exposed to either PCB126 (4.9mg/kg) or the PCB mixture, Arcolor1260 (20mg/kg) and analyzed for inflammatory, calorimetry and  parameters. Consistent with the literature, MCD diet-fed mice demonstrated steatosis, indicative of a compromised liver. Mice fed the MCD-diet and subsequently exposed to PCB126 showed observable wasting  leading to mortality. PCB126 and Aroclor1260 exposure worsened hepatic fibrosis exhibited by the MCD groups. Interestingly, PCB126 but not Aroclor1260 induced steatosis and inflammation in CD-fed mice. Mice with liver injury and subsequently exposed to PCBs also manifested  disturbances due to alterations in hepatic gene expression. Furthermore, PCB exposure in MCD-fed mice led to extra-hepatic toxicity such as upregulated circulating inflammatory biomarkers, implicating endothelial cell dysfunction. Taken together, these results indicate that environmental pollution can exacerbate toxicity caused by diet-induced liver injury which may be partially due to dysfunctional energy homeostasis. This is relevant to PCB-exposed human cohorts who suffer from alcohol or diet-induced fatty liver diseases.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Choline is required for the synthesis of the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) and for betaine, an important osmoregulator. Here, choline transport, lipid homeostasis, and mitochondria function were analyzed in skin fibroblasts from POTS and compared with control cells. The choline transporter-like protein 1/solute carrier 44A1 (CTL1/SLC44A1) and mRNA expression were 2-3 times lower in POTS fibroblasts, and choline uptake was reduced 60% (P < 0.05). Disturbances of membrane homeostasis were observed by reduced ratios between PC:phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin:cholesterol, as well as by modified phospholipid fatty acid composition. Choline deficiency also impaired mitochondria function, which was observed by a reduction in oxygen consumption, mitochondrial potential, and glycolytic activity. When POTS cells were treated with choline, transporter was up-regulated, and uptake of choline increased, offering an option for patient treatment.

NE receptors are present in nearly all, if not all, organs of the body, which may allow this molecule to play a role in a variety of disease processes. This paper examines the hypothesis elevated NE signaling, through genetics and/or environmental factors, is an etiological factor in a variety of diseases outside of the brain, including age-related macular degeneration, systemic lupus erythematosus, atrial fibrillation, and . Lines of evidence presented to assess the hypothesis include: (1) studies of noradrenergic drugs modulating the four diseases; (2) association of these diseases with bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, where the latter three conditions may involve elevated NE signaling; and (3) association with psychological stress, since NE is released in response to stress. Many of the studies cited tend to support the hypothesis, or are at least consistent with it. If the hypothesis is correct, perhaps a large number of individuals would benefit from chronically taking drugs that systemically diminish noradrenergic signaling, thereby helping prevent or treat a wide variety of diseases.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Twelve hour fasting blood samples, taken at the initiation and on the third month of therapy, were analyzed for the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite+nitrate (NOx), and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD). No patient presented additional risk factors for increased reactive oxygen species levels.Compared with sixteen control participants, patients with CSX had significantly higher activity of MPO and levels of MDA, but significantly lower SOD activity and levels of NOx before treatment. After treatment, MPO activity and MDA levels were significantly reduced; SOD activity and NOx levels were significantly increased with nebivolol but remained unchanged with metoprolol.We have shown that patients with CSX who taken nebivolol have lower serum MPO activity, levels of MDA and higher serum SOD activity, NOx levels when compared with metoprolol treatment. Exercise stress test parameters were also ameliorated in patients who had taken nebivolol in contrast to metoprolol. Nebivolol treatment may be a novel treatment strategy in cases with CSX in the future.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28635127>Cardiovascular risk score is linked to subcutaneous adipocyte size and lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>Although white adipose tissue mass and distribution correlates with cardiovascular disease, the fat cell-specific perturbations underlying this association are not known. We determined the relationship between adipocyte size and lipid metabolism with cardiovascular risk.Adipocyte size as well as spontaneous (basal) and hormone-stimulated effects on adipocyte lipid metabolism (lipolysis and lipogenesis) were investigated in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of 304 men and 775 women. Subjects were classified into five categories according to Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII)  criteria.Adipocyte size increased with increasing ATPIII score (P < 0.0001). For lipolysis, there was a gradual increase in basal and catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis and a decrease in insulin-mediated inhibition of stimulated lipolysis with ATPIII (P < 0.0001). In contrast, the lipolytic action of atrial natriuretic peptide was similar between ATPIII classes. Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis decreased with increasing score (P < 0.0001). Circulating free fatty acid levels were 50% higher in the top risk category (4-5) compared with the lowest score (P < 0.0001). Fat cell size correlated positively with increasing ATPIII score and lipolysis but negatively with lipogenesis. All these differences were independent of age, sex and body weight status (P < 0.0001 to 0.02 after correction). When all functional measures were put together, maximum insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, insulin-antilipolytic sensitivity and basal lipolysis together explained about 20% in the variation of ATPIII in score.Independently of sex, age and body weight status, a high cardiovascular risk score associates with increased circulating free fatty acid levels and hormone-specific alterations of lipolysis/lipogenesis in enlarged subcutaneous fat cells.© 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297845>Inflammasome-mediated dysbiosis regulates progression of NAFLD and obesity.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of  and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of  via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple -associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and  disorders.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18609565>Correlation study of optimized voxel-based morphometry and (1)H MRS in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis.</a></h2><p>: To assess whether structural and  brain abnormalities are correlated in MTLE/HS .: Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter concentration (GMC) and gray matter volume (GMV) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements from both-sided hippocampal and thalamic regions were performed in 20 MTLE/HS patients and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls.

The present study analyzed a model of diet-induced obesity in mice lacking the TLR4/TLR2 co-receptor CD14.Six-week-old male mice lacking CD14 (n = 16) were allocated to either a control diet or a high-fat high-simple carbohydrate diet (5.4 kcal/g; 35% fat; 35% sucrose), and compared with C57BL/6 (WT; n = 15) controls. After 12 weeks, body composition, basal sympathetic activity, non-invasive blood pressure and glucose tolerance were evaluated. Hepatic and adipose tissues were collected for mRNA quantification, histology and LPS incubation.In both WT and CD14 knockout mice, obesity was accompanied by TLR2 and TLR4 upregulation. However, obese mice lacking CD14 presented decreased lipid and macrophage content in hepatic and adipose tissues, lower urinary levels of noradrenaline, decreased systolic blood pressure, reduced fasting plasma glucose and blunted glucose intolerance, compared with obese WT group. In the presence of exogenous sCD14, adipose tissue incubation with LPS-induced TLR2 and TNF-alpha upregulation in both WT and CD14 knockout obese mice.In our model of diet-induced obesity, mice lacking CD14 showed lower adiposity and hepatic steatosis, improved glucose homeostasis, blunted sympathetic overactivity and reduced blood pressure elevation. This was observed in the presence of preserved TLR4 and TLR2 gene expression, and intact TLR4 signaling pathways.

The obese Zucker rat (OZR) model of the  exhibits myriad vascular impairments, although their integrated impact on functional hyperaemia remains unclear. In this study, arterial pressor responses and skeletal muscle perfusion were assessed in lean Zucker rats (LZRs) and OZRs during adrenergic stimulation (phenylephrine), challenge with thromboxane (U46619) and endothelium-dependent dilatation (methacholine). The OZRs were hypertensive compared with the LZRs, but this was abolished by adrenoreceptor blockade (phentolamine); pressor responses to U46619 were similar between strains and were abolished by blockade with the prostaglandin H(2)/thromboxane A(2) receptor antagonist, SQ-29548. Depressor reactivity to methacholine was impaired in OZRs, but was improved by antioxidant treatment (TEMPOL). Across levels of  demand, blood flow to in situ gastrocnemius muscle was restrained by adrenergic constriction in OZRs, although this diminished with increased demand. Oxygen extraction, reduced in OZRs compared with LZRs across levels of  demand, was improved by TEMPOL or SQ-29548; treatment with phentolamine did not impact extraction, and neither TEMPOL nor SQ-29548 improved muscle blood flow in OZRs. While oxygen uptake and muscle performance were consistently reduced in OZRs versus LZRs, treatment with all three agents improved outcomes, while treatment with individual agents was less effective. These results suggest that contributions of vascular dysfunction to perfusion, oxygen uptake and muscle performance are spatially distinct, with adrenergic constriction impacting proximal resistance and endothelial dysfunction impacting distal microvessel-tissue exchange. Further, these data suggest that increasing skeletal muscle blood flow in OZRs is not sufficient to improve performance, unless distal perfusion inhomogeneities are rectified.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28408641>Gastroparesis and lipid metabolism-associated dysbiosis in Wistar-Kyoto rats.</a></h2><p>Altered gastric accommodation and intestinal morphology suggest impaired gastrointestinal (GI) transit may occur in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain, as common in stress-associated functional GI disorders. Because changes in GI transit can alter microbiota composition, we investigated whether these are altered in WKY rats compared with the resilient Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats under basal conditions and characterized plasma lipid and metabolite differences. Bead transit was tracked by X-ray imaging to monitor gastric emptying (4 h), small intestine (SI) transit (9 h), and large intestine transit (12 h). Plasma extracts were analyzed by lipid and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cecal microbial composition was determined by Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis using the QIIME pipeline. Stomach retention of beads was 77% for WKY compared with 35% for SD rats. GI transit was decreased by 34% (9 h) and 21% (12 h) in WKY compared with SD rats. Excluding stomach retention, transiting beads moved 29% further along the SI over 4-9 h for WKY compared with SD rats. Cecal , , and unclassified  genera were less abundant in WKY rats, whereas the minor taxa , , and  were higher. Diglycerides, triglycerides, phosphatidyl-, and phosphatidylserine were lower in WKY rats, whereas cholesterol esters and taurocholic acids were higher. The unexpected WKY rat phenotype of delayed gastric emptying, yet rapid SI transit, was associated with altered lipid and metabolite profiles. The delayed gastric emptying of the WKY phenotype suggests this rat strain may be useful as a model for gastroparesis. This study reveals that the stress-prone Wistar-Kyoto rat strain has a baseline physiology of gastroparesis and rapid small intestine transit, together with  changes consistent with lipid metabolism-associated dysbiosis, compared with nonstress-prone rats.

Heart function ex vivo in MS group showed a decreased mechanical performance response to isoproterenol challenge (ISO). Importantly, MS hearts under ISO showed nearly twofold the incidence of ventricular fibrillation. Healthy rat cardiomyocytes exposed to MS group serum displayed impaired contractile function and Ca handling during ISO treatment, showing slightly decreased cell shortening and Ca transient amplitude (23%), slower cytosolic calcium removal (17%), and more frequent spontaneous Ca release events (7.5-fold).

To date, none of the recent pertaining reports provide deep understanding of the SCO2 disease pathophysiology. To investigate the cardiac pathology of the disease, we were the first to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from SCO2-mutated patients. For iPSC generation, we reprogrammed skin fibroblasts from two SCO2 patients and healthy controls. The first patient was a compound heterozygote to the common E140K mutation, and the second was homozygote for the less common G193S mutation. iPSC were differentiated into cardiomyocytes through embryoid body (EB) formation. To test the hypothesis that the SCO2 mutation is associated with mitochondrial abnormalities, and intracellular Ca -overload resulting in functional derangements and arrhythmias, we investigated in SCO2-mutated iPSC-CMs (compared to control cardiomyocytes): (i) the ultrastructural changes; (ii) the inotropic responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation, increased [Ca ] and angiotensin-II (AT-II); and (iii) the Beat Rate Variability (BRV) characteristics. In support of the hypothesis, we found in the mutated iPSC-CMs major ultrastructural abnormalities and markedly attenuated response to the inotropic interventions and caffeine, as well as delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and increased BRV, suggesting impaired SR Ca handling due to attenuated SERCA activity caused by ATP shortage.

The unique hallmark of SIC is extensive ventricular dysfunction (akinesia) involving apical segments with preserved function in basal segments. Adrenergic overstimulation plays an important role in initiating SIC, but the pathomechanisms involved are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that excessive catecholamines cause perturbation of myocardial lipid metabolism and that cardiac lipotoxicity is responsible for the pathogenesis of SIC.A single dose injection of isoprenaline (ISO; 400 mg/kg) induced SIC-like regional akinesia in mice. Oil red O staining revealed severe lipid accumulation in the heart 2 h post-ISO. Both intramyocardial lipid accumulation and cardiac function were normalized within 1 week post-ISO and no significant amount of fibrosis was detected. We found that gene expression of lipid importers and exporters (ApoB lipoprotein) was depressed 2 h post-ISO. These results were confirmed by similar findings in SIC patients and in ISO/patient serum-stressed HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Moreover, overexpression of ApoB in the heart was found to protect against the development of ISO-induced cardiac toxicity and cardiac dysfunction. We also found that ISO-induced intramyocardial lipid accumulation caused electrophysiological disturbance and stunning in ISO/patient serum-stressed HL-1 cardiomyocytes.The present study demonstrates that lipotoxicity is closely associated with catecholamine-induced myocardial dysfunction, including neurogenic stunning,  stunning, and electrophysiological stunning. Cardiac lipotoxicity may originate from direct inhibition of myocardial ApoB lipoprotein and subsequent decreased lipid export, caused by supraphysiological levels of catecholamines.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487891>Enzymatic measurement of ether phospholipids in human plasma after hydrolysis of plasma with phospholipase A.</a></h2><p> ether phospholipids (ePE) and choline ether phospholipid (ePC) are present in human serum or plasma.

Therefore, need for assay of ether phospholipids in plasma may increase in the future. Nowadays, measurement of the ether phospholipids in human plasma seem to depend on tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), but a system for LC/MS/MS is too expensive for most of ordinary clinical laboratories, moreover, use and maintenance of the system are time consuming.Phospholipase A (PLA1) hydrolyzes ester (acyl) bond at the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipids, but it does not act on ether bond at the sn-1 position. We confirmed by a HPLC method that treatment of plasma with PLA1 causes complete disappearance of all diacyl phospholipids, but ether phospholipids remain intact. On the basis of these observations, we developed an enzymatic assay method for ePE and ePC in human plasma by use of a fluorescence plate reader.The amount of ePE in human plasma measured by the enzymatic method was well correlated to that by LC/ESI-MS method (R > 0.94), but the correlation of ePC between the two methods was bit poorer (R > 0.77) than that of ePE.The enzymatic method may be applied to assay of ether phospholipids (ePE and ePC) not only in human plasma but also to assay of ePE and ePC in the other tissues.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26881746>Hepatoprotective Effect and Synergism of Bisdemethoycurcumin against MCD Diet-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Mice.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the , has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease over the last decade in developed countries.

While the rich bioavailability research of curcumin, BDMC is the poor studies. We investigated whether BDMC has the hepatoprotective effect and combinatory preventive effect with silymarin on methionine choline deficient (MCD)-diet-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups of normal (normal diet without any treatment), MCD diet (MCD diet only), MCD + silymarin (SIL) 100 mg/kg group, MCD + BDMC 100 mg/kg group, MCD + SIL 50 mg/kg + BDMC 50 mg/kg group. Body weight, liver weight, liver function tests, histological changes were assessed and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were conducted after 4 weeks. Mice lost body weight on the MCD-diet, but BDMC did not lose less than the MCD-diet group. Liver weights decreased from BDMC, but they increased significantly in the MCD-diet groups. All liver function test values decreased from the MCD-diet, whereas those from the BDMC increased significantly. The MCD- diet induced severe hepatic fatty accumulation, but the fatty change was reduced in the BDMC. The BDMC showed an inhibitory effect on liver lipogenesis by reducing associated gene expression caused by the MCD-diet. In all experiments, the combinations of BDMC with SIL had a synergistic effect against MCD-diet models. In conclusion, our findings indicate that BDMC has a potential suppressive effect on NAFLD.

In this study, we demonstrated that inflamed dysfunctional adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cholesterol-induced NMS. Control (C), high cholesterol (HC) and HC with 10% fructose in drinking water (HCF) diets were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the body weights of the C- and HC-fed rats were comparable, but the weights of the HCF-fed rats were relatively low. Cholesterol caused  problems such as high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia and hypoinsulinemia. The HCF-fed rats exhibited whole-body insulin resistance with low circulating high-density lipoprotein levels. Increases in the tumor necrosis factor α level in the plasma, the number of CD68+ macrophages and the free nuclear factor-κB level in gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) resulted in local inflammation, which appeared as inflamed dysfunctional gWAT. Reduced superoxide dismutases (SODs) deteriorate natural antioxidant defense systems and induce reactive oxygen species in gWAT. Dysregulation of plasma levels of catecholamine, adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin in cholesterol-induced inflamed adipose tissue contributed to increased lipolysis and increased circulating nonesterified fatty acids. Cholesterol activated inflammation, lipolysis and cell death in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, Chol-3T3-CM reduced the population of M2-type Raw264.7 macrophages, indicating that the macrophage polarization is mediated by cholesterol.

In addition, associations of several  complications like insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia and psychological co-morbidities are well known in PCOS. One of the major factors influencing mood and the emotional state of mind is neurotransmitters. Also, these neurotransmitters are very crucial for GnRH release. Hence, the current study investigates the status of neurotransmitters in PCOS.A PCOS rat model was developed using testosterone. Twenty-one-day-old rats were subcutaneously injected with 10 mg/kg body weight of testosterone propionate (TP) for 35 days. The animals were validated for PCOS characteristics by monitoring estrus cyclicity, serum testosterone and estradiol levels and by histological examination of ovarian sections. Neurotransmitter estimation was carried out using fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods.TP-treated animals demonstrated increased serum testosterone levels with unaltered estradiol content, disturbed estrus cyclicity and many peripheral cysts in the ovary compared to control rats mimicking human PCOS. Norepinephrine (NE), dopamine, serotonin, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and epinephrine levels were significantly low in TP-induced PCOS rats compared to control ones, whereas the activity of acetylcholinesterase in the PCOS brain was markedly elevated.Neurotransmitter alteration could be one of the reasons for disturbed gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, consequently directing the ovarian dysfunction in PCOS.

Obesity is characterized by the increase of body fat and an excess of total body fat and, in particular, visceral fat accumulation, is considered to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. To determine whether the malfunction of the mesenteric adipose tissue plays an important role in the diabetic related , in this study, lipolysis and gene expression in the subcutaneous, omental and mesenteric adipose tissue of the diabetic subjects were evaluated.Lipolysis and real time PCR were utilized to determine adipocyte function.Basal adipose tissue glycerol release is higher in diabetics than that of the non diabetics in all three fat depots. Isoproterenol (ISO) significantly increases glycerol release in subcutaneous, omental and mesenteric adipose tissues of non diabetic subjects but it stimulated glycerol release was significantly impaired in all three fat depots of the diabetic subjects. Gene expression studies indicate that leptin, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), Fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) and 11beta-hydroysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) gene expression were significantly up regulated in the mesenteric adipose tissue of the diabetic patients.Human mesenteric adipose tissue in obese diabetic subjects has high basal glycerol release and impaired isoproterenol stimulated glycerol release.

Nephrotic  (NS) is a nonspecific kidney disorder, which is mostly represented by minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). Since urine metabolites may mirror disease-specific functional perturbations in kidney injury, we examined urine samples for distinctive  changes to identify biomarkers for clinical applications. We developed unbiased multi-component covarianced models from a discovery set with 48 samples (12 healthy controls, 12 MCD, 12 FSGS, and 12 MGN). To extensively validate their diagnostic potential, new batch from 54 patients with primary NS were independently examined a year after. In the independent validation set, the model including citric acid, pyruvic acid, fructose, , and cysteine effectively discriminated each NS using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis except MCD-MGN comparison; nonetheless an additional metabolite multi-composite greatly improved the discrimination power between MCD and MGN. Finally, we proposed the re-constructed  network distinctively dysregulated by the different NSs that may deepen comprehensive understanding of the disease mechanistic, and help the enhanced identification of NS and therapeutic plans for future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, some obese subjects with autonomic imbalance present a dissociation between sympathetic activity-mediated vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Here, we aimed to determine in a rat model of  whether the endothelium endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-NO pathway contributes to counteract the vasopressor effect of the sympathetic system. Rats were fed a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet for 15 wk. Sympathovagal balance was evaluated by spectral analysis of heart rate variability and plasmatic catecholamine measurements. Blood pressure was measured in the presence or absence of N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit the contribution of eNOS. Vascular reactivity was assessed on isolated aortic rings in response to α-adrenergic agonist. The HFS diet increased sympathetic tone, which is characterized by a higher low on the high-frequency spectral power ratio and a higher plasmatic concentration of epinephrine. Despite this, no change in blood pressure was observed. Interestingly, HFS rats exhibited vascular hyporeactivity (-23.6%) to α-adrenergic receptor stimulation that was abolished by endothelial removal or eNOS inhibition (l-NAME). In addition, eNOS phosphorylation (Ser) was increased in response to phenylephrine in HFS rats only. Accordingly, eNOS inhibition in vivo revealed higher blood pressure in HFS rats compared with control rats (147 vs. 126 mmHg for mean blood pressure, respectively). Restrain of adrenergic vasopressor action by endothelium eNOS is increased in HFS rats and contributes to maintained blood pressure in the physiological range. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite the fact that prohypertensive sympathetic nervous system activity is markedly increased in rats with early , they present with normal blood pressure. These observations appear to be explained by increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase response to adrenergic stimulation, which results in vascular hyporeactivity to α-adrenergic stimulation, and therefore blood pressure is preserved in the physiological range.

Neurological examination showed an isolated tetra pyramidal . The cerebral MRI showed a bilateral brain lesion involving the basal ganglia, optic pathways, temporal lobes, and the midbrain. Serial MRSs showed a decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine ratio and increased choline/creatine ratio. An increase in the myoinositol (MYO)/creatine ratio and the presence of a lipid/lactate peak were also recorded. A neuroimaging follow-up with MRI and MRS performed 2 years later showed similar findings.We describe an MRS study of a brain tumor in a patient with segmental NF-1 for the first time. The MRS study showed similar findings, described earlier in rare studies of patients with the classic form of NF-1.

The median SAM/SAH ratio was lower in DS and that of methionine and reduced glutathione did not differ significantly between the groups. The mathematical model showed that enhanced methionine turnover and accelerated Hcy-remethylation might explain the shift in the methylation cycle in DS.In addition to the DS-related excess of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) activity, increases in the activities of MS and betaine homocysteine methyl transferase, and in methionine input were necessary to account for the changes in metabolite levels observed in DS.

Fat biopsies were obtained from 48 nondiabetic subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Lipolysis rate was measured as glycerol release from isolated cells and proteins involved in lipolysis regulation were assessed by immunoblots. Fasting blood samples were obtained and  and inflammatory variables were analyzed. In women, the rate of 8-bromo-cAMP- and isoprenaline-stimulated lipolysis was approximately 2- and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, in subcutaneous compared to omental adipocytes, whereas there was no difference between the two depots in men. Dexamethasone treatment increased the ability of 8-bromo-cAMP to stimulate lipolysis in the subcutaneous depot in women, but had no consistent effects in fat cells from men. Protein kinase A, Perilipin A, and hormone sensitive lipase content in adipocytes was not affected by adipose depot, sex, or glucocorticoid treatment. In conclusion, catecholamine and glucocorticoid regulation of lipolysis in isolated human adipocytes differs between adipose tissue depots and also between sexes.

Cardiovascular and  disorders, the most prevalent clinical challenges worldwide, are epidemiologically linked to poor nutritional habits throughout life. We aimed to understand whether postnatal overnutrition (PO) initiated during lactation affects  markers and vascular function later in life. To test this hypothetical effect, we studied a PO Wistar rat model based on adjusting litter size at the third day of age to three pups and eight for the control group (C). Systemic parameters such as body weight and food intake were significantly increased in adult rats, measured up to 36 weeks. Moreover, fat mass, triglycerides, insulin and systolic blood pressure were all significantly increased in the PO group. Furthermore, we assessed whether these alterations would affect morphological and functional parameters in isolated vessels. Consistent with systemic alterations of the vasculature, contraction of thoracic aortic rings, determined by dose-response curves to norepinephrine (NE), was significantly reduced in PO rats. Histological stains revealed that the relative area of collagen was higher and the elastic fiber density was lower in the distal rings of PO rats.

Enhanced contractility of penile erectile tissue has been associated with augmented activity of the RhoA/Rho kinase (RhoK) pathway in models of diabetes-associated ED. The present study assessed whether abnormal vasoconstriction in penile arteries from prediabetic obese Zucker rats (OZRs) is due to changes in the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and/or in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Penile arteries from OZRs and lean Zucker rats (LZRs) were mounted on microvascular myographs for simultaneous measurements of [Ca(2+)](i) and tension. The relationships between [Ca(2+)](i) and contraction for the α(1)-adrenergic vasoconstrictor phenylephrine (PE) were left shifted and steeper in OZRs compared with LZRs, although the magnitude of the contraction was similar in both groups. In contrast, the vasoconstriction induced by the thromboxane A(2) receptor agonist U-46619 was augmented in arteries from OZRs, and this increase was associated with an increase in both the sensitivity and maximum responses to Ca(2+). The RhoK inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μM) reduced the vasoconstriction induced by PE to a greater extent in OZRs than in LZRs, without altering Ca(2+). Y-27632 inhibited with a greater potency the contraction elicited by high KCl in arteries from OZRs compared with LZRs without changing [Ca(2+)](i). RhoK-II expression was augmented in arteries from OZRs. These results suggest receptor-specific changes in the Ca(2+) handling of penile arteries under conditions of . Whereas augmented vasoconstriction upon activation of the thromboxane A(2) receptor is coupled to enhanced Ca(2+) entry, a RhoK-mediated enhancement of myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity is coupled with the α(1)-adrenergic vasoconstriction in penile arteries from OZRs.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571428>Nebivolol lowers blood pressure and increases weight loss in patients with hypertension and diabetes in regard to age.</a></h2><p>In patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and arterial hypertension, the control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure is essential to reduce the risk of adverse events.

In regard to age, the most significant reduction in blood pressure over the 12-week treatment period was observed in the group of patients below the age of 40. With advancing age, there was a decline in the reduction of systolic blood pressure induced by nebivolol. This effect was more evident among the decennial age groups in respect to diastolic blood pressure. In addition, we found weight reduction to be age dependent. Body weight was significantly more reduced in men compared with women.Nebivolol is effective in treating patients with diabetes suffering from high blood pressure and .

Despite clinical aspects have been well-characterized, neurometabolic profiling in the brain of AS remains to be clear. The present study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to investigate whether pediatric AS is associated with measurable neurometabolic abnormalities that can contribute new information on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder.Study participants consisted of 34 children with AS (2-12 years old; mean age 5.2 (±2.0); 28 boys) and 19 typically developed children (2-11 years old; mean age 5.6 (±2.6); 12 boys) who served as the normal control group.

The psychosocial impact of trimethylaminuria can be considerable. However, trimethylaminuria is difficult to diagnose without specialized tests, in part because odor production is diet-dependent, and malodors may not be present during medical examinations. Thus, the prevalence and demographics of trimethylaminuria remain unclear.We tested 353 patients who had unexplained (idiopathic) malodor production for trimethylaminuria using a standard choline challenge. We also collected basic demographic information.Approximately one third of patients (118) tested positive for trimethylaminuria. Consistent with previous reports, women, particularly African American women, were significantly overrepresented among trimethylaminuria-positive patients. Of note, the same pattern was seen among trimethylaminuria-negative patients. Also consistent with previous reports, trimethylaminuria-positive women who were still menstruating tended to produce higher levels of trimethylamine within ± 7 days of menses, although this trend was statistically marginal (P = .07).If our patient sample is representative of patients with idiopathic malodor, demographic information (race and gender) may not be useful in a differential diagnosis of trimethylaminuria. However, undiagnosed cases of trimethylaminuria may be fairly common among patients with idiopathic malodor. If so, choline challenge testing should be indicated for all such patients because trimethylaminuria is responsive to dietary and other treatments.

However, whether alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamine and substantially promote adaptive thermogenesis in adipose tissue remains controversial. Here, we show that tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH), a rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis, was expressed and phosphorylated in adipose-resident macrophages. In addition, the plasma level of adrenaline was increased by cold stress in mice, and treatment of macrophages with adrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and TyrH. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII or PKA signaling diminished adrenaline-induced phosphorylation of TyrH in primary macrophages. Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII upregulated basal TyrH phosphorylation, while suppressing the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on TyrH in macrophages. Myeloid-specific disruption of CaMKIIγ suppressed both the cold-induced production of norepinephrine and adipose UCP1 expression in vivo and the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on macrophage-dependent activation of brown adipocytes in vitro. Lack of CaMKII signaling attenuated catecholamine production mediated by cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key inducers of type 2 immune response in primary macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest a feedforward mechanism of adrenaline in adipose-resident macrophages, and that myeloid CaMKII signaling plays an important role in catecholamine production and subsequent beige fat activation.© The Author (2017).

Combination therapy of losartan and pioglitazone reduced BP more than either monotherapy, and showed additive effects on improving endothelial dysfunction and abolishing the increased vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II. These synergistic effects were associated with further reductions in protein expression of p47(phox) and AT1, NADPH oxidase activity, and nitrotyrosine level.Our data indicate that combined treatment exerts more beneficial effects on lowering BP and improving vascular lesions.© The Author(s) 2013.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18177478>Alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is not involved in impaired functional vasodilation in the obese Zucker rat.</a></h2><p>1. Obesity/ is associated with augmented a-adrenoceptor sensitivity and impaired hyperaemic responses to exercise. Thus, it is possible that this elevated a-adrenoceptor constriction contributes to the blunted hyperaemic response. 2. Male lean and obese Zucker rats were instrumented for acute measurements of blood pressure (BP) and iliac blood flow (BF). Changes in BP and BF were determined in anaesthetized animals in response to intravenous administration of increasing doses of the a(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE). Once BF and BP returned to normal, a single bolus of the a-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (0.5 mg) was administered. In separate animals, the spinotrapezius muscle was exteriorized for direct in situ observation of the microcirculation in response to phentolamine and muscle contraction. 3. Administration of PE demonstrated that iliac BF is highly autoregulated in the face of increasing perfusion pressure. Iliac conductance following phentolamine was significantly greater in obese rats. Following phentolamine administration, iliac vascular conductance was significantly greater in obese rats compared with lean animals. However, a-adrenoceptor blockade did not significantly alter arteriolar diameter in the spinotrapezius muscle during muscle contraction in either lean or obese animals. 4. These results suggest a greater contribution of the a-adrenoceptors in basal hindlimb vascular tone in obese rats. Furthermore, an augmented a-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction may not contribute to the impaired functional dilation in anaesthetized obese rats.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18089956>Endocannabinoids and related N-acylethanolamines in the control of appetite and energy metabolism: emergence of new molecular players.</a></h2><p>Endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylgycerol) and related N-acylethanolamines (N-oleoylethanolamine) exhibit opposite effects in the control of appetite. The purpose of this review is to highlight the similarities and differences of three major lipid-signaling molecules by focusing on their mode of action and the proteins involved in the control of food intake and energy metabolism.Anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol promote food intake and are the main endogenous ligands of the cannabinoid receptors. One of them, the cannabinoid receptor 1, is responsible for the control of food intake and energy expenditure both at a central and a peripheral level, affecting numerous anorexigenic and orexigenic mediators (leptin, neuropeptide Y, ghrelin, orexin, endogenous opioids, corticotropin-releasing hormone, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript). In the gut, N-oleoylethanolamine plays an opposite role in food regulation, by interacting with two molecular targets different from the cannabinoid receptors: the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and a G-protein coupled receptor GPR119.Recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the promotion of food intake or, in contrast, the suppression of food intake by anandamide and N-oleoylethanolamine, are summarized. Potential strategies for treating overweight, , and type II diabetes are briefly outlined.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27042260>Effect of Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester on Vascular Damage Caused by Consumption of High Fructose Corn Syrup in Rats.</a></h2><p>Fructose corn syrup is cheap sweetener and prolongs the shelf life of products, but fructose intake causes hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. All of them are referred to as  and they are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Hence, the harmful effects of increased fructose intake on health and their prevention should take greater consideration. Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE) has beneficial effects on  and vascular function which is important in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, there are no known studies about the effect of CAPE on fructose-induced vascular dysfunction. In this study, we examined the effect of CAPE on vascular dysfunction due to high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). HFCS (6 weeks, 30% fed with drinking water) caused vascular dysfunction, but treatment with CAPE (50 micromol/kg i.p. for the last two weeks) effectively restored this problem. Additionally, hypertension in HFCS-fed rats was also decreased in CAPE supplemented rats. CAPE supplements lowered HFCS consumption-induced raise in blood glucose, homocysteine, and cholesterol levels. The aorta tissue endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) production was decreased in rats given HFCS and in contrast CAPE supplementation efficiently increased its production. The presented results showed that HFCS-induced cardiovascular abnormalities could be prevented by CAPE treatment.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073300>Association of Oral Contraceptives With Drug-Induced QT Interval Prolongation in Healthy Nonmenopausal Women.</a></h2><p>Women are at higher risk of drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) than men. Androgens are protective. Influence of oral contraception on drug-induced TdP and QT prolongation is controversial.To determine if the extent of sotalol-induced corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and specific T-wave morphological changes, which are biomarkers for the risk of drug-induced TdP, differ in patients according to the androgenic activity of the type of oral contraceptive (OCs) they take compared with patients who took no pills.A cohort of 498 healthy, nonmenopausal women received 80 mg of oral sotalol, a drug with known risk of drug-induced TdP, during this study in a clinical investigation center. The participants also took either no oral contraception or received OCs with different types of progestin: levonorgestrel (which has high androgenic potency), desogestrel or gestodene (which has intermediate androgenic potency), or drospirenone (which has antiandrogenic properties). Women were enrolled from February 2008 to February 2012, and data analysis took place from September 2014 to May 2018.Electrocardiographic changes 3 hours after sotalol administration.A total of 137 women received levonorgestrel, 41 received desogestrel, 51 received gestodene, and 62 received drospirenone; another 207 received no OCs. Baseline QTc duration, plasma sotalol levels, and potassium levels did not significantly differ among groups. However, 3 hours after sotalol exposure, QTc prolongation was greater in women taking drospirenone (mean [SD] increase, 31.2 [12.6] milliseconds from baseline) than in women taking no OCs (mean [SD] increase, 24.6 [12.5] milliseconds; P = .005) or those taking levonorgestrel (mean [SD] increase, 24.2 [13.7] milliseconds; P = .005). The frequency of sotalol-induced T-wave alteration was higher in women taking drospirenone (n = 13 of 61 [21.0%]) than those taking levonorgestrel (n = 20 of 137 [14.6%]) or women taking no OCs (n = 24 of 207 [11.6%]; P = .01). Disproportionality analysis using the European pharmacovigilance database showed a higher reporting rate of OC-induced prolonged QT and ventricular arrhythmias in women taking drospirenone than levonorgestrel (drug-induced long QT : reporting odds ratio [ROR], 6.2 [95% CI, 1.3-30.8]; P = .01; ventricular arrhythmia: ROR, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.7-6.3]; P < .001).Contraceptive pills are associated with variable drug-induced alterations of ventricular repolarization in healthy nonmenopausal women. Drospirenone, an antiandrogenic pill, was associated with increased sotalol-induced QTc prolongation, although absolute QTc prolongation was modest. This finding was supported by the European pharmacovigilance database, which showed a higher reporting rate of suspected OC-induced ventricular arrhythmias on drospirenone compared with levonorgestrel. More data are required on whether antiandrogenic OCs lead to clinically significant adverse events in patients taking QTc-prolonging drugs.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23635962>Brain  changes suggestive of axonal damage in radiologically isolated .</a></h2><p>The MRI incidental finding in asymptomatic subjects of brain white matter (WM) changes meeting the Barkhof criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been recently characterized as the radiologically isolated  (RIS). This entity needs to be more specifically defined to allow risk stratification of these subjects. We used brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) to assess  changes in an RIS population.Twenty-three RIS subjects who were classified according to the Okuda Criteria underwent 1H-MRSI examination with a central brain (CB) volume of interest (VOI) to measure levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho) normalized to creatine (Cr) in the whole CB-VOI, in lesional/perilesional and normal-appearing WM regions, and in the cortical gray matter (CGM). The 1H-MRSI data were compared with those of 20 demographically matched healthy controls (HC).NAA/Cr levels were significantly lower in RIS than in HC in all regions (p < 0.005 for all). No differences in Cho/Cr levels were found in either brain region. A single-subject analysis showed that NAA/Cr levels were at least 2 SDs below the HC mean in the 44% of RIS in the normal-appearing WM and in the 61% of RIS in the CGM.Decreased brain NAA/Cr levels in a group of RIS subjects indicates that brain  abnormalities suggestive of axonal damage can be significant even at this early disease stage.

NS seems to be accompanied by cardiovascular alterations, since patients with NS present an increased incidence in cardiac disease. The aim of our work was to study the effects of HgCl(2)-induced NS on myocardial function and morphometry. Normotensive Brown-Norway rats were injected with HgCl(2) (1 mg/kg, HgCl(2) group; n = 6, subcutaneous) or the vehicle (control group; n = 6, subcutaneous) on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11. The animals were placed in  cages for evaluation of urinary excretion of noradrenaline, sodium, total proteins, albumin and creatinine. Fourteen and 21 days after the first HgCl(2) injection, left ventricle (LV) hemodynamics was evaluated through pressure micromanometers in basal and isovolumetric heartbeats. The heart and gastrocnemius muscle weights and tibial length were also examined. In an additional group of animals cardiac dimensions and ejection fraction were assessed by echocardiography and LV apoptosis and fibrosis were studied. HgCl(2)-injected rats presented proteinuria, albuminuria, hyperlipidemia, anemia, sodium retention and ascites at day 14. These alterations were accompanied by LV hemodynamic changes only in isovolumetric heartbeats. Similarly, on day 21, HgCl(2)-injected rats presented proteinuria, albuminuria, hyperlipidemia, anemia, but no sodium retention or ascites. These animals presented LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction in both basal and isovolumetric heartbeats, as well as cardiac atrophy, LV fibrosis and an increase in myocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, HgCl(2)-induced NS is accompanied by LV dysfunction and can be a promising model for studying the link between NS and cardiac disease.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25553245>Discrimination of sepsis stage  profiles with an LC/MS-MS-based metabolomics approach.</a></h2><p>To identify  biomarkers that can be used to differentiate sepsis from systemic inflammatory response  (SIRS), assess severity and predict outcomes.65 patients were involved in this study, including 35 patients with sepsis, 15 patients with SIRS and 15 normal patients.

Here we used constitutive and inducible mutagenesis to delete the nuclear transcription regulator Mecp2 in macrophages. Mice that lacked the gene encoding Mecp2, which is associated with Rett , in macrophages did not show signs of neurodevelopmental disorder but displayed spontaneous obesity, which was linked to impaired function of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Specifically, mutagenesis of a BAT-resident CxCr1 macrophage subpopulation compromised homeostatic thermogenesis but not acute, cold-induced thermogenesis. Mechanistically, malfunction of BAT in pre-obese mice with mutant macrophages was associated with diminished sympathetic innervation and local titers of norepinephrine, which resulted in lower expression of thermogenic factors by adipocytes. Mutant macrophages overexpressed the signaling receptor and ligand PlexinA4, which might contribute to the phenotype by repulsion of sympathetic axons expressing the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A. Collectively, we report a previously unappreciated homeostatic role for macrophages in the control of tissue innervation.

It is also unclear whether advanced fibrosis of steatohepatitis will regress when diet is controlled. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the resolution of fibrosis occurs in steatohepatitis induced by a methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD). Manifestation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in this model was also studied. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis was induced in rats by feeding them an MCDD for 10 weeks. Instead of MCDD, a methionine-choline control diet (CD) was given for the last 2 weeks to the experimental group. Fibrosis and inflammation were determined by tissue staining. Protein and gene expressions were determined by immunoblotting and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. Expressions of caspase-7, caspase-12, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and protein disulfide isomerase were evaluated to clarify the presence of ER stress. Changing the diet from MCDD to CD triggered the reduction of fat in hepatocytes, a decrease in inflammatory gene expression and oxidative stress, and regression of fibrosis accompanied by the disappearance of activated stellate cells and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and RT-PCR analysis all indicated the occurrence of ER stress in steatohepatitis, while it recovered immediately after changing the diet from MCCD to CD. The ratio of hepatocyte proliferation/apoptotis increased significantly during the recovery stage. This simple experiment clearly shows that changing the diet from MCDD to a normal diet (CD) triggers the resolution of hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic reactions and hepatocyte apoptosis, suggesting that MCDD-induced steatohepatitis is also reversible.

Decreased insulin  signaling and increased oxidative stress may promote these maladaptive changes. In this context, the beta-blocker nebivolol has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, increase endothelial NO synthase activity, and reduce NADPH oxidase-induced superoxide generation. We hypothesized that nebivolol would attenuate diastolic dysfunction and myocardial remodeling by blunting myocardial oxidant stress and promoting insulin  signaling in a rodent model of obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Six-week-old male Zucker obese and age-matched Zucker lean rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg x kg(-) x day(-1)) for 21 days, and myocardial function was assessed by cine MRI. Compared with untreated Zucker lean rats, untreated Zucker obese rats exhibited prolonged diastolic relaxation time (27.7+/-2.5 versus 40.9+/-2.0 ms; P<0.05) and reduced initial diastolic filling rate (6.2+/-0.5 versus 2.8+/-0.6 microL/ms; P<0.05) in conjunction with increased homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (7+/-2 versus 95+/-21; P<0.05), interstitial and pericapillary fibrosis, abnormal cardiomyocyte histoarchitecture, 3-nitrotyrosine, and NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide. Nebivolol improved diastolic relaxation (32.8+/-0.7 ms; P<0.05 versus untreated Zucker obese), reduced fibrosis, and remodeling in Zucker obese rats, in concert with reductions in nitrotyrosine, NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide, and improvements in the insulin  signaling, endothelial NO synthase activation, and weight gain (381+/-7 versus 338+/-14 g; P<0.05).

Male Wistar rats were assigned to receive fructose (FRU, 10%) or drinking water (CON) for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was evaluated by tail plethysmography. Fasting glucose, insulin and glucose tolerance were measured at the end of the follow-up. Mesenteric vascular bed reactivity was tested before and after pharmacological blockade. Western blot analysis was performed for iNOS, eNOS, Nox2 and COX-2. DHE staining was used for vascular superoxide anion detection. Vessel structure was evaluated by optical and electronic microscopy. Fructose intake did not alter blood pressure, but did increase visceral fat deposition and fasting glucose as well as impair insulin and glucose tolerance. Fructose increased NE-induced vasoconstriction compared with CON, and this difference was abrogated by indomethacin perfusion as well as endothelium removal. ACh-induced relaxation was preserved, and the NO modulation tested after L-NAME perfusion was similar between groups. SNP-induced relaxation was not altered. Inducible NOS was increased; however, there were no changes in eNOS, Nox2 or COX-2 protein expression. Basal or stimulated superoxide anion production was not changed by fructose intake.

In order to identify nutrients required for the survival or multiplication of EHEC in the bovine GIT, we compared the transcriptomes of the EHEC O157:H7 reference strain EDL933 cultured in vitro in bovine digestive contents (DCs) (rumen, small intestine and rectum) using RNA-sequencing.Gene expression profiles showed that EHEC EDL933 activated common but also specific  pathways to survive in the different bovine DCs. Mucus-derived carbohydrates seem important in EHEC nutrition in posterior DCs (small intestine and rectum) but not in rumen content. Additional carbohydrates (xylose, ribose, mannitol, galactitol) as well as gluconeogenic substrates (aspartate, serine, glycerol) would also be used by EHEC as carbon and/or nitrogen sources all along the bovine GIT including the rumen. However, xylose, GalNac, ribose and fucose transport and/or assimilation encoding genes were over-expressed during incubation in rectum content compared with rumen and intestine contents, and genes coding for maltose transport were only induced in rectum. This suggests a role for these carbohydrates in the colonization of the cattle rectum, considered as the major site for EHEC multiplication. In contrast, the transcription of the genes associated with the assimilation of , an important nitrogen source for EHEC, was poorly induced in EHEC growing in rectum content, suggesting that  is mainly assimilated in the cattle rumen and small intestine. Respiratory flexibility would also be required for EHEC survival because of the redundancy of dehydrogenases and reductases simultaneously induced in the bovine DCs, probably in response to the availability of electron donors and acceptors.EHEC EDL933 showed a high flexibility in the activation of genes involved in respiratory pathways and assimilation of carbon and nitrogen sources, most of them from animal origin. This may allow the bacterium to adapt and survive in the various bovine GIT compartments.

Decreases in Glu/Cr and GABA/Cr may indicate that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons are affected. Highly significant correlations between NAA/Cr, Glu/Cr, and GABA/Cr were observed. These neuronal metabolites were also decreased in the absence of classical SIV encephalitis (SIVE). At any disease classification, animals inoculated with SIVmac251 were found to have lower levels of NAA/Cr than animals inoculated with SIVmac239. In considering therapy for neuroAIDS the findings here support prevention of the encephalitic process, but suggest that suppressing the formation of multinucleated giant cells alone would be insufficient to prevent neuronal injury.(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24769289>One-carbon metabolism in neurodevelopmental disorders: using broad-based nutraceutics to treat cognitive deficits in complex spectrum disorders.</a></h2><p>Folate and choline, two nutrients involved in the one-carbon  cycle, are intimately involved in regulating DNA integrity, synthesis, biogenic amine synthesis, and methylation. In this review, we discuss evidence that folate and choline play an important role in normal cognitive development, and that altered levels of these nutrients during periods of high neuronal proliferation and synaptogenesis can result in diminished cognitive function. We also discuss the use of these nutrients as therapeutic agents in a spectrum of developmental disorders in which intellectual disability is a prominent feature, such as in Fragile-X, Rett , Down , and Autism spectrum disorders. A survey of recent literature suggests that nutritional supplements have mild, but generally consistent, effects on improving cognition. Intervening with supplements earlier rather than later during development is more effective in improving cognitive outcomes. Given the mild improvements seen after treatments using nutrients alone, and the importance of the genetic profile of parents and offspring, we suggest that using nutraceutics early in development and in combination with other therapeutics are likely to have positive impacts on cognitive outcomes in a broad spectrum of complex neurodevelopmental disorders.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy intake is usually sufficient to cover the increase in energy requirements for fetal growth during the period before calving, but meeting the demand for energy is often difficult during the early stages of lactation. A catabolic state predominates during the transition period, leading to the mobilisation of energy reserves (NEFA and amino acids) that are utilised mainly by the liver and muscle. Increased uptake of mobilised NEFA by the liver, combined with the limited capacity of hepatocytes to either oxidise fatty acids for energy or to incorporate esterified fatty acids into VLDL results in fatty liver  and ketosis. This  disturbance can affect the general health, and it causes economic losses. Different nutritional strategies have been used to restrict negative effects associated with the energy challenge in transition cows. The provision of choline in the form of rumen-protected choline (RPC) can potentially improve liver function by increasing VLDL exportation from the liver. RPC increases gene expression of microsomal TAG transfer protein and APOB100 that are required for VLDL synthesis and secretion. Studies with RPC have looked at gene expression,  hormones, metabolite profiles, milk production and postpartum reproduction. A reduction in liver fat and enhanced milk production has been observed with RPC supplementation. However, the effects of RPC on health and reproduction are equivocal, which could reflect the lack of sufficient dose-response studies.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24381266>When norepinephrine becomes a driver of breathing irregularities: how intermittent hypoxia fundamentally alters the modulatory response of the respiratory network.</a></h2><p>Neuronal networks are endogenously modulated by aminergic and peptidergic substances. These modulatory processes are critical for maintaining normal activity and adapting networks to changes in , behavioral, and environmental conditions. However, disturbances in neuromodulation have also been associated with pathologies. Using whole animals (in vivo) and functional brainstem slices (in vitro) from mice, we demonstrate that exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) leads to fundamental changes in the neuromodulatory response of the respiratory network located within the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), an area critical for breathing. Norepinephrine, which normally regularizes respiratory activity, renders respiratory activity irregular after AIH. Respiratory irregularities are caused both in vitro and in vivo by AIH, which increases synaptic inhibition within the preBötC when norepinephrine is endogenously or exogenously increased. These irregularities are prevented by blocking synaptic inhibition before AIH. However, regular breathing cannot be reestablished if synaptic inhibition is blocked after AIH. We conclude that subtle changes in synaptic transmission can have dramatic consequences at the network level as endogenously released neuromodulators that are normally adaptive become the drivers of irregularity. Moreover, irregularities in the preBötC result in irregularities in the motor output in vivo and in incomplete transmission of inspiratory activity to the hypoglossus motor nucleus. Our finding has basic science implications for understanding network functions in general, and it may be clinically relevant for understanding pathological disturbances associated with hypoxic episodes such as those associated with myocardial infarcts, obstructive sleep apneas, apneas of prematurity, Rett , and sudden infant death .</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28965593>Isoproterenol exacerbates hyperglycemia and modulates chromium distribution in mice fed with a high fat diet.</a></h2><p>Isoproterenol (ISO), a nonselective β-adrenoceptor agonist for treating bradycardia and asthma, has been proposed to raise blood glucose level. Little is known regarding the relationship between ISO treatment, the induced chromium (Cr) redistribution, and changes in glucose metabolism. We aimed to characterize the effects of a single dose of ISO on glucose homeostasis and Cr level changes in an obesity mouse model.Mice (C57BL6/j strain) were first fed for a continuous period of 12 weeks with either a high fat diet (HFD), to develop an obesity animal model, or a standard diet (SD), to develop a lean animal model as controls. These groups were each separated into two subgroups to receive either a single dose of ISO or saline (control). We measured in vivo their  parameters, fasting glucose level, area under the curve (AUC) for glucose level time profile, insulin level time profile, insulin sensitivity index, and chromium distribution.After a single dose of ISO, the SD-fed mice had slightly higher blood glucose levels compared with the SD controls, when the level was measured 30 and 60min after injection. By contrast, the ISO-treated HFD-fed mice had significantly higher blood glucose levels and AUC during the entire 120min following one administration compared with the HFD control group. Additionally, they had a substantially lower HOMA-IR index, whereas insulin levels remained unchanged. The Cr level in their bones and liver was decreased, and loss of Cr through urinary excretion was elevated.The results demonstrated that ISO exacerbated hyperglycemic  in the obesity animal model. ISO induced a net negative Cr balance as a result of increased urinary excretion, leading to Cr mobilization that was not desirable to overcome the hyperglycemia.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

The AC stimulatory effects of β-agonist isoproterenol in animals with obesity and DM2 was shown to be practically unchanged. The respective effects of norepinephrine on the AC activity were attenuated in the brain of young and mature rats and in the myocardium if mature rats, and the I-I treatment led to their partial recovery. In the brain and myocardium of mature rats with obesity and DM2, the enhancement of the AC stimulatory effects of β3-AR agonists was observed, white in young rats the influence of the same pathological conditions was lacking. The I-I treatment decreased the AC stimulatory effects of β3-agonists to their levels in the control.

We investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Ep, co-administered with milrinone, in children who underwent open heart surgical repair for congenital defects following cardiopulmonary bypass, including associated variability factors.Thirty-nine children with a high risk of low cardiac output  were prospectively enrolled. Ep pharmacokinetics, hemodynamic and  effects were analyzed using the non-linear mixed effects modeling software MONOLIX. According to the final model, an Ep dosing simulation was suggested.Ep dosing infusions ranged from 0.01 to 0.23 μg.kg-1.min-1 in children whose weight ranged from 2.5 to 58 kg. A one-compartment open model with linear elimination adequately described the Ep concentration-time courses. Bodyweight (BW) was the main covariate influencing clearance (CL) and endogenous Ep production rate (q0) via an allometric relationship: CL(BWi) = θCL x (BWi)3/4 and q0(BWi) = θq0 x (BWi )3/4. The increase in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a function of Ep concentration were well described using an Emax model. The effect of age was significant on HR and MAP basal level parameters. Assuming that Ep stimulated the production rate of plasma glucose, the increases in plasma glucose and lactate levels were well described by turnover models without any significant effect of age, BW or exogenous glucose supply.According to this population analysis, the developmental effects of BW and age explained a part of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics between-subject variabilities of Ep administration in critically ill children. This approach ultimately leads to a valuable Ep dosing simulation which should help clinicians to determine an appropriate a priori dosing regimen.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21599899>The interleukin-6 and noradrenaline mediated inflammation-stress feedback mechanism is dysregulated in : effect of exercise.</a></h2><p> (MS) is a  disorder associated with obesity, type-II diabetes, and "low grade inflammation", with the concomitant increased risk of cardiovascular events. Removal of the inflammatory mediator signals is a promising strategy to protect against insulin resistance, obesity, and other problems associated with MS such as cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present investigation was to determine the "inflammatory and stress status" in an experimental model of MS, and to evaluate the effect of a program of habitual exercise and the resulting training-induced adaptation to the effects of a single bout of acute exercise.Obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) were used as the experimental model of MS, and lean Zucker rats (Fa/fa) were used for reference values. The habitual exercise (performed by the obese rats) consisted of treadmill running: 5 days/week for 14 weeks, at 35 cm/s for 35 min in the last month. The acute exercise consisted of a single session of 25-35 min at 35 cm/s. Circulating concentrations of IL-6 (a cytokine that regulates the inflammatory and  responses), CRP (a systemic inflammatory marker), and corticosterone (CTC) (the main glucocorticoid in rats) were determined by ELISA, and that of noradrenaline (NA) was determined by HPLC. Glucose was determined by standard methods.The genetically obese animals showed higher circulating levels of glucose, IL-6, PCR, and NA compared with the control lean animals. The habitual exercise program increased the concentration of IL-6, CRP, NA, and glucose, but decreased that of CTC. Acute exercise increased IL-6, CRP, and NA in the sedentary obese animals, but not in the trained obese animals. CTC was increased after the acute exercise in the trained animals only.Animals with MS present a dysregulation in the feedback mechanism between IL-6 and NA which can contribute to the systemic low-grade inflammation and/or hyperglycaemia of MS. An inappropriate exercise intensity can worsen this dysregulation, contributing to the , inflammatory, and stress disorders associated with MS. Habitual exercise (i.e., training) induces a positive adaptation in the response to acute exercise.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177786>The effects of weight loss versus weight loss maintenance on sympathetic nervous system activity and  components.</a></h2><p>Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity participates in both the pathogenesis and adverse clinical complications of  (MetS) obesity.We conducted a prospective lifestyle intervention trial to compare the effects of active weight loss and extended weight loss maintenance on SNS function and MetS components.Untreated subjects (14 males, four females; mean age, 53 ± 1 yr; body mass index, 30.9 ± 0.9 kg/m(2)) who fulfilled Adult Treatment Panel III criteria were randomized to 12-wk hypocaloric diet alone (n = 8) or together with aerobic exercise training (n = 10). This was followed by a 4-month weight maintenance period. Measurements of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) by microneurography, whole-body norepinephrine kinetics, substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry, baroreflex sensitivity, plasma renin activity (PRA), and MetS components were performed.Body weight decreased by 9.3 ± 0.8% at wk 12 (P < 0.001), and this was maintained. During active weight loss, norepinephrine spillover rate decreased by 23 ± 16% (P = 0.004), MSNA by 25 ± 3 bursts per 100 heartbeats (P < 0.001), and PRA by 0.25 ± 0.09 ng/ml · h (P = 0.007), whereas baroreflex sensitivity increased by 5.2 ± 2.2 msec/mm Hg (P = 0.005). After weight maintenance, beneficial effects of weight loss on norepinephrine spillover rate were preserved, whereas PRA and MSNA rebounded (by 0.24 ± 0.11 ng/ml · h, P = 0.02; and 20 ± 5 bursts/100 heartbeats, P = 0.0003), and baroreflex sensitivity was attenuated.Divergent effects of successful weight loss maintenance on whole-body norepinephrine spillover rate and MSNA suggest organ-specific differentiation in SNS adaptation to weight loss under conditions of negative vs. stable energy balance.</p><p>Keyword: metabolic syndrome</p></html>
