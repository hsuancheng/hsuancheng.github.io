Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to , lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high  morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative -independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197730>Metabolomic Response of Skeletal Muscle to Aerobic Exercise Training in  Resistant Type 1 Diabetic Rats.</a></h2><p>The etiology of  in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is unknown, however it affects approximately 20% of T1D patients. Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) have been identified as a mechanism of . We examined skeletal muscle of T1D rats to determine if alterations in lipid metabolism were evident and whether aerobic exercise training improves IMCL and . To do so, 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control (C), sedentary diabetes (D) and diabetes exercise (DX) groups. Following multiple low-dose Streptozotocin (STZ) injections (20 mg/kg), glycemia (9-15 mM) was maintained using  treatment. DX were treadmill trained at high intensity (~75% V02max; 5days/week) for 10 weeks. The results demonstrate that D exhibited  compared with C and DX, indicated by decreased glucose infusion rate during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (p < 0.05). There were no differences between C and DX, suggesting that exercise improved  (p < 0.05). Metabolomics analysis revealed a significant shift in lipid metabolism whereby notable fatty  metabolites (, palmitic  and several polyunsaturated fatty acids) were significantly elevated in D compared to C and DX. Based on the intermediates observed,  in T1D is characterized by an -desensitizing intramyocellular fatty  metabolite profile that is ameliorated with exercise training.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29309791>Amelioration of streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus in Wistar rats by .</a></h2><p>Traditionally  (AA, 20:4 n-6) is considered as a pro-inflammatory molecule since it forms precursor to prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs) and thromboxanes (TXs) that have pro-inflammatory actions. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) is considered as a low-grade systemic inflammatory condition in which circulating PGs and LTs are increased. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 DM is used as a model of human type 2 DM in which peripheral , increased plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and hyperglycemia occurs. In the present study, we observed that oral supplementation of AA prevented STZ-induced type 2 DM in Wistar rats by restoring hyperglycemia, plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6; adipose tissue NF-kB and lipocalin 2 (LPCLN2) and pancreatic tissue NF-kB and 5- and 12- lipoxygenase enzymes to normal. AA treatment enhanced  sensitivity and plasma lipoxin A4 (LXA4) levels, a potent anti-inflammatory molecule derived from AA. These results are supported by our previous studies wherein it was noted that plasma phospholipid content of AA and circulating LXA4 levels are low in those with type 2 DM. In a preliminary study, we also noted that high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced type 2 DM in Wistar rats can be prevented by oral supplementation of AA. These results suggest AA has anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic actions by enhancing the production of its anti-inflammatory metabolite LXA4.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the long-term pathogenesis of high-calorie diet-induced metabolic syndromes, including NASH, has not been well described in minipigs. We examined the development of metabolic syndromes in Bama minipigs that were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 23 months, by using histology and serum biochemistry and by profiling the gene expression patterns in the livers of HFHSD pigs compared to controls. The pathology findings revealed microvesicular steatosis, iron overload,  synthesis, lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant capacity, increased cellular damage, and inflammation in the liver. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 164 genes were differentially expressed between the livers of the HFHSD and control groups. The pathogenesis of early-stage NASH was characterized by hyperinsulinemia and by de novo synthesis of fatty acids and nascent triglycerides, which were deposited as lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Hyperinsulinemia shifted the energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies, and the high ketone body concentration induced the overexpression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The iron overload, CYP2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 overexpression promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which resulted in  and linoleic  peroxidation and, in turn, led to malondialdehyde production and a cellular response to ROS-mediated DNA damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27155920>The role of free fatty acids in the inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile in adolescents with metabolic syndrome engaged in interdisciplinary therapy.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if interdisciplinary therapy can influence the cardiometabolic and serum free fatty  profile. The second aim was to evaluate if there is an association between serum free fatty acids, inflammation and cardiometabolic biomarkers in obese adolescents with and without metabolic syndrome submitted to a long-term interdisciplinary therapy. The study involved 108 postpuberty obese adolescents, who were divided according to metabolic syndrome (MetS) diagnosis: MetS (n=32) and Non-MetS (n=76). The interdisciplinary therapy consisted of a 1-year period of nutrition, psychology, physical exercise and clinical support. After therapy, both groups improved metabolic, inflammatory (leptin, adiponectin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, adiponectin/leptin ratio and C-reactive protein) and cardiometabolic profile (PAI-1 and ICAM). Metabolic syndrome prevalence reduced from 28.70% to 12.96%. Both groups reduced myristic  (C14:0) and increased docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6n3), heneicosapentaenoic  (HPA, C21:5n3) and  (C20:4n6). After adjustment for metabolic syndrome and the number of metabolic syndrome parameters, multiple regression analysis showed that changes in VCAM and PAI-1 were negatively associated with changes in cis-linoleic  (C18:2n6c). Additionally, changes in trans-linoleic  (C18:2n6t) were also positively associated with these biomarkers. Moreover, leptin and leptin/adiponectin ratio were negatively associated with changes in docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5n3) and stearidonic  (SDA, C18:4n3). Adiponectin/leptin ratio was positively associated with docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5n3). Changes in adiponectin were positively correlated with changes in omega 3, such as heneicosapentaenoic  (HPA, C21:5n3) and docosapentaenoic  (DPA, C22:5n3). Results support that interdisciplinary therapy can control inflammatory and cardiometabolic profile in obese adolescents. Moreover, serum fatty acids can be influenced by lifestyle changes and are able to modulate these biomarkers.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of our work was to assess the fatty , oxylipin and phenolic composition using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), ultra- high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to MS and HPLC coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Additionally, various antioxidant activities were assessed. The inhibition of α-glucosidase, α-amylase, lipase, cyclooxygenases-1 and -2 (COX-1/COX-2), and lipoxygenase was determined. The main fatty acids were oleic and 7-hexadecenoic acids. Eight phytoprostanes and three phytofurans were identified and quantified. Hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic compounds. Oils showed antioxidant activity determined by EPR, and inhibition of COX-1/COX-2. The statistical analysis showed that the roasting does not affect the composition of the samples. The occurrence of oxylipins in this species is reported for the first time. Chilean hazelnuts can be considered a source of health promoting compounds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to , the plasma membrane-embedded  receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of . The activities of this receptor,  binding, and tyrosine kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on  response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated fatty- blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic  (LNA),  (ARA), alpha-linolenic  (ALA), docoshexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the -signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and liver hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the fatty- composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human  (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The fatty acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances  action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These include a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health that could be partly attributed to the effects of polyphenols on lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate whether consumption of pomegranate juice for 6 weeks could modify lipid peroxidation and phospholipid fatty  composition of plasma and erythrocytes in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Twenty-three women, aged 40-60 years, were enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups: the intervention group, in which each participant consumed 300 mL of juice per day for 6 weeks; and a control group.A statistically significant decrease in the relative amount of  (P < 0.05) and an increase in the relative amount of saturated fatty acids (P < 0.05) were observed in the intervention group at the end of the consumption period. In addition, pomegranate juice significantly increased the relative amount of total mono-unsaturated fatty acids (P < 0.05), and significantly decreased the levels of thiobarbituric  reactive substances in erythrocytes (P < 0.05). The status of blood lipids and the values for blood pressure were not changed during the study.The results obtained indicate a positive impact of the consumption of pomegranate juice on lipid peroxidation and fatty  status in subjects with metabolic syndrome and suggest potential anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective effects. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28711599> sex-dependently affects obesity through linking gut microbiota-driven inflammation to hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis.</a></h2><p>Unraveling the role of dietary lipids is beneficial to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, how dietary lipids affect existing obesity remains unknown.  (AA), a derivative of linoleic , is one of the crucial n-6 fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AA affects obesity through associating microbiota-driven inflammation with hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Four-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 10weeks to induce obesity, and then fed a HFD enriched with 10g/kg of AA or a continuous HFD in the following 15weeks. Systemic adiposity and inflammation, metabolic profiles, gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids production, hypothalamic feeding regulators, browning process of adipocytes, hepatosteatosis, and  in adipose were investigated. The results indicated that AA aggravates obesity for both genders whereas sex-dependently affects gut microbiota composition. Also, AA favors pro-inflammatory microbiota and reduces butyrate production and circulating serotonin, which augments global inflammation and triggers hypothalamic leptin  via microglia accumulation in male. AA exacerbates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis along with amplified inflammation through TLR4-NF-κB pathway and induces . Reversely, AA alleviates obesity-related disorders via rescuing anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing microbiota, up-regulating GPR41 and GPR109A and controlling hypothalamic inflammation in female. Nevertheless, AA modifies adipocyte browning and promotes lipid mobilization for both genders. We show that AA affects obesity likely through a gut-hypothalamus-adipose-liver axis. Our findings formulate recommendations of n-6 fatty acids like AA from dietary intake for obese subjects preferably in a sexually dimorphic way.Copyright © 2017.

We hypothesized that hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities of GTE would protect against NASH by reducing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an NFκB-dependent enzyme, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dietary fat-induced obese model. Male Wistar rats were fed a low-fat diet containing no GTE or a high-fat (HF) diet containing GTE at 0%, 1%, or 2% for 8 weeks.  and total hepatic fatty acids increased following HF feeding (P<.05) and these were normalized by GTE at 1-2%. GTE (1-2%) normalized hepatic malondialdehyde without affecting cytochrome P450 2E1 mRNA expression, which was otherwise increased by HF feeding. HF-mediated increases in hepatic COX-2 protein and activity as well as PGE2 concentrations were normalized by GTE (1-2%). COX-2 activity and PGE2 were correlated to each other, and to serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic NFκB-binding activity (P<.05; r=0.28-0.49). GTE attenuated HF-mediated increases in total hepatic n-6 and n-3, without affecting the n-6/n-3 ratio. GTE did not affect HF-mediated increases in n-6 in nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) and phospholipid pools, whereas n-3 and n-6/n-3 in both pools were unaffected by GTE and HF feeding. GTE decreased total hepatic  without affecting HF-mediated increases in  in NEFA or phospholipid pools. Thus, GTE attenuates lipid peroxidation and PGE2 accumulation by decreasing COX-2 activity independent of  availability and supports an additional mechanism by which GTE protects against liver injury during NASH in an HF-feeding model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25776459>Intake of farmed Atlantic salmon fed soybean oil increases hepatic levels of -derived oxylipins and ceramides in mice.</a></h2><p>Introduction of vegetable ingredients in fish feed has affected the fatty  composition in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). Here we investigated how changes in fish feed affected the metabolism of mice fed diets containing fillets from such farmed salmon. We demonstrate that replacement of fish oil with rapeseed oil or soybean oil in fish feed had distinct spillover effects in mice fed western diets containing the salmon. A reduced ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fish feed, reflected in the salmon, and hence also in the mice diets, led to a selectively increased abundance of  in the phospholipid pool in the livers of the mice. This was accompanied by increased levels of hepatic ceramides and -derived pro-inflammatory mediators and a reduced abundance of oxylipins derived from eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic . These changes were associated with increased whole body  and hepatic steatosis. Our data suggest that an increased ratio between n-6 and n-3-derived oxylipins may underlie the observed marked metabolic differences between mice fed the different types of farmed salmon. These findings underpin the need for carefully considering the type of oil used for feed production in relation to salmon farming.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The role of PUFA in reducing the risk of stroke is uncertain. The concentrations of PUFA in the human body are determined both by dietary intake and by activities of desaturase enzymes. Desaturase enzymes have been associated with chronic diseases, but little is known about their association with stroke risk. We investigated the associations of Δ-6-desaturase (D6D) and Δ-5-desaturase (D5D) activities with stroke risk factors and risk of stroke among 1842 men from the prospective, population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study, aged 42-60 years and free of CVD at baseline in 1984-1989. ANCOVA and Cox regression models were used for the analyses. Whole serum desaturase activities were estimated as product:precursor ratios - γ-linolenic :linoleic  for D6D and :dihomo-γ-linolenic  for D5D. Higher D6D activity was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, serum  and TAG concentrations and worse homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA) indices. In contrast, higher D5D activity was associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, serum , LDL-cholesterol, TAG and C-reactive protein concentrations, higher HDL-cholesterol concentration, and better HOMA indices. During the mean follow-up of 21·2 years, 202 stroke cases occurred. Neither D6D activity (multivariable-adjusted extreme-quartile hazard ratios (HR) 1·18; 95 % CI 0·80, 1·74) nor D5D activity (HR 1·06; 95 % CI 0·70, 1·60) were associated with stroke risk. In conclusion, higher D5D activity was favourably associated and higher D6D activity unfavourably associated with several stroke risk factors, but not with the risk of incident stroke.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27401401>Characterization of the Cytochrome P450 epoxyeicosanoid pathway in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an emerging public health problem without effective therapies. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize  into bioactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have potent anti-inflammatory and protective effects. However, the functional relevance of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid metabolism pathway in the pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood. Our studies demonstrate that both mice with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH and humans with biopsy-confirmed NASH exhibited significantly higher free EET concentrations compared to healthy controls. Targeted disruption of Ephx2 (the gene encoding for soluble epoxide hydrolase) in mice further increased EET levels and significantly attenuated MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and injury, as well as high fat diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation, systemic glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that dysregulation of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid pathway is a key pathological consequence of NASH in vivo, and promoting the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of EETs warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy for NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An untargeted metabolomics approach has been employed using both UPLC-Orbitrap and -QqTOF methods to identify the changes induced by chronic HT administration on the plasma metabolome. 31 metabolites have been found to be differentially expressed between the examined groups. HT was shown to decrease biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty  biosynthesis, and the metabolism of linoleic , retinol, sphingolipids and , whereas glycerolipid metabolism is up-regulated.

In this study we established the "Focus" mode of biomarkers to characterize the dose-effect relationship of Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD), a TCM formula for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM). A rat model of 2-DM was established through high fat diet feeding combined with low-dose STZ injection. Rats with 2-DM were administered high, middle or low doses (6.785, 4.071, 1.357 mg·kg·d, respectively) of GQD extract for 60 d. Metformin (300 mg·kg·d) was taken as the positive control. Blood samples were collected to assess serum biochemical indexes and metabolic profiling. After "Focus" analysis, the biochemical index triglycerides (TG) and  sensitivity (ISI) were identified as focused integrated biomarkers (FIBs), while  and docosatetraenoic  were the metabolic FIBs. Dose-effect relationship curves of GQD were built based on these types of FIBs. Furthermore, the two dose-effect relationship curves showed similar trends with the middle dosage displaying the greatest efficacy, suggesting that  function and  metabolism played important roles in 2-DM and the responses to GQD. The metabolic FIB docosatetraenoic should be further explored for understanding its involvement in the process of 2-DM occurrence and the treatment.

The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of obesity, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts.

In this review we discuss the role of 12-LOX in NAFLD pathogenesis and its potential role in emerging new therapeutics.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, limited information exists on how the response to dietary intake of linoleic  (LA; 18:2n-6) is modified by polymorphisms in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene cluster.The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that the FADS1 rs174550 genotype modifies the effect of dietary LA intake on the fatty  composition of plasma lipids, fasting glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Associations were investigated between genotype, plasma PUFAs, fasting glucose, and hsCRP concentrations in the cross-sectional, population-based Metabolic Syndrome in Men cohort (n = 1337). In addition, 62 healthy men from the cohort who were homozygotes for the TT or CC genotype of the FADS1 rs174550 were recruited to a 4-wk intervention (FADSDIET) with an LA-enriched diet. The fatty  composition of plasma PUFAs and concentrations of plasma fasting glucose, serum hsCRP, and plasma lipid mediators (eicosanoids and related analogs) were measured at the beginning and end of the 4-wk intervention period.In the FADSDIET trial, the plasma LA proportion increased in both genotype groups in response to an LA-enriched diet. Responses in concentrations of serum hsCRP and plasma fasting glucose and the proportion of  (20:4n-6) in plasma phospholipids and cholesteryl esters differed between genotype groups (interaction of diet × genotype, P < 0.05). In TT homozygous subjects, plasma eicosanoid concentrations correlated with the  proportion in plasma and with hsCRP (r = 0.4-0.7, P < 0.05), whereas in the CC genotype there were no correlations.Our findings show that the FADS1 genotype modifies metabolic responses to dietary LA. The emerging concept that personalized dietary counseling should be modified by the FADS1 genotype needs to be tested in larger randomized trials.

The aim of this study was to compare both profiles and to highlight the differences that could influence the improvement of the treatment of patients in both groups. The study involved 73 women, including 24 patients with chronic kidney disease treated with haemodialysis, 19 patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), and 30 healthy women in the control group. A total of 35 fatty acids and derivatives were identified and quantified by gas chromatography. Intensified elongation processes from  C10:0 to C16:0 were noted in both groups (more intense in MetS), as well as an increased synthesis of  (C20:4n6), which was more intense in CKD. Significant correlations of oleic  (C18:1n9), gamma linoleic  (C18:3n6), and docosatetraenoate  (C22:4n6) with parameters of CKD patients were observed. In the MetS group, auxiliary metabolic pathways of oleic  were activated, which simultaneously inhibited the synthesis of eicosapentanoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) from alpha lipoic  (ALA). On the other hand, in the group of female patients with CKD, the synthesis of EPA and DHA was intensified. Activation of the synthesis of oleic  (C18: 1n9 ct) and trans-vaccinic  (C18:1) is a protective mechanism in kidney diseases and especially in MetS due to the increased concentration of saturated fatty  (SFA) in plasma. The cause of the increased amount of all FAs in plasma in the CKD group, especially in the case of palmitic (C16:0) and derivatives stearic (C18:0) acids, may be the decomposition of adipose tissue and the progressing devastation of the organism, whereas, in the MetS group, dietary intake seems to be the main reason for the increase in SFA. Moreover, in MetS, auxiliary metabolic pathways are activated for oleic , which cause the simultaneous inhibition of EPA and DHA synthesis from ALA, whereas, in the CKD group, we observe an increased synthesis of EPA and DHA. The higher increase of nervonic  (C24:1) in CKD suggests a higher degree of demyelination and loss of axons.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29138692>Transcriptomics-driven lipidomics (TDL) identifies the microbiome-regulated targets of ileal lipid metabolism.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome and lipid metabolism are both recognized as essential components in the maintenance of metabolic health.

However, its role in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been supported by results obtained from high-fat feeding of iPLA2β-null (PKO) mice. Unlike livers of human NAFLD and genetically obese rodents, fatty liver induced by high-fat diet is not associated with depletion of hepatic phospholipids. We therefore tested whether iPLA2β could regulate obesity and hepatic steatosis in leptin-deficient mice by cross-breeding PKO with ob/ob mice to generate ob/ob-PKO mice. Here we observed an improvement in ob/ob-PKO mice with significant reduction in serum enzymes, lipids, glucose,  as well as improved glucose tolerance, and reduction in islet hyperplasia. The improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by liver triglycerides, fatty acids and cholesterol esters was associated with decreased expression of PPARγ and de novo lipogenesis genes, and the reversal of β-oxidation gene expression. Notably, ob/ob livers contained depleted levels of lysophospholipids and phospholipids, and iPLA2β deficiency in ob/ob-PKO livers lowers the former, but replenished the latter particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) that contained  (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Compared with WT livers, PKO livers also contained increased PE and PC containing AA and DHA. Thus, iPLA2β deficiency protected against obesity and ob/ob fatty liver which was associated with hepatic fatty-acyl phospholipid remodeling. Our results support the deleterious role of iPLA2β in severe obesity associated NAFLD.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their immunomodulatory effects are numerous and are not always mediated by cannabinoid receptors, reflecting the presence of an  (AA) molecule in their structure, the latter being the precursor of numerous bioactive lipids that are pro- or anti-inflammatory. 2-AG and AEA can thus serve as a source of AA but can also be metabolized by most eicosanoid biosynthetic enzymes, yielding additional lipids. In this regard, enhancing endocannabinoid levels by using endocannabinoid hydrolysis inhibitors is likely to augment the levels of these lipids that could regulate inflammatory cell functions. This review summarizes the metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of AEA and 2-AG, as well as the biologic effects of the 2-AG and AEA lipidomes in the regulation of inflammation.© Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29594475>Individual fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes are associated with several features of the metabolic syndrome in obese children.</a></h2><p>Obesity leads to the clustering of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) also in children and is often accompanied by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Quality of dietary fat, beyond the quantity, can influence CV risk profile and, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids (FA) have been proposed as beneficial in this setting. The aim of the study was to evaluate the associations of individual CV risk factors, characterizing the MetS, with erythrocyte membrane FA, markers of average intake, in a group of 70 overweight/obese children.We conducted an observational study. Erythrocyte membrane FA were measured by gas chromatography. Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to evaluate associations between FA and features of the MetS.Mean content of Omega-3 FA was low (Omega-3 Index = 4.7 ± 0.8%). Not omega-3 FA but some omega-6 FA, especially  (AA), were inversely associated with several features of the MetS: AA resulted inversely correlated with waist circumference (r = - 0.352), triglycerides (r = - 0.379), fasting  (r = - 0.337) and 24-h SBP (r = - 0.313). Total amount of saturated FA (SFA) and specifically palmitic , correlated positively with waist circumference (r = 0.354), triglycerides (r = 0.400) and fasting  (r = 0.287). Fatty Liver Index (FLI), a predictive score of steatosis based on GGT, triglycerides and anthropometric indexes, was positively correlated to palmitic  (r = 0.515) and inversely to AA (r = - 0.472).Our data suggest that omega-6 FA, and especially AA, could be protective toward CV risk factors featuring the MetS and also to indexes of hepatic steatosis in obese children, whereas SFA seems to exert opposite effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27436752>Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP3 regulates both adipogenesis and lipolysis in mouse white adipose tissue.</a></h2><p>Among the four prostaglandin E2 receptors, EP3 receptor is the one most abundantly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT). The mouse EP3 gene gives rise to three isoforms, namely EP3α, EP3β, and EP3γ, which differ only at their C-terminal tails. To date, functions of EP3 receptor and its isoforms in WAT remain incompletely characterized. In this study, we found that the expression of all EP3 isoforms were downregulated in WAT of both db/db and high-fat diet-induced obese mice. Genetic ablation of three EP3 receptor isoforms (EP3 mice) or EP3α and EP3γ isoforms with EP3β intact (EP3β mice) led to an obese phenotype with increased food intake, decreased motor activity, reduced  sensitivity, and elevated serum triglycerides. Since the differentiation of preadipocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts to adipocytes was markedly facilitated by either pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion/inhibition of EP3 receptor via the cAMP/PKA/PPARγ pathway, increased adipogenesis may contribute to obesity in EP3 and EP3β mice. Moreover, both EP3 and EP3β mice had increased lipolysis in WAT mainly due to the activated cAMP/PKA/hormone-sensitive lipase pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that EP3 receptor and its α and γ isoforms are involved in both adipogenesis and lipolysis and influence food intake, serum lipid levels, and  sensitivity.© The Author (2016).

Recent work has demonstrated that macrophage FABP4 integrates inflammatory and lipid metabolic responses, thereby contributing to the development of  and atherosclerosis. However, it is not known whether FABP4 in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells(HPAECs) modulates inflammation.Here, we demonstrate that FABP4 and inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-stimulated HPAECs. In addition, LPS increases the expression of molecules in the (AA)-cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 signaling pathway in FABP4-expressing, but not FABP4-deficient, HPAECs.Our findings demonstrate that silencing FABP4 could decrease inflammatory cytokines, which were reported to be expressed via the AA-COX2 pathway, in HPAECs. In addition, silencing FABP4 could inhibit the expression of molecules in the AA-COX2 pathways. So we speculate silencing FABP4 could decrease the inflammatory response in HPAECs, which involves in the AA-COX2 signaling pathway.

It was found that d-fagomine reduces fat-induced impaired glucose tolerance, inflammation markers, and mediators (hepatic microgranulomas and lobular inflammation, plasma IL-6, prostaglandin E , and leukotriene B ) while attenuating the changes in the populations of Enterobacteriales and Bifidobacteriales.d-Fagomine delays the development of a fat-induced prediabetic state in rats by reducing low-grade inflammation. We suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of d-fagomine may be linked to a reduction in fat-induced overpopulation of minor gut bacteria.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Genetic variations and diet are well-known risk factor for MetS, but the interaction between these two factors is less explored. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of interaction between SNP of inflammatory genes (encoding interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-10) and plasma fatty acids on the odds of MetS, in a population-based cross-sectional study.Among participants of the Health Survey - São Paulo, 301 adults (19-59 y) from whom a blood sample was collected were included.

The influence of gene-fatty acids interaction on MetS risk was investigated.IL6 gene SNP rs1800795 G allele was associated with higher odds for MetS (OR = 1.88; p = 0.017). Gene-fatty  interaction was found between the IL1B gene SNP rs116944 and stearic  (p inter = 0.043), and between rs1143634 and EPA (p inter = 0.017).

However, the role of 20-HETE in the regulation of large artery remodeling in metabolic syndrome has not been investigated. We hypothesized that elevated 20-HETE in metabolic syndrome increases matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12) activation leading to increased degradation of elastin, increased large artery stiffness and increased systolic blood pressure. 20-HETE production was increased ~7 fold in large, conduit arteries of metabolic syndrome (JCR:LA-cp, JCR) vs. normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. This correlated with increased elastin degradation (~7 fold) and decreased arterial compliance (~75% JCR vs. SD). 20-HETE antagonists blocked elastin degradation in JCR rats concomitant with blocking MMP12 activation. 20-HETE antagonists normalized, and MMP12 inhibition (pharmacological and MMP12-shRNA-Lnv) significantly improved (~50% vs. untreated JCR) large artery compliance in JCR rats. 20-HETE antagonists also decreased systolic (182 ± 3 mmHg JCR, 145 ± 3 mmHg JCR + 20-HETE antagonists) but not diastolic blood pressure in JCR rats. Whereas diastolic pressure was fully angiotensin II (Ang II)-dependent, systolic pressure was only partially Ang II-dependent, and large artery stiffness was Ang II-independent. Thus, 20-HETE-dependent regulation of systolic blood pressure may be a unique feature of metabolic syndrome related to high 20-HETE production in large, conduit arteries, which results in increased large artery stiffness and systolic blood pressure. These findings may have implications for management of systolic hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These lipid mediators are involved in fever, pain, and thrombosis and are produced from multiple cells as well as cell/cell interactions, for example, immune cells and epithelial/endothelial cells. Metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, are linked with chronic low-grade inflammation, impacting the immune system and promoting a variety of chronic diseases. Recent Advances: Multiple studies have corroborated the important function of eicosanoids and their receptors in (non)-inflammatory cells in immunometabolic disorders (e.g., , obesity, and cardiovascular and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases). In this context, LOX and COX products are involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. In addition, recent work has elucidated the potent function of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., lipoxins and resolvins) in resolving inflammation, protecting organs, and stimulating tissue repair and remodeling.Inhibiting/stimulating selected eicosanoid pathways may result in anti-inflammatory and proresolution responses leading to multiple beneficial effects, including the abrogation of reactive oxygen species production, increased speed of resolution, and overall improvement of diseases related to immunometabolic perturbations.Despite many achievements, it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying immunological/metabolic cross talk to offer substantial therapeutic promise.

Effects of EETs are limited by hydrolysis by soluble epoxide hydrolase to less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids. Studies in rodent models provide compelling evidence that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids exert favorable effects on glucose homeostasis, either by enhancing pancreatic islet cell function or by increasing  sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Specifically, the tissue expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase appears to be increased in rodent models of obesity and diabetes. Pharmacological inhibition of epoxide hydrolase or deletion of the gene encoding soluble epoxide hydrolase (Ephx2) preserves islet cells in rodent models of type 1 diabetes and enhances  sensitivity in models of type 2 diabetes, as does administration of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids or their stable analogues.

Overweight and obesity development is for most individuals the result of years of positive energy balance. Evidence from intervention trials and animal studies suggests that frequent intake of lean seafood, as compared with intake of terrestrial meats, reduces energy intake by 4-9 %, sufficient to prevent a positive energy balance and obesity. At equal energy intake, lean seafood reduces fasting and postprandial risk markers of , and improves  sensitivity in -resistant adults. Energy restriction combined with intake of lean and fatty seafood seems to increase weight loss. Marine n-3 PUFA are probably of importance through n-3 PUFA-derived lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids and oxylipins, but other constituents of seafood such as the fish protein per se, trace elements or vitamins also seem to play a largely neglected role. A high intake of fatty seafood increases circulating levels of the -sensitising hormone adiponectin. As compared with a high meat intake, high intake of seafood has been reported to reduce plasma levels of the hepatic acute-phase protein C-reactive protein level in some, but not all studies.

Future studies should be designed to elucidate the potential contribution of trace elements, vitamins and undesirables present in seafood, and we argue that stratification into responders and non-responders in randomised controlled trials may improve the understanding of health effects from intake of seafood.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428465>Netrin-1 Alters Adipose Tissue Macrophage Fate and Function in Obesity.</a></h2><p>Macrophages accumulate prominently in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of obese humans and high fat diet (HFD) fed mice, and this is linked to  and type II diabetes. While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment in obesity have been delineated, the signals directing macrophage persistence in VAT are poorly understood. We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in obesity, we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance lipid handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in lipid handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of lipid localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in  metabolism, and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT. Collectively, our data show that targeted deletion of netrin-1 in macrophages reprograms the ATM phenotype in obesity, leading to reduced adipose inflammation, and improved lipid handling and metabolic function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433904>Ratios of serum eicosapentaenoic  to  and docosahexaenoic  to  were inversely associated with serum resistin levels: The Hisayama Study.</a></h2><p>Resistin is an adipocyte-derived polypeptide that leads to the progression of  and subsequent atherosclerosis. Some studies have reported an association between self-reported intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and serum resistin levels. However, no studies have investigated the association between the ratio of serum levels of n-3 to serum n-6 PUFAs and the serum resistin concentration in the general population.We carried out a cross-sectional study of 3,200 community-dwelling Japanese individuals aged ≥40 years in 2002-2003. The ratios of serum eicosapentaenoic  or docosahexaenoic  to  (AA) were categorized into quartiles. The associations of serum eicosapentaenoic /AA and docosahexaenoic /AA with the serum resistin concentration were assessed using linear regression models with adjustment for potential confounding factors.The geometric mean of serum resistin was 10.3 ng/mL. The age- and sex-adjusted geometric mean of serum resistin decreased significantly with increased levels of serum eicosapentaenoic /AA (quartile 1: 11.3 ng/mL; quartile 2: 10.6 ng/mL; quartile 3: 10.3 ng/mL; quartile 4: 9.3 ng/mL; P for trend <0.001). A similar association was observed for serum docosahexaenoic /AA (quartile 1: 11.1 ng/mL; quartile 2: 10.6 ng/mL; quartile 3: 10.1 ng/mL; quartile 4: 9.7 ng/mL; P for trend <0.001). An adjustment for potential confounding factors did not change these associations.Higher ratios of serum n-3 to n-6 PUFAs were associated with lower serum resistin levels. Consumption of a large amount of n-3 PUFAs might have desirable effects on resistin-mediated diseases.© 2019 The Authors.

Fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36), whose expression is inducible in obesity, is known for its function in fatty  uptake. Previous work by us and others suggested that CD36 plays an important role in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the results have been conflicting and the mechanisms were not well understood. In this study, by using CD36-overexpressing transgenic (CD36Tg) mice, we uncovered a surprising function of CD36 in regulating glycogen homeostasis. Overexpression of CD36 promoted glycogen synthesis, and as a result, CD36Tg mice were protected from fasting hypoglycemia. When challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), CD36Tg mice showed unexpected attenuation of hepatic steatosis, increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and improved glucose tolerance and  sensitivity. The HFD-fed CD36Tg mice also showed decreased levels of proinflammatory hepatic prostaglandins and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictive and proinflammatory  metabolite. We propose that CD36 functions as a protective metabolic sensor in the liver under lipid overload and metabolic stress. CD36 may be explored as a valuable therapeutic target for the management of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

We quantitatively determined 11 FFAs, seven cytokine/adipokine, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) and C-peptide levels from the fasting blood samples that were collected at 16 weeks of gestation. Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Negative relationships were found with specific FFAs (molecular percentage, palmitoleic, oleic, linolenic, myristic acids) and HOMA-IR and C-peptide levels (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). In contrast, palmitic, stearic, , dihomo-γ-linolenic (DGLA) and docosahexaenoic acids were positively associated with HOMA-IR and C-peptide (p<0.01 to p<0.0001). The individual FFAs also predicted cytokine/adipokine levels. For example, women who had elevated DGLA (highest quartile) were twice as (adjusted OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.98) likely to have higher interleukin (IL)-8 (p<0.0001) levels. Conversely, women with high palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic  levels had reduced odds (≥2-fold, p<0.01 to p<0.001) for having higher IL-8, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels.Our results suggest that maternal individual FFAs uniquely affect  and secretion. The effects are either direct or indirect via modulation of the inflammatory response. Modifying the composition of FFAs may help in reducing the risk of GDM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25761783>A high-fat plus fructose diet produces a vascular prostanoid alterations in the rat.</a></h2><p>In the rat, a high-fat (HF) plus fructose (F) diet produces cardiovascular and metabolic alterations that resemble human metabolic syndrome. Prostanoids (PR), cyclo-oxygenase-derived  metabolites, have vasoactive properties and mediate inflammation. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of a HF+F diet on blood pressure (BP), metabolic parameters and mesenteric vascular bed PR production in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Four groups were studied over 9 weeks (n = 6 each): control (C), standard diet (SD) and tap water to drink; F+SD and 10% w/v F solution to drink; HF 50% (w/w) bovine fat added to SD and tap water; and HFF, both treatments. PR were determined by HPLC. Blood pressure was elevated in all experimental groups. Triglyceridaemia, insulinaemia and HOMA-IR were increased in the F and HF groups. HF+F animals showed elevated glycaemia, insulinaemia, HOMA-IR and triglyceridaemia. F decreased the vasodilator prostanoids PGI2 and PGE2 in the mesenteric vascular bed. Body weight was not significantly altered. In HFF, production of PGE2 , PGF2 alpha and TXB2 was elevated. The increased BP in HF and HFF could be partly attributed to the imbalance in vascular PR production towards vasoconstrictors. On the other hand, this dietary modification could induce inflammation, which would explain the elevation of PGE2 . In the F group, hypertension could be related to decreased vasodilator PRs. The simultaneous administration of HF and F in the rat produces deleterious effects greater than observed when treatments are applied separately.© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913432>Transcriptome analysis reveals novel insights into the response of low-dose benzo(a)pyrene exposure in male tilapia.</a></h2><p>Despite a wide number of toxicological studies that describe benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) effects, the metabolic mechanisms that underlie these effects in fish are largely unknown. Of great concern is the presence of BaP in aquatic systems, especially those in close proximity to human activity leading to consumption of potentially contaminated foods. BaP is a known carcinogen and it has been reported to have adverse effects on the survival, development and reproduction of fish. The purpose of this study was to investigate if a low dose of BaP can alter genes and key metabolic pathways in the liver and testis in male adult tilapia, and whether these could be associated with biological endpoints disruption. We used both high-throughput RNA-Sequencing to assess whole genome gene expression following repeated intraperitoneal injections of 3 mg/kg of BaP (every 6 days for 26 days) and morphometric endpoints as indicators of general health. Condition factor (K) along with hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices (morphometric parameters) were significantly lower in BaP-treated fish than in controls. BaP exposure induced important changes in the gene expression pattern in liver and testis as revealed by both Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. Alterations that were shared by both tissues included  metabolism, androgen receptor to prostate-specific antigen signaling, and -associated effects on lipogenesis. The most salient liver-specific effects included: biological processes involved in detoxification, IL6-associated , mTOR hyperactivation, mitotic cytokinesis, spindle pole and microtubule binding. BaP effects that were confined to the testis included: immune system functions, inflammatory response, estrogen and androgen metabolic pathways. Taken together, gene expression and morphometric end point data indicate that the reproductive success of adult male tilapia could be compromised as a result of BaP exposure. These results constitute new insights on the mechanism of action of low dose BaP in a non-model organism (tilapia).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the use of a neuron-specific promoter to generate the Tg mice, they expressed significant levels of H-apoD in both plasma and liver and they slowly develop hepatic steatosis and . We show here that hepatic PPARγ expression in Tg mice is increased by 2-fold compared to wild type (WT) mice. Consequently, PPARγ target genes Plin2 and Cide A/C are overexpressed, leading to increased lipid droplets formation. Expression of the fatty  transporter CD36, another PPARgamma target, is also increased in Tg mice associated with elevated fatty  uptake as measured in primary hepatocytes. Elevated expression of AMPK in the liver of Tg leads to phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase, indicating a decreased activity of the enzyme. Fatty  synthase expression is also induced but the hepatic lipogenesis measured in vivo is not significantly different between WT and Tg mice. In addition, expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, is slightly upregulated. Finally, we show that overexpressing H-apoD in HepG2 cells in presence of  (AA), the main apoD ligand, increases the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. Supporting the role of apoD in AA transport, we observed enrichment in hepatic AA and a decrease in plasmatic AA concentration. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hepatic steatosis observed in apoD Tg mice is a consequence of increased PPARγ transcriptional activity by AA leading to increased fatty  uptake by the liver.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28699199>Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, serum zinc, delta-5- and delta-6-desaturase activities and incident metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>The associations of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with metabolic syndrome have been poorly explored. We investigated the associations of the serum n-6 PUFA and the activities of enzymes involved in the PUFA metabolism, delta-5-desaturase (D5D) and delta-6-desaturase (D6D) with risk of incident metabolic syndrome. We also investigated whether zinc, a cofactor for these enzymes, modifies these associations.A prospective follow-up study was conducted on 661 men who were aged 42-60 years old at baseline in 1984-1989 and who were re-examined in 1998-2001.Men in the highest versus the lowest serum total omega-6 PUFA tertile had a 70% lower multivariate-adjusted risk of incident metabolic syndrome [odds ratio (OR) = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18-0.51, P < 0.001]. Inverse associations were also observed for linoleic ,  and D5D activity. By contrast, men in the highest tertile of D6D activity had an 84% higher risk (OR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.15-2.94, P = 0.008). Similar associations were observed with many of the metabolic syndrome components at the re-examinations. Most associations were attenuated after adjustment for body mass index. Finally, the associations of D6D and LA were stronger among those with a higher serum zinc concentration.Higher serum total n-6 PUFA, linoleic  and  concentrations and D5D activity were associated with a lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome and higher D6D activity was associated with a higher risk.

Fetal programming is characterized by adaptive responses to specific environmental conditions during early life stages, which may alter gene expression and permanently affect the structure and function of several organs and tissues, thus influencing the susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Regarding lipid metabolism during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, the maternal body accumulates fat, whereas in late pregnancy, the lipolytic activity in the maternal adipose tissue is increased. However, an excess or deficiency of certain fatty acids may lead to adverse consequences to the fetuses and newborns. Fetal exposure to trans fatty acids appears to promote early deleterious effects in the offspring's health, thereby increasing the individual risk for developing metabolic diseases throughout life. Similarly, the maternal intake of saturated fatty acids seems to trigger alterations in the liver and adipose tissue function associated with  and diabetes. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly long-chain PUFAs (long-chain PUFA-, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ), play an important and beneficial physiologic role in the offspring who receive this fatty  during critical periods of development. Therefore, the maternal nutritional condition and fatty  intake during pregnancy and/or lactation are critical factors that are strongly associated with normal fetal and postnatal development, which influence the modifications in fetal programming and in the individual risk for developing metabolic diseases throughout life.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Through untargeted metabolomics (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS), we analyzed the fasting serum of subjects with high IR and/or obesity ( n = 64). An partial least-squares discriminant analysis with orthogonal signal correction followed by univariate statistics and enrichment analysis allowed exploration of these metabolic profiles. A multivariate regression method (LASSO) was used for variable selection and a predictive biomarker model to identify subjects with high IR regardless of obesity was built. Adrenic  and a dyglyceride (DG) were shared by high IR and obesity.

DGs and adrenic  differed in concordant/discordant phenotypes, thereby revealing protective mechanisms against high IR also in obesity. A biomarker model formed by DGs, uric and adrenic acids presented a high predictive power to identify subjects with high IR [AUC 80.1% (68.9-91.4)]. These findings could become relevant for diabetes risk detection and unveil new potential targets in therapeutic treatments of IR, diabetes, and obesity.

The genetic factors may be associated with the diminished antiplatelet efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy. We investigated the possible association between  receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) polymorphisms and high platelet reactivity in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A total of 674 CAD patients with T2DM were enrolled in this study. Platelet aggregation and platelet activation were assessed with light transmission aggregometry and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Participants were divided into high platelet reactivity (HPR) group and non-HPR group according to their maximal platelet aggregation. Genotypes were identified by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. The association between IRS-1 genetic variants and platelet function was assessed.There were 233 participants in the HPR group and 441 participants in the non-HPR group. G allele frequencies of rs13431554 were 27.7 % for the HPR group and 18.6 % for the non-HPR group (p < 0.001).

Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are key enzymes that catalysis prostaglandin synthesis from . COX2 is an inducible COX isoform and that plays an important role in inflammatory process by leading the synthesis of pro- and anti- inflammatory prostaglandins.

In this study, we evaluated rs5275 and rs689466 variants located on the COX-2 gene by PCR-RFLP in 100 T2DM patients and 100 control subjects. The interaction among COX2 variants and T2DM was analyzed using appropriate methods. The both variants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls (p > 0.05).

Lipoxins are endogenously generated from , and exhibit anti-inflammatory actions. Currently, there is no available cohort study identifying the association between serum lipoxins level and MetS. Here we investigate the relationship between serum lipoxin A4 (LXA4) level and the risk of incident MetS in a middle-aged Chinese population. A total 624 participants aged 40-65 years were enrolled at baseline, with 417 (including 333 MetS absence) of them were followed up at 2.5 years. Abdominal visceral fat area (VFA) and abdominal subcutaneous fat area (SFA) were determined using MRI. Serum lipoxin A4 levels were measured by ELISA. At baseline, serum LXA4 levels were significantly correlated with a cluster of traditional MetS risk factors related to obesity (P ≤ 0.05). A higher incidence of new Mets was found in the participants of the lowest tertile of LXA4 levels as compared with that in participants of the highest tertile (P = 0.025). Low serum LXA4 levels [OR 2.607(1.151-5.909), P = 0.022] and high VFA [OR 2.571(1.176-5.620), P = 0.018] were associated with an increased incident Mets, respectively, which remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, gender, current smoking, and alcohol drinking status. Logistic regression analysis suggested a combination of low serum LXA4 levels and high WC/VFA might optimize the prediction of incident Mets in middle-aged Chinese population [OR 4.897/4.967, P = 0.009/0.003]. Decrease in serum LXA4 level and increase in VFA are independent predictors of incident Mets in a population-based cohort, and a combination of them enhances the prognostic value of incident Mets. Taken together, our data suggest that serum LXA4 levels might be useful for early detection and prevention of Mets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246383>Study of the metabolomics characteristics of patients with metabolic syndrome based on liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a disease with complex pathophysiology and pathogenesis involving multiple systems of the human body. This study aimed to identify serum metabolites that are relevant to MS.This study involved 40 patients with MS and 28 healthy adults, and the following data were statistically analyzed: basic clinical data, blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, and visceral fat coefficient. Serum samples from both groups were collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF/MS); multivariate and univariate statistical methods were used to identify potential MS biomarkers and MS-related metabolic pathways. In addition, leucine and valine levels in serum from MS patients and normal subjects were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).In this study, 23 potential biomarkers were identified in the plasma of MS patients. These biomarkers were mainly related to metabolism; the tricarboxylic  cycle; galactose metabolism;  metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation; and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. ELISAs were utilized to verify serum leucine and valine levels, and the results supported the experimental metabolomics results.In total, 23 MS-related metabolites were identified in the serum; these differential metabolites were mainly associated with lipid metabolism, amino  metabolism, glucose metabolism, purine metabolism, and other related metabolic pathways. This study shows that LC/MS-based metabolomics methods can be used to investigate the pathological changes in MS patients and identify biomarkers for the early diagnosis of MS.Copyright © 2017.

Hepatic ACSL4 is coregulated with the phospholipid (PL)-remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) acyltransferase 3 by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ to modulate the plasma triglyceride (TG) metabolism. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of hepatic ACSL4 deficiency on lipid metabolism in adult mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Adenovirus-mediated expression of a mouse ACSL4 shRNA (Ad-shAcsl4) in the liver of HFD-fed mice led to a 43% reduction of hepatic arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity and a 53% decrease in ACSL4 protein levels compared with mice receiving control adenovirus (Ad-shLacZ). Attenuated ACSL4 expression resulted in a substantial decrease in circulating VLDL-TG levels without affecting plasma cholesterol. Lipidomics profiling revealed that knocking down ACSL4 altered liver PL compositions, with the greatest impact on accumulation of abundant LPC species (LPC 16:0 and LPC 18:0) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species (LPE 16:0 and LPE 18:0). In addition, fasting glucose and  levels were higher in Ad-shAcsl4-transduced mice versus control (Ad-shLacZ). Glucose tolerance testing further indicated an -resistant phenotype upon knockdown of ACSL4.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells because of enhanced production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immunocytes infiltrating the pancreas in response to unknown exogenous and endogenous toxin(s). On the other hand, type 2 DM is due to increased peripheral  secondary to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-α in response to high-fat and/or calorie-rich diet (rich in saturated and trans fats). Type 2 DM is also associated with significant alterations in the production and action of hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, BDNF, free radicals, gut hormones, and vagus nerve activity. Thus, type 1 DM is because of excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines close to β cells, whereas type 2 DM is due to excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation. Hence, methods designed to suppress excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may form a new approach to prevent both type 1 and type 2 DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and similar surgeries ameliorate type 2 DM, partly by restoring to normal: gut hormones, hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, vagal activity, gut microbiota, bioactive lipids, BDNF production in the gut and hypothalamus, concentrations of cytokines and free radicals that results in resetting glucose-stimulated  production by pancreatic β cells. Our recent studies suggested that bioactive lipids, such as , eicosapentaneoic , and docosahexaenoic  (which are unsaturated fatty acids) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites: lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, may have antidiabetic actions. These bioactive lipids have anti-inflammatory actions, enhance eNO, BDNF production, restore hypothalamic dysfunction, enhance vagal tone, modulate production and action of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin, and influence gut microbiota that may explain their antidiabetic action. These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic β cells, gut, liver, and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466985>Association between plasma fatty acids and inflammatory markers in patients with and without  and in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a cross-sectional study.</a></h2><p>Proinflammatory biomarkers levels are increased among patients with cardiovascular disease, and it is known that both the presence of  and diet may influence those levels. However, these associations are not well studied among patients with established cardiovascular disease. Our objective is to compare inflammatory biomarker levels among cardiovascular disease secondary prevention patients with and without , and to evaluate if there is any association between plasma fatty  levels and inflammatory biomarker levels among them.In this cross-sectional sub-study from the BALANCE Program Trial, we collected data from 359 patients with established cardiovascular disease. Plasma fatty acids and inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) were measured. Biomarkers and plasma fatty  levels of subjects across  resistant and not  resistant groups were compared, and general linear models were used to examine the association between plasma fatty acids and inflammatory biomarkers.Subjects with  had a higher concentration of hs-CRP (p = 0.002) and IL-6 (p = 0.002) than subjects without .

ARASCO oil was administered orally for the first 7 d consecutively, followed by once weekly throughout the study (14 wk). At various time points, blood glucose and body weight and oral glucose tolerance tests were measured. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed to collect plasma and various organs and stored at -80°C. Plasma , tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and lipoxin A4 were measured. Expression of the following genes was determined: nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) in pancreas and lipocalin 2 (LPCLN2) in adipose tissue. Various antioxidants were measured in the plasma and other tissues. Area under the curve and  sensitivity index were assessed by computing homeostatic model of assessment for , quantitative  check index, Matsuda, and Belfiore indices.ARASCO oil treatment decreased hyperglycemia, restored  sensitivity, suppressed inflammation, enhanced plasma lipoxin A4 levels, and reversed altered antioxidant status to near normal in animals with HFD + STZ-induced diabetes.These results suggest that ARASCO, a rich source of AA, can prevent HFD + STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar rats owing to its anti-inflammatory action. It remains to be seen whether ARASCO oil is useful in preventing or postponing the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Although fructose consumption has increased globally and is linked to metabolic syndrome, little is known about the long-term effects of maternal high-fructose (HF) exposure during gestation and lactation, especially on renal programming. We examined potential key genes and pathways that are associated with HF-induced renal programming using whole-genome RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify the abundance of RNA transcripts in kidneys from 1-day-, 3-week-, and 3-month-old male offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received regular chow or chow supplemented with HF (60% diet by weight) during the entire period of pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring exhibited programmed hypertension at 3 months of age. Maternal HF intake modified over 200 renal transcripts from nephrogenesis stage to adulthood. We observed that 20 differentially expressed genes identified in 1-day-old kidney are related to regulation of blood pressure. Among them, Hmox1, Bdkrb2, Adra2b, Ptgs2, Col1a2 and Tbxa2r are associated with endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). NGS also identified genes in  metabolism (Cyp2c23, Hpgds, Ptgds and Ptges) that may be potential key genes/pathways contributing to renal programming and hypertension. Collectively, our NGS data suggest that maternal HF intake elicits a defective adaptation of interrelated EDHFs during nephrogenesis which may lead to renal programming and hypertension in later life. Moreover, our results highlight genes and pathways involved in renal programming as potential targets for therapeutic approaches to prevent metabolic-syndrome-related comorbidities in children with HF exposure in early life.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) and plasma fatty acids were measured at baseline and after 3 years.After 3 years, the overweight group showed greater increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, , homeostasis model assessment- index and ba-PWV values (P = .009) than the normal-weight group. In addition, greater reductions in eicosapentaenoic  (C20:3, n-3, EPA; P = .009) and the EPA/ (C20:4, n-6, AA) ratio (P = .001) were found in the overweight group. Multivariate analyses revealed that changes in (Δ) ba-PWV were significantly and positively associated with baseline BMI values and ΔAA/linoleic  ratios (C18:2, n-6, LA) and negatively associated with ΔEPA/AA ratios. In a subanalysis using baseline BMI values, Δba-PWV correlated strongly and negatively with ΔEPA/AA ratios (r = -0.595, P < .001) and positively with ΔAA/LA ratios (r = 0.455, P < .001) in the overweight group.This study suggests that the persistence of overweight over 3 years in subjects ≥50 years old is associated with faster arterial stiffening than is observed in normal-weight subjects and that this stiffening is independently associated with increases in AA/LA and decreases in EPA/AA ratios.Copyright © 2016 National Lipid Association.

LA is known to induce obesity and . In this study, two concentrations of LA with or without added glucose (G) were fed to mice to investigate their effects on endocannabinoid (EC) biology.Four groups of C57BL/6 mice were provided with diets containing 1% or 8% LA with or without added G (LAG) for 8 weeks. Body weights, food intake, circulating glucose and  levels were measured throughout the study. Following euthanasia, plasma, bowel and hepatic ECs, monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels (enzymes responsible for EC degradation) and transcriptional activity of PPARα in liver were quantified. Liver was probed for evidence of  receptor activity perturbation.Increasing dietary LA from 1% to 8% significantly increased circulating, small bowel and hepatic ECs. 1%LAG fed mice had lowest feed efficiency, and only liver levels of both ECs were reduced by addition of G. Addition of G to 1% LA diets resulted in elevated monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty  amide hydroxylase protein levels ( < 0.001 and  < 0.001, respectively) in liver due to increased transcriptional activity of PPARα ( < 0.05). The reduced EC levels with addition of G also correlated with a measure of enhanced  action.In conclusion, body weight of mice is influenced by the source of calorie intake. Furthermore, tissue EC/g are dependent on tissue-specific synthesis and degradation that are modulated by dietary LA and G which also influence food efficiency, and down-stream  signalling pathways.

Relatively little is known about factors outside the central nervous system that may mediate the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on brain endocannabinoid levels. One candidate is the liver fatty  binding protein (FABP1), a cytosolic protein highly prevalent in liver, but not detected in brain, which facilitates hepatic clearance of fatty acids. The impact of Fabp1 gene ablation (LKO) on the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on brain and plasma endocannabinoid levels was examined and data expressed for each parameter as the ratio of high-fat diet/control diet. In male wild-type mice, HFD markedly increased brain N-acylethanolamides, but not 2-monoacylglycerols. LKO blocked these effects of HFD in male mice. In female wild-type mice, HFD slightly decreased or did not alter these endocannabinoids as compared with male wild type. LKO did not block the HFD effects in female mice. The HFD-induced increase in brain -derived arachidonoylethanolamide in males correlated with increased brain-free and total . The ability of LKO to block the HFD-induced increase in brain arachidonoylethanolamide correlated with reduced ability of HFD to increase brain-free and total  in males. In females, brain-free and total  levels were much less affected by either HFD or LKO in the context of HFD. These data showed that LKO markedly diminished the impact of HFD on brain endocannabinoid levels, especially in male mice.© 2016 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29398618>A role for long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) in diet-induced phospholipid remodeling and obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction.</a></h2><p>Regulation of fatty  (FA) metabolism is central to adipocyte dysfunction during diet-induced obesity (DIO). Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-4 (ACSL4) has been hypothesized to modulate the metabolic fates of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), including  (AA), but the in vivo actions of ACSL4 are unknown. The purpose of our studies was to determine the in vivo role of adipocyte ACSL4 in regulating obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction.We developed a novel mouse model with adipocyte-specific ablation of ACSL4 (Ad-KO) using loxP Cre recombinase technology. Metabolic phenotyping of Ad-KO mice relative to their floxed littermates (ACSL4) was performed, including body weight and body composition over time;  and glucose tolerance tests; and energy expenditure, activity, and food intake in metabolic cages. Adipocytes were isolated for ex vivo adipocyte oxygen consumption by Clark electrode and lipidomics analysis. In vitro adipocyte analysis including oxygen consumption by Seahorse and real-time PCR analysis were performed to confirm our in vivo findings.Ad-KO mice were protected against DIO, adipocyte death, and metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) had reduced incorporation of AA into phospholipids (PL), free AA, and levels of the AA lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed HFD had reduced p53 activation and increased adipocyte oxygen consumption (OCR), which we demonstrated are direct effects of 4-HNE on adipocytes in vitro.These studies are the first to elucidate ACSL4's in vivo actions to regulate the incorporation of AA into PL and downstream effects on DIO-associated adipocyte dysfunction. By reducing the incorporation of AA into PL and free fatty  pools in adipocytes, Ad-KO mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced increases in adipose and liver fat accumulation, adipocyte death, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) inflammation, and  (IR). Additionally, deficiency of adipocyte ACSL4 expression in mice fed a HFD resulted in increased gWAT adipocyte OCR and whole body energy expenditure (EE).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor,  (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme, fatty  amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the liver and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26302954>Long-term effect of early postnatal overnutrition on  and serum fatty  profiles in male rats.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence suggests that overnutrition during the early postnatal period, a critical window of development, increases the risk of adult-onset obesity and . In this study, we investigated the impact of overnutrition during the suckling period on body weight, serum biochemistry and serum fatty  metabolomics in male rats.Rats raised in small litters (SL, 3 pups/dam) and normal litters (NL, 10 pups/dam) were used to model early postnatal overnutrition and control, respectively. Serum glucose, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, free fatty ,  and leptin concentrations were assayed using standard biochemical techniques. Serum fatty acids were identified and quantified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach. mRNA and protein levels of key components of the  receptor signaling pathway were measured in epididymal fat and gastrocnemius muscle by quantitative PCR and western blotting.SL rats were 37.3 % and 15.1 % heavier than NL rats at weaning and 16-weeks-old, respectively. They had increased visceral fat mass, adult-onset  and glucose intolerance as well as elevated serum levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides. All detectable fatty acids were elevated in the serum of SL pups at weaning compared to NL controls, and significant increases in the levels of four fatty acids (palmitic , palmitoleic , oleic  and ) persisted into adulthood. Moreover, a significantly positive correlation was identified between an  index (HOMA-IR) and concentrations of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and oleic  in serum at postnatal 16 weeks. Early postnatal overnutrition also resulted in a significant downregulation of  receptor substrate-1 (Irs-1), protein kinase B (Akt2) and glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) at the protein level in epididymal fat of SL rats at 16 weeks, accompanied by decreased mRNA levels for Irs-1 and Glut4. In gastrocnemius muscle, Akt2 and Glut4 mRNA and Glut4 protein levels were significantly decreased in SL rats.This study demonstrates that early postnatal overnutrition can have long-lasting effects on body weight and serum fatty  profiles and can lead to impaired  signaling pathway in visceral white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which may play a major role in IR.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29362766>Effects of calorie restriction plus fish oil supplementation on abnormal metabolic characteristics and the iron status of middle-aged obese women.</a></h2><p>The increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles has led to a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) worldwide as well as in Taiwan. Middle-aged women are at a greater risk of MetS, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than men because they have more subcutaneous fat and larger waist circumferences compared with men with equal visceral fat levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of calorie restriction (CR) and fish oil supplementation (CRF) on middle-aged Taiwanese women with MetS. An open-label, parallel-arm, controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. A total of 75 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the CR or CRF group. Both the dietary intervention groups were further divided into two age groups: ≤45 and >45 years. Changes in MetS severity, inflammatory status, iron status, and red blood cell fatty  profile were evaluated. A total of 71 participants completed the trial. Both dietary interventions significantly ameliorated MetS and improved the participants' inflammatory status. CR significantly increased the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) whereas CRF increased hepcidin levels in women aged >45 years. Furthermore, CRF significantly increased the n-6/n-3 and /docosahexaenoic  ratios. Both interventions improved the anthropometric and MetS characteristics, including body weight, blood glucose and triglyceride levels, and the score of the homeostasis model assessment of  and quantitative  sensitivity check index. In conclusion, the 12-week dietary interventions improved the abnormal metabolic status of middle-aged obese women.

In this study, the antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was investigated by metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Fenugreek flavonoids were purified using polyamide resin and D101 macroporous adsorption resin, characterized by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and administered to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats for 28 days. Pharmacological study results indicated that fenugreek flavonoids exerted a strong antidiabetic effect characterized by significant reduction of fasting blood glucose (P < 0.01), increase in serum  level (P < 0.01) and liver glycogen content (P < 0.01), attenuation of weight loss, and improvement of pancreatic islet and kidney conditions. The antidiabetic effect of fenugreek flavonoids was further analyzed by metabonomics. Serum samples of health and diabetic rats treated or not with fenugreek flavonoids were evaluated by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The PCA model revealed significant differences among the animal groups, and OPLS-DA identified fenugreek flavonoids-induced changes of 11 potential biomarkers involved in lipid metabolism (docosahexaenoic , , sphinganine, sphingosine‑1‑phosphate, and lysophosphatidylcholines 20:4, 18:2, 16:0, and 20:2), amino  metabolism (hippuric  and tryptophan), and kidney function-related metabolism (2‑phenylethanol glucuronide). Our study demonstrates that flavonoids are bioactive components of fenugreek with potent antidiabetic activity, which exert their therapeutic effects by multiple mechanisms, including reducing , improving gluconeogenesis, and protecting islet cells and kidneys from damage.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant.

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and . Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular inflammation, leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation and improving metabolic risk factors.

Our aim was to test whether DHA and AA-enriched lipid emulsions would increase activity, growth, and neurodevelopment in preterm piglets and limit brain inflammation. Cesarean-delivered preterm pigs were given three weeks of either enteral preterm infant formula (ENT) or TPN with one of three parenteral lipid emulsions: Intralipid (IL), SMOFlipid (SMOF) or an experimental emulsion (EXP). Activity was continuously monitored and weekly blood sampling and behavioral field testing performed. At termination of the study, whole body and tissue metrics were collected. Neuronal density was assessed in sections of hippocampus (HC), thalamus, and cortex. Frontal cortex (FC) and HC tissue were assayed for fatty  profiles and expression of genes of neuronal growth and inflammation. After 3 weeks of treatment, brain DHA content in SMOF, EXP and ENT pigs was higher (P < 0.01) in FC but not HC vs. IL pigs. There were no differences in brain weight or neuron density among treatment groups. Inflammatory cytokine TNFα and IL-1β expression in brain regions were increased in IL pigs (P < 0.05) compared to other groups. Overall growth velocity was similar among groups, but IL pigs had higher percent body fat and increased  compared to other treatments (P < 0.05). ENT pigs spent more time in higher physical activity levels compared to all TPN groups, but there were no differences in exploratory behavior among groups.

Cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5), an important enzyme in mouse liver, metabolizes many drugs and activates multiple pro-carcinogens with widely varying structures. According to the changes in liver fatty  profiles observed in NAFLD animal models developed in our laboratory and others, saturated (PA/palmitic, and SA/stearic acids) and unsaturated (OA/oleic, LA/linoleic, ALA/α-linolenic and AA/ acids) fatty acids were selected to induce mouse primary hepatocytes, at concentrations under 1 mM, as detected by MTT assay. After 24 h treatment with various fatty  concentrations and types, CYP2A5 mRNA and protein amounts, and enzyme activity were determined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and Coumarin 7-hydroxylation, respectively. Meanwhile, Nrf2 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. The results indicated that saturated fatty acids are more potent in inducing CYP2A5 than unsaturated ones, except . In addition, the changes in CYP2A5 expression were consistent with the alterations observed in Nrf2 expression, indicating that Nrf2 might play a regulatory role in CYP2A5 expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639852>The Frequency of Fish-Eating Could Negatively Associate with Visceral Adiposity in Those Who Eat Moderately.</a></h2><p>Visceral fat accumulation is regarded as one of the major phenotypes of metabolic syndrome. There have not been enough data on the relationship between the fish-eating habit and visceral adiposity. A total of 94 male participants received abdominal CT for the measurement of the visceral fat area (VFA), serum sampling for the fatty  composition and questionnaires about their life-style. We divided the participants into two groups: whether they ate their fill (group F, n=70) or they ate in moderation (group M, n=24). Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed that usual alcohol consumption and lower daily physical activity in group F, and infrequent fish-eating and frequent fat-rich deserts in group M were the significant positive correlates with the VFA. The serum eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)/ (AA) ratio showed significant correlation with the frequency of fish-eating in both groups. Interestingly, in group M, the serum EPA/AA ratio negatively correlated with the VFA, while it failed in group F. In conclusion, the present data suggest that the fish-eating habit might negatively associate with visceral fat accumulation only in those who are moderate in eating in the general population.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25389363>CYP2J2 attenuates metabolic dysfunction in diabetic mice by reducing hepatic inflammation via the PPARγ.</a></h2><p>Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and -derived cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase metabolites have diverse biological effects, including anti-inflammatory properties in the vasculature. Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation in type 2 diabetes is a key component in the development of . In this study, we investigated whether CYP epoxygenase expression and exogenous EETs can attenuate  in diabetic db/db mice and in cultured hepatic cells (HepG2). In vivo, CYP2J2 expression and the accompanying increase in EETs attenuated , as determined by plasma glucose levels, glucose tolerance test,  tolerance test, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. CYP2J2 expression reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in liver, including CRP, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα, and decreased the infiltration of macrophages in liver. CYP2J2 expression also decreased activation of proinflammatory signaling cascades by decreasing NF-κB and MAPK activation in hepatocytes. Interestingly, CYP2J2 expression and exogenous EET treatment increased glucose uptake and activated the -signaling cascade both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that CYP2J2 metabolites play a role in glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, CYP2J2 expression upregulated PPARγ, which has been shown to induce adipogenesis, which attenuates dyslipidemias observed in diabetes. All of the findings suggest that CYP2J2 expression attenuates the diabetic phenotype and  via inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways and activation of PPARγ.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29869155>High ApoD protein level in the round ligament fat depot of severely obese women is associated with an improved inflammatory profile.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a lipocalin participating in lipid transport. It binds to a variety of ligands, with a higher affinity for , and is thought to have a diverse array of functions. We investigated a potential role for ApoD in  sensitivity, inflammation, and thrombosis-processes related to lipid metabolism-in severely obese women.We measured ApoD expression in a cohort of 44 severely obese women including dysmetabolic and non-dysmetabolic patients. Physical and metabolic characteristics of these women were determined from anthropometric measurements and blood samples. ApoD was quantified at the mRNA and protein levels in samples from three intra-abdominal adipose tissues (AT): omental, mesenteric and round ligament (RL).ApoD protein levels were highly variable between AT of the same individual. High ApoD protein levels, particularly in the RL depot, were linked to lower plasma  levels (-40%, p = 0.015) and  (-47%, p = 0.022), and increased  sensitivity (+10%, p = 0.008). Lower circulating pro-inflammatory PAI-1 (-39%, p = 0.001), and TNF-α (-19%, p = 0.030) levels were also correlated to high ApoD protein in the RL AT.ApoD variability between AT was consistent with different accumulation efficiencies and/or metabolic functions according to the anatomic location of fat depots. Most statistically significant correlations implicated ApoD protein levels, in agreement with protein accumulation in target tissues. These correlations associated higher ApoD levels in fat depots with improved metabolic health in severely obese women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30135309>Chronic kidney disease attenuates the plasma metabolome response to .</a></h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to decreased sensitivity to the metabolic effects of , contributing to protein energy wasting and muscle atrophy.

Using targeted metabolomics profiling, we examined the plasma metabolome in 95 adults without diabetes in the fasted state (58 with CKD, 37 with normal glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We assessed heterogeneity in fasting metabolites and the response to  to identify potential metabolic pathways linking CKD with . Baseline differences and effect modification by CKD status on changes with  clamp testing were adjusted for confounders.

Fasted-state differences between CKD and controls included abnormalities in tryptophan metabolism, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and the TCA cycle.  infusion markedly decreased metabolite levels, predominantly amino acids and their metabolites. CKD was associated with attenuated -induced changes in nicotinamide, , and glutamine/glutamate metabolic pathways.

The effects of EETs in cardiovascular physiology are vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory and anti‑apoptotic, which are opposite to the function to 20‑HETE. However, EETs are not stable in vivo, and are rapidly degraded to the biologically less active metabolites, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, via soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Western blotting, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were performed in order to determine target RNA and protein expression levels. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the disturbed renal 20‑HETE/EET ratio in the hypertensive cytochrome P450 4F2 transgenic mice was caused by the activation of sEH and the repression of epoxygenase activity. In addition, 20‑HETE showed an opposite regulatory effect on the endogenous epoxygenases in the liver and kidney. Given that 20‑HETE and EETs have opposite effects in multiple disease, the regulation of their formation and degradation may yield therapeutic benefits.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28352940>Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids contribute to  sensitivity in mice and in humans.</a></h2><p> is frequently associated with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The cytochrome P450 (CYP)  epoxygenases (CYP2C, CYP2J) and their epoxyeicosatrienoic  (EET) products lower blood pressure and may also improve glucose homeostasis. However, the direct contribution of endogenous EET production on  sensitivity has not been previously investigated. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous CYP2C-derived EETs alter  sensitivity by analysing mice lacking CYP2C44, a major EET producing enzyme, and by testing the association of plasma EETs with  sensitivity in humans.We assessed  sensitivity in wild-type (WT) and Cyp2c44  mice using hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and isolated skeletal muscle.  secretory function was assessed using hyperglycaemic clamps and isolated islets. Vascular function was tested in isolated perfused mesenteric vessels.  sensitivity and secretion were assessed in humans using frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests and plasma EETs were measured by mass spectrometry.Cyp2c44  mice showed decreased glucose tolerance (639 ± 39.5 vs 808 ± 37.7 mmol/l × min for glucose tolerance tests, p = 0.004) and  sensitivity compared with WT controls (hyperinsulinaemic clamp glucose infusion rate average during terminal 30 min 0.22 ± 0.02 vs 0.33 ± 0.01 mmol kg min in WT and Cyp2c44  mice respectively, p = 0.003). Although glucose uptake was diminished in Cyp2c44  mice in vivo (gastrocnemius R 16.4 ± 2.0 vs 6.2 ± 1.7 μmol 100 g min, p < 0.01) -stimulated glucose uptake was unchanged ex vivo in isolated skeletal muscle. Capillary density was similar but vascular K-induced relaxation was impaired in isolated Cyp2c44  vessels (maximal response 39.3 ± 6.5% of control, p < 0.001), suggesting that impaired vascular reactivity produces impaired  sensitivity in vivo. Similarly, plasma EETs positively correlated with  sensitivity in human participants.CYP2C-derived EETs contribute to  sensitivity in mice and in humans. Interventions to increase circulating EETs in humans could provide a novel approach to improve  sensitivity and treat hypertension.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070664>The Epoxyeicosatrienoic  Pathway Enhances Hepatic  Signaling and is Repressed in -Resistant Mouse Liver.</a></h2><p>Although it is widely accepted that ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver is associated with hepatic , the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been well characterized.Here we employed time resolved quantitative proteomic profiling of mice fed a high fat diet to determine which pathways were affected during the transition of the liver to an -resistant state. We identified several metabolic pathways underlying altered protein expression. In order to test the functional impact of a critical subset of these alterations, we focused on the epoxyeicosatrienoic  (EET) eicosanoid pathway, whose deregulation coincided with the onset of hepatic . These results suggested that EETs may be positive modulators of hepatic  signaling. Analyzing EET activity in primary hepatocytes, we found that EETs enhance  signaling on the level of Akt. In contrast, EETs did not influence  receptor or  receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation. This effect was mediated through the eicosanoids, as overexpression of the deregulated enzymes in absence of  had no impact on  signaling. The stimulation of  signaling by EETs and depression of the pathway in  resistant liver suggest a likely role in hepatic .

EPA and DHA are synthesized from the precursor alpha-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3n-3), whereas AA is produced from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n-6) through the action of Δ5 and Δ6-desaturases. High-fat diet (HFD) decreases the activity of both desaturases and LCPUFA accretion in liver and other tissues. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), a natural antioxidant, has an important cytoprotective effects in different cells and tissues.Male mice C57BL/6 J were fed a control diet (CD) (10% fat, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates) or a HFD (60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) for 12 weeks. Animals were daily supplemented with saline (CD) or 5 mg HT (HFD), and blood and the studied tissues were analyzed after the HT intervention. Parameters studied included liver histology (optical microscopy), activity of hepatic desaturases 5 and 6 (gas-liquid chromatography of methyl esters derivatives) and antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase by spectrophotometry), oxidative stress indicators (glutathione, thiobarbituric  reactants, and the antioxidant capacity of plasma), gene expression assays for sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) (qPCR and ELISA), and LCPUFA profiles in liver, erythrocyte, brain, heart, and testicle (gas-liquid chromatography).HFD led to  and liver steatosis associated with SREBP-1c upregulation, with enhancement in plasma and liver oxidative stress status and diminution in the synthesis and storage of n-6 and n-3 LCPUFAs in the studied tissues, compared to animals given control diet. HT supplementation significantly reduced fat accumulation in liver and plasma as well as tissue metabolic alterations induced by HFD. Furthermore, a normalization of desaturase activities, oxidative stress-related parameters, and tissue n-3 LCPUFA content was observed in HT-treated rats over control animals.HT supplementation prevents metabolic alterations in desaturase activities, oxidative stress status, and n-3 LCPUFA content in the liver and extrahepatic tissues of mice fed HFD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29882756>Short-Term Exposure to High Sucrose Levels near Weaning Has a Similar Long-Lasting Effect on Hypertension as a Long-Term Exposure in Rats.</a></h2><p>Adverse conditions during early developmental stages permanently modify the metabolic function of organisms through epigenetic changes. Exposure to high sugar diets during gestation and/or lactation affects susceptibility to metabolic syndrome or hypertension in adulthood. The effect of a high sugar diet for shorter time lapses remains unclear. Here we studied the effect of short-term sucrose ingestion near weaning (postnatal days 12 and 28) (STS) and its effect after long-term ingestion, for a period of seven months (LTS) in rats. Rats receiving sucrose for seven months develop metabolic syndrome (MS). The mechanisms underlying hypertension in this model and those that underlie the effects of short-term exposure have not been studied. We explore NO and endothelin-1 concentration, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, fatty  participation and the involvement of oxidative stress (OS) after LTS and STS. Blood pressure increased to similar levels in adult rats that received sucrose during short- and long-term glucose exposure. The endothelin-1 concentration increased only in LTS rats. eNOS and SOD2 expression determined by Western blot and total antioxidant capacity were diminished in both groups. Saturated fatty acids and  were only decreased in LTS rats. In conclusion, a high-sugar diet during STS increases the hypertension predisposition in adulthood to as high a level as LTS, and the mechanisms involved have similarities (participation of OS and eNOS and SOD expression) and differences (fatty acids and  only participate in LTS and an elevated level of endothelin-1 was only found in LTS) in both conditions. Changes in the diet during short exposure times in early developmental stages have long-lasting effects in determining hypertension susceptibility.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982448>Fatty  Content of Plasma Triglycerides May Contribute to the Heterogeneity in the Relationship Between Abdominal Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>About one-third of the people with abdominal obesity do not exhibit the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Fatty acids in plasma triglycerides (TGs) may help to explain part of this heterogeneity. This study compared TG fatty  profile of adults with and without abdominal obesity and examined the associations of these fatty acids with MetS components.Fifty-four abdominally obese subjects were matched by age and sex with 54 adults without abdominal obesity. People were classified with MetS according to the harmonizing criteria for MetS. Fatty acids in plasma TGs were analyzed by gas chromatography.There were no differences in fatty acids of plasma TGs between people with and without abdominal obesity. However, there were differences between abdominally obese people with and without MetS. The abdominally obese group with MetS had higher palmitic (+2.9%; P = 0.012) and oleic (+4.0%; P = 0.001) acids and lower linoleic (-6.4%; P = 0.018) and  (-1.2%; P = 0.004) acids. After adjustment for abdominal obesity, age, and sex, a stepwise regression analysis showed that palmitic  positively contributed to the variance in  (β = +1.08 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and homeostasis model assessment of  (HOMA-IR) index (β = +1.09 ± 1.01; P = 0.000) and myristic  positively contributed to the variance in systolic blood pressure (β = +1.09 ± 1.03; P = 0.006). In contrast, linoleic  negatively contributed to the variance in glucose (β = -0.321 ± 0.09; P = 0.001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β = -1.05 ± 1.01; P = 0.000).There were no differences in the plasma TG fatty  profile between people with and without abdominal obesity.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) measured visceral fat area (VFA) and the ratio of CT attenuation for liver to spleen (L/S).The L/S ratio showed significant correlations with serum DGLA level and D5D activity (p<0.0001 for both). Serum DGLA level and D5D activity were significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) or VFA, and with Homeostasis Model Assessment- (HOMA-IR) (p<0.0001 for all). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that a high DGLA level or low D5D activity was a significant determinant for hepatic steatosis (p<0.0001 for both) independent of BMI and HOMA-IR. ROC analysis revealed that they significantly enhanced the value of MetS-related factors in predicting hepatic steatosis (p<0.05 for both).A high DGLA level and low D5D activity in serum lipids may be useful markers predicting hepatic steatosis incrementally to MetS-related conventional factors.Copyright © 2016 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.

On the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  (omega 3), and  (omega 6) have shown anti-inflammatory properties. Lately, an inverse relationship between omega-3 fatty acids, inflammation, obesity and CVDs has been demonstrated. To check fatty acids effect, the levels of some inflammation biomarkers have been analyzed. Leptin, adiponectin and resistin represent a group of hormones associated with the development of CVDs, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and  and are modified in obese/overweight people comparing to normal weight people. Omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to decrease the production of inflammatory mediators, having a positive effect in obesity and diabetes mellitus type-2. Moreover, they significantly decrease the appearance of CVD risk factors. Regarding omega-6 PUFA, there is controversy whether their effects are pro- or anti-inflammatory. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive overview about the role of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs in CVDs and metabolic syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29937909>The effect of FADS2 gene rs174583 polymorphism on desaturase activities, fatty  profile, , biochemical indices, and incidence of type 2 diabetes.</a></h2><p>In this study, we investigated the associations of erythrocytes fatty  composition, activities of delta-5 desaturase (D5D) and delta-6 desaturase (D6D), and other metabolic risk factors, with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk to determine if rs174583 polymorphism of FADS2 gene had any effect on these associations.Fatty  profile of erythrocytes was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 95 T2D patients and 95 apparently healthy participants. The genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of FADS2 gene were determined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Other biochemical parameters were measured in the serum using standard analytical procedures.D6D activity was increased ( < 0.001) and D5D activity was decreased in T2D patients ( < 0.001) compared to controls. Homeostatic model assessment  (HOMA-IR) index was positively correlated with D6D ( = 0.34,  < 0.001) and negatively correlated with D5D ( = -0.19,  = 0.02). Palmitic  ( < 0.001) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic  ( = 0.03) were higher and linoleic  ( < 0.001) and  (AA) ( < 0.001) were lower in T2D patients. The distribution of rs174583 genotypes which includes C/T, C/C, and T/T was not different in the two groups ( = 0.63).In the population studied, there was a strong association in the erythrocytes fatty  composition, D5D and D6D activities and other metabolic risk factors between non-T2D and T2D patients. In addition, there was a strong association in erythrocytes DGLA and AA contents and D5D activities between rs174583 genotypes in all participants. However, the distribution of rs174583 genotypes did not differ significantly between T2D patient and controls, and it did not appear to be an association between rs174583 SNP and incident of T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26171623>Metabolic profiles during an oral glucose tolerance test in pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes.</a></h2><p>Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a complex metabolic condition associated with hyperpglycemia that is diagnosed in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during pregnancy. For a deeper understanding of the pathology of the disease, further investigations during pregnancy are required, ideally under metabolic challenging conditions.We performed targeted metabolomics in a group of 24 well-matched women during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 231 plasma metabolites were profiled and compared to conventional clinical diagnostics.A pattern of 8 metabolites differed between GDM and healthy controls as early as 30 min in an OGTT (AUC 0.977±0.008), and an increase in acylcarnitine C18:0, decreased concentrations of diacyl phosphatidylcholines (PC aa) C34:4, PC aa C36:4, PC aa C38:5, Lyso PC C20:4 and  were associated with .Our data suggest an additional value of metabolite pattern in the diagnosis of GDM and describe altered pathways that might be subjected to a more precise diagnosis and individualized therapy.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29416584>The Current Conditions and Lifestyles of Obese University Students.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in Japan remains high, and the onset becomes early. Studies on the current conditions and lifestyles of obese university students may support early interventions to achieve lifestyle modification.The results of periodic health examinations in 32,262 first-year university students revealed that 2,036 (6.3%) were obese. We performed a more detailed examination in 221 of these obese students (165 males and 56 females, age 19 ± 1 years) with study agreement from 2014 to 2016. In this study cohort, the percentage of students who exercised regularly was significantly higher among males than females. Body fat in males with well-exercised was lower than that in males with no exercise. In addition, serum level of high-density cholesterol in males with well-exercised was higher. Among females, there were no significant differences in these parameters between exercisers and non-exercisers. Forty-two obese students (40 males and two females) met the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Among males, levels of body fat, uric , liver enzyme and  in the MetS group were significantly higher than those in the non-MetS group. The average ratio of eicosapentaenoic  to  (EPA/AA) was low (0.14).Although the proportions of students with obesity and/or MetS were not high, the EPA/AA ratio in obese young males was low, which may be associated with a high risk of coronary atherosclerosis. To prevent the onset of cardiovascular diseases early intervention to achieve lifestyle modification may be important.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598849>TLR4 knockout can improve dysfunction of β-cell by rebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats.</a></h2><p>Studies showed that TLR4 knockout (TLR4) could mitigate obesity and  induced by high-fat diet in rats. In this study, we further investigated the effects of TLR4 on islet function and pancreatic proteomics in obese rats by high-fat diet.PA-induced lipotoxicity β-cells, SD and TLR4 rats were used in this study. iTRAQ was used to screen out meaningful differential proteins.The protein expression level was evaluated by Western blotting; the cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay.TLR4 could reduce inflammatory and regulate body composition in obese rats, and improve β-cells function. The quantitative analysis of protein revealed that TLR4 rebalanced proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats. In addition, the pathways involved in differential proteins were mainly metabolic pathways,  metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction, pancreatic secretion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Further analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) revealed that Stk39 and Ass1 interacting through Mapk14-Ywhae were node proteins and participated in inflammatory response, carboxylic  metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process. In vitro experiments we confirmed that silencing TLR4 can inhibit PA-induced β-cell apoptosis,  secretion disorders, and increase Ass1 expression. While, overexpression of Ass1 in β-cell inhibited PA or LPS-induced β-cell damage.Our study confirmed that TLR4 could improve dysfunction of β-cell, and the underlying mechanism might be involved in ebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas, affecting the expression of Ass1.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28556909>Altered post-capillary and collecting venular reactivity in skeletal muscle with metabolic syndrome.</a></h2><p>With the development of the metabolic syndrome, both post-capillary and collecting venular dilator reactivity within the skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats (OZR) is impaired. The impaired dilator reactivity in OZR reflects a loss in venular nitric oxide and PGI bioavailability, associated with the chronic elevation in oxidant stress. Additionally, with the impaired dilator responses, a modest increase in adrenergic constriction combined with an elevated thromboxane A production may contribute to impaired functional dilator and hyperaemic responses at the venular level. For the shift in skeletal muscle venular function with development of the metabolic syndrome, issues such as aggregate microvascular perfusion , mass transport and exchange within with capillary networks, and fluid handling across the microcirculation are compelling avenues for future investigation.While research into vascular outcomes of the metabolic syndrome has focused on arterial/arteriolar and capillary levels, investigation into venular function and how this impacts responses has received little attention. Using the in situ cremaster muscle of obese Zucker rats (OZR; with lean Zucker rats (LZR) as controls), we determined indices of venular function. At ∼17 weeks of age, skeletal muscle post-capillary venular density was reduced by ∼20% in LZR vs. OZR, although there was no evidence of remodelling of the venular wall. Venular tone at ∼25 μm (post-capillary) and ∼75 μm (collecting) diameter was elevated in OZR vs. LZR. Venular dilatation to acetylcholine was blunted in OZR vs. LZR due to increased oxidant stress-based loss of nitric oxide bioavailability (post-capillary) and increased α - (and α -) mediated constrictor tone (collecting). Venular constrictor responses in OZR were comparable to LZR for most stimuli, although constriction to α -adrenoreceptor stimulation was elevated. In response to field stimulation of the cremaster muscle (0.5, 1, 3 Hz), venular dilator and hyperaemic responses to lower frequencies were blunted in OZR, but responses at 3 Hz were similar between strains. Venous production of TxA was higher in OZR than LZR and significantly higher than PGI production in either following  challenge. These results suggest that multi-faceted alterations to skeletal muscle venular function in OZR may contribute to alterations in upstream capillary pressure profiles and the transcapillary exchange of solutes and water under conditions of metabolic syndrome.© 2017 The Authors.

Methods and Materials Data from 225 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally analyzed. The serum levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA) and  (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs (eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ) were measured, and the estimated Δ-5 desaturase (D5D) activity was calculated based on the AA to DGLA ratio. The associations between the composition of PUFAs and obesity-related parameters, including the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, alanine amino transferase (ALT) level, homeostatic model assessment of  (HOMA-IR), and body fat percentage, as measured by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, were analyzed. Results Among the PUFAs, the DGLA level had the strongest correlations with BMI (p<0.001), waist circumference (p<0.001), ALT level (p<0.001), HOMA-IR (p<0.001), and body fat percentage (p<0.01). AA was positively correlated and D5D was negatively correlated with several obesity-related parameters, while n-3 PUFAs did not have a constant correlation. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the DGLA level was an independent determinant for HOMA-IR (β=0.195, p=0.0066) after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, and the ALT, triglyceride, and HbA1c levels. Conclusion A high serum DGLA level was associated with obesity, body fat accumulation, a high ALT level, and  in patients with type 2 diabetes. The measurement of the serum PUFA levels may be useful for evaluating metabolic abnormalities and estimating the dietary habits of patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27860326>Docosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  are positively associated with  sensitivity in rats fed high-fat and high-fructose diets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to compare  and metabolic changes using a global lipidomic approach.Rats were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a high-fructose diet (HFrD) for 12 weeks to induce  (IR) syndrome. After 12 weeks feeding, physiological and biochemical parameters were examined.  sensitivity and plasma metabolites were evaluated using a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and mass spectrometry, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to investigate the strength of correlations.Rats on both diets developed IR syndrome, characterized by hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired fasting glucose, and IR. Compared with HFrD-fed rats, non-esterified fatty acids were lower and body weight and plasma  levels were markedly higher in HFD-fed rats. Adiposity and plasma leptin levels were increased in both groups. However, the size of adipocytes was greater in HFD- than HFrD-fed rats. Notably, the lipidomic heat map revealed metabolites exhibiting greater differences in HFD- and HFrD-fed rats compared with controls. Plasma adrenic  levels were higher in HFD- than HFrD-fed rats. Nevertheless, linoleic and  levels decreased in HFrD-fed rats compared with controls. Plasma concentrations of docosapentaenoic  (DPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were significantly reduced after feeding of both diets, particularly the HFrD. There was a strong positive correlation between these two fatty acids and the  sensitivity index.The systemic lipidomic analysis indicated that a reduction in DHA and DPA was strongly correlated with IR in rats under long-term overnutrition. These results provide a potential therapeutic target for IR and metabolic syndrome.© 2016 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233865>Cytokines, angiogenic, and antiangiogenic factors and bioactive lipids in preeclampsia.</a></h2><p>Preeclampsia is a low-grade systemic inflammatory condition in which oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction occurs. Plasma levels of soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-1, also known as sFlt1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1), an antiangiogenic factor have been reported to be elevated in preeclampsia. It was reported that pregnant mice deficient in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity show a preeclampsia-like phenotype due to a deficiency or absence of 2-methoxyoestradiol (2-ME), a natural metabolite of estradiol that is elevated during the third trimester of normal human pregnancy. Additionally, autoantibodies (AT1-AAs) that bind and activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor) also have a role in preeclampsia. None of these abnormalities are consistently seen in all the patients with preeclampsia and some of them are not specific to pregnancy. Preeclampsia could occur due to an imbalance between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. VEGF, an angiogenic factor, is necessary for the transport of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to endothelial cells. Hence reduced VEGF levels decrease the availability of PUFAs to endothelial cells. This leads to a decrease in the formation of anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins from PUFAs. Lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins, and PUFAs suppress ; activation of leukocytes, platelets, and macrophages; production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α; and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction; and enhance production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO). Estrogen enhances the formation of lipoxin A4 and NO. PUFAs also augment the production of NO and inhibit the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and antagonize the actions of angiotensin II. Thus, PUFAs can prevent activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 a (AT1 receptor). Patients with preeclampsia have decreased plasma phospholipid concentrations of  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), the precursors of lipoxins (from AA), resolvins (from EPA and DHA), and protectins (from DHA) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 from DGLA: dihomo-γ-linolenic ) and prostacyclin (PGI2 derived from AA). Based on these evidences, it is proposed that preeclampsia may occur due to deficiency of PUFAs and their anti-inflammatory products: lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Accumulation of immune cells, especially macrophages, and macrophage polarization from M2 to M1 state, affect intrinsic WAT signaling, namely anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines, fatty acids (FA), and lipid mediators derived from both n-6 and n-3 long-chain PUFA such as (i)  (AA)-derived eicosanoids and endocannabinoids, and (ii) specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators including resolvins derived from both eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), lipoxins (AA metabolites), protectins and maresins (DHA metabolites). In this respect, potential differences in modulating adipocyte metabolism by various lipid mediators formed by inflammatory M1 macrophages typical of obese state, and non-inflammatory M2 macrophages typical of lean state remain to be established. Studies in mice suggest that (i) transient accumulation of M2 macrophages could be essential for the control of tissue FA levels during activation of lipolysis, (ii) currently unidentified M2 macrophage-borne signaling molecule(s) could inhibit lipolysis and re-esterification of lipolyzed FA back to triacylglycerols (TAG/FA cycle), and (iii) the egress of M2 macrophages from rebuilt WAT and removal of the negative feedback regulation could allow for a full unmasking of metabolic activities of adipocytes. Thus, M2 macrophages could support remodeling of WAT to a tissue containing metabolically flexible adipocytes endowed with a high capacity of both TAG/FA cycling and oxidative phosphorylation. This situation could be exemplified by a combined intervention using mild calorie restriction and dietary supplementation with EPA/DHA, which enhances the formation of "healthy" adipocytes.
