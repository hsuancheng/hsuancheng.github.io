Dysregulated fatty  metabolism in the liver plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase 4A14 (CYP4A14) is a homolog of human CYP4A hydroxylase that catalyzes omega-hydroxylation of medium-chain fatty acids and  in mice. The goal of this study was to determine the role of CYP4A14 in the development and the progression of NAFLD. Here, we showed that hepatic CYP4A expression was up-regulated in the livers of patients and three murine models of NAFLD. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CYP4A14 in the livers of C57BL/6 mice resulted in a fatty liver phenotype with a significant increase in hepatic fatty  translocase (FAT/CD36) expression. In contrast, CYP4A14 gene-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet or a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet exhibited attenuated liver lipid accumulation and reduced hepatic FAT/CD36 expression. In addition, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis was markedly ameliorated in MCD diet-fed CYP4A14-deficient mice. Collectively, CYP4A14 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both SS and  and may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358367>Hyperinsulinemia shifted energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies in early nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from high-fat high-sucrose diet induced Bama minipigs.</a></h2><p>The minipig can serve as a good pharmacological model for human subjects. However, the long-term pathogenesis of high-calorie diet-induced metabolic syndromes, including , has not been well described in minipigs. We examined the development of metabolic syndromes in Bama minipigs that were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 23 months, by using histology and serum biochemistry and by profiling the gene expression patterns in the livers of HFHSD pigs compared to controls. The pathology findings revealed microvesicular steatosis, iron overload,  synthesis, lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant capacity, increased cellular damage, and inflammation in the liver. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 164 genes were differentially expressed between the livers of the HFHSD and control groups. The pathogenesis of early-stage  was characterized by hyperinsulinemia and by de novo synthesis of fatty acids and nascent triglycerides, which were deposited as lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Hyperinsulinemia shifted the energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies, and the high ketone body concentration induced the overexpression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The iron overload, CYP2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 overexpression promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which resulted in  and linoleic  peroxidation and, in turn, led to malondialdehyde production and a cellular response to ROS-mediated DNA damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30765737>Nutritional and lipidomics biomarkers of docosahexaenoic -based multivitamin therapy in pediatric .</a></h2><p>Two recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated improved radiographic, histological and hepatometabolic cues of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () in pediatric patients treated with the ω-3 fatty  docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in combination with vitamin D (VD) or with choline (CHO) and vitamin E (VE), the DHA-VD and DHA-CHO-VE trials, respectively). In the present study we verified the nutritional compliance to these DHA-based multivitamin treatments; lipidomics biomarkers of the reported outcome on  indicators were also investigated. Samples were obtained from 30 biopsy-proven pediatric  patients of the DHA-CHO-VE trial randomized in multivitamin treatment group and placebo group (n = 15 each), and from 12 patients of the treatment group of the DHA-VD trial. All patients underwent 6-month therapy plus 6 months of follow-up. Plasma samples and clinical data were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study (12 months). Selected biomarkers included the free form of DHA and other ω-3 fatty   (AA), indices of the vitamin E status, and some hepatic metabolites of these lipids. Radiographic and histological improvements of treated patients were associated with increased concentrations of DHA, α-linolenic  and α-tocopherol (i.e. VE), and with decreased AA that was also investigated in complex lipids by untargetd lipidomics. As a result a significantly lowered AA/DHA ratio was observed to represent the main indicator of the response to the DHA-based therapy. Furthermore, baseline levels of AA/DHA showed strong association with NAS and US improvement. A stable correction of DHA AA metabolism interaction is associated with the curative effect of this therapy and may represent a key nutritional endpoint in the clinical management of pediatric .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453513>Green Tea Lowers Hepatic COX-2 and Prostaglandin E2 in Rats with Dietary Fat-Induced Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Green tea extract (GTE) protects against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () by decreasing hepatic steatosis and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation. We hypothesized that hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory activities of GTE would protect against  by reducing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an NFκB-dependent enzyme, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dietary fat-induced obese model. Male Wistar rats were fed a low-fat diet containing no GTE or a high-fat (HF) diet containing GTE at 0%, 1%, or 2% for 8 weeks. Insulin resistance and total hepatic fatty acids increased following HF feeding (P<.05) and these were normalized by GTE at 1-2%. GTE (1-2%) normalized hepatic malondialdehyde without affecting cytochrome P450 2E1 mRNA expression, which was otherwise increased by HF feeding. HF-mediated increases in hepatic COX-2 protein and activity as well as PGE2 concentrations were normalized by GTE (1-2%). COX-2 activity and PGE2 were correlated to each other, and to serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic NFκB-binding activity (P<.05; r=0.28-0.49). GTE attenuated HF-mediated increases in total hepatic n-6 and n-3, without affecting the n-6/n-3 ratio. GTE did not affect HF-mediated increases in n-6 in nonesterified fatty  (NEFA) and phospholipid pools, whereas n-3 and n-6/n-3 in both pools were unaffected by GTE and HF feeding. GTE decreased total hepatic  without affecting HF-mediated increases in  in NEFA or phospholipid pools. Thus, GTE attenuates lipid peroxidation and PGE2 accumulation by decreasing COX-2 activity independent of  availability and supports an additional mechanism by which GTE protects against liver injury during  in an HF-feeding model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27401401>Characterization of the Cytochrome P450 epoxyeicosanoid pathway in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis () is an emerging public health problem without effective therapies. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize  into bioactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have potent anti-inflammatory and protective effects. However, the functional relevance of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid metabolism pathway in the pathogenesis of  remains poorly understood. Our studies demonstrate that both mice with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced  and humans with biopsy-confirmed  exhibited significantly higher free EET concentrations compared to healthy controls. Targeted disruption of Ephx2 (the gene encoding for soluble epoxide hydrolase) in mice further increased EET levels and significantly attenuated MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and injury, as well as high fat diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation, systemic glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that dysregulation of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid pathway is a key pathological consequence of  in vivo, and promoting the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of EETs warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy for .Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Liver phospholipid and fatty  composition have been shown to be altered in NAFLD. However, detailed profiles of circulating lipids in the pathogenesis of NAFLD are lacking.Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine circulating lipids and potential mechanisms related to hepatic gene expression between liver biopsy-proven simple steatosis (SS), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis () and healthy subjects.Plasma phospholipid and fatty  composition were determined in 31 healthy living liver donors as healthy controls (HC), 26 patients with simple hepatic steatosis (SS) and 20 with progressive .

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize . Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with . In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with  received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64% alpha-linolenic (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired liver biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven  patients with paired liver histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with .Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We aimed to investigate the role of butyrate-induced gut microbiota and metabolism in  development. Sixty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups ( = 15-17 per group) and were fed either a methionine-choline-sufficient (MCS) diet or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet with or without sodium butyrate (SoB; 0.6 g/kg body weight) supplementation for 6 weeks. Liver injury, systematic inflammation, and gut barrier function were determined. Fecal microbiome and metabolome were analyzed using 16S rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that butyrate alleviated the MCD diet-induced microbiome dysbiosis, as evidenced by a significantly clustered configuration separate from that of the MCD group and by the depletion of  and  and enrichment of promising probiotic genera , , , , , , and  genera. The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially improved by butyrate; several butyrate-responsive metabolites involved in lipid metabolism and other pathways, such as stearic , behenic , oleic , linoleic , squalene, and , were identified. Correlation analysis of the interaction matrix indicated that the modified gut microbiota and fecal metabolites induced by butyrate were strongly correlated with the alleviation of hepatic injury, fibrosis progression, inflammation, and lipid metabolism and intestinal barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that butyrate exerts protective effects against  development, and these effects may be driven by the protective gut microbiome and metabolome induced by butyrate.

Currently, the driver for this progression is not fully understood; in particular, it is not known how NAFLD and its early progression affects the distribution of lipids in the liver, producing lipotoxicity and inflammation. In this study, we used dietary and genetic mouse models of NAFL and NASH and translated the results to humans by correlating the spatial distribution of lipids in liver tissue with disease progression using advanced mass spectrometry imaging technology. We identified several lipids with distinct zonal distributions in control and NAFL samples and observed partial to complete loss of lipid zonation in NASH. In addition, we found increased hepatic expression of genes associated with remodeling the phospholipid membrane, release of  (AA) from the membrane, and production of eicosanoid species that promote inflammation and cell injury. The results of our immunohistochemistry analyses suggest that the zonal location of remodeling enzyme LPCAT2 plays a role in the change in spatial distribution for AA-containing lipids. This results in a cycle of AA-enrichment in pericentral hepatocytes, membrane release of AA, and generation of proinflammatory eicosanoids and may account for increased oxidative damage in pericentral regions in NASH.NAFLD is associated not only with lipid enrichment, but also with zonal changes of specific lipids and their associated metabolic pathways. This may play a role in the heterogeneous development of NAFLD. (Hepatology 2017;65:1165-1180).© 2016 by The Authors.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex, involving crosstalk between multiple organs, cell-types, and environmental and genetic factors. Dysfunction of the adipose tissue plays a central role in NAFLD progression. Here, we analysed transcriptomics data obtained from the Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) of NAFLD patients to understand how the VAT metabolism is altered at the genome scale and co-regulated with other cellular processes during the progression from obesity to  with fibrosis. For this purpose, we performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), a method that organizes the disease transcriptome into functional modules of cellular processes and pathways. Our analysis revealed the coordination of metabolic and inflammatory modules (termed "immunometabolism") in the VAT of NAFLD patients. We found that genes of , sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid metabolism were upregulated and co-expressed with genes of proinflammatory signalling pathways and hypoxia in / with fibrosis. We hypothesize that these metabolic alterations might play a role in sustaining VAT inflammation. Furthermore, immunometabolism related genes were also co-expressed with genes involved in Extracellular Matrix (ECM) degradation. Our analysis indicates that upregulation of both ECM degrading enzymes and their inhibitors (incoherent feedforward loop) potentially leads to the ECM deposition in the VAT of  with fibrosis patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926387>Association between Serum Phospholipid Fatty Acids and Intraprostatic Inflammation in the Placebo Arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.</a></h2><p>Inflammation may play an etiologic role in prostate cancer. Several dietary factors influence inflammation; studies have shown that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are anti-inflammatory, whereas n-6 and trans fatty acids are proinflammatory. We evaluated whether serum phospholipid n-3, n-6, and trans fatty acids were associated with intraprostatic inflammation, separately in 191 prostate cancer cases and 247 controls from the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). Men without a prostate cancer diagnosis underwent prostate biopsy at trial end, and benign prostate tissue inflammation was evaluated in approximately three biopsy cores per man; this was expressed as no, some, or all cores with inflammation. In controls, serum eicosapentaenoic  [OR of all cores with inflammation versus none (95% CI), 0.35 (0.14-0.89)] and docosahexaenoic  [OR (95% CI), 0.42 (0.17-1.02)] were inversely associated with, whereas linoleic  [OR (95% CI), 3.85 (1.41-10.55)] was positively associated with intraprostatic inflammation. Serum trans fatty acids were not associated with intraprostatic inflammation. No significant associations were observed in cases; however, we could not rule out a positive association with linoleic  and an inverse association with . Thus, in the PCPT, we found that serum n-3 fatty acids were inversely, n-6 fatty acids were positively, and trans fatty acids were not associated with intraprostatic inflammation in controls.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Unlike common 'obese/metabolic' NAFLD, these subjects lack hypertriglyceridemia and have lower risk of cardiovascular disease. In animals, phosphatidylcholine (PC) deficiency results in a similar phenotype. PCs surround the core of VLDL consisting of triglycerides (TGs) and cholesteryl-esters (CEs). We determined the effect of the TM6SF2 E167K on these lipids in the human liver and serum and on hepatic gene expression and studied the effect of TM6SF2 knockdown on hepatocyte handling of these lipids.Liver biopsies were taken from subjects characterized with respect to the TM6SF2 genotype, serum and liver lipidome, gene expression and histology. In vitro, after TM6SF2 knockdown in HuH-7 cells, we compared incorporation of different fatty acids into TGs, CEs, and PCs.The TM6SF2 and TM6SF2 groups had similar age, gender, BMI and HOMA-IR. Liver TGs and CEs were higher and liver PCs lower in the TM6SF2 than the TM6SF2 group (p<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were deficient in liver and serum TGs and liver PCs but hepatic free fatty acids were relatively enriched in PUFA (p<0.05). Incorporation of PUFA into TGs and PCs in TM6SF2 knockdown hepatocytes was decreased (p<0.05). Hepatic expression of TM6SF2 was decreased in variant carriers, and was co-expressed with genes regulated by PUFAs.Hepatic lipid synthesis from PUFAs is impaired and could contribute to deficiency in PCs and increased intrahepatic TG in TM6SF2 E167K variant carriers.Copyright © 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota, which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity. Finally, we summarize the most recent lipidomic strategies utilized to explore the liver lipidome and its modifications in the course of NALFD. These include measures of lipid profiles in blood plasma and erythrocyte membranes that can surrogate to some extent lipid investigation in the liver.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim was to assess this relationship. In a cross-sectional study, hepatic gene expression (Illumina Microarray) was first compared among 20 patients with simple steatosis (SS), 19 with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (), and 24 healthy controls. The FA composition in hepatic total lipids was compared between SS and , and associations between gene expression and FAs were examined. Gene expression differed mainly between healthy controls and patients (SS and ), including genes related to unsaturated FA metabolism. Twenty-two genes were differentially expressed between  and SS; most of them correlated with disease severity and related more to cancer progression than to lipid metabolism. Biologically active long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs; eicosapentaenoic  + docosahexaenoic , ) in hepatic total lipids were lower in  than in SS. This may be related to overexpression of FADS1, FADS2, and PNPLA3. The degree and direction of correlations between PUFAs and gene expression were different among SS and , which may suggest that low PUFA content in  modulates gene expression in a different way compared with SS or, alternatively, that gene expression influences PUFA content differently depending on disease severity (SS versus ).Well-defined subjects with either healthy liver, SS, or  showed distinct hepatic gene expression profiles including genes involved in unsaturated FA metabolism.

In the Liver Biopsy Cross-Sectional Cohort, a total of 1149 individuals underwent liver biopsy to diagnose liver disease and disease severity.The genotype rs641738 at the MBOAT7-TMC4 locus associated with increased hepatic fat content in the 2 cohorts, and with more severe liver damage and increased risk of fibrosis compared with subjects without the variant. MBOAT7, but not TMC4, was found to be highly expressed in the liver. The MBOAT7 rs641738 T allele was associated with lower protein expression in the liver and changes in plasma phosphatidylinositol species consistent with decreased MBOAT7 function.We provide evidence for an association between the MBOAT7 rs641738 variant and the development and severity of NAFLD in individuals of European descent. This association seems to be mediated by changes in the hepatic phosphatidylinositol acyl-chain remodeling.Copyright © 2016 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p></html>
