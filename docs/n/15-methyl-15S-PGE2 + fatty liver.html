To date, identifying individuals at risk for IDILI remains challenging. This is a prospective study, where a nested case-control (1:5) design was adopted. For six patients who had abnormalities in  function test after Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. (PM) ingestion (susceptible group), 30 patients with normal  function were matched (tolerant group). Based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, metabolomics analysis was done on serum samples prior to PM ingestion, to screen the differential metabolites and characterize metabolomic profiles of patient serum in the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that there were remarkable separations between susceptible and tolerant groups. A total of 25 major differential metabolites were screened out, involving glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism,  acid metabolism, histidine metabolism and aromatic amino acid metabolism. Wherein, the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of metabolites PE 22:6, crotonoyl-CoA, 2E-tetradecenoyl-CoA, phenyllactic acid, indole-5,6-quinone, phosphoribosyl-ATP were all greater than 0.9. The overall serum metabolic profile comprising of 25 metabolites could clearly distinguish susceptible and tolerant groups. This proof-of-concept study used metabolomics to characterize the metabolic profile of IDILI risk individuals before drug ingestion for the first time. The metabolome characteristics in patient serum before PM ingestion may predict the risk of  injury after PM ingestion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626136>Risk factors for the development of hyperuricemia: A STROBE-compliant cross-sectional and longitudinal study.</a></h2><p>Hyperuricemia has received increasing attention as a major public health problem. This study aims to investigate the risk factors for hyperuricemia and to explore the relationship between changes in biochemical variables and incident hyperuricemia.A cross-sectional and subsequently prospective study was performed among adults who took their health checkups at Zhejiang University Hospital. The participants who were free of hyperuricemia at baseline received annual follow-up examinations during a 6-year period. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted to calculate the risks for incident hyperuricemia.Of the 9238 participants enrolled, 1704 (18.4%) were diagnosed as hyperuricemia. During 21,757 person-years of follow-up, 1492 incident hyperuricemia cases were identified. The incidence of hyperuricemia was 68.58 cases per 1000 person-year of follow-up in the overall participants. The prevalence and the incidence of hyperuricemia increased greatly in female older than 50 years. High levels of BMI, SBP, FPG, TG, LDL-C, ALT, BUN, and creatinine increased the risk of hyperuricemia. Suffering  also increased the risk of hyperuricemia. Subjects with increasing DBP, TG, BUN, creatinine, or decreasing HDL-C were more likely to incident hyperuricemia.This study revealed that the change of diastolic blood pressure (DBP), serum triglycerides (TG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level were independently associated with incident hyperuricemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608220>Obesity Paradox in Chronic  Diseases: Product of Bias or a Real Thing?</a></h2><p>In recent years, evidence supporting the theory of obesity paradox has increased, showing that obese/overweight people with prevalent chronic diseases experience lower mortality compared with patients of normal weight. So far, evidence is most comprehensive in cardiovascular and chronic renal diseases; however, published studies are prone to many biases, enabling us to reach a definite conclusion. Available data in chronic  disease is scarce and ambiguous. Obesity is traditionally associated with nonalcoholic  disease and steatosis in viral hepatitis and as such one would not expect the obesity paradox to be a real possibility in  disease. Yet, there seem to be new data indicating the opposite - the obesity paradox exists in severe and end-stage  cirrhosis, which could be attributed to a better lean mass in patients with higher body mass index, meaning that sarcopenia, as one of the most important prognostic factors of survival, is less likely to be present. Nonetheless, the problem of various methodological problems addressing the association between body weight and mortality, which is present both in  disease and other chronic diseases, are preventing us from attaining an unanimous conclusion. Still, we should be aware that the obesity paradox might be true, especially in severe and end-stage illness. This suggests focusing our efforts toward preserving or building up fat-free mass and decreasing inflammatory activity responsible for catabolism and sarcopenia, and implying that the underlaying cause should be treated.© 2019 Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655133>β-Klotho gene variation is associated with  damage in children with NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic  disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with  damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on  damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free  acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on  damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the .

NAFLD and NASH lead to an expansion of epicardial adipose tissue and the release of proinflammatory adipocytokines that cause microcirculatory dysfunction and fibrosis of the adjoining myocardium, resulting in atrial fibrillation as well as heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Inflammatory changes in the left atrium lead to electroanatomical remodeling; thus, NAFLD and NASH markedly increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Simultaneously, patients with NAFLD or NASH commonly show diastolic dysfunction or latent HFpEF. Interventions include (1) weight loss by caloric restriction, bariatric surgery or intensive exercise; and (2) drugs that ameliorate fat-mediated inflammation in both the  and heart (e.g., statins, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and pioglitazone). Patients with NAFLD or NASH commonly have an inflammation-related atrial and ventricular myopathy, which may contribute to symptoms and long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2019.

The etiology of this disease is known in 90% of the patients, and it is viral in most of the cases. According to recent predictions, nearly half of the world population will be suffering from obesity by 2030. Consequently, non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) may play a growing role in HCC epidemiology. In this review we sought to explore the relationship between  steatosis and HCC.  A narrative review was conducted using the PubMed MeSH search. The eligible papers were identified using a standard PubMed search with relevant key terms and various synonyms.  According to the results, patients with NAFLD-HCC tended to be older than those with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HCC, and they were more often obese and had concomitant diseases, such as diabetes. On the other hand, the synthetic  function was better preserved in NAFLD-HCC patients, who also obtained lower scores on the Model for End-stage  Disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP). However, it has to be noted that HCC in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may develop without underlying cirrhosis. Although NASH-HCC is usually smaller and well-differentiated compared to HCV-HCC, the prognosis is similar in both groups. Efficient HCC screening in NASH cirrhosis poses a challenge because it is difficult to perform ultrasound examination in obese patients and alfa-fetoprotein level is no longer considered reliable.  The constantly increasing prevalence of NAFLD in the general population can contribute to a growing role of NAFLD/NASH in HCC epidemiology. Moreover, some particular challenges specific for patients with  steatosis may impede proper HCC diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631098>Regulation of angiopoietin-like protein 8 expression under different nutritional and metabolic status.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease with increasing prevalence worldwide. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8), a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family, is involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis and believed to be associated with T2DM. Expression levels of ANGPTL8 are often significantly altered in metabolic diseases, such as non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that ANGPTL8, together with other members of this protein family, such as angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), regulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), thereby participating in the regulation of triglyceride related lipoproteins (TRLs). In addition, members of the angiopoietin-like protein family are varyingly expressed among different tissues and respond differently under diverse nutritional and metabolic status. These findings may provide new options for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, metabolic syndromes and other diseases. In this review, the interaction between ANGPTL8 and ANGPTL3 or ANGPTL4, and the differential expression of ANGPTL8 responding to different nutritional and metabolic status during the regulation of LPL activity were reviewed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616396>SCFAs-Induced GLP-1 Secretion Links the Regulation of Gut Microbiome on Hepatic Lipogenesis in Chickens.</a></h2><p>The impact of gut microbiota and its metabolites on fat metabolism have been widely reported in human and animals. However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in lipid metabolism that  is the main site of lipid synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and fat synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain  acids (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed lipid accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610081>Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis after  Transplantation.</a></h2><p>Currently, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the second leading indication for  transplant (LT), behind alcohol-related  disease. After transplant, both recurrent and de novo nonalcoholic  disease are common, however, recurrence rates of NASH and advanced fibrosis are low. Identification of high-risk groups and optimizing treatment of metabolic co-morbidities both pre- and post-LT is paramount to maintaining a healthy allograft, especially with the additional consequences of long-term immunosuppression. In addition, NASH LT recipients are at increased risk of cardiovascular events and malignancy, and warrant a tailored approach to management. The optimal approach to NASH LT recipients including metabolic co-morbidities management, tailored immunosuppression, the role of bariatric surgery, and nutritional and pharmacotherapy of NASH are discussed in this review. Overall, aggressive management of metabolic syndrome post LT via medical and surgical modalities, and a minimalist approach to immunosuppression is advised.Copyright © 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632963>Monitoring the Sphingolipid  Synthesis by Stable-Isotope Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that share a sphingoid base backbone. They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C  acid palmitoyl-CoA and the amino acid L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid metabolism will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat  microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following lipid extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for metabolism studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619310>Association between edible mushroom intake and the prevalence of newly diagnosed non-alcoholic  disease: results from the TCLSIH Cohort Study in China.</a></h2><p>Animal studies have suggested that mushroom intake can alleviate non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the association between mushroom intake and NAFLD is unknown in humans. We aimed to investigate the association of mushroom intake with NAFLD among Chinese adults. This is a cross-sectional study of 24,236 adults (mean [standard deviation] age: 40.7 [11.9] years; 11,394 men [47.0%]). Mushroom intake was assessed via a validated food frequency questionnaire. Newly diagnosed NAFLD was identified based on the results of annual health examinations, including ultrasound findings and a self-reported history of the disease. Multiple logistic models were used to examine the association between mushroom intake and NAFLD. The prevalence of newly diagnosed NAFLD was 19.0%. Compared to those consuming mushrooms less frequently (≤1 time/week), the fully adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of newly diagnosed NAFLD were 0.95 (0.86, 1.05) for those consuming 2-3 times/week and 0.76 (0.63, 0.92) for those consuming ≥4 times/week, respectively (P for trend = 0.01). The inverse association was consistent in subgroups defined by age, sex, and body mass index. In conclusion, higher mushroom intake was significantly associated with lower prevalence of NAFLD among Chinese adults.

Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify the superiority among various obesity indices such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) for predicting NAFLD in pre- and postmenopausal women.This cross-sectional analysis included 620 healthy women (318 premenopausal and 302 postmenopausal women) between 20 and 80 years of age recruited from the Health Promotion Center of Korea University Guro Hospital. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography.In premenopausal women, there were no statistical differences in the area under the curve values among the three obesity indices, whereas, in postmenopausal women, the area under the curve value of WHR was significantly larger than those of either BMI (difference between area: 0.102, 95% confidence interval: 0.031, 0.173) or WC (difference between area: 0.064, 95% confidence interval: 0.018-0.109). Furthermore, in postmenopausal women, the combination of WHR with BMI or WC significantly increased predictive power of NAFLD when compared to using BMI or WC alone. The optimal cutoff values for BMI, WC, and WHR for detecting NAFLD were 23.9 kg/m, 69 cm, and 0.81 in premenopausal women and 22.9 kg/m, 74 cm, and 0.86 in postmenopausal women, respectively.In premenopausal women, BMI, WC, and WHR hold similar potential in predicting the risk of NAFLD, whereas, in postmenopausal women, WHR is the most useful discriminative indicator for NAFLD.

Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has a correlation with metabolic syndrome and its complications.We reviewed the literature regarding the mechanisms of developing NAFLD through AGE-RAGE signaling.NAFLD, metabolic syndrome, and production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) share many common risk factors and appear to be connected. AGE induces production of the receptor for AGE (RAGE).

The immune system, especially macrophages, has an important defense mechanism against RAGE pathway activities.Soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) has the capability to reduce inflammation by blocking the interaction of AGE with RAGE. However, sRAGE has some limitations, and the best method of usage is probably autotransplantation of transfected stem cells or monocytes, as a precursor of macrophages and Kupffer cells, with a virus that carries sRAGE to alleviate the harmful effects of AGE-RAGE signaling in the settings of  disease.Copyright © 2019 Kamyar Asadipooya et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651803>Childhood Obesity: A Risk Factor for Non-alcoholic  Disease in Adolescence.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), defined as fat accumulation >5% in hepatocytes, may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis later in life.

Serum cathepsin D levels were measured using the CatD enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (USCN Life Science, Wuhan, China) using stored samples collected on the same day of the  biopsy procedure. The performance of cathepsin D in the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.Data for 216  biopsies and 34 healthy controls were analyzed. The mean cathepsin D level was not significantly different between NAFLD patients and controls; between NASH and non-NASH patients; and across the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH was 0.62 and 0.52, respectively. The AUROC of cathepsin D for the diagnosis of the different steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades ranged from 0.51 to 0.58. Of the 216  biopsies, 152 were paired  biopsies from 76 patients who had a repeat  biopsy after 48 weeks. There was no significant change in the cathepsin D level at follow-up compared to baseline in patients who had histological improvement or worsening for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning grades. Cathepsin D was poor for predicting improvement or worsening of steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning, with AUROC ranging from 0.47 to 0.54. It was fair for predicting worsening (AUROC 0.73) but poor for predicting improvement (AUROC 0.54) of lobular inflammation.Cathepsin D was a poor biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of NASH in our cohort of Asian patients, somewhat inconsistent with previous observations in Caucasian patients.

Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been recognized as key mechanisms in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Whether Orai1 facilitates ER stress by oxidative stress remains unknown. The rat model of NAFLD was constructed by feeding high-fat diet (HFD). BRL-3A cells were treated with NEFAs, Orai1inhibtor BTP2, NFκB inhibitor wogonin, or small interfering Orai (siOrai) 1, respectively. The content of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating oxidative stress, was measured by a spectrophotometer. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, and GRP78 were quantified using Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses. For the intracellular location of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Orai1 were measured by Western blot and immunofluorescence, and cytosolic Ca was measured by flow cytometry. As we expected, the  of rats with NAFLD showed lipid droplets in HE and Oil Red O. The decreased GSH and increased MDA were found in rats fed with HFD. ER stress major proteins PERK, IRE1, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP were significantly increased in the HFD group. In BRL-3A cells, GSH content dramatically decreased from 1 h, MDA content dramatically increased from 3 h, and expression levels of ER stress significantly increased from 3 h by NEFA treatment. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca increased from 0.5 h by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. It indicated that NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca to induce oxidative stress, thus ER stress. The content of oxidative stress and ER stress proteins showed the same trends by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells. These effects were reversed by the Orai1 inhibitor BTP2 and the NFκB inhibitor wogonin. Moreover, siOrai1 abrogated NEFAs' influence in BRL-3A cells. Last, ROS was found by NEFAs treated in BRL-3A cells, and NEFA treatment enhanced the nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 and ORAI1. It was considered that high NEFAs increased cytosolic Ca and enhanced NFκB-dependent SOCE and its moiety protein Orai1 to decrease GSH and thus induced oxidative stress at earlier stages and furthermore tempted ER stress in the pathologic progress of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Li, Zou, Guo, Zhang, Xia, Zhang, Yang and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628911>Association between the perturbation of bile acid homeostasis and valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Valproic acid (VPA), a widely prescribed antiepileptic drug, is known to induce hepatotoxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying this toxicity are not well understood. In this study, we performed a nontargeted metabolomic analysis of children with epilepsy treated with VPA (n=23). Metabolic pathway analysis showed that the  acid pathway, citrate cycle, urea cycle, amino acid metabolism, and bile acid pathway were altered in children with epilepsy exhibiting VPA hepatotoxicity. In particular, the VPA-induced perturbation of bile acid homeostasis has not been observed previously. Based on these findings, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to characterize bile acid profiles and further determined the effects of VPA on the synthesis, transport, and regulation of bile acids in mice. The bile acid metabolomic profiles of the livers of mice treated with VPA indicated an increase in most bile acids, especially chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA), as well as unconjugated bile acids. The upregulation of genes related to bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1and CYP8B1) and the downregulation of genes related to conjugation (BAAT and BACS) and regulation (FXR and SHP) were detected in the , suggesting that hydrophobic bile acid production was increased and FXR signaling was impaired. Our results suggest that the perturbation of bile acid homeostasis and impaired FXR signaling are involved in VPA-induced hepatotoxicity, providing a novel insight into VPA hepatotoxicity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Among them, the association with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as an important one regarding both its prevalence and significance. The early recognition of this association is important for the prognosis of patients with NAFLD and CKD. Apart from early diagnosis, the accurate assessment of renal function is also crucial in the clinical practice of hepatologists. Several methods have been used in the literature for the evaluation of kidney function in patients with NAFLD up to now. In this respect, calculators (or formulas) for the estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and Albumin to Creatinine Ratio (ACR) are simple, practical and easily available methods for this purpose. The aim of this review is to report on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of the relationship between NAFLD and CKD and to describe the different methods of kidney function assessment in patients with NAFLD. The collection of all relevant data regarding this association will provide hepatologists with pertinent knowledge on this topic and allow them to use the most accurate methods for the assessment of kidney function in these patients in their clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 Fundación Clínica Médica Sur, A.C.

The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic  disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic  has a higher mutational burden than normal . Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1-5% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic  disease; and others-arising from exogenous exposures-were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic , but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of  tissue as it progresses from health to disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634861>HIV and the .</a></h2><p>Among individuals with HIV infection,  disease remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, even with the availability of agents that cure hepatitis C infection and suppress hepatitis B replication.

Traditional markers of kidney function, such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are commonly used to estimate glomerular filtration rate. However, these markers have several limitations including poor specificity and sensitivity. A number of serum and urine biomarkers have recently been described to detect kidney damage caused by drugs such as cisplatin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and tacrolimus. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), -type  acid-binding protein (L-FABP), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and cystatin C have been identified as biomarkers for early kidney damage. Hy's Law is widely used as to predict a high risk of severe drug-induced  injury caused by drugs such as acetaminophen. Recent reports have indicated that glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), Keratin-18 (k18), MicroRNA-122 and ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OCT) are more sensitive markers of hepatotoxicity compared to the traditional markers including the blood levels of amiotransferases and total bilirubin.

Recent studies suggest that patients with HIV are at high risk for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and progressive  fibrosis. Evidence for the prevalence, risk factors, and diagnostic methodologies of NAFLD in patients with HIV mono-infection is summarized here.Although limited, published studies suggest that the prevalence of NAFLD is higher (30-50%) and progresses at an increased rate in patients with HIV compared to the general population. Identifying those at risk for significant  fibrosis is critical, preferably with non-invasive screening tests. While there is a paucity of evidence in this population, transient elastography (TE) appears to provide a sensitive, non-invasive screening modality. Identifying NAFLD early will allow for dietary and lifestyle interventions, as well as future drug therapies to decrease the risk of progressive  fibrosis and cirrhosis in the high-risk HIV population.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of miR-1296 as a non-invasive biomarker in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD).Serum samples were collected from normal people and NAFLD patients for biochemical detection. Serum microRNAs were isolated by the NucleoZOL method, and the stem-loop method was used to reverse transcribe the DNA. The relative quantification of miR-1296 was performed by SYBR Green method. Spearman's method was used to analyze the correlation between miR-1296 and serum biochemical parameters.By using 2-∆∆CT method, we found that, compared with the normal control group, the expression of serum miR-1296 increased in patients with normal lipid NAFLD and those with hyperlipidemia NAFLD. At the same time, the expression of microRNA-1296 in the NAFLD hyperlipidemia group increased more significantly than that in the NFALD group with normal lipid. Spearman's correlation assay demonstrated that the correlation between the expression of miR-1296 and blood lipids, including TC, TG, HDL-c, and LDL-c, was TC (r = 0.4951, p = 0.0013), TG (r = 0.054, p = 0.6425), HDL-C (r = 0.3435, p = 0.07522), and LDL-C (r = 0.3307, p = 0.0699.

The significance of TWIST2 has been emphasized in various tumors; however, few studies report its functions in metabolism and metabolic diseases. Here we aimed to explore the novel role and regulation mechanism of TWIST2 in hepatic steatosis. Our results showed that  knockdown caused mice obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, which were accompanied with inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. , TWIST2 overexpression ameliorated hepatocellular steatosis, inhibited inflammation, and improved mitochondrial content and function with a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21)-dependent pattern. NF-κB negatively regulated FGF21 transcription by directly binding to  promoter DNA, which was eliminated by TWIST2 overexpression by inhibiting NF-κB expression and translocation to nucleus. TWIST2 overexpression decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, increased mitochondrial DNA and biogenesis, and enhanced ATP production and antioxidation ability. Additionally, TWIST2 expression was repressed by insulin-targeting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and forkhead box protein O1 and was enhanced by dexamethasone targeting Krüppel-like factor 15, which directly interacted with  promoter DNA.

Dysregulated metabolism of sphingomyelin in the  plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Ceramides are central molecules of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catabolism and play an important role in insulin resistance, apoptosis, and inflammation. In addition, apoptosis is a main contributor to the development of NAFLD. This study detected whether the inhibition of ceramide synthesis ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in rats with NAFLD. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the NAFLD model. Here, we showed that hepatic ceramide, steatosis, and fibrosis increased in  tissue from rats with NAFLD. Chronic treatment with myriocin inhibited ceramide and lipid accumulation and improved fibrosis in  tissue samples of high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats. In addition, hepatic inflammation and apoptosis were markedly ameliorated in HFD-fed rats treated with myriocin. Furthermore, myriocin treatment regulated the expression of pro-apoptosis and anti-apoptosis proteins by inactivating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in the  of HFD-fed rats. Collectively, ceramide plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NASH and may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Jiang, Li, Liu, Wang and Lei.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623698>Effects of a riboflavin source suitable for use in organic broiler diets on performance traits and health indicators.</a></h2><p>Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is essential for monogastric animals. It is mainly produced by recombinant microorganisms (Candida famata, Bacillus subtilis and Ashbya gossypii). The availability of genetically modified organism (GMO)-free riboflavin, obligatory in European organic agriculture, is a major issue. Besides, requirements for organic livestock might differ from conventional production because other genotypes and feed formulations are used. The effects of a fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin produced with unmodified A. gossypii by fermentation were investigated at graded dosages as an alternative to conventional (GMO-based) riboflavin in slow-growing broilers on performance traits and health and welfare indicators. In 2 runs with 800 animals each, Ranger Gold™ broilers were fed with 4 dietary treatments. For starter diets (day 1 to 18), treatments included a basal diet (1) without any riboflavin supplementation (negative control, N-C), (2) with conventional riboflavin supplementation (Cuxavit B2 80% riboflavin) at 9.6 mg/kg (positive control, P-C), (3) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 3.5 mg/kg (A-low) and (4) with riboflavin supplementation from the alternative source at 9.6 mg/kg (A-high). For the finisher diet (day 29 until slaughtering), P-C and A-high were supplemented with 8.0 mg/kg and A-low with 3.5 mg/kg. Diets were formulated according to organic regulations. Animals were kept in floor pens with 20 chickens per pen. Weekly, BW, feed and water consumption were recorded. Every second week, animal-based health and welfare indicators (feather score and footpad dermatitis) were scored. Slaughter traits were assessed for five males and females per pen at 62/63 days of age. Final body weight of A-high differed from N-C and A-low, but not from P-C. From week 2 until six years of age, A-high had a higher daily weight gain when compared to all other groups. With 74.4%, dressing percentage was higher in A-high compared with all other groups (73.3%). Breast percentage of A-low was lower than that of both control groups but did not differ from A-high. The highest frequency of  scores indicating  syndrome was found in P-C, followed by N-C and A-low. Feather scores did not respond to treatment; the highest frequency of mild footpad dermatitis was observed in A-high, however at a low prevalence. In conclusion, the tested fermentation suspension with a high native content of riboflavin derived from fermentation of A. gossypii can be used at levels of commercial recommendations as alternative to riboflavin produced from GMO in broiler feeding. Further studies must verify whether riboflavin can be reduced without inducing riboflavin deficiency in slow-growing broilers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657737>Effect of the dietary linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3) on histopathological alterations caused by suboptimal temperature in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).</a></h2><p>Tilapias are produced worldwide, including subtropical areas. In turn, dietary  acids can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial weight: 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in  caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the  acid content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, data regarding stroke risk are limited. We sought to investigate whether NAFLD-fibrosis is associated with stroke in addition to heart disease.We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2014). After excluding participants with competing causes of  disease, the Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were calculated. First, we used a composite measure to classify participants: NAFLD-fibrosis was defined as having at least one score above its validated cut-off. Second, we also used the FIB-4 and NFS scores individually. The key outcome was prevalent stroke, and we also evaluated heart disease; both were self-reported. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association between NAFLD-fibrosis and these outcomes while adjusting for demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors.We identified 1653 participants with NAFLD-fibrosis from a sample of 27,040 participants. In total, 753 had prior stroke. An association between NAFLD-fibrosis and stroke was seen when using the FIB-4 score (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.50) but not the NFS (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.92-1.87). NAFLD-fibrosis was associated with heart disease (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.06-2.01) using the composite measure and both scores individually.NAFLD-fibrosis may be associated with stroke in addition to heart disease, with differences depending on the measure used to define NAFLD-fibrosis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

HepG2 cells were incubated with  acid with or without myriocin treatment. Lipid accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults,  biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and  biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated  pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of  acid metabolism associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

Small molecules originating from dietary food are considered suitable and attractive drug candidates for humans in terms of safety. In this study, an edible plant,  (LV), used as a traditional and medicinal food in East Asia was evaluated for lipogenesis decreasing effects.Activity-guided fractionation was performed, and the isolated compounds were identified using spectroscopic methods. We conducted  real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting as well as histological and biochemical analyses following  treatments.Using a high-fat diet animal model, we confirmed that LV extracts (LVE) decreased lipogenic metabolism and restored  function to control levels.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential beneficial effects of QH on anti-fatigue and ergogenic functions following physiological challenge. Forty 8-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were divided into four groups ( = 10 for each group): Group 1 (vehicle control or oil only); Group 2 (1X QH dose or 102.5 mg/kg); Group 3 (2X QH dose or 205 mg/kg); Group 4 (6X QH dose or 615 mg/kg). Anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were studied using the forelimb grip strength experiment and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time, and levels of serum lactate, ammonia, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatine kinase (CK), and free  acids (FFA) after an acute exercise challenge. The forelimb grip strength and exhaustive weight-loaded swimming time of the QH-6X group were significantly higher than those of the other groups. QH supplementation dose-dependently reduced serum lactate, ammonia, and CK levels and increased the FFA concentration after acute exercise. In addition, QH increased the  and muscle glycogen content, an important energy source during exercise.

The most recent evidences indicate that lipotoxicity-induced inflammation in the  is associated with obesity-derived alterations and remolding in adipose tissue that culminates in most prevalent  pathology named as non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). A comprehensive crosstalk of adiponectin and its cognate receptors, specifically adiponectin receptor-2 in the  mediates ameliorative effects in obesity-induced NAFLD by interaction with hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Recent studies highlight the implication of molecular mediators mainly involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-driven NAFLD, however, the plausible mechanisms remain elusive. The present review aimed at collating the data regarding mechanistic approaches of adiponectin and adiponectin-activated PPARs as well as PPAR-induced adiponectin levels in attenuation of hepatic lipoinflammation. Understanding the rapidly occurring adiponectin-mediated pathophysiological outcomes might be of importance in the development of new therapies that can potentially resolve obesity and obesity-associated NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647137>Ultrasound  Indicator: A Simple Tool for Differentiating Steatosis From Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Validity in the Average Obese Population.</a></h2><p>Steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and fibrosis/cirrhosis represent a spectrum of  disease. The ultrasound  indicator (US-FLI) evaluates ultrasound (US) features to identify stages of  disease. We hypothesized that US features could be independent predictors of NASH and that the US-FLI differentiates steatosis from NASH in the average obese population.A retrospective analysis of 208 patients with normal (n = 14), steatotic (n = 89), and NASH (n = 105) livers was performed. /biliary disease and a history of alcohol intake were excluded. Ultrasound metrics included -kidney contrast, posterior attenuation, vessel blurring, difficulty visualizing the gallbladder wall, difficulty visualizing the diaphragm, and areas of focal  sparing. A statistical comparison of the 3 groups as well as fibrosis stage I and II/III NASH groups was performed. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of NASH.Gallbladder wall visualization and vessel blurring were different between the steatosis and NASH groups (P ≤ .01). Gallbladder wall visualization was specific for NASH (89%), and vessel blurring was sensitive for NASH (93%). A US-FLI score of 4 or lower suggested the absence of NASH (negative predictive value, 88%; sensitivity, 91%). Logistic regression revealed vessel blurring as the only US predictor of NASH (P ≤ .01). However, the area under the curve (0.649) showed poor performance in differentiating steatosis from NASH when the US-FLI score was 5 or higher.Our data suggest that the US-FLI may differentiate steatosis from NASH in the average obese population. Vessel blurring and poor gallbladder wall visualization were the most important metrics. Identification of NASH was enhanced by including the US-FLI score with vessel blurring.Published 2019.

NAFLD management is mainly focused on weight loss, but the optimal characteristics of the diet demand further investigation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of two personalized energy-restricted diets on the  status in overweight or obese subjects with NAFLD after a 6 months follow-up. Ninety-eight individuals from the  in Obesity (FLiO) study were randomized into two groups and followed different energy-restricted diets. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months. Diet, anthropometry, body composition, and biochemical parameters were evaluated.  assessment included ultrasonography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, elastography, and determination of transaminases. Both dietary groups significantly improved their metabolic and hepatic markers after the intervention, with no significant differences between them. Multivariate regression models evidenced a relationship between weight loss, adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet), and a decrease in  fat content, predicting up to 40.9% of its variability after 6 months. Moreover, the antioxidant capacity of the diet was inversely associated with  fat content. Participants in the group with a higher adherence to the MedDiet showed a greater reduction in body weight, total fat mass, and hepatic fat. These results support the benefit of energy-restricted diets, high adherence to the MedDiet, and high antioxidant capacity of the diet for the management of NAFLD in individuals with overweight or obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618396>SARCOPENIA AND SEVERITY OF NON-ALCOHOLIC  DISEASE.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease is characterized by deposition of lipids in the hepatic parenchyma exceeding 5% of  weight in the absence of other conditions, such as viral or alcoholic hepatitis and metabolic disease.

Hepatic accumulation of free cholesterol induces activation of nonparenchymal cells, including Kupffer cells, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells, which leads to persistent inflammation and fibrosis. The nuclear receptors  X receptor α (LXRα) and LXRβ act as negative regulators of cholesterol metabolism through the induction of hepatocyte cholesterol catabolism, excretion, and the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Additionally, LXRs exert an anti-inflammatory effect in immune cell types, such as macrophages. LXR activation suppresses acute hepatic inflammation that is mediated by Kupffer cells/macrophages. Acute  injury, diet-induced steatohepatitis, and fibrosis are exacerbated by significant hepatic cholesterol accumulation and inflammation in LXR-deficient mice. Therefore, LXRs regulate hepatic lipid metabolism and immunity and they are potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of hepatic inflammation that is associated with cholesterol accumulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615498>Elevated serum levels of aminotransferases in relation to unhealthy foods intake: Tehran lipid and glucose study.</a></h2><p>Abnormal levels of  enzymes, particularly aminotransferases, are prognostic features of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). Considering the important role of dietary intakes in development of NAFLD, we aimed to determine possible association of unhealthy foods (fast foods, soft drinks, sweet and salty snacks) consumption with elevated levels of aminotransferases.This cross-sectional study was conducted within the framework of sixth phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (2014-2017), on 187 adult men and 249 adult women (19-70 y). Usual intakes of unhealthy foods (kcal/week) were measured using a validated semi-quantitative 147-items food frequency questionnaire. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of elevated aminotransferases in each tertile of energy-dense unhealthy foods.Mean age of participants was 44.44 ± 15.09 years, 43% of participants were men. Higher consumption of fast foods (> 11.39% kcal/week) was associated with elevated ALT to AST ratio (OR: 3.27; 95% CI: 1.90-5.63) and elevated ALT (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.57-4.76). Also, each 1 SD increased energy intakes from fast foods was related to increased chance of having elevated ALT and ALT to AST ratio by 35% (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.08-1.68, OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10-1.66, respectively). There was no significant association between consumption of soft drinks, sweet or salty snacks and elevated aminotransferases.Higher intakes of energy from fast foods seems to be associated with an elevated serum levels of ALT and ALT to AST ratio, as indicators of development of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618976>The Potential of the FSP1cre- Mouse Model for Studying Juvenile NAFLD.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) can progress from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized by  inflammation, possibly leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high-fat diet, develop severe NASH. Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse  revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the  cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher lipid content was present in postnatal day 2 (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in  acid β-oxidation, and  acid and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their  in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639589>Early life high-fat diet exposure maintains glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with a  and small brain size in the adult offspring.</a></h2><p>Diet during pregnancy has long lasting consequences on the offspring, warranting a study on the impact of early exposure to a high fat diet on the adult offspring. We hypothesized that a prenatal n-6 enriched diet will have adverse metabolic outcomes on the adult offspring that may be reversed with a postnatal n-3 enriched diet. To test this hypothesis, we examined the adult offspring from three groups: (1) n-6 group: during gestation and lactation, dams consumed an n-6 polyunsaturated  acid enriched diet, (2) n-3 group: gestational n-6 diet was followed by an n-3 enriched diet during lactation, and (3) a control (CD) group that received standard diet throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring from all groups weaned to a control diet ad libitum. Beginning at postnatal day 2 (P < .03) and persisting at 360 days in males (P < .04), an increase in hypothalamic AgRP expression occurred in the n-6 and n-3 groups, with an increase in food intake (P = .01), and the n-3 group displaying lower body (P < .03) and brain (P < .05) weights. At 360 days, the n-6 and n-3 groups remained glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive, with increased phosphorylated-AMP-activated protein kinase (P < .05). n-6 group developed hepatic steatosis with reduced hepatic reflected as higher plasma microRNA-122 (P < .04) that targets pAMPK. We conclude that early life exposure to n-6 and n-3 led to hypothalamic AgRP-related higher food intake, with n-6 culminating in a  partially mitigated by postnatal n-3.

A subset of this population exhibits an aggressive histological phenotype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with ≥ stage 2 fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. The definition of NAFLD excludes excessive alcohol intake, which is well known to cause alcoholic  disease and will not be discussed here. Most NAFLD clinical trials use ~14 drinks per week as the cutoff for excessive alcohol intake. Alcohol consumption below this threshold, which we define as moderate alcohol consumption, is common in the US. According to the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 56% of the US adult population consume alcohol, but only 8.2% report drinking heavily and 18.3% report binge drinking. The American Association for the Study of  Diseases (AASLD) Practice Guidance of 2018 states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation with regard to moderate alcohol consumption in patients with NAFLD, citing a lack of longitudinal studies that examine the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on disease progression and its extrahepatic harms versus benefits, specifically in individuals with established NAFLD. NAFLD prevalence studies have generally noted a negative correlation between modest alcohol consumption and NAFLD. However, prevalence studies have limited application to patients with established NAFLD who present to the clinic. There can also be many confounding factors, because modest alcohol consumption is also negatively associated with some NAFLD risk factors, and those risk factors may not be adequately adjusted for in analyses. The prevalence of NASH with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) is more important because this is the group that is believed to have progressive disease. Thus, cohort studies of disease progression are more important from the patient's standpoint. Because these patients have already developed NAFLD or NASH, their interest lies in their odds of disease progression if they have moderate alcohol consumption compared to abstinence. It is also noteworthy that cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of death among patients with NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduction in overall mortality, but mostly in cardiovascular mortality. However, this protective effect has not been demonstrated specifically in patients with NAFLD.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

This study is aimed at establishing an intrauterine hyperglycemia rat model to investigate the growth and glycolipid metabolic characteristics in transgenerational offspring and discuss the effects of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11 (ARHGEF11) and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in offspring development. The severe intrauterine hyperglycemia rat model was caused by STZ injection before mating, while offspring development and glycolipid metabolism were observed for the following two generations. The expression of ARHGEF11, ROCK1, PI3K, and AKT was tested in the  and muscle tissue of F2 offspring. The results showed severe growth restriction in F1 offspring and obesity, , and insulin resistance in female F2 offspring, especially the offspring of female intrauterine hyperglycemia-exposed parents (F2G♀C♂) and both (F2G♀G♂). The expression of ARHGEF11 and ROCK1 was significantly elevated; PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT were significantly decreased in  tissues of F2G♀C♂ and F2G♀G♂. Our study revealed that intrauterine hyperglycemia could cause obesity and abnormal glycolipid metabolism in female transgenerational offspring; the programming effect of the intrauterine environment could cause a more obvious phenotype in the maternal line. Further exploration suggested that increased expression of ARHGEF11 and ROCK1 and the decreased expression of PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT in the  could be responsible for the abnormal development in F2 offspring.Copyright © 2019 Wanyi Zhang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632525>Neuregulin 4 attenuate tubulointerstitial fibrosis and advanced glycosylation end products accumulation in diabetic nephropathy rats via regulating TNF-R1 signaling.</a></h2><p>Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) play important roles in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD). This study aims to investigate roles of Nrg4 in the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) in diabetic nephropathy (DN). In present study, Nrg4 is under-expression in serum and renal tissue of diabetic nephropathy rats. In present study, Nrg4 attenuate renal function injury, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, inflammation and suppress the expression levels of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) in vivo and vitro.

Classically, these include findings such as spider angiomata, jaundice, palmar erythema, and as cirrhosis decompensates, ascites, variceal hemorrhage (VH), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Aside from these universal hallmarks among cirrhotics, patients with nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic  disease (ALD) harbor their own distinct systemic associations and manifestations. NAFLD is tightly linked to metabolic syndrome, which appears to be a driving force for a multitude of comorbidities, such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as increased malignancy risk. ALD also maintains a variety of comorbidities congruent with systemic effects of chronic alcohol use. These findings are highlighted by cardiovascular conditions, neuronal damage, myopathy, nutritional deficiencies, chronic pancreatitis, in addition to increased malignancy risk. While a general, guideline-driven management for all cirrhotic patients remains imperative for minimizing risk of complications, a tailored treatment strategy is useful for patients with NAFLD and ALD who entertain their own constellation of unique systemic manifestations.2019 Translational Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

There is an intriguing link between alopecia areata and gut dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been recommended to treat  (previously known as ) infection, and has also shown potentials in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and non-alcohol  disease.An 86-year-old man, with a history of sigmoid colon carcinoma, suffered from recurrent abdominal pain and distension, and diarrhea for six months, with inappetence. At admission, he was also diagnosed with depression. Upon physical examination, the patient presented with a 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm alopecia areata on his right occiput. Due to the negative results of laboratory testing, capsule endoscopy, and colonoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious diarrhea, depressive disorder, and patchy alopecia areata. Considering that noninfectious diarrhea in the elderly patient was mainly caused by gut dysbiosis, he was given six rounds of FMT. His diarrhea improved remarkably one month after FMT, with improved appetite and disappearance of abdominal pain, distension, and depressive symptoms. Surprisingly, he reported new hair growth on the affected region of his scalp, with some of his white hair gradually turning to black, without taking any other therapies for alopecia areata before and after FMT.FMT might act as a potential therapy for patients who suffer from alopecia areata.

Studies have indicated, however, that the onset of NAFLD occurs during pre-diabetes, a condition that often precedes the onset of T2DM. Oleanolic acid has been reported to improve glucose homeostasis in diet-induced pre-diabetes; however, the effects of this triterpene on  function have not been evaluated.This study was aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on selected markers of NAFLD in a pre-diabetes rat model.Pre-diabetes was induced by exposing Sprague Dawley rats to a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The pre-diabetic rats were then treated with OA (80 mg/kg) or metformin (500 mg/kg) in the presence and absence of dietary interventions for a period of 12 weeks. The effects of OA were evaluated on parameters including plasma triglycerides (TGs), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, bilirubin, AST, ALT, SREBP and antioxidant profile while the livers were collected for histological analysis.The findings of this study showed that the administration of OA to pre-diabetic rats ameliorated body/ weights ratio and significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and VLDL. Furthermore, OA also ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress, lowered the SREBP expression and intrahepatic TGs. In addition, OA administration decreased plasma concentrations of bilirubin and  damage enzyme biomarkers.The findings of the study suggest that OA ameliorates the risk of developing pre-diabetes-related NAFLD through the prevention of intrahepatic fat accumulation while also lowering hepatic inflammation.© 2019 Gamede et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646850>Non alcoholic  disease: a survey of involvement of primary care physician.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are neglected in most patients' electrical medical report by their family physicians (FP).

Increased Nogo-B expression can be determined in the  of cirrhosis patients. However, the effect of PPARγ activation on hepatic Nogo-B expression remains unknown. In this study, we found PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone or dephosphorylation increased Nogo-B expression at mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we identified a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in Nogo-B promoter and found PPARγ enhanced Nogo-B transcription in a PPRE-dependent manner. ChIP assay further confirms rosiglitazone enhanced the binding of PPARγ to Nogo-B promoter. Using a  specific PPARγ deficient mice, we determined the critical role of PPARγ expression in regulating hepatic Nogo-B expression. Increased glucose and palmitate in culture medium activated Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mouse primary hepatocytes, and corresponding, high-fat diet (HFD) induced  associated with increased hepatic Nogo-B and PPARγ expression in mice.

Patients with  damage most often reported to internal medicine specialists (59%) and gastroenterologists (27.5%). The diagnosis was based on abnormal aminotransferases (80.8%) and abdominal ultrasound examination (89.9%). Computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (50.2%) and  biopsy (22.4%) were used to assess fibrosis. Almost all respondents recommended reduction of body mass and lifestyle changes, and less than half (46.4%) recommended pharmacological treatment.NAFLD was the most common  disease that was the reason for medical consultations, but its incidence seems to be underestimated due to referral for further diagnostics only in patients with abnormal aminotransferases. The diagnostic methods used to assess the severity of the  fibrosis and the recommended pharmacological treatment varied depending on the physician's specialisation and the centre's reference level.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643255>Tetracycline.</a></h2><p>Tetracycline is an oral, broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat mild-to-moderate infections due to susceptible microbial organisms.

To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to develop a model for predicting non-completion of a specialist multidisciplinary service for clinically severe obesity, termed the Metabolic Rehabilitation Programme (MRP).Using a case-control study design in a public hospital setting, we extracted data from medical records for all eligible patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 kg/m with either type 2 diabetes or  disease referred to the MRP from 2010 through 2015. Non-completion status (case definition) was coded for patients whom started but dropped-out of the MRP within 12 months. Using multivariable logistic regression, we tested the following baseline predictors hypothesised in previous research: age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, residential distance from the clinic, blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), current continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, current depression/anxiety, diabetes status, and medications. We used receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve to test the performance of models.Out of the 219 eligible patient records, 78 (35.6%) non-completion cases were identified. Significant differences between non-completers versus completers were: age (47.1 versus 54.5 years, p < 0.001); residential distance from the clinic (21.8 versus 17.1 km, p = 0.018); obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (42.9% versus 56.7%, p = 0.050) and CPAP therapy (11.7% versus 28.4%, p = 0.005). The probability of non-completion could be independently associated with age, residential distance, and either OSA or CPAP. There was no statistically significant difference in performance between the alternate models (69.5% versus 66.4%, p = 0.57).Non-completion of intensive specialist obesity management services is most common among younger patients, with fewer complex care needs, and those living further away from the clinic. Clinicians should be aware of these potential risk factors for dropping out early when managing outpatients with severe obesity, whereas policy makers might consider strategies for increasing access to specialist obesity management services.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637675>High uric acid, reduced glomerular filtration rate and non-alcoholic  in young people with obesity.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the association between high uric acid (UA), reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in outpatient children and adolescents with overweight (OW) or obesity (OB).Anthropometric, biochemical, hepatic ultrasound and eGFR data were available from 2565 young people with OW/OB (age 5-18 years). eGFR was calculated using the Schwartz's bedside formula and reduced eGFR (ReGFR) was defined by a value < 90 mL/min/1.73 m. High UA was defined as ≥ 75th percentile by sex in children and adolescents.The population was stratified in four categories: (1) normal eGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 1,236); (2) ReGFR and absence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 155); (3) normal eGFR and presence of NAFLD (ReGFR/NAFLD (n = 1019); (4) presence of both conditions (ReGFR/NAFLD) (n = 155). Proportions of youth with high UA across the four categories were 17%, 30%, 33% and 46%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Young people with high levels of UA had odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.11 (1.43-3.11) for ReGFR; 2.82 (2.26-3.45) for NAFLD; and 5.04 (3.45-7.39) for both conditions (P < 0.0001 for all), independently of major confounders.High levels of UA were independently associated with ReGFR, NAFLD and the combination of both conditions in young people with OW/OB.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as the progressive disease entity often leads to fibrosis and end-stage disease. The magnitude of NAFLD patients are not diagnosed and have no access to further clinical assessment. Diagnostic pathways for individual risk evaluation fitting with available resources are of utmost importance in real-world clinical practice. Retrospective analysis of 1346 anonymized outpatient datasets at Würzburg University Hospital, Germany. Transient elastography (TE) with controlled attenuation parameter and laboratory-based risk scores (NFS, FIB-4) were the main diagnostic workup tools for risk stratification. After preselection based on questionnaire information NAFLD still accounts for one-fifth of patients in the  outpatient service. More than 80 % of NAFLD patients receive their first-time diagnosis in our unit. Laboratory-based risk scores and TE are valuable tools for second-step risk assessment as shown in our clinical data analysis. Moreover, 65 % of NAFLD patients use inpatient services for at least 1 day. The policy to perform  biopsy in high-risk patients above the recommended threshold of 9.6 kPa if any clinical doubt exists regarding the diagnosis of cirrhosis leads to a histological down staging in almost 80 %. Questionnaire-based referral from primary care followed by broadly available fast-track TE and eventually  biopsy for selected patients is the standard practice in our unit. This approach represents a feasible model to handle the large gap between availability and clinical need for TE facilities.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621956>Independent and combined effects of Satureja khuzistanica essential oils and acetic acid on prevalence and intensity of  syndrome in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Two hundred fifty two male Ross 308 broiler chicks were raised to examine the effects of Satureja khuzistanica essential oils (SkEO; 0, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg/bird/day) administrated via oral gavage and dietary supplementation of acetic acid (AA; 0 or 20 g/kg) in a 6 × 2 factorial fashion using a complete randomized block design with seven replicates of three birds each.

In Day 38 of age,  percentage was greater by 0.37% in the birds received 400 mg SkEO than those given 500 mg (p < .05).  fat percentage decreased in the birds fed the acidified diet and received 300 and 500 mg SkEO as well as in the birds offered 200 and 400 mg of SkEO and fed non-acidified diet than those received acidified diet with no SkEO administration (p < .05). Prevalence of score zero for hepatocytic vacuolations and necrosis was 80.00% and 42.42% in the birds receiving 600 mg SkEO respectively. Median for relative frequency of scores for hepatocytic vacuolations and hepatocytic necrosis was lesser in the birds received SkEO by oral gavage compared with that of control birds (p < .05). In conclusion, administration of SkEO via oral gavage reduced  fat in broiler chicken but no consistent dosage could be verified as the effective dosage for all ages concerned.

Almost all patients (96%) were on hypoglycaemic drugs, 58% had at least one chronic vascular complication, 19% a macrovascular complication (prior myocardial infarction and/or ischemic stroke) and 33% a microvascular one (26% chronic kidney disease [CKD]; 16% retinopathy; 6% neuropathy). One-hundred-seventy-one (72%) patients had CAP ≥248dB/m (i.e. hepatic steatosis), whereas 83 (21%) patients had LSM ≥7.0/6.2 kPa (M/XL probes) (significant  fibrosis). CAP was not associated with any macro/microvascular complications, whereas LSM ≥7.0/6.2 kPa was independently associated with prior cardiovascular disease (adjusted-OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.2-8.8; p=0.02) and presence of microvascular complications (adjusted-OR 4.2, 95%CI 1.5-11.4; p=0.005), mainly CKD (adjusted-OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.3-10.1; p=0.01) and retinopathy (adjusted-OR 3.7, CI 95% 1.2-11.9; p=0.02). Neither diabetes duration nor haemoglobin A1c differed according to CAP or LSM values.Significant fibrosis, detected by FibroScan®, is independently associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular and microvascular complications, thus opening a new scenario in the use of this tool for a comprehensive evaluation of hepatic and vascular complications in patients with T2DM.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

LT teams will be dealing with obesity in the coming years, and it is necessary for them to recognize some key aspects surrounding the LT in obese patients. Obesity by itself should not be considered a contraindication for LT, but it should make LT teams pay special attention to cardiovascular risk assessment, in order to properly select candidates for LT. Obese patients may be at increased risk of perioperative respiratory and infectious complications, and it is necessary to establish preventive strategies. Data on patient and graft survival after LT are controversial and scarce, especially for long-term outcomes, but morbid obesity may adversely affect these outcomes, particularly in NAFLD. The backbone of obesity treatment should be diet and exercise, whilst being careful not to precipitate or worsen frailty and sarcopenia. Bariatric surgery is an alternative for treatment of obesity, and the ideal timing regarding LT is still unknown. Sleeve gastrectomy is probably the procedure that has the best evidence in LT because it offers a good balance between safety and efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653319>The Importance of Amerindian Ancestry on Nonalcoholic  Disease in the Hispanic/Latino American Population.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628998>Decreased Physical Working Capacity in Adolescents With Non-Alcoholic  Disease Associates With Reduced Iron Availability: PWC in NAFLD Relates to Iron Bioavailability.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is common and related to obesity and insulin resistance. Iron metabolism is impaired in obese individuals and iron deficiency has been associated with physical inactivity. We investigated whether iron bioavailability is reduced in patients with NAFLD and contributes to reduced cardiorespiratory fitness.We collected information on weight-adjusted, submaximal physical work capacity (PWC), ultrasound-determined hepatic steatosis, iron indices, and hematologic and metabolic parameters from 390 female and 458 male participants of the Raine Study-a longitudinal study of disease development in 2868 children in Western Australia. X and linear regression analyses were used to compare characteristics of study participants according to NAFLD status at age 17 years.Fourteen percent of the cohort had NAFLD. PWC was significantly reduced in adolescents with NAFLD compared to adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.17 W/kg, P=.0003, adjusted for sex and body mass index [BMI]). Iron bioavailability (assessed by mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH], transferrin saturation, and serum levels of iron) was inversely correlated with BMI in adolescents with NAFLD (P≤.01 for all, adjusted for sex) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (P>.30). MCV and MCH correlated with PWC (MCV, P=.002 for female and P=.0003 male participants; MCH, P=.004 for female and P=.01 for male participants), irrespective of NAFLD status. Reduced PWC was associated with lower transferrin saturation in adolescents with NAFLD (reduction of 0.012 W/kg per unit decrease in transferrin saturation, P=.007) but not in adolescents without NAFLD (reduction of 0.001 W/kg, P=.40), adjusted for sex. This association was independent of MCV or MCH.In a well-defined cohort of adolescents, we found NAFLD to be associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of BMI. The relationship between transferrin saturation and PWC in adolescents with NAFLD indicates that functional iron deficiency might contribute to reductions in cardiorespiratory fitness.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

In the LIVEHIV and LHivPa cohorts, NAFLD was diagnosed if the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was ≥ 248 dB/m; in the MHMC cohort, it was diagnosed if the /spleen Hounsfield unit (HU) ratio on abdominal computerized tomography scan was < 1.1. Medium/high-risk fibrosis category was defined as fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) ≥ 1.30. Patients requiring specialist referral to hepatology were defined as either having NAFLD and being in the medium/high-risk fibrosis category or having elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT).A total of 1534 HIV-infected adults without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection were included in the study. Of these, 313 (20.4%) patients had the metabolic comorbidities (obesity and/or diabetes) required for entry in the diagnostic algorithm. Among these patients, 123 (39.3%) required specialist referral to hepatology, according to guidelines. A total of 1062 patients with extended metabolic comorbidities (any among obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia) represented most of the cases of NAFLD (79%), elevated ALT (75.9%) and medium/high-risk fibrosis category (75.4%). When the algorithm was extended to these patients, it was found that 341 (32.1%) would require specialist referral to hepatology.According to current guidelines, one in five HIV-monoinfected patients should undergo detailed assessment for NAFLD and disease severity. Moreover, one in ten should be referred to hepatology.

It is well known that insulin resistance, especially hepatic insulin resistance, is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Current research has shown that hepatic  acid accumulation can cause hepatic insulin resistance through increased gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and impaired insulin signal pathway. Mitochondria are the major sites of  acid β-oxidation, which is the major degradation mechanism of  acids. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be involved in the development of hepatic  acid-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a catabolic process, selectively degrades damaged mitochondria to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and preserve mitochondrial dynamics and function. Therefore, mitophagy can promote mitochondrial  acid oxidation to inhibit hepatic  acid accumulation and improve hepatic insulin resistance. Here, we review advances in our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and hepatic insulin resistance. Additionally, we also highlight the potential value of mitophagy in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2019 Su, Nie, Huang, Zhu, Feng, Tang and Zheng.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622696>The gut- axis in  disease: pathophysiological basis for therapy.</a></h2><p>The gut- axis refers to the bidirectional relationship between the gut and its microbiota, and the , resulting from the integration of signals generated by dietary, genetic and environmental factors.

The zebrafish (Danio rerio), is a small freshwater fish considered an appropriate vertebrate model for investigating the toxicity of compounds. Previous investigations showed tissue-specific bioaccumulation and alterations in the expression of  acid binding proteins (fabps) in male and female zebrafish, potentially due to interactions between PFAS and  acid transporters. In addition, a number of neurological impacts have been reported as a result of human and animal exposure to PFAS. Therefore, this comprehensive study was designed to investigate whether PFOS exposure affects the expression of genes associated with  acid metabolism (fabp1a, fabp2, and fabp10a) in zebrafish , intestine, heart, and ovary and genes involved in the nervous system (ChAT, ngf, bdnf, AChE, and hdac6) in brain and muscle. Results indicate alterations in expression of genes associated with  acid metabolism and neural function that vary with both exposure concentration and sex. Additionally, our findings highlight that the expression of these genes differ according to exposure duration.

In addition, dietary iron intake was positively associated with the OR of NAFLD in a dose-response relationship manner (test for trend P < .001). However, after stratifying the data by gender, such association only remained in the male, but not in the female population. With adjustment of additional potential confounders, the results did not change materially.Subjects with higher dietary iron intake were subject to a higher prevalence of NAFLD in a dose-response relationship manner.

Treatment is largely based on lifestyle modification, which is difficult to achieve in most patients. Progression of simple  or steatosis to its severe form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and  fibrosis has been explained by a 'two-hit hypothesis'. Whilst simple steatosis is considered the first hit, its transformation to NASH may be driven by a second hit. Of several factors that constitute the second hit, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are formed when reducing-sugars react with proteins or lipids, have been implicated as major candidates that drive steatosis to NASH via the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Both endogenous and processed food-derived (exogenous) AGEs can activate RAGE, mainly present on Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, thus propagating NAFLD progression. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of NAFLD with special emphasis on the role of food-derived AGEs in NAFLD progression to NASH and  fibrosis. Moreover, the effect of dietary manipulation to reduce AGE content in food or the therapies targeting AGE/RAGE pathway on disease progression is also discussed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649796>Liraglutide for non-alcoholic  disease in children and adolescents: has a new era arrived?</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657225>THE ROLE OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA IN  DISEASE.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is the natural intestinal inhabitant that has been recognized recently as a major player in the maintenance of human health and the pathophysiology of many diseases.

However, it is difficult to treat because its inherent genetic heterogeneity results in activation of numerous signaling pathways. Kinases have been targeted for decades with varying results, but the development of therapeutic resistance is a major challenge. Areas covered The key roles of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC1, TP53 microRNAs (miRs) as therapeutic targets are discussed and we suggests novel approaches for targeting miRs or their downstream targets to combat HCC. We performed literature searches using the Medline Database from 2000 to the present. Expert Opinion. The involvement of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTORC and TP53 pathways as drivers of the disease and drug resistance is a challenge. Moreover, miRs regulate the expression of key genes in these pathways. What we and others are proposing is the prospect of targeting miRs and their downstream targets to improve conventional approaches to treat HCC. Combination approaches are often promising because multiple signaling pathways are deregulated due to diverse mutations and events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614650>Polyphenol-Rich Extracts from  Bark and Fruit Ameliorate Free  Acid-Induced Lipogenesis through AMPK and LC3 Pathways.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a chronic  disease found worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the mechanisms of inhibiting lipid accumulation in free  acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells caused by bark and fruit extracts of  (TSB and TSF). FFA induced lipid and triglyceride (TG) accumulation, which was attenuated by TSB and TSF. TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced  X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1,  acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism. Moreover, TSB and TSF reduced TG contents, implying the therapeutic use of TSB and TSF in NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649231> in a two days old neonate.</a></h2><p>Neonatal death due to inborn error of metabolism (IEM) is rare in Malaysia.

Recently, a new score was developed to estimate body fat percentage (relative fat mass, RFM). We aimed to evaluate the value of RFM in predicting the presence and severity of NAFLD, compared with other anthropometric measurements.RFM, body mass index (BMI), and other anthropometric measurements were evaluated in two cohorts of subjects: a cohort from a Portuguese prospective epidemiological study (e_Cor) and morbidly obese patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. We evaluated if RFM and BMI were related with the presence and severity of  disease, which was assessed by noninvasive tools in the first cohort and by  histology in the morbidly obese cohort. The independence of relations found in univariate analysis was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.In the general population cohort, 744 subjects (48% male) were enrolled. BMI-defined obesity was present in 23% and RFM-defined obesity in 86%. Insulin resistance (IR) related with BMI-defined obesity (OR 4.37 [2.16-8.84]) and weight (OR 1.05 [1.02-1.08]) in men, and waist circumference (WC) (OR 1.07 [1.03-1.11]) in women. Dyslipidemia and hypertension related with RFM-defined obesity in men (OR 2.96 [1.36-6.47] and OR 5.37 [1.31-22.06], respectively). Ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD in 33% related with weight in men (OR 1.03 [1.003-1.06] and WC in women (OR 1.06 [1.02-1.10]). In men, ALT elevation related with weight (OR 1.04 [1.02-1.07]). In women, advanced fibrosis (estimated by NAFLD Fibrosis Score) associated with BMI-defined obesity (OR 42.43 [3.61-498.13]). In the morbidly obese cohort, 152 subjects were enrolled, of whom 84% were female, 37% had steatohepatitis, and 9.4% had advanced fibrosis. Adiponectin associated inversely and leptin positively with RFM in men. The severity of steatosis increased linearly with BMI and WC in women. Higher BMI associated with steatohepatitis in women and advanced fibrosis in men.RFM-defined obesity better predicted dyslipidemia and hypertension (though not IR) and adipokine imbalance; however, it did not add value to BMI-defined obesity in predicting NAFLD or  injury.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611648>The clinical potential of circulating microRNAs in obesity.</a></h2><p>Obesity is a complex condition that is characterized by excessive fat accumulation, which can lead to the development of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic  disease and cardiovascular diseases. Evidence is accumulating that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) act as a new class of endocrine factor. These miRNAs are released by many types of tissue, including adipose tissues. miRNAs might serve as endocrine and paracrine messengers that facilitate communication between donor cells and tissues with receptor cells or target tissues, thereby potentially having important roles in metabolic organ crosstalk. Moreover, many miRNAs are closely associated with the differentiation of adipocytes and are dysregulated in obesity. As such, circulating miRNAs are attractive potential biomarkers and hold promise for the development of miRNA-based therapeutics (such as miRNA mimetics, anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and exosomes loaded with miRNA) for obesity and related disorders. Here we review the latest research progress on the roles of circulating miRNAs in metabolic organ crosstalk. In addition, we discuss the clinical potential of circulating miRNAs as feasible biomarkers for the assessment of future risk of metabolic disorders and as therapeutic targets in obesity and related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610032>YAP in Kupffer cells enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis, although the potential role of YAP in non-neoplastic  diseases remains largely unknown. We report herein that YAP in Kupffer cells (KCs) enhances the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Our data show that the expression of YAP is significantly increased in KCs of wild type mice fed HFD. We then generated mice with macrophage/monocyte-specific deletion of YAP (YAP ) or TLR4 (TLR4 ) and the animals were fed high fat diet (HFD) or treated with LPS. Our data showed that YAP mice fed HFD exhibited lower serum ALT/AST levels and less hepatic inflammation when compared to their littermate controls. LPS treatment induced the accumulation of YAP in KCs in vitro and in mice which was prevented by macrophage/monocyte-specific deletion of TLR4 (TLR4 ). LPS transcriptionally activates YAP via AP-1 in macrophages/KCs. The LPS-induced YAP further enhances the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6) through YAP association with the TEAD-binding motif in the promoter region of inflammatory cytokines. Forced overexpression of active YAP (YAP5SA) in KCs enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment of HFD-fed mice with verteporfin inhibited Kupffer cell activation, reduced  inflammation and decreased serum ALT/AST levels. Analyses of  tissues from NASH patients reveal that YAP is increased in KCs and that the level of YAP in human  tissues is positively correlated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: This study describes an important role of YAP in Kupffer cells for regulation of  inflammation in NASH. Our findings suggest that inhibition of YAP may represent a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for NASH treatment.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607566>L-carnitine supplementation attenuates NAFLD progression and cardiac dysfunction in a mouse model fed with methionine and choline-deficient diet.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic  disorder. NAFLD, associated lipotoxicity, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and altered mitochondrial metabolism, is responsible for systemic inflammation, which contributes to organ dysfunction in extrahepatic tissues, including the heart. We investigated the ability of L-carnitine (LC) to oppose the pathogenic mechanisms underlying NAFLD progression and associated heart dysfunction, in a mouse model of methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD). Mice were divided into three groups: namely, the control group (CONTR) fed with a regular diet and two groups fed with MCDD for 6 weeks. In the last 3 weeks, one of the MCDD groups received LC (200 mg/kg each day) through drinking water (MCDD + LC). The hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress decreased after LC supplementation, which also reduced hepatic fibrosis via modulation of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), peroxisome-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and nuclear factor kappa B (NfƙB) expression. LC ameliorated systemic inflammation, mitigated cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and prevented fibrosis progression by acting on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1-2 (ERK1-2), and αSMA. This study confirms the existence of a relationship between  disease and cardiac abnormalities and highlights the role of LC in controlling  oxidative stress, steatosis, fibrosis, and NAFLD-associated cardiac dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Thus, determining the prevalence and the population risk factors of steatosis may assist in risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of steatosis and steatohepatitis among livers from adults who died due to non-burn trauma.Specimens were collected from 224 adults undergoing autopsy at a regional autopsy referral center from September 2011 to April 2013. Histopathological examination was performed on six samples obtained from different lobes of each . The outcomes of interest were the presence of steatosis, steatohepatitis, NASH inflammation and NASH fibrosis. The main predictors were body mass index, abdominal circumference,  weight and volume, presence of cholelithiasis, and siderosis. Our modeling strategy made use of a series of generalized linear models with a binomial family.Our sample had a mean age of 40 years; steatosis was diagnosed in 48.2% of cases, and steatohepatitis was diagnosed in 2.7%. The presence of a high proportion of  changes was more prevalent among males and older individuals, with the most affected age group being 41-60 years. When evaluating the crude odds ratio for steatosis, the factors significantly associated with an increased risk of steatosis were greater abdominal circumference, BMI, and  weight and the presence of siderosis.Our study reinforces the role of older age, obesity and hepatomegaly as predictors of  disease. These variables should be considered in the assessment of  changes in the livers of potential  donors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623374>A Nutraceutical Rich in Docosahexaenoic Acid Improves Portal Hypertension in a Preclinical Model of Advanced Chronic  Disease.</a></h2><p>Inflammation and oxidative stress play a key role in the pathophysiology of advanced chronic  disease (ACLD) and portal hypertension (PH). Considering the current lack of effective treatments, we evaluated an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nutraceutical rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a possible therapy for ACLD. We investigated the effects of two-week DHA supplementation (500 mg/kg) on hepatic  acids, PH, oxidative stress, inflammation, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) phenotype in rats with ACLD. Additionally, the effects of DHA were evaluated in murine macrophages and human HSC. In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, cirrhotic rats receiving DHA reestablished a healthy hepatic  acid profile, which was associated with an improvement in PH. The mechanisms underlying this hemodynamic improvement included a reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as a marked HSC deactivation, confirmed in human HSC. Experiments with cultured macrophages showed that treatment with DHA protects against pro-inflammatory insults. The present preclinical study demonstrates that a nutraceutical rich in DHA significantly improves PH in chronic  disease mainly by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress-driven HSC activation, encouraging its evaluation as a new treatment for PH and cirrhosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616668>Cardiovascular Risk in  Disease: The -Heart Axis-Literature Review.</a></h2><p>According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 18 million deaths per year. Nevertheless, the worldwide prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), also known to be common risk factors for CVD, have dramatically increased over the last decades. Chronic alcohol consumption is a major cause of chronic  diseases (CLD) as well as being a major health care cost expenditure accounting for the spending of tremendous amounts of money annually. NAFLD has become one of the major diseases plaguing the world while standing as the most common cause of  disease in the Western countries by representing about 75% of all CLD. Currently, the most common cause of death in NAFLD remains to be CVD. Several mechanisms have been suggested to be responsible for associating FLD with CVD through several mechanisms including low-grade systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines, endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipotoxicity and microbiota dysbiosis which may also be influenced by other factors such as genetic and epigenetic variations. Despite of all this evidence, the exact mechanisms of how FLD can causally contribute to CVD are not fully elucidated and much remains unknown. Moreover, the current literature supports the increasing evidence associating FLD with several cardiovascular (CV) adverse events including coronary artery disease, increased subclinical atherosclerosis risk, structural alterations mainly left ventricular hypertrophy, increased epicardial fat thickness, valvular calcifications including aortic valve sclerosis and mitral annular calcification and functional cardiac modifications mainly diastolic dysfunction in addition to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias and conduction defects including atrioventricular blocks and bundle branch blocks. Patients with FLD should be evaluated and managed accordingly in order to prevent further complications. Possible management methods include non-pharmacological strategies including life style modifications, pharmacological therapies as well as surgical management. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking FLD with an increased CV risk, in addition to associated CV adverse events and current management modalities.Copyright © 2019 Ismaiel and Dumitraşcu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643709>Thiazolidinediones.</a></h2><p>The thiazolidinediones are a relatively new family of agents for type 2 diabetes that act by increasing insulin sensitivity through a unique mechanism of engagement of the so-called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, PPAR-γ. Attachment of ligand to the PPAR-γ receptor activates a series of genes that are involved in glucose and  acid metabolism, the overall effect being an increase in insulin effect. The thiazolidinediones reduce blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and act additively with other antidiabetic medications. Troglitazone was the first thiazolidinedione that received approval for use in the United States (January 1997). However, within a year of its approval, reports of severe  injury and deaths from acute  failure began to appear. Cautionary statements and recommendations for monitoring of ALT levels were made, but after more than two dozen reports of hepatic failure and the introduction of two new thiazolidinediones in 1999, troglitazone was withdrawn from use in 2000. The newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, have been associated with only rare instances of acute  injury. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are linked to increased weight gain, heart failure and fracture risk and they are considered second-line agents for type 2 diabetes and recommended only after failure of metformin and lifestyle modifications.

We compared real-life healthcare costs of patients with NAFLD to matched controls.We performed a retrospective study of 646 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD in Sweden from 1971 through 2009. Each patient was matched for age, sex, and county of residence with 10 persons from the general population (controls). We retrieved all healthcare contacts through Dec 31, 2014 from national registers. Unit costs were assigned to arrive at a total healthcare cost (in USD [$]) per study subject.During a mean follow-up of 19.9 years, we recorded a mean of 0.27 hospitalizations per year for patients with NAFLD vs 0.16 for controls (P<.001). This corresponded to an incremental cost of $635 per year for patients with NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD had a higher mean use of outpatient care visits: 1.46 contacts per year compared with 0.86 per year in controls, corresponding to $255 in additional costs (P<.001). Total costs incurred by patients with stage 3-4 fibrosis were higher than by patients with fibrosis stage 0-2 (mean annual costs, $4397 vs $629). Cumulative costs were higher for all stages of fibrosis compared to controls.Healthcare costs are nearly twice as high in patients with NAFLD than in matched controls. This is mostly attributable to higher costs for hospitalizations, but also to more outpatient visits. Patients with advanced fibrosis had the highest costs.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The major risk factor for  cancer is cirrhosis with the underlying causes of cirrhosis being viral infection (hepatitis B or C), metabolic deregulation (Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) in the presence of obesity and diabetes), alcohol or cholestatic disorders. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive phospholipid with numerous effects, most of them compatible with the hallmarks of cancer (proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, evasion of apoptosis, deregulated metabolism, neoangiogenesis, etc.). Autotaxin (ATX) is the enzyme responsible for the bulk of extracellular LPA production, and together with LPA signaling is involved in chronic inflammatory diseases, fibrosis and cancer. This review discusses the most important findings and the mechanisms related to ATX/LPA/LPAR involvement on metabolic, viral and cholestatic  disorders and their progression to  cancer in the context of human patients and mouse models. It focuses on the role of ATX/LPA in NAFLD development and its progression to  cancer as NAFLD has an increasing incidence which is associated with the increasing incidence of  cancer. Bearing in mind that adipose tissue accounts for the largest amount of LPA production, many studies have implicated LPA in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation,  steatosis, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and lipogenesis. At the same time, LPA and ATX play crucial roles in fibrotic diseases. Given that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually developed on the background of  fibrosis, therapies that both delay the progression of fibrosis and prevent its development to malignancy would be very promising. Therefore, ATX/LPA signaling appears as an attractive therapeutic target as evidenced by the fact that it is involved in both  fibrosis progression and  cancer development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643245>Propofol.</a></h2><p>Propofol is the mostly commonly used parenteral anesthetic agent in the United States, extensively used for minor and outpatient surgical procedures because of its rapid onset and reversal of action, and in intensive care units (ICUs) for maintenance of coma.

This study quantified  fat improvement by orlistat in a Chinese cohort with NAFLD accompanied by obesity, diagnosed by a lower body mass index threshold than that for White patients.We conducted a parallel-group, open-label, 24-week, randomized clinical trial registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IPR-17012258). Obese participants with NAFLD were randomized 1:1.5 to the intervention group with orlistat or conventional care.  fat quantification was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction with Dixon sequence.Overall, 170 ( = 68, orlistat 120 mg three times/day and  = 102, conventional therapy) and 130 patients with NAFLD ( = 56, orlistat and  = 74, conventional therapy) were included for intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis, respectively. Orlistat reduced  fat content to a greater degree than conventional care [-5.45%  -1.96%,  < 0.001 (ITT analysis) and -6.66%  -2.68%,  < 0.001 (PP analysis)]. The 6-month rate of decrease in steatosis grades was higher in the orlistat group [45.6%  22.5% (ITT analysis), 57.4%  30.3% (PP analysis), both  < 0.001]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified orlistat treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.6,  = 0.036] as an independent predictor of steatosis improvement. Among patients with orlistat therapy, weight loss (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4,  = 0.040) and severe steatosis (OR = 6.7, 95% CI: 1.1-40.3,  = 0.03) remained predictive of steatosis improvement.Orlistat can effectively promote steatosis improvement and may serve as a treatment option for controlling NAFLD.ChiCTR-IPR-17012258.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614690>Exploration and Development of PPAR Modulators in Health and Disease: An Update of Clinical Evidence.</a></h2><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors that govern the expression of genes responsible for energy metabolism, cellular development, and differentiation. Their crucial biological roles dictate the significance of PPAR-targeting synthetic ligands in medical research and drug discovery. Clinical implications of PPAR agonists span across a wide range of health conditions, including metabolic diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and malignancies. In this review we aim to consolidate existing clinical evidence of PPAR modulators, highlighting their clinical prospects and challenges. Findings from clinical trials revealed that different agonists of the same PPAR subtype could present different safety profiles and clinical outcomes in a disease-dependent manner. Pemafibrate, due to its high selectivity, is likely to replace other PPARα agonists for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. PPARγ agonist pioglitazone showed tremendous promises in many non-metabolic disorders like chronic kidney disease, depression, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The clinical niche of PPARβ/δ agonists is less well-explored. Interestingly, dual- or pan-PPAR agonists, namely chiglitazar, saroglitazar, elafibranor, and lanifibranor, are gaining momentum with their optimistic outcomes in many diseases including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic  disease, and primary biliary cholangitis. Notably, the preclinical and clinical development for PPAR antagonists remains unacceptably deficient. We anticipate the future design of better PPAR modulators with minimal off-target effects, high selectivity, superior bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics.

Restoration of intracellular lipid droplet (LD) formation turns the activated HSC back to a quiescent state. Our previous studies have shown that curcumin suppresses HSC activation through increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, gamma (PPARγ) and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activities. This study aims at evaluating the effect of curcumin on lipid accumulation in HSCs and hepatocytes, and further elucidating the underlying mechanisms. Now we showed that curcumin increased LD formation in activated HSCs and stimulated the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein and  acid synthase, and reduced the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase. Exogenous perilin5 expression in primary HSCs promoted LD formation. Perilipin 5 siRNA eliminated curcumin-induced LD formation in HSCs. These results suggest that curcumin recovers LD formation and lipid accumulation in activated HSCs by increasing perilipin 5 gene expression. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK or PPARγ activity blocked curcumin's effect on Plin5 gene expression and LD formation.

The focal disturbance (FD) ratio, as calculated using ASQ, and the hepatic fat fraction (HFF), estimated by MRS, were obtained at both initial and follow-up examinations. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the correlations between ordinal values.The FD ratio showed a strong, negative linear correlation with the HFF after logarithmic transformation of both variables from the initial examinations of 36 patients (ρ=-0.888, P<0.001) and the follow-up examinations of 27 patients (ρ=-0.920, P<0.001). There was also a significant, negative linear correlation between the change in the logarithm of the FD ratio and the change in the logarithm of the HFF by MRS over the follow-up period (ρ=-0.645, P<0.001). In 16 patients with an increased FD ratio on follow-up, the HFF on follow-up MRS significantly decreased, and high-density lipoprotein levels significantly increased, whereas low-density lipoprotein levels tended to decrease.The FD ratio was significantly correlated with the HFF at both the initial and follow-up examinations, and there was also a significant correlation between changes in the FD ratio and changes in the HFF over the follow-up period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657145>Severe obesity is associated with  disease severity in pediatric non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Paediatric non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent among children with obesity. The primary objective of this study was determining whether obesity severity is associated with NAFLD severity. By using paediatric classifications for severe obesity, clinicians may be able to better risk stratify patients, which in turn would guide more effective management and treatment.Retrospective cohort study including patients followed at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center for NAFLD. Patients were categorized as overweight or class I, II, III obese based on established body mass index (BMI) cut-offs.  disease severity was determined using biochemical, imaging (magnetic resonance elastography [MRE]), and histologic evidence of  injury.Three cohorts were studied individually based on the method used to assess disease severity (biochemical n = 767, imaging n = 366, and histology n = 249). Between the three cohorts, there were significant differences in age, proportion of patients with class II and class III obesity, and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels. In the biochemistry cohort, the odds of having ALT > 80 U/L were highest in patients with class III obesity (P = .026). In the imaging cohort,  stiffness was significantly different between BMI groups of patients (P = .001). In the histology cohort, those with class III obesity had significantly higher odds of NAFLD activity score (NAS) ≥ 5 (P = .012).Obesity severity is associated with  disease severity. Patients with more severe obesity are more likely to have more advanced  disease, a finding that can assist in risk stratification, as well as monitoring and treatment approaches.© 2019 World Obesity Federation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614732>Sp1 is Involved in Vertebrate LC-PUFA Biosynthesis by Upregulating the Expression of  Desaturase and Elongase Genes.</a></h2><p>The rabbitfish  was the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the ability for the biosynthesis of long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated  acids (LC-PUFA) from C18 PUFA precursors, and all the catalytic enzymes including two  acyl desaturase 2 (Δ4 Fads2 and Δ6/Δ5 Fads2) and two elongases (Elovl4 and Elovl5) have been identified, providing a good model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in fish. Stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) has been speculated to be a vital transcription factor in determining the promoter activity of Fads-like genes in fish, however its regulatory effects on gene expression and LC-PUFA biosynthesis have not been demonstrated. Bioinformatic analysis predicted potential Sp1 binding sites in the promoters of the rabbitfish Δ6/Δ5  and , but not in Δ4  promoter. Here we cloned full-length cDNA of the rabbitfish  gene, which encoded a putative protein of 701 amino acids, and was expressed in all tissues studied with highest levels in gill and eyes. The dual luciferase reporter assay in HepG2 line cells demonstrated the importance of the Sp1 binding site for the promoter activities of both Δ6/Δ5  and . Moreover, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed the direct interaction of Sp1 with the two promoters. Insertion of the Sp1 binding site of Δ6/Δ5  promoter into the corresponding region of the Δ4  promoter significantly increased activity of the latter. In the  hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells, mRNA levels of Δ6/Δ5  and  were positively correlated with the expression of  when  was overexpressed or knocked-down by RNAi or antagonist (mithramycin) treatment. Moreover, overexpression of  also led to a higher conversion of 18:2n-6 to 18:3n-6, 18:2n-6 to 20:2n-6, and 18:3n-3 to 20:3n-3, which related to the functions of Δ6/Δ5 Fads2 and Elovl5, respectively. These results indicated that Sp1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis by directly targeting Δ6/Δ5  and  in rabbitfish, which is the first report of Sp1 involvement in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in vertebrates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640217>Characterization of Lipid Profiles after Dietary Intake of Polyunsaturated  Acids Using Integrated Untargeted and Targeted Lipidomics.</a></h2><p>Illuminating the comprehensive lipid profiles after dietary supplementation of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) is crucial to revealing the tissue distribution of PUFAs in living organisms, as well as to providing novel insights into lipid metabolism. Here, we performed lipidomic analyses on mouse plasma and nine tissues, including the , kidney, brain, white adipose, heart, lung, small intestine, skeletal muscle, and spleen, with the dietary intake conditions of arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as the ethyl ester form. We incorporated targeted and untargeted approaches for profiling oxylipins and complex lipids such as glycerol (phospho) lipids, sphingolipids, and sterols, respectively, which led to the characterization of 1026 lipid molecules from the mouse tissues. The lipidomic analysis indicated that the intake of PUFAs strongly impacted the lipid profiles of metabolic organs such as the  and kidney, while causing less impact on the brain. Moreover, we revealed a unique lipid modulation in most tissues, where phospholipids containing linoleic acid were significantly decreased in mice on the ARA-supplemented diet, and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) selectively incorporated DHA over ARA and EPA.

In addition to metabolic, genetic, and environmental factors, a dysregulated circadian rhythm resulting from lifestyle changes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). An accumulating body of evidence also supports strong association between NAFLD and metabolic disorder, the pathogenesis of which is related to periodic fluctuations in hormonal homeostasis. It is clear that endocrine and circadian rhythms are tightly interconnected. Generally, the circadian rhythm regulates flux patterns of physiological functions. The present review will discuss the modulation of bodily processes by the circadian rhythm with specific attention to the regulation of NAFLD by leptin and related hormones. : PubMed/MEDLINE was searched for articles related to concomitant occurrence of NAFLD and T2DM between January 1995 and September 2019. Areas covered included epidemiological, physiology and pathophysiology aspects. : NAFLD and NASH are increasingly prevalent and may be largely mitigated with effective lifestyle modification and, potentially, circadian rhythm stabilization. Improved knowledge of the specific pathogenesis of NAFLD in addition to enhanced diagnostic screening tools and prediction of future disease burden is imperative.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658496>Dietary Fish Oil Alters DNA Methylation of Genes Involved in Polyunsaturated  Acid Biosynthesis in Muscle and  of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar).</a></h2><p>Adequate dietary supply of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) is required to maintain health and growth of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). However, salmon can also convert α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) into eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) by sequential desaturation and elongation reactions, which can be modified by 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 intake. In mammals, dietary 20:5n-3 + 22:6n-3 intake can modify Fads2 expression (Δ6 desaturase) via altered DNA methylation of its promoter. Decreasing dietary fish oil (FO) has been shown to increase Δ5fad expression in salmon . However, it is not known whether this is associated with changes in the DNA methylation of genes involved in polyunsaturated  acid synthesis. To address this, we investigated whether changing the proportions of dietary FO and vegetable oil altered the DNA methylation of Δ6fad_b, Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b promoters in  and muscle from Atlantic salmon and whether any changes were associated with mRNA expression. Higher dietary FO content increased the proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and decreased Δ6fad_b mRNA expression in , but there was no effect on Δ5fad, Elovl2, and Elovl5_b expression. There were significant differences between  and skeletal muscle in the methylation of individual CpG loci in all four genes studied. Methylation of individual Δ6fad_b CpG loci was negatively related to its expression and to proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in the .

Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) occurs when fat is deposited (steatosis) in the  due to causes other than excessive alcohol use and is associated with  fibrosis. In this study, we asked whether miR-29a could reduce experimental high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and  fibrosis in mice. We performed systematical expression analyses of miR-29a transgenic mice (miR-29aTg mice) and wild-type littermates subjected to HFD-induced NAFLD. The results demonstrated that increased miR-29a not only alleviated HFD-induced body weight gain but also subcutaneous, visceral, and intestinal fat accumulation and hepatocellular steatosis in mice. Furthermore, hepatic tissue in the miR-29aTg mice displayed a weak fibrotic matrix concomitant with low fibrotic collagen1α1 expression within the affected tissues compared to the wild-type (WT) mice fed the HFD diet. Increased miR-29a signaling also resulted in the downregulation of expression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition-executing transcription factor , mesenchymal markers , and such pro-inflammation markers as  and  within the  tissue. Meanwhile, miR-29aTg-HFD mice exhibited significantly lower levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM, and mitochondria DNA content in the  than the WT-HFD mice. An in vitro luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-29a mimic transfection reduced  acid translocase CD36 expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: Our data provide new insights that miR-29a can improve HDF-induced obesity, hepatocellular steatosis, and fibrosis, as well as highlight the role of miR-29a in regulation of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657148>Ratio of Conjugated Chenodeoxycholic to Muricholic Acids is Associated with Severity of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Bile acids (BAs) are important molecules in the progression of nonalcoholic  disease. This study aimed to investigate BA profile alterations in Chinese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.BA profiles in serum and  tissues were determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in patients from two different clinical centers.A total of 134 participants were enrolled in this study to serve as the training (n = 87) and validation (n = 47) cohorts. The ratio of circulating conjugated chenodeoxycholic acids to muricholic acids (P = 0.001) was elevated from healthy controls to non-NASH individuals to NASH individuals in a stepwise manner in the training cohort and was positively associated with the histological severity of NASH: steatosis (R  = 0.12), lobular inflammation (R  = 0.12), ballooning (R  = 0.11), and fibrosis stage (R  = 0.18). The ratio was elevated in the validation cohort of NASH patients (P < 0.001), and it was able to predict NASH (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 75%) and significant fibrosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 71%) in these two cohorts. Moreover, this elevated ratio and impaired farnesoid X receptor signaling were found in the NASH .Altered BA profile in NASH is closely associated with the severity of  lesions, and it has the potential for predicting NASH development.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621579>Obesity-linked suppression of membrane-bound -Acyltransferase 7 (MBOAT7) drives non-alcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Recent studies have identified a genetic variant rs641738 near two genes encoding membrane bound -acyltransferase domain-containing 7 () and transmembrane channel-like 4 () that associate with increased risk of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol-related cirrhosis, and  fibrosis in those infected with viral hepatitis.

Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical  variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1).

The earliest stage of NAFLD is simple steatosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. Inhibition of steatosis is a potential treatment for NAFLD. Patchouli alcohol (PA) is an active component of  (Blanco) Benth. (Labiatae), which is a medicinal food in Asia countries and proved to possess hepatoprotective effect. This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PA against high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis in rats. In this study, male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a HFD for 4 weeks to induce NAFLD. Oral administration with PA significantly reduced pathological severity of steatosis in HFD-fed rats. It was associated with suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and regulating very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism. Our data showed that PA treatment effectively attenuated ER stress by inhibiting the activation of protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Moreover, PA decreased hepatic VLDL uptake by suppressing very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) expression. It also restored VLDL synthesis and export by increasing apolipoprotein B100 (apoB 100) secretion and microsomal triglyceride-transfer protein (MTP) activity. Taken together, PA exerted a protective effect on the treatment of NAFLD in HFD-fed rats and may be potential therapeutic agent acting on hepatic steatosis.Copyright © 2019 Wu, Xu, Li, Huang, Wu, Gan, Chen, Luo, Li, Huang, Su and Liu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646127>Metabolic clinic for individuals with HIV/AIDS: a commitment and vision to the future of HIV services.</a></h2><p>One of the biggest current challenges in managing an ageing cohort living with the HIV is handling dyslipidaemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic  disease. Combination antiretroviral therapy decrease mortality and morbidity in HIV patients, but lead to increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, abnormalities of fat distribution and high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, a metabolic clinic was established for individuals living with HIV in the Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The clinic meets considerable demands by service users and hence has the potential to be popular. This review focuses on the importance of the development of a metabolic clinic for the purpose of audit, research, teaching and exchange of knowledge between HIV specialists and the metabolic team in the management of complex cases. Therefore, the metabolic clinic should be an integral part of HIV services especially as the cohort of the 'older' HIV population increases.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Namodenoson, a selective agonist of the A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR), which is highly expressed in pathological  cells, induces a robust anti‑inflammatory effect in the , mediated via the de‑regulation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. Namodenoson also acts as a  protective agent by inhibiting ischemia/reperfusion injury. Based on these unique characteristics, we investigated the anti‑NASH effect of Namodenoson in murine models of steatohepatitis and in the LX2 human hepatic stellate cell line (HSC). In the STAM model, Namodenoson significantly decreased the non‑alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) activity score, NAS, demonstrating anti‑inflammatory and anti‑steatotic effects. In the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) model, Namodenoson reversed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to normal values and significantly improved  inflammation and fibrosis, as well as the adiponectin and leptin levels. Namodenoson de‑regulated the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway in the  extracts of the CCl4 model mice and in the LX2 HSCs, manifested by a decrease in the expression of phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), nuclear factor κ‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B cells (NF‑κB), β‑catenin, lymphoid enhancer‑binding factor 1 (Lef‑1) and cyclin D1, and an increase in the expression level of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK‑3β). The fibrosis marker, α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) was also de‑regulated, supporting the anti‑fibrotic effect of Namodenoson. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that Namodenoson exerts an anti‑NASH effect mediated via the de‑regulation of the PI3K/NF‑κB/Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway.

Primary analyses were performed on the three cohorts and secondary analyses on subcohorts including patients with NAFLD diagnosis code (N = 6599). Case/outcome definitions were formulated with International Classification of Diseases/Read codes/laboratory results and classified using validated algorithms. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated with a Poisson regression model.When comparing the T2DM+HBV and T2DM cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 14.06 (95% confidence interval: 4.47-44.19) for cirrhosis and 2.83 (1.06-7.55) for HCC. When comparing the T2DM+HBV and HBV cohorts, adjusted IRRs were 0.68 (0.21-2.27) for cirrhosis and 1.39 (0.46-4.20) for HCC.

Simple steatosis can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of NAFLD. The most potent driver for NASH is hepatocyte death induced by lipotoxicity, which triggers inflammation and fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis and/or  cancer. Despite the significant burden of NAFLD, there is no therapy for NAFLD/NASH. Accumulating evidence indicates gender-related NAFLD progression. A higher incidence of NAFLD is found in men and postmenopausal women than premenopausal women, and the experimental results, showing protective actions of estradiol in  diseases, suggest that estrogen, as the main female hormone, is associated with the progression of NAFLD/NASH. However, the mechanism explaining the functions of estrogen in NAFLD remains unclear because of the lack of reliable animal models for NASH, the imbalance between the sexes in animal experiments, and subsequent insufficient results. Herein, we reviewed the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH focused on gender and proposed a feasible association of estradiol with NAFLD/NASH based on the findings reported thus far. This review would help to expand our knowledge of the gender differences in NAFLD and for developing gender-based treatment strategies for NAFLD/NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653116>The Positive Effects of  Heteropolysaccharide on NAFLD and Regulation of the Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p> Non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem in many countries.

Here, we study the effect of Zingiber officinale and omega-3  acids on ER stress for treating NAFLD. Male Wistar rats were fed on a normal diet (control group) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. The HFD rats were later treated with vehicle, omega-3 or with Z. officinale extract. HFD group demonstrated significantly more body weight gain and higher plasma lipid profile, glucose, and hepatic enzymes. The expressions of lipogenic ChREBP and ER stress genes CHOP, XBP1, and GRP78 were increased. This was accompanied by intrahepatic fat accumulation visualized by hepatic morphology and H&E-stained sections. Treatment with Z. officinale and omega-3  acids reverted these changes into a normal healthy state. From these results, we prove that both therapeutic approaches can be potential drugs for treating NAFLD besides other ER stress-associated diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The effect of Zingiber officinale extract and omega-3  acid on ER stress associated with NAFLD was investigated. The results revealed that Z. officinale extract and omega-3  acids significantly inhibited ER stress and intrahepatic fat accumulation with the upper hand for Z. officinale extract.

Although neonicotinoids display a high specificity for insects, their use has been recently debated since several studies led to the hypothesis that they may have adverse ecological effects and potential risks to mammals and even humans. Due to their hydrophobic nature, neonicotinoids need specific carriers to allow their distribution in body fluids. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant plasma protein, is a key carrier of endogenous and exogenous compounds. The in silico docking and ligand binding properties of acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam to HSA are here reported. Neonicotinoids bind to multiple  acid (FA) binding sites, preferentially to the FA1 pocket, with high affinity. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for neonicotinoid binding FA1 of HSA (i.e.,  K ) derived from in silico docking simulations (ranging between 3.9 × 10 and 6.3 × 10 M) agree with those determined experimentally from competitive inhibition of heme-Fe(III) binding (i.e.,  K ; ranging between 2.1 × 10 and 6.9 × 10 M). Accounting for the HSA concentration in vivo (~7.5 10 M), values of K here determined suggest that the formation of the HSA:neonicotinoid complexes may occur in vivo. Therefore, HSA appears to be an important determinant for neonicotinoid transport and distribution to tissues and organs, particularly to the  where they are metabolized.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635053>Magnetic-Assisted Treatment of  Fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Chronic  injury can be induced by viruses, toxins, cellular activation, and metabolic dysregulation and can lead to  fibrosis.

Oestrogen injections induced FLHS, but the incidence and severity of the condition was increased with a combination of E & LPS. Hepatic mRNA levels of the genes encoding key regulators of inflammation such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were evaluated. The expression of IL-6 mRNA in hepatocytes of all treated groups (E, LPS and E & LPS hens) was elevated from 6 to 56 fold (< 0.01), when compared to baseline and control values, with the highest fold change at 3 h post-treatment. The mRNA levels for IL-1β were better expressed at 24 h post-treatments with E, LPS and E & LPS. The expression of IL-18 mRNA in the  tissue was lower than IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA in all treated birds.

The results revealed that in the NAFLD model, LRP6 expression was negatively associated with miR‑21 expression. After antagonizing the expression of miR‑21, the protein level of LRP6 was increased. In addition, the WNT/β‑catenin signaling pathway was activated, and lipid accumulation and inflammation were alleviated in the . However, the expression of PPAR‑γ was not inhibited following the upregulation of the WNT signaling pathway.

NAFL (non-alcoholic ) is now, with the prevalence of 40 %, the most common  disease in Western countries. Despite that NAFL has usually no symptoms and in most patients, it is diagnosed as an incidental finding by abdominal ultra-sound, every third of these patients develops NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), resulting in an individual progression of the sequence of fibrosis - cirrhosis - hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the fact, that NASH is, along with the cardiovascular causes, involved in -related mortality of patients with the metabolic syndrome, from clinical view, it is fundamental to distinguish between benign NAFL and potentially progressive NASH. This appears even more serious realizing that patients with NASH are being often underdiagnosed because of limited indications of  biopsy, a common diagnostically gold standard. This work emphasizes the relationship between metabolic syndrome and  disease and presents the main diagnostic possibilities of NAFL/NASH, the most dealing with serum markers.

A new method using LCMS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) analysis of serum lipids now fulfils these criteria, having high enough specificity and sensitivity, and have also been validated by comparing with a large cohort of patients diagnosed with  biopsy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630897>NAFLD and Atherosclerosis: Two Sides of the Same Dysmetabolic Coin?</a></h2><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) is strongly increasing and may put patients at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (asCVD). Both disease phenotypes often co-occur, in the case of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus type 2, and the metabolic syndrome. We explore the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the epidemiology of asCVD in NAFLD patients, shared drivers of both phenotypes, and factors caused by NAFLD that contribute to asCVD. Genetic studies support that NAFLD may drive asCVD through mixed hyperlipidemia. Next, we discuss the prospects of lifestyle improvement and pharmacological treatment of NAFLD for asCVD risk reduction. Finally, we point out that earlier identification of patients with NAFLD should be pursued by increasing awareness of the association of these two phenotypes and collaboration between the involved physicians.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Biotin deficiency is very rare in those who take in a normal balanced diet. Mammals obtain biotin from food. Foods rich in biotin are egg yolk, , cereals (wheat, oats), vegetables (spinach, mushrooms), and rice. Dairy items and breast milk also contain biotin. Besides, gut micro bacteria can produce biotin. The average dietary intake of biotin in the western population is approximately 35 to 70 mcg/day.[2][3][5]Copyright © 2019, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652578>The SGLT2 Inhibitor Canagliflozin Prevents Carcinogenesis in a Mouse Model of Diabetes and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis-Related Hepatocarcinogenesis: Association with SGLT2 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of canagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and NASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model of diabetes and NASH-HCC. First, mice aged five weeks were divided into two groups (vehicle group and canagliflozin group) and were treated for three weeks. Then, mice aged five weeks were divided into three groups of nine animals each: the vehicle group, early canagliflozin group (treated from five to nine weeks), and continuous canagliflozin group (treated from five to 16 weeks). Canagliflozin was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg in these experiments. In addition, the in vitro effects of canagliflozin were investigated using HepG2 cells, a human HCC cell line. At the age of eight or 16 weeks, the histological non-alcoholic  disease activity score was lower in the canagliflozin-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. There were significantly fewer hepatic tumors in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly fewer glutamine synthetase-positive nodules in the continuous canagliflozin group than in the vehicle group. Expression of α-fetoprotein mRNA, a marker of HCC, was downregulated in the continuous canagliflozin group when compared with the vehicle group. At 16 weeks, there was diffuse SGLT1 expression in the hepatic lobules and strong expression by hepatocytes in the vehicle group, while SGLT2 expression was stronger in  tumors than in the lobules. In the in vitro study, canagliflozin (10 μM) suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry showed that canagliflozin reduced the percentage of HepG2 cells in the G2/M phase due to arrest in the G1 phase along with decreased expression of cyclin D and Cdk4 proteins, while it increased the percentage of cells in the G0/1 phase. Canagliflozin also induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3. In this mouse model of diabetes and NASH/HCC, canagliflozin showed anti-steatotic and anti-inflammatory effects that attenuated the development of NASH and prevented the progression of NASH to HCC, partly due to the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis as well as the reduction of tumor growth through the direct inhibition of SGLT2 in tumor cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625900>[Dysfunctions of mitochondrial  acid β-oxidation in rare and common diseases].</a></h2><p>Dysfunctions of mitochondrial  acid ß-oxidation (ß-FAO) in various tissues represent a hallmark of many common disorders, and are acknowledged to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity, and cardiac diseases. Moreover, inborn defects in ß-FAO form a large family of rare diseases with variable phenotypes, ranging from fatal multi-organ failure in the newborn to isolated adult onset myopathy. These pathologies highlight the critical role of ß-FAO in many tissues with high-energy demand (heart, muscle, , kidney). Furthermore, and unexpectedly, very recent data unveiled the possible involvement of ß-FAO in instructing complex non energy-related functions, such as chromatin modification, control of neural stem cell activity, or survival and fate of cancer cells. Pharmacological targeting of ß-FAO by small molecules might therefore open new avenues for the treatment of various rare or common diseases.© 2019 médecine/sciences – Inserm.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647808>Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men.</a></h2><p>Obesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases. It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death. We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran's Q-test (Phet). A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic  disease, chronic  disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet = 1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet = 3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet = 1.0×10-4) in men than women. Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626206>[Evaluation of the effect of remaxol on hepatocytes in non-alcoholic  dystrophy modeling in laboratory C57BL/6 mice].</a></h2><p>To provide a morphological evaluation of the effectiveness of incorporating remaxol into a treatment regimen for non-alcoholic  disease.The investigation was conducted using 32 male C57BL/6 mice weighing 35-44 g, which were divided into 4 groups. In Group 1, eight mice were fed with a standard diet for 75 days; the animals from Groups 2 and 3 received a hypercaloric diet for the same period of time. The mice from Group 2 were euthanized immediately after the diet was stopped; and Group 3 was switched to the standard diet after 20 days of the recovery period. Group 4 included the mice that were, after a 75-day hypercaloric diet, were injected with remaxol at a dose of 25 ml/kg once daily every other day; the cycle consisted of 10 injections.  tissues were morphologically evaluated using Oil Red O-stained tissue specimens additionally stained with Mayer's hematoxylin on the cryostat sections applying a Zeiss Axio Imager. A2 microscope equipped with an Axiocam 506 color camera. The photographed images were processed using the ZEN 2.3 program ('Carl Zeiss', Germany).The morphological equivalent of  improvement in mice that were injected and were not injected with remaxol was found to be normalization of the lobular structure, preservation of the structure and intralobular orientation of the hepatic tubules, and restoration of the width of the sinusoidal lumen. The degree of infiltration was much lesser than that in the group of experimental animals that did not additionally receive the drug.These histological signs may suggest that remaxol is effective in treating non-alcoholic  disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640183>Water Extract of  L.

HepG2 cells were treated with free  acid (FFA) mixture (oleic acid: palmitic acid, 2:1) for 24 h to stimulate in vitro . In addition, C57BL/6 mice were fed 60 kcal% high-fat (HF) diet for eight weeks to induce  in vivo. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) productions were increased by FFA and HF-diet, but supplementation with CLW significantly decreased these levels. CLW treatment ameliorated antioxidant activities that were suppressed by exposure to the FFA and HF-diet. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) and  acid transport proteins (FATP2 and FATP5) were increased in HF-diet groups, while CLW suppressed their expression levels. Moreover, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), and  acid synthase (FAS) expression levels were down-regulated in the CLW groups compared to HF-diet groups. On the other hand, 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) expressions were up-regulated in the CLW groups. HF-diet fed mice showed high hepatic triglycerides (TG) content compared to the normal diet mice. However, the administration of CLW restored the hepatic TG level, indicating an inhibitory effect against lipid accumulation by CLW. These results suggest that CLW could be a potentially useful agent for the prevention of NAFLD through modulating  acid uptake.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656291>The Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy on Obesity and Obesity-related Disease : the Results of 10 Initial Cases.</a></h2><p>Introduction : The number of patients who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been increasing.

Results of a multicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate the perioperative use of Omega-3 polyunsaturated  acids (Ω3-FA) to reduce post-operative complications after  surgery.In a variety of animal models, Ω3-FA disclosed strong protective effects in alleviating hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury and steatosis with enhancement of regeneration after major tissue loss. Given these benefits along with its safety profile, we hypothesized that perioperative administration of Ω3-FA in patients undergoing  surgery may ameliorate the post-operative course.A multi-centric, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to test whether two single intravenous infusions of Omegaven (Ω3-FA) vs. placebo may decrease morbidity. The primary endpoints were postoperative complications by severity (Clavien-Dindo classification) integrated in the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI).Between July 2013 and July 2018, 261 patients (132 in the Omegaven and 129 in the placebo groups) were included in the trial from three centers. Most cases (87%, n=227) underwent open  surgery and 56% (n=105) were major resections (≥3 segments). In an intention-to-treat analysis including the drop out cases, the mortality rate was 4% and 2% in the OmegavenTM and placebo groups (P=0.447; OR: 95%CI: 0.04-2.51), respectively. Any complications and major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3b) occurred in 46% vs. 43% (P=0.709) and 12% vs. 10% (P=0.69) in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively. The mean CCI was 17 (±23) vs.14 (±20) (P=0.417). An analysis excluding the drop-outs provided similar figures.The routine perioperative use of two single doses of intravenous Ω3-FA (100ml Omegaven) cannot be recommended in patients undergoing  surgery (Grade A recommendation).This trial fails to detect an effect on the use of two single Omega-3  acid infusions before and during  surgery to reduce complications. Despite strong evidence of -directed anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative action in various rodent models, this trial fails to confer  protection with single Omega-3  acid infusions and is therefore currently not recommended.Copyright © 2019.

NAFLD is associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity and genetic factors and includes a spectrum of potentially progressive  disease that comprises of simple steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), variable degree of fibrosis and, ultimately, cirrhosis. Simple steatosis has been considered a benign condition, while the progression to fibrosis and advanced  disease is related to NASH development. While steatosis is diagnosed by routine imaging methods, NASH could be diagnosed only by  biopsy. Life style modification and weight reduction is the method of choice in the treatment of NAFLD. Despite intensive effort, no pharmacological treatment of NAFLD has been approved; based on the results of clinical trials the use of vitamin E or pioglitazone could be considered in the treatment of bioptically proved NASH.

Similar study was done in the normal glucose tolerance and prediabetes groups separately. These parameters were then compared with those of 75 matched diabetic teetotallers with NAFLD. To analyse further the difference between normal glucose tolerance, prediabetic and overt diabetic groups, binary logistic regression of the factors was carried out taking prediabetes and diabetes as outcome variable.All the metabolic parameters were significantly higher in diabetics compared to non diabetics and in prediabetics compared to those with normal glucose tolerance except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and BMI significantly predicted NFS in the overall (adjusted R2 68.7%, P=0.000) and normal glucose tolerance groups (adjusted R2 73.2%, P=0.000) whereas BMI, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HbA1c did in prediabetics (adjusted R2 89%, P=0.000). The metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with NFS in the overall and prediabetic groups. High triglyceride (odds ratio1.08), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (odds ratio1.03) and HbA1c (odds ratio 11.54) were positively associated with prediabetes compared to normal glucose tolerance group.In nondiabetic teetotallers dyslipidemias are the prime contributors to the development of NAFLD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649922>Investigation of the Antibacterial Activity and  Cytotoxicity of Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles as Potent Therapeutics.</a></h2><p>Biogenic nanoparticles are the smartest weapons to deal with the multidrug-resistant "superbugs" because of their broad-spectrum antibacterial propensity as well as excellent biocompatibility.

Electron microscopic images confirmed the synthesis of almost spherical shaped biogenic silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs). The zeta potentials of the nanoparticles were negative and were -22 and -26 mV for Aq-bAgNPs and Et-bAgNPs, respectively. The antibacterial activity of bAgNPs was investigated against seven pathogenic (i.e., enteropathogenic ) and three nonpathogenic (i.e.,  DH5α,  K12, and ) bacteria at different time points (i.e., 12, 16, 20, and 24 h) in a dose-dependent manner (i.e., 20, 40, and 60 μg) through broth dilution assay, disk diffusion assay, CellTox Green uptake assay, and trypan blue dye exclusion assay. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration value for both the bAgNPs was 0.125 μg. Et-bAgNPs showed the highest antibacterial activity against  at 60 μg after 16 h and the diameter of inhibited zone was 28 mm. Lipid peroxidation assay using all the bacterial strains revealed the formation of malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid adduct due to the oxidation of cell membrane  acids by bAgNPs. The bAgNPs showed excellent hemocompatibility against human as well as rat red blood cells. Furthermore, there was no significant toxicity observed when the levels of rat serum ALT, AST, γ-GT (i.e.,  function biomarkers), and creatinine (i.e., kidney function biomarker) were determined.Copyright © 2019 Hossain, Polash, Takikawa, Shubhra, Saha, Islam, Hossain, Hasan, Takeoka and Sarker.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633718>NONALCOHOLIC  DISEASE (NAFLD), MORE THAN A  DISEASE.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644209>Tamoxifen.</a></h2><p>Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal antiestrogen that is widely used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer.

Chronic therapy with fibrates has been associated with transient mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and with rare instances of acute  injury, which can be severe and evolve into chronic hepatitis, with progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fibrates are derivatives of fibric acid. Therapy with fibrates in humans leads to a lowering of serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels leading to decreases in triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Several fibrates have also been found to decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL) and increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, but their effects are, in general, less than what can be achieved with the statins. The fibrates are currently used largely in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and are used in combination with statins to treat hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism by which the fibrates lower lipid levels is unknown, but they may act through interactions with the hepatic peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) which regulate gene transcription of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and secretion. The fibrates bind specifically to a PPAR alpha isozyme, which is found largely in the  and which regulates  acid oxidation, increasing lipoprotein lipase levels which, in turn, enhances clearance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617122>Prediction of Recurrence Patterns from Hepatic Parenchymal Disease After Resection of Colorectal  Metastases.</a></h2><p>Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with inflammatory hepatic parenchymal disease (HPD) and increased risk for recurrence after resection of colorectal  metastases (CRLM). The independent impact of HPD on recurrence patterns has not been well defined.The nonalcoholic  disease activity score (NAS) was used to quantify HPD including steatosis and fibrosis for all patients with completely resected CRLM between April 2003 and March 2007. Clinicopathologic factors, perioperative history, and outcomes were compared with the NAS. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the association between severe HPD (NAS ≥ 3) with clinical and perioperative characteristics. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS). The cumulative incidences of recurrence [any intrahepatic recurrence (IHR), extrahepatic recurrence only (EHR), and death without recurrence (DWR)] were estimated using competing risks methods.Among the 357 patients included in this study, microsteatosis was noted in 124 (35%) patients, severe HPD in 31 (9%), steatohepatitis in 14 (4%), and sinusoidal injury in 36 (10%). After median follow-up of 127 months (range 4-175 months), 10-year RFS was 22% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17-27%]. Ten-year cumulative incidence for IHR, EHR, and DWR was 37%, 30%, and 12%, respectively. After controlling for confounders, NAS ≥ 3 was independently associated with higher risk of IHR [hazard ratio (HR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-2.90, p = 0.027] and lower risk of EHR (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.75, p = 0.019) on multivariable analysis.Severe HPD was associated with increased IHR risk and decreased EHR risk.

In a cross-sectional study, to compare fasting and postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle (TRLP) concentrations and size in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women and determine the relationship between TRLP subfractions and whole-body insulin sensitivity, hepatic and visceral fat, and SCD-1 levels.  In 122 federally employed women without diabetes, 73 black (58 African American and 15 African immigrant) and 49 white; age 44{plus minus}10 (mean{plus minus}SD); BMI 30.0{plus minus}5.6 kg/m2 we measured lipoprotein subfractions using nuclear magnetic resonance. Hepatic fat was measured by proton MRS, insulin sensitivity index (SI) calculated by minimal modeling from a frequently-sampled intravenous glucose test, RBC  acid profiles by gas chromatography were used to estimate SCD-1 indices. Hepatic fat, S, and SCD-1 were similar in black women and lower than in whites, regardless of menopausal status. Fasting and postprandial large, medium and small TRLPs, but not very small TRLPs, were lower in black women. Fasting large, medium and very small TRLPs negatively correlated with S and positively correlated with visceral and hepatic fat, and SCD-1 activity in both groups. In multivariate models, visceral fat and SCD-1 were associated with total fasting TRLP concentrations (adjR= 0.39, P=0.001). Black women had smaller postprandial changes in large (P=0.005) and medium TRLPs (P=0.007).  Lower visceral fat and SCD-1 activity may contribute to the paradoxical association of lower fasting and postprandial TRLP subfractions despite insulin resistance in black compared to white pre- and post-menopausal women. Similar concentrations of very small TRLPs are related to insulin resistance and could be important mediators of cardiometabolic disease risk in women.  .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31643954>Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists.</a></h2><p>The angiotensin II receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are a family of agents that bind to and inhibit the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and thus inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and its cascade of effects in causing arteriolar contraction and sodium retention.

Since their introduction in 1995, these agents have been used widely in the therapy of hypertension and to reduce the complications of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and diabetic nephropathy. The ARBs in clinical use in the United States include eight agents of similar chemical structure and activity, but somewhat different pharmacokinetics: losartan (Cozaar: 1995), valsartan (Diovan: 1996), irbesartan (Avapro: 1997), eprosartan (Teveten: 1997), candesartan (Atacand: 1998), telmisartan (Micardis: 1998), olmesartan (Benicar: 2002) and azilsartan (Edarbi: 2011). All of these agents have been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during chronic therapy (0.2% to 2%) which are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, self limited, and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. As a class, the ARBs have been associated with rare instances of acute  injury that is usually self limited in duration, but varies in clinical expression, being usually hepatocellular but occasional cholestatic in nature. The most common presentation of  injury due to these agents is a cholestatic hepatitis arising within 1 to 8 weeks of starting and resolving as rapidly with stopping. Rare instances of prolonged jaundice have been described but not acute  failure or autoimmune chronic hepatitis. Several Individual case reports of clinically apparent  injury have been published in the literature for losartan, valsartan, irbesartan olmesartan and candesartan, but not specifically for azilsartan, eprosartan, and telmisartan, probably because these three have been in use for a shorter period of time and in fewer subjects. Most ARBs and particularly olmesartan have been linked to rare instances of severe sprue-like enteropathy. The enteropathy typically presents with severe diarrhea and weight loss with variable degrees of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising 6 months to many years after starting the ARB. Small intestinal histological findings resemble those of celiac disease with flattening of the duodenal villuous pattern and villous atrophy. However, anti-transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies (the serologic markers of celiac disease) are negative and there is little or no response to a gluten-free diet. Withdrawal of the ARB, however, results in prompt improvement in the diarrhea and gradual resolution of duodenal villous flattening. Some cases of this drug induced enteropathy have had accompanying serum aminotransferase elevations and  by imaging or  biopsy, which, along with the diarrhea, resolve rapidly with stopping the medication.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651571>The Prevalence of Lean/Nonobese Nonalcoholic  Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h2><p>The prevalence of lean/nonobese nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) ranges widely in studies. Thus, here, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population to give clarity.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting NAFLD prevalence in the lean/nonobese population. Lean or nonobese was defined by body mass index cutoffs reported by authors in original studies. NAFLD prevalence based on community, population, or health checkups was combined with random-effect model after logit transformation. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were further performed to investigate the heterogenicity.A total of 45 studies were enrolled in the final analysis, with 55,936 lean/nonobese subjects included, among whom 7351 NAFLD patients were diagnosed. Overall, the pooled NAFLD prevalence of the lean or nonobese population was 10.2% (95% confidence interval: 7.6%-13.6%) and 15.7% (95% confidence interval: 12.5%-19.6%), respectively. Compared with western studies, the NAFLD prevalence in the lean or nonobese population was lower in eastern studies. In addition, the NAFLD prevalence in both the lean and nonobese population showed a general upward trend during recent years. The prevalence was similar in community-based and health checkup-based studies. Lean/nonobese NAFLD patients had significantly lower rates of hypertension, lower uric acid and fasting plasma glucose, and a higher level of high-density lipoprotein than nonlean/obese patients.The prevalence of NAFLD in the lean/nonobese population is not rare in either the western or eastern regions of the world. This meta-analysis of prevalence assessment and clinical characteristics should enable higher confidence in more specific interventions and health care standards for these patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622986>Exogenous Hydrogen Sulfide Alleviates-Induced Intracellular Inflammation in HepG2 Cells.</a></h2><p> acids induced hepatic inflammation plays an important role in nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) pathogenesis. Hydrogen sulfide (HS), an endogenous gasotransmitter, has been established to possess potent anti-inflammation in various human organs. However, the anti-inflammation property of HS in the  is still needed to further elucidate. Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether exogenous HS can protect hepatocytes against inﬂammation induced by palmitic acid (PA). HepG2 hepatocytes were exposed to PA for 24 h to induce free  acids-induced inflammation. The cells were pretreated with NaHS (a donor of H2S) before exposure to PA. Cell viability, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β), NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB were measured by a combination of MTT assay, ELISA, Western blot and Immunofluorescence. Here, we found that exogenous HS dose-dependently inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of NF-κB signaling in PA-induced HepG2 cells. Thus, HS might be a candidate therapeutic agent against NAFLD.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630414>First-in-class  acid synthase inhibitor TVB-2640 reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis in males with metabolic abnormalities.</a></h2><p>Elevated hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a key distinguishing characteristic of nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In rodent models of NAFLD, treatment with a surrogate of TVB-2640, a pharmacological inhibitor of FAS (FASi), has been shown to reduce hepatic fat and other biomarkers of DNL. The purpose of this Phase I clinical study was to test the effect of the TVB-2640 in obese men with certain metabolic abnormalities that put them at risk for NAFLD. Twelve subjects (mean±SE, 42±2y, BMI 37.4±1.2 kg/m , glucose 103±2 mg/dL, TG 196±27 mg/dL, and elevated  enzymes) underwent 10 days of treatment with TVB-2640 at doses ranging from 50-150 mg/d. Food intake was controlled throughout the study. Hepatic DNL was measured before and after an oral fructose/glucose (F/G) bolus using isotopic labeling with 1- C -acetate IV infusion, followed by measurement of labeled VLDL-palmitate via GC/MS. Substrate oxidation was measured by indirect calorimetry. Across the range of doses, fasting DNL was reduced by up to 90% (P=0.003). Increasing plasma concentrations of TVB-2640 were associated with progressive reductions in the percent of fructose-stimulated peak fractional DNL (R = - 0.749, P=0.0003) and absolute DNL AUC 6h post F/G bolus (R = - 0.409, P=0.025). For all subjects combined, ALT was reduced by 15.8±8.4% (P=0.05). Substrate oxidation was unchanged and safety monitoring revealed that the drug was well tolerated, without an increase in plasma triglycerides. Alopecia occurred in two subjects (reversed after stopping the drug), but otherwise no changes were observed in fasting glucose, insulin, ketones, and renal function. These data support the therapeutic potential of FASi, TVB-2640 in particular, in patients with NAFLD and NASH.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625959>Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance closely related to lobular inflammation in nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>Insulin resistance (IR) has been established as a major risk factor for nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) where it exerts effects on plasma glucose homeostasis, cellular anabolism, and organ glucose uptake. Owing to paucity of studies focused on peripheral IR in relation to pathological outcome, we aim to investigate homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by histological characteristics of NAFLD. biopsy of 588 patients was screened. After excluding etiologies other than NAFLD and factors contributing to IR, serum HOMA-IR was compared with patients' histologic features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess their relationship. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was calculated to assess the discriminatory ability of homeostatic model assessment of IR for advanced lobular inflammation (LI).We observed higher serum level of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and low-density lipoprotein as HOMA-IR increased. HOMA-IR is significantly associated with severity of LI (odds ratio = 1.222, 95% confidence interval = 1.135-1.315, P < 0.001), similar association remained after adjusting for age, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides (odds ratio = 1.205, 95% confidence interval = 1.102-1.317, P < 0.001). HOMA-IR is discriminant of LI with AUROC = 0.832 and cutoff = 2.995 (sensitivity = 0.938, specificity = 0.569).This study demonstrated a strong and independent association of HOMA-IR with the severity of  inflammation by histological evaluation in NAFLD patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and its possible role in diagnosis of LI could be translated into clinical assessment of NAFLD patients with uncertainty of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646583>Key molecular pathways in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic  disease worldwide and also become an emerging risk factor for -related complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The -related burden of NASH is likely to increase and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is probably to be the leading indication for  transplantation by 2020, as a consequence of increased disease prevalence and of the lack of an effective treatment. The first step in the NAFLD development is represented by fat accumulation in the , a condition that is commonly associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Notably, it has been acknowledged that the step from nonalcoholic  (NAFL) to NASH is key step in the NASH formation, and the mechanisms behind this transition have been extensively studied. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immunity is a driving force in NAFLD progression because it directly regulates all key pathogenic features of the disease processes, including metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the currently available signaling pathways of NASH formation, including oxidative stress, NOD-like receptors (NLRs), mitochondria-associated pathways, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nuclear receptors, and other signal pathways, for the aim of a better understanding of this disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633652> Transplantation for Propionic Acidemia: A Multi-center Linked Database Analysis.</a></h2><p>Propionic Acidemia (PA) is a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting from deficiency in the enzyme necessary for catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, some odd chain  acids and cholesterol. Despite optimal medical management, PA often leads to acute and progressive neurological injury. Reports on  transplantation (LT) as a cellular therapy are limited and varied. The objective of this study was to examine the largest collection of patients who underwent LT for PA.Examining the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the Pediatric Health Information System administrative billing databases, we performed a multicenter, retrospective analysis of LT over a 16-year period. During this period, 4849 pediatric LT were performed out of which 23 were done for PA at 10 different centers.The majority of recipients were 5 years of age or younger and had status 1b exception points at the time of transplant. The 1-, 3-, and 5- year graft survival for PA LT recipients was 84.6% and the 1-, 3, and 5- year patient survival was 89.5%. There was no significant difference in graft or patient survival between PA and non-PA LT recipients. Despite historical data to the contrary, we did not find an increased incidence of hepatic arterial thrombosis in patients undergoing LT for PA. Patients in the PA LT group, however, had a significantly higher post-operative rate of readmission compared to the non-PA LT group (90.5% vs. 72.8%, p = 0.021).LT for children with PA is a viable treatment option with acceptable outcomes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637346>Nonalcoholic  Disease in Nonobese Subjects of African Origin Has Atypical Metabolic Characteristics.</a></h2><p>Nonobese nonalcoholic  disease is reported in several populations.

CT was used to estimate  and abdominal fat and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), adiponectin, and fetuin-A. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), insulinogenic index (IGI), and oral disposition index (oDI) were calculated after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test.Fifty-two percent of participants were male; mean (±SD) age was 28.5 ± 7.8 years, and body mass index was 22.4 ± 3.0 kg/m. Mean  attenuation (MLA) and /spleen (LS) ratio, both inversely correlated to  fat, were 62.8 ± 4.3 HU and 1.2 ± 0.1, respectively; 3.8% of participants had  fat >30% (LS ratio < 1). In age, sex, and BMI-adjusted correlations, MLA was negatively associated with weight ( = -0.30;  = 0.009) and height ( = -0.28;  = 0.017) and was associated with fasting glucose ( = 0.23;  = 0.05), fasting insulin ( = 0.42;  ≤ 0.001) and HOMA-IR ( = 0.35;  = 0.004). Serum lipids, ALT, adiponectin, fetuin-A, WBISI, IGI, and oDI were not associated with  fat.In nonobese Afro-Caribbean participants, greater  fat was associated with weight and height and lower fasting insulin and hyperinsulinemia appears to be influential in the reduction of NAFLD.

This study examined urinary L-FABP excretion under renal ischemia in feline acute kidney injury (AKI) model. L-FABP excretion increased immediately after renal ischemia/reperfusion, despite the absence of obvious structural damage to the kidneys, in the two AKI model cats studied. L-FABP was detected in the renal tubular lumen immediately after renal ischemia/reperfusion in the two cats, but not in a sham surgery cat.

Using a model of prenatal maternal 70% food restriction diet (FR30) in rat, we previously showed that maternal undernutrition predisposes offspring to altered lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, especially under high-fat (HF) diet. Here, using microarray-based expression profiling combined with metabolic, endocrine, biochemical, histological and lipidomic approaches, we assessed whether FR30 procedure sensitizes adult male offspring to impaired lipid metabolism in the . No obvious differences were noted in the concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and bile acids in the  of 4-month-old FR30 rats whatever the post-weaning diet used. However, several clues suggest that offspring's lipid metabolism and steatosis are modified by maternal undernutrition. First, lipid composition was changed (i.e., higher total saturated  acids and lower elaidic acid) in the  whereas larger triglyceride droplets were observed in hepatocytes of undernourished rats. Second, FR30 offspring exhibited - impact on hepatic gene expression and lipid metabolism pathways under chow diet. Although the transcriptome profile was globally modified by maternal undernutrition, cholesterol and bile acids biosynthesis pathways appear as key targets indicating that FR30 animals were predisposed to impaired hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Third, FR30 procedure markedly modifies hepatic gene transcription profiles in undernourished offspring in response to post-weaning HF.

Non-obese and lean individuals were defined as BMI<30kg/m and BMI<25kg/m, respectively.Totally 310 patients were included. Seventy-six individuals (24.5%) had NAFL and 30 patients (9.67%) had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) among non-obese population. In multivariate regression analysis, only higher BMI was marginally associated with NASH in non-obese compared to those without NASH (Odds ratio: 2.52, 95% CI: 0.097-6.54; P=0.05). Totally, 246 individuals were lean. 55 individuals (22.3%) had NAFL and 20 individuals (8.2%) had NASH in their  biopsies. In univariate analysis, serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and uric acid were associated with NAFL among lean individuals (P<0.05). In regression analysis, serum uric acid was associated with NAFL (Odds ratio: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.18-2.45; P=0.004) and NASH in lean individuals (Odds ratio: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.27-3.10; P=0.003).NAFLD/NASH is prevalent even in a healthy lean population when evaluated by  biopsy. Higher BMI and serum uric acid were two major risks of NAFLD/NASH in non-obese and lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Vitamin E is recommended for treatment of NASH in the general population. However, its safety and efficacy among HIV-infected patients remain unknown.Single centre, phase IV, open-label, single arm clinical trial.HIV mono-infected patients without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection were included. The diagnosis of NASH was based on the co-existence of , diagnosed by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) ≥ 248 dB/m, and significant hepatocyte apoptosis, defined by the serum biomarker cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) >130.5 U/L. Participants were treated with 800 IU daily of oral vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) for 24 weeks, and followed for an additional 24 weeks post-discontinuation. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate changes in ALT, CAP and CK-18 at the completion of treatment and end of follow-up, controlling for pre-treatment trends.A total of 27 patients were included. Four (15%) had a pretreatment  biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of NASH in all cases. Compared to baseline, 24 weeks of vitamin E treatment improved ALT (-27 units/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] -37, --17), CAP scores (-22 dB/m; 95% CI -42, -1) and CK-18 (-123 units/L; 95% CI -201, -46). Conversely, there was no change in BMI. No serious adverse event was reported and no patient was lost to follow-up.In this first clinical trial, we showed that vitamin E is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for NASH in HIV-infected patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617130>Usefulness of Controlled Attenuation Parameter in Detecting and Monitoring Hepatic Steatosis with MRI-PDFF as Reference.</a></h2><p>Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) has been developed to estimate the extent of hepatic steatosis.The purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of CAP in assessing hepatic steatosis and its change using magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as reference standard.Consecutive patients with  steatosis were enrolled prospectively. We assessed hepatic steatosis with CAP and MRI-PDFF at enrollment and 12-month follow-up. The correlations between the two methods were analyzed. With MRI-PDFF as reference, the performance of CAP in diagnosis of steatosis severity and its changes was assessed.A total of 50 patients were enrolled, and 45 of them had follow-up MRI-PDFF and CAP at a median interval of 399 days. The mean hepatic steatosis was 13.4% by MRI-PDFF and 291.6 dB/m by CAP. There were positive correlations between CAP and MRI-PDFF in steatosis severity and its change. The median value of CAP was 254, 301.5, and 329.5 dB/m for steatosis < 10%, 10-20%, and > 20%, respectively. For CAP in detecting steatosis ≥ 10% and > 20%, the diagnostic performance was 0.821 and 0.814. With the cutoff of 275 dB/m for ≥ 10% steatosis, the positive predictive value was 84.8%. With the cutoff of 325 dB/m for > 20% steatosis, the negative predictive value was 91.9%. In multiple linear regression, one dB/m change by CAP was associated with 0.039% change by MRI-PDFF.In assessing  fat content, CAP correlated with MRI-PDFF and was useful for detection and monitoring of hepatic steatosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639597>A sensitive and efficient method for simultaneous profiling of bile acids and  acids by UPLC-MS/MS.</a></h2><p>The carboxyl group is the functional group in both bile acids (BAs) and  acids (FAs) (BAFAs). Considering the functional correlation and the structural similarity of these compounds, a sensitive and efficient method was developed here for the first time to simultaneously profile BAFAs based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Through optimization of the chromatographic conditions, all BAFAs can be efficiently separated and quantified in 19 min with excellent peak shape. For comprehensive profiling of endogenous FAs without standards, a strategy was established to predict the retention times (RTs) of all theoretically possible FAs on the basis of the good multiple linear regression relationship between RT and FA carbon chain length and double bond number. High-resolution mass spectrometry was employed for the final confirmation of these predicted FAs. Twenty-eight FAs in rat serum were newly identified using this strategy. Though the regulation of collision energies (CEs) for highly abundant compounds, the problems of their poor quantification linearity and accuracy caused by MS signal saturation were solved, facilitating the simultaneous quantification of both high- and low-abundance BAFAs with good linearity and accuracy. The established UPLC-MS/MS method was further used to quantify BAFAs in rat serum and to explore the disturbance of BAFA metabolism in the Tripterygium glycoside-induced  injury rat model. A total of 25 BAs and 55 FAs in rat serum were identified and quantified. Several BAFAs, including nordeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid and some unsaturated FAs, were found to differ significantly in the control and model groups. These BAFAs are very promising biomarkers for the evaluation of Tripterygium glycoside-induced  injury.Copyright © 2019.

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and lipid metabolism, and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the . Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into  suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the  after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of  acid synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

It is characterized by accumulation of fat in the hepatocytes associated with lobular inflammation and balonization, which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Thus, a characterization and follow-up of a progression of the fibrosis level of these patients becomes important, being that the transient hepatic elastography is a reliable method for this evaluation with a measure of the kapa index.To evaluate the progression of hepatic fibrosis through elastography in patients with non-alcoholic  disease.Patients who had previously performed hepatic biopsy and noninvasive scores for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis were included in the study. These same subjects were then submitted to current clinical evaluation, laboratory and  elastography tests, defining the level of  fibrosis, about 10 years after the first evaluation.Data were analyzed for 66 patients previously submitted to  biopsy. Of these, 16 were not found, four could not participate because they were debilitated due to hepatic cirrhosis, two had died from an automobile accident and five from complications of cirrhosis of the . Therefore, of the 50 patients with a known history, 9 (18%) had died of cirrhosis or were unable to attend the examination because of their  disease. The remaining population was predominantly female (61.5%), mean age of 63 years, being overweight, dyslipidemia (76.9%), disorders of the glycemic profile (76.9%), and metabolic syndrome (82.1%). Of the 39 cases evaluated, 35% had the same degree of fibrosis at the initial evaluation (biopsy) and at the current evaluation (elastography), 33% had an increase in the degree of fibrosis and another 30% had a decrease in the degree of fibrosis. Twenty-eight patients had NASH at baseline. Regarding these patients, it was observed in the current evaluation, that 25% remained stable in the degree of fibrosis, 39% progressed, and 35% regressed.Despite some limitations of our study, such as the small number of patients, and the use of two different methods of evaluation (biopsy and elastography), the data obtained allow us to conclude that of the 39 evaluated cases, 33% (13) presented progression of fibrosis and the total group of 50 patients, 42% had cirrhosis or died due to  disease.

Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats received 20% fructose in drinking water (10 treated with allopurinol and 10 received vehicle) and 10 control rats received tap water. After 14 days, the hepatic response to an acute fructose load was evaluated, and in fasted animals, respirometry studies in freshly isolated mitochondria were performed. In fasting rats, we did not find differences in systemic or hepatic uric acid and triglyceride concentrations among the groups, but mitochondrial respiratory control rate was significantly decreased by high fructose feeding and correlated with a reduced expression of Complex I, as well as decreased aconitase-2 activity. On the other hand, in fructose fed rats, an acute fructose load increased systemic and hepatic uric acid, triglycerides and oxidative stress. Fructose feeding was also associated with fructokinase and xanthine oxidase overexpression and increased  de novo lipogenesis program ( acid synthase (FAS) and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector C (CIDEC) overexpression, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC) overactivity and decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation). Allopurinol treatment prevented hepatic and systemic alterations.

They are widely used in medical practice, but currently have restricted usefulness. Tetracyclines act by binding to bacterial ribosomes inhibiting protein synthesis. Bacterial resistance is common and is usually caused by plasmids that decrease the bacterial cell wall permeability. At least eight different tetracyclines are currently available in the United States: tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline, sarecycline, omadacycline, eravacycline and demeclocycline. Several others tetracyclines have been used in the past in the United States or Europe, but have been withdrawn (chlortetracycline, aureomycin, triacetyloleandomycin, rolitetracycline, oxytetracycline). While all tetracyclines are capable of causing a distinctive form of acute  disease when given intravenously in high doses,  injury from oral forms tetracyclines vary greatly in frequency and clinical features. Minocycline is the most commonly implicated tetracycline in causing  injury and generally ranks within the 10 most common causes of drug induced  injury in developed nations. Minocycline hepatotoxicity generally presents with a long latency, hepatocellular enzyme elevations, prominent autoimmune features, apparent response to corticosteroid therapy and relatively bengn course. Doxycycline, in contrast, usually presents with a short latency (within 60 days), a cholestatic course, mild immunoallergic or autoimmune features and sometimes prolonged, but ultimately benign course. The other tetracyclines have had limited clinical use and are generally suspected but unproven potential causes of  injury.References updated: 10 April 2019</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633654>Evaluation of Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Early Phase Clinical Trials of Steatohepatitis in Adolescents.</a></h2><p>Early-phase pediatric nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) clinical trials are designed with non-invasive parameters to assess potential efficacy. Increasingly, these parameters include MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and MR elastography (MRE)-derived shear stiffness as biomarkers of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. Understanding fluctuations in these measures is essential for calculating trial sample sizes, interpreting results, and planning clinical drug trials in children with NAFLD. Lack of such data in children comprises a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whole- MRI-PDFF change in adolescents with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) over 12 weeks.Adolescents 12-19 years with biopsy-proven NASH undergoing standard-of-care treatment were enrolled. Baseline and week-12 assessments of anthropometrics, transaminases, MRI-PDFF, and MRE-stiffness were obtained.Fifteen adolescents were included (mean age 15.7 [SD 2.9] years). Hepatic MRI-PDFF was stable over 12 weeks (mean absolute change -0.8%, p = 0.24). Correlation between baseline and week-12 values of MRI-PDFF was high (ICC = 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 - 0.99). MRE-stiffness was stable (mean percentage change 2.7%, p = 0.44); correlation between baseline and week-12 values was moderate (ICC = 0.47; 95% CI: 0, 0.79). Changes in weight, BMI, and aminotransferases were not statistically significant.In adolescents with NASH, fluctuations in hepatic MRI-PDFF and MRE-stiffness over 12 weeks of standard-of-care were small. These data on the natural fluctuations in quantitative imaging biomarkers can serve as a reference for interventional trials in pediatric NASH and inform the interpretation and planning of clinical trials.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637181>Effect of Weight Reduction on Histological Activity and Fibrosis of Lean Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Patient.</a></h2><p>Weight reduction has evidenced benefit on attenuation of histological activity and fibrosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but there is scarcity of data for lean NASH subgroup. We have designed this study to compare the effects of weight reduction on histological activity and fibrosis of lean and non-lean NASH.We have included 20 lean and 20 non-lean histologically proven NASH patients. BMI < 25 kg/m2 was defined as non-lean. Informed consent was taken from each subject. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moderate exercise along with dietary restriction was advised for both groups for weight reduction. After 1 year, 16 non-lean and 15 lean had completed second  biopsy.Age, sex, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltrasferase (GGT), Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) was similar in both groups. Steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, nonalcoholic  disease activity score (NAS) and fibrosis was similar in the two groups. In lean/non-lean group, any amount of weight reduction, ≥ 5% weight reduction and ≥ 7% weight reduction was found in respectively 8/11, 5/6 and 2/6 patients. In both lean and non-lean groups, weight reduction of any amount was associated with significant reduction of steatosis, ballooning and NAS, except lobular inflammation and fibrosis. In both groups, weight reduction of ≥ 5% was associated with significant reduction in NAS only. However, significant improvement in NAS was noted with ≥ 7% weight reduction in non-lean group only.Smaller amount of weight reduction had the good benefit of improvement in all the segments of histological activity in both lean and non-lean NASH.© 2019 Shahinul Alam, Mohammad Jahid Hasan, Md.
