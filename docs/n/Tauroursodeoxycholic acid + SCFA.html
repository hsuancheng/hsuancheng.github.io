Mitochondrial SH3BP5 (also called SAB) and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediate the hepatotoxic effects of APAP. We investigated the involvement of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STARD1), a mitochondrial cholesterol transporter, in this process and sensitization by valproic acid (VPA), which depletes glutathione and stimulates steroidogenesis.Nonfasted C57BL/6J mice (control) and mice with liver-specific deletion of STARD1 (Stard1), SAB (Sab), or JNK1 and JNK2 (Jnk1+2) were given VPA with or without APAP. Liver tissues were collected and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry and for APAP metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial function. Adult human hepatocytes were transplanted into Fah/Rag2/Il2rg/NOD (FRGN) mice to create mice with humanized livers.Administration of VPA before administration of APAP increased the severity of liver damage in control mice. The combination of VPA and APAP increased expression of CYP2E1, formation of NAPQI-protein adducts, and depletion of glutathione from liver tissues of control mice, resulting in ER stress and the upregulation of STARD1. Livers from control mice given VPA and APAP accumulated cholesterol in the mitochondria and had sustained mitochondrial depletion of glutathione and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of ER stress, by administration of  to control mice, prevented upregulation of STARD1 in liver and protected the mice from hepatoxicity following administration of VPA and APAP. Administration of N-acetylcysteine to control mice prevented VPA- and APAP-induced ER stress and liver injury. Stard1 mice were resistant to induction of ALF by VPA and APAP, despite increased mitochondrial levels of glutathione and phosphorylated JNK; we made similar observations in fasted Stard1 mice given APAP alone. Sab mice or Jnk1+2 mice did not develop ALF following administration of VPA and APAP. The ability of VPA to increase the severity of APAP-induced liver damage was observed in FRGN mice with humanized liver.In studies of mice, we found that upregulation of STARD1 following ER stress mediates APAP hepatoxicity via SH3BP5 and phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type  cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection . These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148866>Effects of alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase genotype variants on plasma metabolome, immune responses and gastrointestinal bacterial enumeration of pigs pre- and post-weaning.</a></h2><p>In pigs, the alpha-(1,2) fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene has been highlighted for its properties in controlling the intestinal expression of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) F18 receptors; a pathogen causing edema disease and post-weaning diarrhoea. In this study, we hypothesized that pigs with different genotypes (ETEC F18 resistant (FUT1AA) versus susceptible (FUT1AG)) differed in following systemic and enteric responses: growth performance, plasma metabolic profiles, expression of candidate genes for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and immunity, number of selected bacteria and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in faeces and digesta in piglets pre and post-weaning, and on the ETEC F18 adherence ex vivo. Genotype had the strongest impact on plasma metabolomic profile on day 7 and 28 of age. FUT1AG piglets had higher level of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, hippuric acid, oxindole, and 3-oxo-5-beta-chol-7-en-24-oic acid on day 7, and a higher level of guanosine on day 28 than that in the FUT1AA piglets. FUT1AA piglets had a higher level of betaine on day 7 and 3-methylguanine on day 28. On day 34 of age, the FUT1AA pigs had higher levels of S-2-hydroxyglutarate, L-phenylalanine,  and an undetermined PC/LysoPC, while Ile Glu Phe Gly peptide and genistein 5-O-glucuronide, and PC (18:0/0:0) were at higher levels in the FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype did not affect the growth performance and expression of candidate genes. FUT1AG piglets had a higher number of haemolytic bacteria in faeces and in digesta than that in FUT1AA at 34 days of age. The colonic acetic acid concentration was highest in FUT1AG piglets. FUT1 genotype may influence not only the expression of E. coli F18 receptors but could potentially impact the gut homeostasis and metabotype of piglets pre and post-weaning. Further investigations on the relation between FUT1 genotype and these aspects including the intestinal commensal  will expand the knowledge on factors affecting the intestinal ecosystem.</p></html>
