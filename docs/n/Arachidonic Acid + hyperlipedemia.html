They were divided into groups of 35 apparently healthy males, 16 males with coronary heart disease, 37 males with dyslipidemia and 9 males with hypertension with age ranges of 24-62, 56-69, 25-69 and 26-75 years, respectively. The female groups were composed of 55 apparently healthy females, 10 females with coronary heart disease, 73 females with dyslipidemia and 15 females with hypertension with age ranges of 27-65, 33-67, 22-73 and 38-70 years, respectively. Platelet fatty acids levels were found to have no significant difference between the different male groups. In the female groups, the alpha-linolenic  (ALA) level in hypertension was significantly higher than in coronary heart disease (CHD) (p<0.05), whereas the  (AA) level in hypertension was significantly higher than in the apparently healthy females (p<0.05). No correlation was found between platelet fatty acids and age or anthropometric parameters, which indicate that platelet fatty acids may not depend on either age or anthropometric parameters. Positive correlations were shown between ALA and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), AA and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), ALA and the diastolic blood pressure, DHA and total cholesterol (TC), and between low density lipoprotein choleoterol (LDL-C) and plasma glucose. Negative correlations were shown between LA and EPA, AA and EPA, EPA and DHA, EPA and the systolic blood pressure, and AA and the diastolic blood pressure.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27737722>Exchanging a few commercial, regularly consumed food items with improved fat quality reduces total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol: a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The healthy Nordic diet has been previously shown to have health beneficial effects among subjects at risk of CVD. However, the extent of food changes needed to achieve these effects is less explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of exchanging a few commercially available, regularly consumed key food items (e.g. spread on bread, fat for cooking, cheese, bread and cereals) with improved fat quality on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and inflammatory markers in a double-blind randomised, controlled trial. In total, 115 moderately hypercholesterolaemic, non-statin-treated adults (25-70 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental diet group (Ex-diet group) or control diet group (C-diet group) for 8 weeks with commercially available food items with different fatty  composition (replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA). In the Ex-diet group, serum total cholesterol (P<0·001) and LDL-cholesterol (P<0·001) were reduced after 8 weeks, compared with the C-diet group. The difference in change between the two groups at the end of the study was -9 and -11 % in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, respectively. No difference in change in plasma levels of inflammatory markers (high-sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-6, soluble TNF receptor 1 and interferon-γ) was observed between the groups. In conclusion, exchanging a few regularly consumed food items with improved fat quality reduces total cholesterol, with no negative effect on levels of inflammatory markers. This shows that an exchange of a few commercially available food items was easy and manageable and led to clinically relevant cholesterol reduction, potentially affecting future CVD risk.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14624957>A perinatal strategy to prevent coronary heart disease.</a></h2><p>I investigated whether metabolism of essential fatty acids and the concentrations of their long-chain metabolites (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [LCPUFAs]) are altered in fetal or perinatal growth retardation, maternal hypercholesterolemia, low-grade systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and atherosclerosis, conditions that predispose to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD).I critically reviewed the literature pertaining to the metabolism of essential fatty acids in CHD and conditions that predispose to it.LCPUFAs enhance endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, suppress the production of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, attenuate insulin resistance, and have antiatherosclerotic properties. Low-birthweight infants have decreased concentrations of LCPUFAs, especially . Neonatal  status is related to intrauterine growth, and LCPUFAs improve fetal and postnatal growth. LCPUFAs are useful in the management of , inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, and may mediate the beneficial actions of statins. Plasma concentrations of various LCPUFAs are low in diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and CHD and in populations at high risk of CHD. Breast milk is rich in LCPUFAs, and this may explain why and how adequate (6 mo to 1 y) breast feeding protects against the development of obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and CHD.LCPUFAs are essential for the growth and development of the fetus and infant. LCPUFAs can prevent various conditions that predispose to the development of CHD. The low incidence of CHD seen in adequately breast-fed infants can be linked to the LCPUFA content of breast milk. Based on this evidence, I suggest that provision of LCPUFAs during critical periods of growth, especially from the second trimester of pregnancy to age 5 y, prevents CHD in adult life.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18681780>Monocyte gene-expression profile in men with familial combined  and its modification by atorvastatin treatment.</a></h2><p>The genetic origin of familial combined  (FCH) is not well understood. We used microarray profiling of peripheral blood monocytes to search novel genes and pathways involved in FCH.Fasting plasma for determination of lipid profiles, inflammatory molecules and adipokines was obtained and peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from male FCH patients basally and after 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment. Sex-, age- and adiposity-matched controls were also studied. Gene-expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 GeneChip arrays.Analysis of gene expression by cDNA microarrays showed that 82 genes were differentially expressed in FCH monocytes compared with controls. Atorvastatin treatment modified the expression of 86 genes. Pathway analysis revealed the over-representation of the complement and coagulation cascades, the hematopoietic cell lineage and the  metabolism pathways. Changes in the expression of some genes, confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, (CD36, leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains-1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 25, CD96 and lipoprotein lipase), may be related to a proinflammatory environment in FCH monocytes, which is partially reversed by atorvastatin. Higher plasma levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids and lower levels of adiponectin in FCH patients could also trigger changes in gene expression that atorvastatin cannot modify.Our results show clear differences in gene expression in FCH monocytes compared with those of matched healthy controls, some of which are influenced by atorvastatin treatment.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10797850>Effect of methyl-prednisone and cyclosporine on the lipid pattern and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in the rat.</a></h2><p>The  posttransplant has been largely attributed to immunosuppressant agents. In the present work we evaluated the effect of oral administration of cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day) and/or methyl-prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) on lipid composition and polyunsaturated fatty  biosynthesis in normal adult male rats. The results obtained showed that both agents produced a delay on the growth together with a significant loss of body weight. In liver microsomal fraction from rats treated with methyl-prednisone, a depression in delta 6 and delta 5 desaturation activities, was observed. This effect was corroborated in the fatty  pattern through the enhancement of linoleic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids, and a depression of . Similar results were noticed in those rats treated with both drugs when compared to the controls. No changes were observed either in the amount of liver microsomal total lipids or in the fatty  composition of kidney and testis microsomes, as well as in erythrocyte membranes, among the different groups studied. Cyclosporine alone produced a significant depression in plasma triglycerides and showed no modifications in the other lipid parameters studied compared to the controls. Fluorescence anisotropy measured in the different membranes was not modified by the several treatments used. In view of the aforementioned data, it can be stated that methyl-prednisone would be the responsible for many of the lipid disorders that can be observed in posttransplant patients when they are subjected to the combined immunotherapy with cyclosporine.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18446850>Korean red ginseng attenuates hypercholesterolemia-enhanced platelet aggregation through suppression of diacylglycerol liberation in high-cholesterol-diet-fed rabbits.</a></h2><p>Intake of Korean red ginseng (KRG, ginseng Radix rubra), rich in glycosylated saponins (ginsenosides), has been known to inhibit platelet aggregation in the normocholesterolemic condition. However, it is unclear whether KRG can attenuate hypercholesterolemia-enhanced platelet aggregation. This study examined whether the daily consumption of a KRG-water extract (WE) could prevent the hypercholesterolemia-enhanced platelet aggregation and progression of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis. KRG-WE administration (200 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks potently inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by low doses of agonists (0.5 microg/mL collagen and 0.025 unit/mL thrombin), whereas it weakly reduced the blood-cholesterol levels and formation of atheromatous lesions. In further investigation, KRG-WE significantly suppressed collagen-induced 1,2-diacylglycerol liberation, but had no significant effect on  liberation. Taken together, it can be suggested that the antiplatelet effect of KRG-WE may, at least partly, be due to the inhibition of 1,2-diacylglycerol generation rather than regulation of blood lipid levels. In conclusion, daily consumption of KRG-WE could be a useful alternative measure for the prevention of thrombus and atheroma formation in hypercholesterolemia.Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12324225>Regulation of PUFA metabolism: pharmacological and toxicological aspects.</a></h2><p>Levels of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) of the n-6 and n-3 series in animal plasma and cells are directly or indirectly dependent upon the intakes of either their precursors, the short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (SCP), linoleic (LA, 18:2 n-6) and alpha linolenic  (ALA, 18:3 n-3), respectively, and/or of the preformed products (, 20:4 n-6) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6 n-3). We report here that pharmacological agents and cytotoxic compounds significantly affect the production of LCP from SCP in cultured cells. Using labelled substrates and radio HPLC separations, we observed that the potent hypocholesterolemic agent, simvastatin, activates the formation of AA from LA, mainly acting at the delta5 desaturation step, and increases also the mRNA levels, in cultured monocytic cells (THP-1). Elevation of AA occurs also in plasma lipids of hyperlipemic patients treated with statins (but not with fibrates). Conversely, oxysterols (mainly 7-beta-oxysterol), which are detected in circulating lipoproteins of rabbits on a hypercholesterolemic diet, potently inhibit the synthesis of AA from LA in hepatocytic cell lines (Hep-G2). At the same time plasma levels o AA are reduced vs controls, in spite of an identical intake of LA. Finally, on the basis of previous work showing reduced levels of LCP, mainly DHA, in the milk of cigarette-smoking mothers, we have observed that the incubation of human mammary gland cells with sera exposed to cigarette smoke results in marked inhibition of the production of DHA from ALA. The products in smoke responsible for this effect, are being identified through mass spectrometric techniques. In conclusion, pharmacological agents and toxic compounds, such as oxysterols and smoke products affect key steps in the synthesis of the LCP, major bioregulators in mammalian cells.Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23534412>Antithrombotic activity of a newly synthesized coumarin derivative 3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-N-{2-[3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-propionylamino]-ethyl}-propionamide.</a></h2><p>Anti-platelet therapy is a useful strategy to prevent acute thromboembolic artery occlusions. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of seselin derivatives against murine pulmonary thromboembolism, bleeding time, platelet activation and thrombosis. Administration of C3 (16 mg/kg) offered 70% protection against collagen- and epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism and 30% protection against -induced death in mice, without adversely affecting bleeding time. No significant difference was observed by C3 in ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis in rats. Significant reduction in thrombus weight was observed in arteriovenous shunt model. In rat PRP, C3 reduced ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In chronic hamster model of dyslipidemia, administration of C3 (16 mg/kg p.o. for 90 days) had no effect on plasma lipids, vasoreactivity and platelet adhesion. C3 fed hamsters showed reduced whole-blood aggregation response to ADP and collagen compared to HC-fed hamsters. In addition, C3 augmented thrombin time; however, time to occlusion was not increased. These results convincingly demonstrated that C3 is a novel molecule that reduces the risk of thrombosis and alleviates prothrombotic state associated with  without any adverse effect on bleeding time.

The platelet aggregation, platelet survival, activity of intraplatelet metabolism of , radiofibrinogen binding to platelet, circulating platelet aggregates and both the activity of factor VIII and the concentration of von Willebrand factor antigen in the plasma were measured. In the majority of patients the impairment of platelet aggregation with ADP, enhancement of radiofibrinogen binding to platelets and an increase of factor VIII level in the plasma were established. There was an interrelationship between platelet dysfunction and disturbances of lipid metabolism. Platelet survival was shortened in patients with moderate  and correlated with a concentration of HDL-cholesterol in the serum. The radiofibrinogen binding to platelets was the most pronounced in patients with severe  and correlated with a concentration of total cholesterol in the serum.

We investigated whether platelet inhibition by simvastatin correlates with the statin effects on lipid lowering, inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial and platelet activation.In hypercholesterolemic patients allocated to diet (n=20) or a 2-month treatment with diet plus 40 mg simvastatin (n=25), we evaluated platelet aggregating responses to ADP, collagen, and  (AA), the effect of aspirin on AA-induced aggregation, pro- and anti-inflammatory and atherogenic mediators (IL-1, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12, and -13, IFN-, IP-10, Eotaxin, and sRAGE), markers of endothelium (sE-selectin, VEGF, and MCP-1) and platelet activation (sP-selectin, sCD-40L, RANTES, and PDGF-bb), and oxidative stress (8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine).After treatment, beside the improvement of lipid profile, we observed the following: a reduction of platelet aggregation to ADP (p=0.0001), collagen (p=0.0001), AA (p=0.003); an increased antiaggregating effect of aspirin in the presence of AA (p=0.0001); a reduction of circulating levels of IL-6 (p=0.0034), IL-13 (p<0.0001), IFN- (p<0.0001), VEGF (p<0.0001), sE-selectin (p<0.0001), sCD-40L (p<0.0001), sP-selectin (p=0.003), and 8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine (p<0.0001); an increase of IL-10 and sRAGEs (p=0.0001 for both). LDL-cholesterol levels (i) positively correlated with IL-6, IFN-, E-selectin, sCD-40L, 8-OH-2'-deoxyguanosine, platelet aggregation to ADP, collagen, AA, and aspirin IC-50 and (ii) negatively correlated with IL-10 and sRAGE. In multiple regression analyses, LDL-cholesterol was the strongest predictor for most parameters of platelet reactivity.In primary hypercholesterolemia, simvastatin treatment reduced platelet activation and subclinical inflammation and improved endothelial dysfunction.

The same PC species with AA were also decreased in the patient's platelets. Thus the supply of phospholipid-bound AA from LDL to the platelets was probably diminished after the apheresis. We therefore analyzed the concentration dependence of the transfer of phospholipid-bound AA from LDL to the platelets under in vitro conditions. The amount of [14C]AA-PC transferred to platelets strongly increased upon elevation of LDL from 0.1 to 1 mg protein/ml, with a less marked elevation being noted at higher LDL concentrations. After stimulation with thrombin (0.5 U/ml), 7.1% ([14C]AA-PC) and 10.6% ([14C]AA-phosphatidylethanolamine) of the 14C transferred from LDL to the platelets were recovered in the eicosanoids [14C]thromboxane B2 (TxB2) plus 12-[14C]hydroxyeicosatetraenoic . Experimental increases and reductions of the [14C]AA-PC import were associated with comparable modifications in the [14C]TxB2 production of the platelets. Accordingly, the import of phospholipid-bound [14C]AA is a necessary prerequisite for the formation of 14C-labeled eicosanoids. In summary, the transfer of phospholipids from LDL to the platelets markedly varies within the physiological range of lipoprotein concentrations. LDL contributes to platelet eicosanoid formation by supplying platelets with phospholipid-bound AA.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23110815>Protective role of 20-OH ecdysone on lipid profile and tissue fatty  changes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p> is an associated complication of diabetes mellitus. The association of hyperglycemia with an alteration of lipid parameters presents a major risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes. The present study was designed to examine the antihyperlipidemic effect of 20-OH ecdysone on lipid profile and tissue fatty  changes in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. The levels of blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, lipoprotein lipase, lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase, 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and fatty  composition were estimated in plasma, liver and kidneys of control and experimental groups of rats. Oral administration of 20-OH ecdysone at a dose of 5mg/kg bodyweight per day to STZ-induced diabetic rats for a period of 30 days resulted in a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and elevation of high density lipoprotein, lipoprotein lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferasein comparison with diabetic untreated rats. Moreover, administration of 20-OH ecdysone to diabetic rats also decreased the concentrations of fatty acids, viz., palmitic, stearic (16:1) and oleic  (18:1), whereas linolenic (18:3) and  (20:4) were elevated. The antihyperlipidemic effect of 20-OH ecdysone was compared with glibenclamide a well-known antihyperglycemic drug. The result of the present study indicates that 20-OH ecdysone showed an antihyperlipidemic effect in addition to its antidiabetic effect in experimental diabetes.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Ly6C(hi) infiltration of monocytes remained similar in blood, spleen and bone marrow of DK mice, but was decreased in aortic lesions. To further assess the role of sEH or EETs in monocyte/macrophage infiltration in atherogenesis, we transplanted DK bone marrow into Ldlr(-/-) recipients, and then fed mice the WTD. Aortic lesions and Ly6C(hi) monocyte infiltration were reduced in mice with transplanted bone marrow of DK mice without diminishing the cholesterol level. Furthermore, sEH inhibition or gene depletion increased the ratio of EETs/DHETs and diminished the expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) in mice peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Monocyte adhesion to P-selectin and to tumor necrosis factor α-activated endothelial cells was also diminished by sEH inhibition.sEH inhibition and gene depletion attenuated atherosclerosis in mice by decreasing the infiltration of monocytes into the artery wall.

In T2DM subjects with high cholesterol (total cholesterol, 218 +/- 15 mg/dl; age, 52 +/- 5 years; BMI, 36.2 +/- 6.6 kg/m2, n = 7), EGb 761 ingestion reduced the platelet TBARS from 29 +/- 9 to 22 +/- 9 pmol/10(7) platelets (p < 0.04). Because ingestion of EGb 761 did not alter platelet counts it is concluded that EGb 761, probably due to the flavonoid fraction, reduced the TBARS by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1-mediated  oxygenation or by reducing the  pool. This is likely to lead to a reduction of platelet hyperactivity, a significant contributor to the development of cardiovascular disease in T2DM patients. Because of other reported beneficial properties of EGb 761, such as stimulation of pancreatic beta-cell function in T2DM subjects with pancreatic exhaustion, it appears that T2DM subjects might benefit from ingesting EGb 761 as a dietary supplement.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21814874>Comparative study of hypocholesterolemic and hypolipidemic effects of conjugated linolenic  isomers against induced biochemical perturbations and aberration in erythrocyte membrane fluidity.</a></h2><p>The purpose of the study was to evaluate hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic activities of conjugated linolenic  (CLnA) isomers, present in bitter gourd and snake gourd seed, in terms of amelioration of plasma lipid profile, lipoprotein oxidation and erythrocyte membrane fluidity after oral administration.Male albino rats were divided into six groups.

Clinical trials have demonstrated the strong relationship of carotid plaque vulnerability with the subsequent risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke and thromboembolic complications during CAS. Recent studies demonstrated that both low eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and low docosahexaenoic  (DHA) levels were significantly associated with lipid-rich coronary and carotid plaques, but little is known about the effect of administration of omega-3 fatty acids (O-3FAs) containing EPA and DHA before and after CAS for stabilizing carotid plaque, preventing thromboembolic complications, and suppressing ISR. In this study, the efficacy of pretreatment with and ongoing daily use of O-3FA in addition to statin treatment was evaluated in patients undergoing CAS.This study was a nonrandomized prospective trial with retrospective analysis of historical control data. From 2012 to 2015, there were 100 consecutive patients with  undergoing CAS for carotid artery stenosis who were divided into two groups. Between 2012 and 2013 (control period), 47 patients were treated with standard statin therapy. Between 2014 and 2015 (O-3FA period), patients were treated with statin therapy and add-on oral O-3FA ethyl esters containing 750 mg/d DHA and 1860 mg/d EPA from 4 weeks before CAS, followed by ongoing daily use for at least 12 months. In all patients, the plaque morphology by virtual histology intravascular ultrasound, the incidence of new ipsilateral ischemic lesions on the day after CAS, the slow-flow phenomenon during CAS, and ISR within 12 months after CAS were compared between the periods.The slow-flow phenomenon during CAS with filter-type embolic protection devices decreased in the O-3FA period (1 of 53 patients [2%]) compared with the control period (7 of 47 patients [15%]; P = .02). Furthermore, ISR for 12 months after CAS was significantly decreased in the O-3FA period (1 of 53 patients [2%]) compared with the control period (10 of 47 patients [21%]; P = .01). On virtual histology intravascular ultrasound analysis, the fibrofatty area was significantly smaller and the fibrous area was significantly greater in the O-3FA period. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a low EPA/ ratio and a symptomatic lesion were the factors related to vulnerable plaque (P = .01 [odds ratio, 5.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-16.63] and P = .01 [odds ratio, 11.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.93-46.86], respectively).Pretreatment with O-3FA reduces the slow-flow phenomenon generated by plaque vulnerability during CAS, and on-going daily use of O-3FA suppresses ISR after CAS.Copyright © 2017 Society for Vascular Surgery.

Fish oil, rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is known to reduce fasting and postprandial triglycerides and to decrease platelet and leukocyte reactivity; it may also decrease blood pressure. Additionally, omega-3 fatty acids may beneficially influence vessel wall characteristics and blood rheology. In light of the potential beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids, we conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to examine the hypothesized exposure-effect relation between maternal dietary intake of marine omega-3 fatty acids and risk of preeclampsia. We measured polyunsaturated fatty acids in erythrocytes obtained from 22 preeclamptic women and 40 normotensive women; we measured polyunsaturated fatty acids as the percentage of total fatty acids from gas chromatography. We employed logistic regression procedures to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After adjusting for confounders, women with the lowest levels of omega-3 fatty acids were 7.6 times more likely to have had their pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia as compared with those women with the highest levels of omega-3 fatty acids (95% CI = 1.4-40.6). A 15% increase in the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids was associated with a 46% reduction in risk of preeclampsia (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.41-0.72). Low erythrocyte levels of omega-3 fatty acids and high levels of some omega-6 fatty acids, particularly , appear to be associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769066>Elevation of n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio suppresses mTORC1 and prevents colorectal carcinogenesis associated with APC mutation.</a></h2><p>Although epidemiological and preclinical studies have shown the preventative effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on colorectal cancer (CRC), the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we revealed that elevation of n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio suppress the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and prevent colorectal tumorigenesis. The transgenic expression of fat-1, a desaturase that catalyzes the conversion of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs and produces n-3 PUFAs endogenously, repressed colorectal tumor cell growth and remarkably reduced tumor burden, and alleviated anemia as well as  in APCMin/+ (adenomatous polyposis coli) mice, a classic CRC model that best simulates most clinical cases. In contrast to  (AA, C20:4 n-6), either Docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6 n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5 n-3), or a combination of DHA and AA, efficiently inhibited the proliferation of CRC cell lines and promoted apoptosis in these cells. The ectopic expression of fat-1 had similar effects in colon epithelial cells with APC depletion. Mechanistically, elevation of n-3/n-6 ratio suppressed mTORC1 activity in tumors of APCMin/+ mice, CRC cell lines with APC mutation, and in normal colon epithelial cells with APC depletion. In addition, elevation of n-3/n-6 ratio repressed mTORC1 activity and inhibited adipogenic differentiation in preadipocytes with APC knockdown, as well as alleviated  in APCMin/+ mice.

Thus, we investigated whether treatment with atorvastatin would result in changes in plasma viscosity and other hemorheologic and hemostatic parameters. Twenty-two hyperlipidemic men at a university lipid clinic were treated single-blinded with atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 12 weeks to determine hemostatic-hemorheologic parameters including blood viscosity, fibrinogen levels, whole blood platelet aggregation, tissue plasminogen activator antigen, hematocrit, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, factor VII activity, red blood cell (RBC) deformity and lipid ratio, sedimentation rate, and fasting serum lipoprotein levels. Atorvastatin treatment provided significant lowering of serum lipoprotein levels: low-density lipoprotein -53% (p = 0.0001), very low density lipoprotein -43% (p = 0.0001), and triglycerides -35% (p < 0.0001).

Macrophages, which generate pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-alpha), are deeply involved in atherosclerosis, as well as mast cells which generate several cytokines, including IL-6 and IFN-gamma, and chemokines such as eotaxin, MCP-1 and RANTES involved in monocyte recruitment and differentiation in the arterial wall. In addition, mast cells participate in lipid retention and vascular cell remodeling, and are mediators of innate and adaptive immunity during atherosclerosis. Mast cells which accumulate in the human arterial intima and adventitia during atherosclerotic plaque progression, release vasoactive and angiogenic compounds, and pro-inflammatory mediators, such as  metabolites, histamine, cytokines/chemokines, platelet activating factor (PAF) and proteolytic enzymes. Mast cells can be activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia, and trigger the endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selection, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and chemokines which mediate the recruitment and adhesion of leukocytes. The participation of mast cells in atherosclerosis is still an enigma and it may be of therapeutic interest to clarify this process.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327761>Distinctive roles of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>To investigate how the saturated and unsaturated fatty  composition influences the susceptibility of developing acute pancreatitis.Primary pancreatic acinar cells were treated with low and high concentrations of different saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and changes in the cytosolic Ca(2+) signal and the expression of protein kinase C (PKC) were measured after treatment.Unsaturated fatty acids at high concentrations, including oleic , linoleic , palmitoleic , docosahexaenoic , and , induced a persistent rise in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations in acinar cells. Unsaturated fatty acids at low concentrations and saturated fatty acids, including palmitic , stearic , and triglycerides, at low and high concentrations were unable to induce a rise in Ca(2+) concentrations in acinar cells. Unsaturated fatty acids at high concentrations but not saturated fatty acids induced intra-acinar cell trypsin activation and cell damage and increased PKC expression.At sufficiently high concentrations, unsaturated fatty acids were able to induce acinar cells injury and promote the development of pancreatitis.

During late pregnancy there is an accelerated breakdown of fat depots, which plays a key role in fetal development. Besides using placental transferred fatty acids, the fetus benefits from two other products: glycerol and ketone bodies. Although glycerol crosses the placenta in small proportions, it is a preferential substrate for maternal gluconeogenesis, and maternal glucose is quantitatively the main substrate crossing the placenta. Enhanced ketogenesis under fasting conditions and the easy transfer of ketones to the fetus allow maternal ketone bodies to reach the fetus, where they can be used as fuels for oxidative metabolism as well as lipogenic substrates. Although maternal cholesterol is an important source of cholesterol for the fetus during early gestation, its importance becomes minimal during late pregnancy, owing to the high capacity of fetal tissues to synthesize cholesterol. Maternal hypertriglyceridemia is a characteristic feature during pregnancy and corresponds to an accumulation of triglycerides not only in very low-density lipoprotein but also in low- and high-density lipoprotein. Although triglycerides do not cross the placental barrier, the presence of lipoprotein receptors in the placenta, together with lipoprotein lipase, phospholipase A2, and intracellular lipase activities, allows the release to the fetus of polyunsaturated fatty acids transported as triglycerides in maternal plasma lipoproteins. Normal fetal development needs the availability of both essential fatty acids and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the nutritional status of the mother during gestation has been related to fetal growth. However, excessive intake of certain long chain fatty acids may cause both declines in  and enhanced lipid peroxidation, reducing antioxidant capacity.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23998969>A highly bioavailable omega-3 free fatty  formulation improves the cardiovascular risk profile in high-risk, statin-treated patients with residual hypertriglyceridemia (the ESPRIT trial).</a></h2><p>A novel omega-3 formulation in free fatty  form (OM3-FFA) has as much as 4-fold greater bioavailability than ethyl ester forms and reduces triglyceride (TG) levels in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of adding OM3-FFA (2 or 4 g/d) to statin therapy for lowering non-HDL-C and TG levels in subjects with persistent hypertriglyceridemia and at high risk for cardiovascular disease.In this double-blind, parallel-group study, 647 diet-stable patients with fasting TG levels ≥ 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL (treated with a maximally tolerated dose of statin or statin with ezetimibe) and at high risk for cardiovascular disease were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with capsules of control (olive oil [OO]) 4 g/d, OM3-FFA 2 g/d (plus 2 g/d OO), or OM3-FFA 4 g/d.

We examined HL-regulated GLUT4 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma gene expression in human cardiac muscle. Compared with control patients, GLUT4 protein levels were 30% lower in human cardiac muscle biopsies from patients with HL and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas GLUT4 mRNA levels were unchanged. PPARgamma mRNA levels were 30-50% lower in patients with HL and/or diabetes mellitus type 2 than in controls. Reporter studies in H9C2 cardiomyotubes showed that HL in vitro, induced by high levels of  (AA) stearic, linoleic, and oleic acids (24 h, 200 mum) repressed transcription from the GLUT4 promoter; AA also repressed transcription from the PPARgamma1 and PPARgamma2 promoters. Co-expression of PPARgamma2 repressed GLUT4 promoter activity, and the addition of AA further enhanced this effect. 5'-Deletion analysis revealed three GLUT4 promoter regions that accounted for AA-mediated effects: two repression-mediating sequences at -443/-423 bp and -222/-197 bp, the deletion of either or both of which led to a partial derepression of promoter activity, and a third derepression-mediating sequence at -612/-587 bp that was required for sustaining this derepression effect. Electromobility shift assay further shows that AA enhanced binding to two of the three regions of cardiac nuclear protein(s), the nature of which is still unknown. We propose that HL, exhibited as a high free fatty  level, modulates GLUT4 gene expression in cardiac muscle via a complex mechanism that includes: (a) binding of AA mediator proteins to three newly identified response elements on the GLUT4 promoter gene and (b) repression of GLUT4 and the PPARgamma genes by AA.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7905466>Increased concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids in milk and platelet rich plasma of grass-fed cows.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological data indicate that omega-3 fatty acids protect from cardiovascular diseases and .

CYP epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET + DHET) and CYP ω-hydroxylase-derived 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) exhibit divergent effects in the regulation of vascular tone and inflammation; thus, alterations in the functional balance between these parallel pathways in liver and kidney may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of metabolic syndrome. However, the impact of metabolic dysfunction on CYP-mediated formation of endogenous eicosanoids has not been well characterized. Therefore, we evaluated CYP epoxygenase (EET + DHET) and ω-hydroxylase (20-HETE) metabolic activity in liver and kidney in apoE(-/-) and wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet, which promoted weight gain and increased plasma insulin levels significantly. Hepatic CYP epoxygenase metabolic activity was significantly suppressed, whereas renal CYP ω-hydroxylase metabolic activity was induced significantly in high-fat diet-fed mice regardless of genotype, resulting in a significantly higher 20-HETE/EET + DHET formation rate ratio in both tissues. Treatment with enalapril, but not metformin or losartan, reversed the suppression of hepatic CYP epoxygenase metabolic activity and induction of renal CYP ω-hydroxylase metabolic activity, thereby restoring the functional balance between the pathways. Collectively, these findings suggest that the kinin-kallikrein system and angiotensin II type 2 receptor are key regulators of hepatic and renal CYP-mediated eicosanoid metabolism in the presence of metabolic syndrome.

Treatment did not significantly affect the concentration of LDL with apoCIII, a subspecies highly associated with CVD risk. OM3-CA increased selectively the concentration of LDL that does not contain apoCIII, a subspecies with a weak relation to coronary heart disease. The reduction in apoCIII was associated with plasma increases in eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic , and  and decreases in linoleic, palmitic, and oleic acids.Reduction in apoCIII may be a mechanism for the TG-lowering effects of OM3-CA.

This study also determined contributors to altered AA-induced dilation between dyslipidemic mice and controls, C57/Bl/6J (C57).Gracilis muscle arterioles were isolated, with mechanical responses assessed following a challenge with AA under control conditions and after elements of AA metabolism pathways were inhibited. Conduit arteries from each strain were used to assess AA-induced production of PGI(2) and TxA(2).Arterioles from ApoE and LDLR exhibited a blunted dilation to AA versus C57.

AA-induced generation of PGI(2) was comparable across strains, although TxA(2) generation was increased in ApoE and LDLR. Arteriolar reactivity to PGI(2) and TxA(2) was comparable across strains. Treatment with TEMPOL improved dilation and reduced TxA(2) production with AA in ApoE and LDLR.These results suggest that AA-induced arteriolar dilation is constrained in ApoE and LDLR via an increased production of TxA(2).

An elevated intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) has also been associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk. However, until now only little is known about the effect of apheresis treatment on the levels of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA) in patients. Using gas chromatography (GC) the present study analyzed the content of n-6 and n-3 PUFA as well as saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids in the plasma of 20 patients with  undergoing regular lipoprotein apheresis procedures in direct pre- and post-therapy measurements. Lipoprotein apheresis uniformly reduced the concentrations of  (AA), EPA and DHA fatty acids analyzed in the plasma. However, the three different apheresis methods analyzed (heparin precipitation, membrane filtration and direct absorption) had different effects on the fatty  profile in the plasma. We found that heparin precipitation and direct absorption apheresis procedures led to a significant decrease of plasma n-3 and n-6 PUFA by 40-50%. In contrast, patients undergoing membrane filtration apheresis, levels pre- and post-apheresis did not change significantly, with AA and EPA being only reduced by approximately 10% while levels of DHA were maintained pre- and post-apheresis. In contrast, total triglyceride levels were lowered most potently by membrane filtration apheresis. In summary, heparin precipitation and direct absorption apheresis approaches significantly lowered polyunsaturated fatty acids in plasma, while membrane filtration did not.

Under-representation of arachidonate-containing GPC and GPE species in some fa/fa rat tissues at 6 wk could contribute to insulin resistance, but depletion of islet arachidonate-containing GPC and GPE species is unlikely to explain the evolution of the insulin secretory defect that is well-developed by 12 wk of age.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15168866>Effects of dietary extra virgin olive oil on serum lipid resistance to oxidation and fatty  composition in elderly lipidemic patients.</a></h2><p>An inverse relation between high consumption of olive oil and low incidence of coronary heart disease among the people living in Mediterranean countries has been proposed. It has been shown, that an oleic -rich diet could increase the resistance of human LDL to in vitro oxidation which is postulated to play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of extra virgin olive oil consumptiom on the resistance of serum lipids to in vitro oxidation and on fatty  composition in the serum of elderly lipidemic patients. A total of 26 patients (mean age 69 years) with combined  consumed daily 2 table spoons (approx. 20 g) of extra virgin olive oil for 6 weeks. Plasma lipids, total antioxidant capacity, indices of serum lipid oxidizability (lag time and maximal rate of oxidation) and the content of fatty acids in serum phospholipids were determined before and after dietary supplementation with olive oil. Plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decreased significantly after 6 weeks of dietary intervention. A significant increase in the lag time of conjugated diene formation (p = 0.026) and the decrease in the rate of lipid oxidation (p = 0.030) were observed after olive oil consumption. The changes in the fatty  profile were characterized by an increase in oleic  content (p = 0.005) as well as by a decline in the content of linoleic  (p = 0.020) and  (p = 0.022). Linear regression analysis revealed some interesting and significant correlations between indices of serum lipid resistance to oxidation and individual fatty acids, suggesting a protective effects of olive oil in lipoprotein oxidation. In conclusion, the daily consumption of extra virgin olive oil in elderly lipidemic patients favourably affected serum lipoprotein spectrum and fatty  composition that probably contributed to the increased resistance of serum lipids to oxidation.

During synthesis of these eicosanoids, oxyradicals are produced. Oxyradicals have been implicated in the development of hypercholes-terolemic atherosclerosis. Aspirin, an inhibitor of synthesis of prostaglandins, would prevent the generation of oxyradicals and hence would prevent the development of atherosclerosis. The purpose of the investigation was to determine if aspirin attenuates the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis, and if this attenuation is associated with a decrease in the oxidative stress.Three groups of rabbits were used for this study: Group I, control; Group II, 0.5% cholesterol; Group III, 0.5% cholesterol plus 0.068% aspirin. Blood samples were collected before and after 1 and 2 months of experimental diets for measurement of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum malondialdehyde, and white blood cell chemiluminescence, a measure of oxyradicals produced by white blood cells. Aortas were removed at the end of the protocol for the measurement of atherosclerotic plaques, malondialdehyde and aortic chemiluminescence, a measure of antioxidant reserve. Serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased to a similar extent in Groups II and III compared to Group I. Serum triglycerides increased in both Groups II and III; however, the increase was greater in Group III than in Group II. Levels of serum and aortic malondialdehyde, and white blood cell-chemiluminescence were higher in Group II compared to Group I. Aspirin decreased the levels of these parameters. Antioxidant reserve increased in both Groups II and III, the increase being greater in the latter than the former. White blood cell-chemiluminescence increased in Group II compared to Group I, but remained unaltered in Group III compared to Group I. Aspirin treatment reduced the development of atherosclerosis by approximately 47%.These results suggest that aspirin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, reduced the development of hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis, and this effect was associated with a decrease in the oxidative stress.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19244367>Metabolic syndrome and serum fatty  patterns in serum phospholipids in hypertriglyceridemic persons with human immunodeficiency virus.</a></h2><p>HIV infection and its treatment are associated with abnormal lipid profiles.

Spectroscopic measurements combined with fluorescence microscopy and/or histochemical staining gave complex chemical information about LD composition and enabled detailed investigations of the changes occurring in various pathological states. Lipid analysis in fatty liver tissue was performed using a dietary mouse model of liver steatosis, induced by a high fat diet (HFD). HFD is characterized by a high percentage of calories from saturated fat (60%) and reflects closely the detrimental effects of dietary habits responsible for increased morbidity due to obesity and its complications in well-developed Western societies. Such diets lead to obesity, , insulin resistance, and steatosis that may also be linked to endothelial dysfunction. In the present work, Raman spectroscopy was applied to characterized chemical composition of lipid droplets in hepatocytes from mice fed HFD and in the endothelium treated with exogenous unsaturated free fatty  (). The results demonstrate the usefulness of Raman spectroscopy to characterize intracellular lipid distribution in 2D and 3D images and can be used to determine the degree of saturation.

Placental lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is involved in the initial step in transplacental fatty  transport as it hydrolyzes maternal triglycerides (TG) to release free fatty acids (FFA). We investigated LPL activity and protein (Western blot) and mRNA expression (real-time RT-PCR) in the placenta of an LPL-deficient mother with marked hypertriglyceridemia. The LPL activity was fourfold lower, LPL protein expression 50% lower, and mRNA expression threefold higher than that of normal, healthy placentas at term (n = 4-7). To further investigate the role of maternal lipids in placental LPL regulation, we isolated placental cytotrophoblasts from term placentas and studied LPL activity and protein and mRNA expression after incubation in Intralipid (as a source of TG) and oleic, linoleic, and a combination of oleic, linoleic, and  acids as well as insulin. Intralipid (40 and 400 mg/dl) decreased LPL activity by approximately 30% (n = 10-14, P < 0.05) and 400 microM linoleic and linoleic-oleic- (n = 10) decreased LPL activity by 37 and 34%, respectively. No major changes were observed in LPL protein or mRNA expression. We found no effect of insulin on LPL activity or protein expression in the cultured trophoblasts.

Platelet non-responsiveness to aspirin is associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Several environmental and hereditary factors are reportedly involved in sub-optimal acetylsalicylic  response. Forty-five coronary artery disease patients and 45 non-coronary artery disease controls received acetylsalicylic  at a daily dose of 75-150 mg. Controls were examined twice: on the day of entering the study and 10 days later. Urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 was assessed as the marker of platelet thromboxane generation. Aggregation was studied in platelet-rich plasma using turbidimetric aggregometry with collagen and . Fifty to seventy percent of coronary artery disease patients showed an extent of collagen-induced aggregation above the upper quartile of the reference range compared with 8-15% in controls (P<0.003). For -activated aggregation these proportions were 45-50% in coronary artery disease versus 7% in controls (P<0.007). In coronary artery disease patients, the acetylsalicylic -mediated platelet inhibition positively correlated with increased triglycerides (in -stimulated platelets, r=0.30, P=0.0018), total cholesterol (r=0.33, P<0.0001 in coll and -activated platelets) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (r=0.27, P=0.0024). In coronary artery disease patients urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 concentrations were significantly increased compared to controls after 10 day acetylsalicylic  intake (563; 313-728 pg/mg creatinine versus 321; 246-488 pg/mg creatinine, P=0.04). The incidence of suboptimal acetylsalicylic  response incidence was more common in patients with coronary artery disease.

Increased consumption of energy-dense diets by pregnant women and lactating mothers suppresses the activities of Delta-6 and Delta-5 desaturases not only in maternal tissues but also in fetal liver and the placenta, resulting in decreased plasma and tissue concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids omega-6  (AA), omega-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). EPA, DHA, and AA have negative feedback control on tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 synthesis. Hence, EPA, DHA, and AA deficiencies induced by an energy-dense diet increase generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, markers of inflammation that in turn decrease production of endothelial nitric oxide and adiponectin to induce insulin resistance in maternal and fetal tissues. Increased concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 enhance expression and activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme, which produces abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, , hyperphagia, and hyperleptinemia, characteristic features of metabolic syndrome X. Continued consumption of an energy-dense diet in childhood aggravates these molecular events.

It was, however, not dependent upon either antiplatelet action or plasma lipid-lowering activity of atorvastatin. In addition, in about 50% of patients, we noticed that ASA (50 μM) significantly and time-dependently diminished thromboxane B(2) concentration in atorvastatin-treated patients. The ASA-induced acetylation of platelet proteins significantly increased in the course of atorvastatin therapy and was associated with reduced platelet cholesterol (R(S)=-0.598, P<0.0001).

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 biosynthetic pathways are responsible for prostaglandin and thromboxane formation. Experimental investigations in animal models using 12/15-LO deficient mice, 12/15-LO or 15-LO transgenic mice, or pharmacological 15-LO inhibition have all demonstrated the essential role of 12/15-LO in atherogenesis. The underlying mechanisms are linked to low-density lipoprotein oxidation, pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine production and enhanced monocyte-endothelial cell interaction. Human genetic studies as well as disruption of the 5-LO gene in mouse models of  revealed that 5-LO and 5-LO-activating protein are associated with risks of human cardiovascular disease, and that this cascade plays an important role in aortic aneurysm pathogenesis through leukotriene-mediated inflammatory chemokine production. COX-1 plays an active role in atherogenesis via thromboxane A(2), while COX-2-derived prostaglandin (PGI(2)) protects against atherosclerosis in murine models. Recent data demonstrated that selective inhibition of COX-2 augments the risk of cardiovascular events in patients. Selective inhibition or blockade of selective components in these two enzymatic pathways through systemic drug delivery or medical device approaches (e.g., drug-eluting stents) may have therapeutic benefit against certain cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30621707>Plasma lipidomic signatures of spontaneous obese rhesus monkeys.</a></h2><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to metabolic diseases are still less understandable.Previously, we screened a group of spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys. Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of fatty acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C20:4), FFA especially palmitic  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys. Conversely, the levels of most PE species were obviously reduced in the obese monkeys.Collectively, our work suggests that lipids such as FFA C16:0 and 16:0-LPA may be potential candidates for the diagnosis and study of obesity-related diseases.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12222745>Changes in plasma lipid composition induced by coconut oil.

Using apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene deletion male mouse models of hypercholesterolemia at 20 wk of age, we tested the hypothesis that arteriolar dilation would be maintained due to an increased stimulus-induced production of dilator metabolites via cyclooxygenase and cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase pathways. Arterioles from both strains demonstrated mild reductions in dilation to hypoxia and acetylcholine versus responses in C57/Bl/6J (C57) controls. However, although inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) attenuated dilation in arterioles from C57 controls, this effect was absent in ApoE or LDLR strains. In contrast, cyclooxygenase-dependent portions of dilator reactivity were maintained across the three strains. Notably, although combined NOS and cyclooxygenase inhibition abolished arteriolar responses to hypoxia and acetylcholine in C57 controls, significant reactivity remained in ApoE and LDLR strains. Whereas inhibition of cytochrome P-450 omega-hydroxylase and epoxygenases had no effect on this residual reactivity in ApoE and LDLR strains, inhibition of 12/15-lipoxygenase with nordihydroguaiaretic  abolished the residual reactivity. With both hypoxic and methacholine challenges, arteries from ApoE and LDLR strains demonstrated an increased production of both 12(S)- and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic , end products of  metabolism via 12/15-lipoxygenase, a response that was not present in C57 controls. These results suggest that with development of hypercholesterolemia, mechanisms contributing to dilator reactivity in skeletal muscle arterioles are modified such that net reactivity to endothelium-dependent stimuli is largely intact.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411718>Modulation of blood oxylipin levels by long-chain omega-3 fatty  supplementation in hyper- and normolipidemic men.</a></h2><p>Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) such as EPA and DHA have been shown to possess beneficial health effects, and it is believed that many of their effects are mediated by their oxygenated products (oxylipins). Recently, we have shown that serum levels of several hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FAs are dependent on the individual status of the parent FAs in a cohort of normo- and hyperlipidemic subjects. So far, the effect of an increased dietary LC n-3 PUFA intake on hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FA levels has not been investigated in subjects with mild combined .In the present study, we compared oxylipin patterns of 10 hyperlipidemic (cholesterol >200mg/dl; triglyceride >150mg/ml) and 10 normolipidemic men in response to twelve weeks of LC n-3 PUFA intake (1.14g DHA and 1.56g EPA). Levels of 44 free hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FAs were analyzed in serum by LC-MS. Additionally, oxylipin levels were compared with their parent PUFA levels in erythrocyte membranes; a biomarker for the individual PUFA status.Differences in the oxylipin pattern between normo- and hyperlipidemic subjects were minor before and after treatment. In all subjects, levels of EPA-derived oxylipins (170-4800pM) were considerably elevated after LC n-3 PUFA intake (150-1400%), the increase of DHA-derived oxylipins (360-3900pM) was less pronounced (30-130%). The relative change of EPA in erythrocyte membranes is strongly correlated (r≥0.5; p<0.05) with the relative change of corresponding epoxy and dihydroxy FA serum levels. The effect on  (AA)-derived oxylipin levels (140-27,100pM) was inconsistent.The dietary LC PUFA composition has a direct influence on the endogenous oxylipin profile, including several highly biological active EPA- and DHA-derived lipid mediators. The shift in oxylipin pattern appears to be dependent on the initial LC PUFA status particularly for EPA. The finding that also levels of other oxylipins derived from ALA, LA or AA are modified by LC n-3 PUFA intake might suggest that at least some of the effects of EPA and DHA could be mediated by a shift in the entire oxylipin profile.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effects of 6-month EPA treatment on postprandial hyperglycemia and , insulin secretion, and concomitant endothelial dysfunction remain unknown in patients with impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and coronary artery disease (CAD).We randomized 107 newly diagnosed IGM patients with CAD to receive either 1800 mg/day of EPA (EPA group, n = 53) or no EPA (n = 54). Cookie meal testing (carbohydrates: 75 g, fat: 28.5 g) and endothelial function testing using fasting-state flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) were performed before and after 6 months of treatment. The primary outcome of this study was changes in postprandial glycemic and triglyceridemic control and secondary outcomes were improvement of insulin secretion and endothelial dysfunction. After 6 months, the EPA group exhibited significant improvements in EPA/, fasting triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The EPA group also exhibited significant decreases in the incremental TG peak, area under the curve (AUC) for postprandial TG, incremental glucose peak, AUC for postprandial glucose, and improvements in glycometabolism categorization. No significant changes were observed for hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose levels. The EPA group exhibited a significant increase in AUC-immune reactive insulin/AUC-plasma glucose ratio (which indicates postprandial insulin secretory ability) and significant improvements in FMD. Multiple regression analysis revealed that decreases in the TG/HDL-C ratio and incremental TG peak were independent predictors of FMD improvement in the EPA group.EPA corrected postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and insulin secretion ability.

Platelets produce reactive oxidant species (ROS) upon stimulation with agonist, but it is uncertain whether they are able to oxidatively modify LDL. Human platelets taken from healthy subjects were incubated with LDL, then stimulated with collagen. Compared with unstimulated platelets, collagen-stimulated platelets induced LDL modification as shown by enhanced conjugated dienes and lysophosphatidylcholine formation, electrophoretic mobility, Apo B-100 degradation, and monocyte LDL uptake. Activated platelets also induced a marked reduction of vitamin E contained in LDL. A significant inhibition of LDL oxidation was observed in platelets treated with arachidonyl trifluomethyl ketone (AACOCF3), an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. The experiments reported above were also conducted in patients with hereditary deficiency of gp91phox, the central core of NADPH oxidase, and in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Platelets from gp91 phox-deficient patients produced a small amount of ROS and weakly modified LDL. Conversely, platelets from hypercholesterolemic patients showed enhanced ROS formation and oxidized LDL more than platelets from healthy subjects. This study provides evidence that platelets modify LDL via NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress, a phenomenon that could be dependent on  activation. This finding suggests a role for platelets in favoring LDL accumulation within atherosclerotic plaque.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22611002>/docosahexaenoic -supplemented diet in early life reduces body weight gain, plasma lipids, and adiposity in later life in ApoE*3Leiden mice.</a></h2><p>This study addresses whether early life  (ARA)/docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA)/DHA (Omacor) supplementation affects body weight gain, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue quantity and quality in later life in ApoE*3Leiden-transgenic mice, a humanized model for  and mild obesity.Four-week-old male ApoE*3Leiden mice were fed chow diet with or without a mixture of ARA (0.129 wt%) and DHA (0.088 wt%) or Omacor (0.30 wt% EPA, 0.25 wt% DHA). At age 12 weeks, mice were fed high-fat/high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet without above supplements until age 20 weeks. Control mice received chow diet throughout the study. Mice receiving ARA/DHA gained less body weight compared to control and this effect was sustained when fed HFHC. Omacor had no significant effect on body weight gain. Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly lowered by both supplementations. At 20 weeks, epididymal fat mass was less in ARA/DHA-supplemented mice, while Omacor had no significant effect on fat mass. Both ARA/DHA and Omacor reduced inguinal adipocyte cell size; only ARA/DHA significantly reduced epididymal macrophage infiltration.This study shows that early life ARA/DHA, but not Omacor supplementation improves body weight gain later in life.

This prospective study included 31 patients with biopsy-proven NASH with . Body mass index, serum lipids, liver function tests, fibrosis markers, and adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were measured periodically during an open-label study of atorvastatin (10 mg daily) for 24 months. Standard weight-loss counseling was continued during the treatment period. Oral glucose tolerance test and liver density assessed by computerized tomography were performed before and after treatment. Follow-up liver biopsy was performed in 17 patients. All 31 patients had high cholesterol levels at baseline, and 20 also presented high triglyceride levels. The body mass index and serum glucose levels did not change during the treatment. After treatment, 23 patients (74.2%) presented normal transaminase levels. Adiponectin levels were significantly increased, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly decreased. However, leptin levels were not changed significantly. The concentration of long-chain fatty acids was decreased; and significant decreases were observed in C18:2,n-6 (linoleic , -21%) and C20:4,n-6 (, -22%). Liver steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score were significantly improved, whereas 4 patients had increased fibrosis stage. The NASH-related metabolic parameters improved with therapy, including fibrosis in some patients. However, 4 of 17 patients had progression of fibrosis over the 2-year period, with 3 of them progressing to stage 3.

In this study, we utilized hamsters fed a normal chow diet, a high-fat diet or a high cholesterol and high fat diet (HCHFD) as animal models to explore novel transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for ACSL4 expression under hyperlipidemic conditions. Through cloning hamster ACSL4 homolog and tissue profiling ACSL4 mRNA and protein expressions we observed a selective upregulation of ACSL4 in testis and liver of HCHFD fed animals. Examination of transcriptional activators of the ACSL family revealed an increased hepatic expression of PPARδ but not PPARα in HCHFD fed hamsters. To explore a role of PPARδ in dietary cholesterol-mediated upregulation of ACSL4, we administered a PPARδ specific agonist L165041 to normolipidemic and dyslipidemic hamsters. We observed significant increases of hepatic ACSL4 mRNA and protein levels in all L165041-treated hamsters as compared to control animals. The induction of ACSL4 expression by L165041 in liver tissue in vivo was recapitulated in human primary hepatocytes and hepatocytes isolated from hamster and mouse. Moreover, employing the approach of adenovirus-mediated gene knockdown, we showed that depletion of PPARδ in hamster hepatocytes specifically reduced ACSL4 expression. Finally, utilizing HepG2 as a model system, we demonstrate that PPARδ activation leads to increased ACSL4 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression, and consequently higher arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity. Taken together, we have discovered a novel PPARδ-mediated regulatory mechanism for ACSL4 expression in liver tissue and cultured hepatic cells.Copyright © 2015.

Blood was collected for analysis of plasma fatty acids, and the heart and left kidney were removed from the rat. In experiment 1, the heart was perfused on a Langendorff apparatus. After evaluation of the cardiac function of each rat, the heart was stored in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution for 8 hr at 4 degrees C. The heart was reperfused and the recovery of cardiac function was evaluated. The coronary perfusate during reperfusion was collected to measure 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha and thromboxane B2. Coronary flow (CF) perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) solution containing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and nitroglycerin were evaluated in the Langendorff mode with atrial pacing (330 beats/min). In experiment 2, the excised left kidney was immediately flushed and preserved with University of Wisconsin solution for 8 hr at 4 degrees C.

The plasma and cardiac ratios of EPA to  were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 than in groups 1 and 2. There were no significant differences in basal cardiac function among any of the diet-fed rats. The percentage values of the recovery of aortic flow, cardiac output (CO), and left ventricular max dp/dt in group 3 and CO in group 4 were significantly higher than in group 2. In addition, the recovery of CF in group 3 tended to be higher than in group 2 (P=0.07). The percentage values of the recovery of aortic flow, CF, CO, and left ventricular max dp/dt in group 1 were significantly lower than in the other dietary groups. CF reperfused with KHB solution containing 5-HT was significantly higher in group 3 than in groups 1 and 2. CF reperfused with KHB solution containing 5-HT was significantly higher in group 4 than in group 1. CF reperfused with KHB solution containing nitroglycerin in group 3 tended to be higher than in groups 1 and 2 (P=0.07). The thromboxame B2 concentrations in the coronary perfusate during reperfusion in groups 3 and 4 were significantly lower than in groups 1 and 2.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of fatty acids and hyperglycemia on human retinal vascular endothelial (hRVE) cells as a means of mimicking diabetic metabolic disorders.The expression of adhesion molecules in hRVE and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was assayed by Western blot analysis and confirmed by leukocyte adhesion assay. The mechanisms underlying the induction of adhesion molecules by fatty acids were further investigated by using cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and P450 monooxygenase (MOX) inhibitors.Treatment of hRVE cells with the n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 18:2n6 and 20:4n6 for up to 24 hours resulted in a significant induction of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 protein levels. In contrast, treatment with high glucose (22 mM) for 24 hours did not affect CAM expression. Induction of CAM by n6 PUFA correlated with enhanced leukocyte binding to hRVE cells. The effect of n6 PUFA on ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was blocked by an inhibitor of LOX, but not by COX or MOX inhibitors. In contrast to hRVE cells, n6 PUFA did not induce ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 in HUVECs.The data obtained in this study demonstrate that acute exposure to linoleic or , but not hyperglycemia, induces inflammatory adhesion molecule expression in the presence of LOX in microvascular hRVE cells, but not in HUVECs.

This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study investigated the effects of titrated doses of D-003 (5-20 mg/d) on platelet aggregation in hypercholesterolemic patients. After a 4-week baseline phase, 56 patients were randomised to D-003 5 mg/d or placebo. The doses were doubled every 15 days if  (AA)-induced platelet aggregation was not inhibited at least by 15%. AA (0.75 and 1.5 mmol/L) and collagen (1 microg/mL)-induced platelet aggregation, laboratory and physical safety indicators were assessed at baseline and every 15 days thereafter, when adverse events (AE) were also reported.

Aortic contractions to norepinephrine were investigated in rabbits fed either standard chow or chow containing 2% cholesterol. In normal rabbits, norepinephrine (10(-6) M) elicited a 126 +/- 2% contraction compared with a 95 +/- 2% contraction in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The factor mediating the depressed response was endothelium-dependent because removal of the endothelium blocked the decrease in norepinephrine-induced contractions observed in the cholesterol-fed rabbits. The endothelium-derived factor was not nitric oxide, because blockade of nitric oxide synthase with nitro-L-arginine did not abolish the decreased response in the cholesterol-fed rabbits. Pretreatment of aortas with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10(-5) M) caused a slight decrease in the norepinephrine-induced contractions, suggesting that the factor could be a vasoconstrictor cyclooxygenase metabolite or a vasodilatory lipoxygenase or cytochrome P450 epoxygenase metabolite. Pretreatment with the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2-receptor antagonist, SQ 29458, had no effect on norepinephrine-induced contractions. Whereas the lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic  (5 x 10(-5) M), caused a slight increase in the contractions to norepinephrine in cholesterol-fed rabbits compared with normal rabbits, the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase inhibitor, metyrapone (10(-4) M), produced a greater enhancement of norepinephrine-induced contractions in cholesterol-fed rabbits but had no effect on responses in the normal rabbits. Characterization of [3H] metabolism in cholesterol-fed aortic tissue indicated that norepinephrine stimulated the synthesis of both lipoxygenase and epoxygenase metabolites in an endothelium-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that (a) an endothelium-derived metabolite of  regulates vascular tone, (b) this metabolite appears to be a lipoxygenase or cytochrome P450 product or both, and (c) the activity or synthesis of the factor is enhanced by hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9268230>Effects of hypercholesterolemia on the contractions to angiotensin II in the isolated aorta and iliac artery of the rabbit: role of  metabolites.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the angiotensin II-induced contractions in the isolated aorta and iliac artery of the rabbit, with respect to the role of arachidonate metabolites. Furthermore, the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril was studied on the responses to angiotensin II in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. After 12 weeks of cholesterol diet (0.3%), endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were significantly fewer compared with control (30.2 +/- 5.9% vs. 73.0 +/- 1.7%) in the aorta but not in the iliac artery of the rabbit. The angiotensin II- and methoxamine-induced contractions were also significantly lower compared with control in the aorta (101.4 +/- 6.7% vs. 60.9 +/- 4.2% and 160.2 +/- 5.7% vs. 135.8 +/- 8.0%, respectively) but not in the iliac artery. The lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic  (NDGA) selectively attenuated the angiotensin II-induced contractions in rabbit aortic rings from the control group only in the presence of the endothelium, whereas it had no effect on the responses to angiotensin II in the cholesterol group (with or without endothelium). In the iliac artery, NDGA inhibited the responses to angiotensin II in both the control and cholesterol groups. Treatment with ramipril (0.33 mg/kg/day) significantly improved the maximal angiotensin II-induced contraction in the aorta of rabbits fed a cholesterol diet for 16 weeks to 61.0 +/- 7.3% (vs. 32.7 +/- 9.0% in the cholesterol group). We conclude that hypercholesterolemia leads to a reduction of angiotensin II-induced contractions in the aorta and not in the iliac artery of the rabbit. This reduction might be related to loss of endothelium-dependent lipoxygenase products and is partially reversed by ramipril.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8848433>Influence of hypercholesterolaemia on the reactivity of isolated rabbit arteries to 15-lipoxygenase metabolites of : comparison with platelet-derived agents and vasodilators.</a></h2><p>The lipoxygenase product 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (15-HETE) was shown to be the most important eicosanoid formed in the atherosclerotic rabbit aorta. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of 15-HETE and its hydroperoxy precursor 15-HpETE with those of other vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents in arteries from rabbits fed either a control or a cholesterol-rich diet for 16 and 30 weeks. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) aggregated platelets and thrombin caused contractions of isolated rabbit aortas. The contractile responses elicited by platelets from control animals were similar to those evoked by platelets from atherosclerotic rabbits. After 16 weeks of hypercholesterolemia, the contractile responses were either augmented (5-HT), unchanged (platelets) or reduced (thrombin). After 30 weeks of hypercholesterolemia, the responses to all contractile agents used had decreased. In both aortas and pulmonary arteries the endothelium-dependent relaxations to the calcium ionophore, A23167, and to acetylcholine were progressively lost and the endothelium-independent relaxations to nitroglycerin were reduced by the progressing hypercholesterolemia. The 15-lipoxygenase metabolites contracted the isolated thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery from control rabbits and to a lesser extent those of the cholesterol-fed rabbits. After raising the tone in these vessels with prostaglandin F2 alpha PGF2 alpha) or noradrenaline, 15-HpETE induced relaxations which were not significantly influenced by the development of fatty streaks. Our data illustrate that the contractions of the blood vessel wall to 15-HETE, like those to other vasoconstrictors, are markedly reduced by developing atherosclerosis. In contrast, the relaxations to 15-HpETE in the rabbit arteries remain unaltered after 16 to 30 weeks of hypercholesterolemia. This is unlike the reactions to other vasodilators, which are markedly reduced.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9180250> of platelet phospholipids is decreased after extracorporeal removal of plasma low density lipoproteins in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Platelet phospholipid composition was analyzed before and after extracorporeal removal of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by LDL apheresis in six patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Elevated levels of total plasma cholesterol and the portion of plasma cholesterol carried by LDL were reduced by 56 and 66% after LDL apheresis. Platelet cholesterol contents remained unaffected. While the phosphatidylcholine (PC):sphingomyelin (SM) ratio in plasma lipoproteins was increased by 22% following apheresis, the same parameter was lowered by 14% in platelets. LDL apheresis induced decreases in the percentages of distinct molecular species containing  in platelet diacyl subgroups of PC, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) as well as in alkenylacyl (plasmalogen) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Directly after apheresis, the percentages of molecular species with  of diacyl PC, diacyl PI and alkenylacyl PE were reduced by 20, 23 and 8%, respectively. Two days after the procedure, total  of diacyl PC, diacyl PS and alkenylacyl PE was lowered by 11, 20 and 8%. Overall, the amount of phospholipid bound  was reduced by 16% after apheresis (from 79.1 to 66.4 nmol/10(8) platelets). The results are thus in agreement with previous data indicating decreased phospholipid bound  in red blood cells after apheresis (Engelman B. Bräutigam C, Kulschar R et al.

The percentage change in the TXA2 metabolite was positively related to the magnitude of change induced by apheresis in phospholipid bound .

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the acute and short-term effects of walnut intake on changes in microvascular function and the relationship of these effects to plasma epoxides, the cytochrome-P450-derived metabolites of fatty acids. Thirty-eight hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women were randomized to 4 weeks of 5 g or 40 g of daily walnut intake. All outcomes were measured after an overnight fast and 4 h after walnut intake. Microvascular function, assessed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), was the primary outcome measure, with serum lipids and plasma epoxides as secondary measures. Compared to 5 g of daily walnut intake, consuming 40 g/d of walnuts for 4 weeks increased the RHI and Framingham RHI. Total cholesterol and low- and high-density cholesterol did not significantly change after walnut intake. The change in RHI after 4 weeks of walnut intake was associated with the change in the sum of plasma epoxides (r=0.65, P=.002) but not with the change in the sum of plasma hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Of the individual plasma epoxides, -derived 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic  was most strongly associated with the change in microvascular function (r=0.72, P<.001). These data support the concept that the intake of walnut-derived fatty acids can favorably affect plasma epoxide production, resulting in improved microvascular function.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of modest amounts of fructose and saturated fatty acids on oxidative stress are unknown.To increase knowledge on this question, 10-wk-old spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar rats were fed for 8 wk with a control diet or an experimental diet enriched with fructose (18%) and saturated fatty acids (11%; FS diet). The total antioxidant status of organs and red blood cells was assayed by monitoring the rate of free radical-induced red blood cell hemolysis.

Antioxidant enzymes and vitamins were also measured to establish the oxidative stress effect.The FS diet did not affect blood pressure in either strain, but it increased plasma insulin concentrations only in Wistar rats without affecting those of glucose of either strain. The FS diet significantly enhanced plasma and VLDL-LDL triacylglycerol concentrations without affecting concentrations of VLDL-LDL thiobarbituric -reactive substances. The decreased content of  and total polyunsaturated fatty acids in VLDL-LDL by the FS diet may have prevented lipid peroxidation in this fraction. Moreover, FS consumption by both strains was accompanied by a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity of adipose tissue, muscle, heart, and liver. This may have resulted from increased tissue ascorbic  levels and glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities in tissues.These findings clearly indicate that the FS diet did not alter blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar rats.

We previously reported that LPL-deficient mice have learning and memory impairment and fewer synaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons, but properties of synaptic activity in LPL-deficient neurons remain unexplored. In this study, we found reduced frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and readily releasable pool (RRP) size in LPL-deficient neurons, which led to presynaptic dysfunction and plasticity impairment without altering postsynaptic activity. We demonstrated that synaptic vesicle recycling, which is known to play an important role in maintaining the RRP size in active synapses, is impaired in LPL-deficient neurons. Moreover, lipid assay revealed deficient docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (AA) in the hippocampus of LPL-deficient mice; exogenous DHA or AA supplement partially restored synaptic vesicle recycling capability. These results suggest that impaired synaptic vesicle recycling results from deficient DHA and AA and contributes to the presynaptic dysfunction and plasticity impairment in LPL-deficient neurons.Copyright © 2014 IBRO.

These modifications of platelet function may play an important role in the occurrence of premature atherosclerosis. One approach to the prevention of the thromboembolic complications of atherosclerosis is the use of antiplatelet agents which depress platelet function. Ridogrel, a combined thromboxane synthase inhibitor and thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor blocker inhibits platelet aggregation. This study was designed to investigate the in vitro effect of ridogrel on platelet function in normocholesterolaemic and familial hypercholesterolaemia type IIa subjects.

Focusing on n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs), a subgroup analysis assessed differential association across potential effect modifiers implicated in oxidative stress and increased risk of neurodegenerative disease.In the 2251 study subjects, the risk of global cognitive decline increased with elevated palmitic  in both fractions and with high  and low linoleic  in cholesteryl esters. Higher n-3 HUFAs reduced the risk of decline in verbal fluency, particularly in hypertensive and dyslipidemic subjects. No significant findings were shown for psychomotor speed or delayed word recall.Promoting higher intakes of n-3 HUFAs in the diet of hypertensive and dyslipidemic persons may have substantial benefits in reducing their risk of cognitive decline in the area of verbal fluency. However, clinical trials are needed to confirm this finding.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10356659>Joint effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and eicosapentaenoic acids on serum lipid profile and plasma fatty  concentrations in patients with .</a></h2><p>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce serum total cholesterol concentrations and the risk of coronary heart disease in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

Fatty liver damage caused by high-fat diets is associated with the generation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). A decrease in the levels of  (AA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and the usefulness of EPA and DHA both in the prevention and management of NAFLD has been reported. AA, EPA and DHA and their anti-inflammatory products lipoxins (LXs), resolvins and protectins suppress IL-6 and TNF-α and PGE(2) production. These results suggest that the activities of Δ(6) and Δ(5) desaturases are reduced in NAFLD and hence, the dietary essential fatty acids, linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) are not metabolized to their long-chain products AA, EPA and DHA, the precursors of anti-inflammatory molecules, LXs, resolvins and protectins that could pre vent NAFLD. This suggests that an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids contribute to NAFLD. Hence, it is proposed that plasma and tissue levels of AA, EPA, DHA and LXs, resolvins and protectins could be used as predictors and prognostic biomarkers of NAFLD. It is suggested that the synthesis and use of more stable analogues of LXs, resolvins and protectins need to be explored in the prevention and management of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9409316>In vivo formation of 8-Epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha is increased in hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>F2-isoprostanes are bioactive prostaglandin (PG)-like compounds that are produced from  through a nonenzymatic process of lipid peroxidation catalyzed by oxygen free-radicals. 8-Epi-PGF2 alpha may amplify the platelet response to agonists, circulates in plasma, and is excreted in urine. We examined the hypothesis that the formation of 8-epi-PGF2 alpha is altered in patients with hypercholesterolemia and contributes to platelet activation in this setting. Urine samples were obtained from 40 hypercholesterolemic patients and 40 age- and sex-matched control subjects for measurement of immunoreactive 8-epi-PGF2 alpha. Urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-thromboxane (TX) B2, a major metabolite of TXA2, was measured as an in vivo index of platelet activation. Low-dose aspirin, indobufen, and vitamin E were used to investigate the mechanism of formation and effects of 8-epi-PGF2 alpha on platelet activation. Urinary 8-epi-PGF2 alpha was significantly (P = .0001) higher in hypercholesterolemic patients than in control subjects: 473 +/- 305 versus 205 +/- 95 pg/mg creatinine. Its rate of excretion was inversely related to the vitamin E content of LDL and showed a positive correlation with urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2. Urinary 8-epi-PGF2 alpha was unchanged after 2-week dosing with aspirin and indobufen despite complete suppression of TX metabolite excretion. Vitamin E supplementation was associated with dose-dependent reductions in both urinary 8-epi-PGF2 alpha and 11-dehydro-TXB2 by 34% to 36% and 47% to 58% at 100 and 600 mg daily, respectively. We conclude that the in vivo formation of the F2-isoprostane 8-epi-PGF2 alpha is enhanced in the vast majority of patients with hypercholesterolemia. This provides an aspirin-insensitive mechanism possibly linking lipid peroxidation to amplification of platelet activation in the setting of hypercholesterolemia. Dose-dependent suppression of enhanced 8-epi-PGF2 alpha formation by vitamin E supplementation may contribute to the beneficial effects of antioxidant treatment.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8348210>Intracavernosal kinetics of eicosanoids and endothelin during erection.

Increased dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was shown to shape FA composition and to improve insulin sensitivity in this animal strain. Thus, the aim of this study is twofold: (1) to evaluate a defect in the FA desaturation by direct measurement of enzyme activity and gene expression for Delta-6 desaturase (Delta-6 D) in liver of hHTg rats and (2) to investigate the effect of dietary n-3 PUFAs on hepatic Delta-6 D in relation to tissue FA composition. Male Wistar or hHTg rats were fed ad libitum for 21 days either the basal or fish oil (FO)-supplemented diets. Triglyceride (Tg) levels in serum and tissue lipid extracts were measured with the aid of a commercially available enzymatic set. Hepatic activity of the Delta-6 D was determined radiometrically in a microsomal fraction using 1-(14)C-linoleic  as a substrate. The Delta-6 D mRNA levels were measured using the Northern blot technique. Tissue FA composition was determined by gas chromatography in the total phospholipid fraction after TLC separation. Increased levels of Tg in hHTg rat circulation were accompanied by raised accumulation of Tg in skeletal muscles. FO feeding lowered the concentration of Tg in serum and prevented their accumulation in skeletal muscles of hHTg rats. A pronounced decrease in the hepatic Delta-6 D activity in hHTg rats (by about 80%) was not further diminished by FO feeding. On the other hand, the activity of Delta-6 D in liver of control rats was reduced by about 40% after FO supplementation. These changes were paralleled by a decrease in the Delta-6 D index as calculated from the liver phospholipid FA profile. In particular, an increase in the amount of 18:2 n-6 and a decrease in  and PUFA n-6 metabolites were found. The results indicate that a decrease of insulin action in hHTg rats is accompanied by an impairment of the hepatic Delta-6 D activity already at the gene level, which is not further affected by n-3 PUFA supplementation.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21216577>Ameliorative potential of S-allylcysteine: effect on lipid profile and changes in tissue fatty  composition in experimental diabetes.</a></h2><p> is an associated complication of diabetes mellitus. The association of hyperglycemia with an alteration of lipid parameters presents a major risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes. The present study was designed to examine the antihyperlipidemic effect of S-allylcysteine (SAC) in STZ induced diabetic rats. The levels of blood glucose, cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids, phospholipids and fatty  composition were estimated in the liver and kidneys of control and experimental groups of rats. Oral administration of SAC at a dose of 150 mg/kg bodyweight per day to STZ-induced diabetic rats for a period of 45 days resulted in a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose, TC, TG, free fatty acids, phospholipids, LDL-C, VLDL-C and elevation of HDL-C in comparison with diabetic control group. Oral administration of SAC to diabetic rats also decreased the concentrations of fatty acids, viz., palmitic, stearic (16:1), and oleic  (18:1), whereas linolenic (18:3) and  (20:4) were elevated.

However, dyslipoproteinemias have been implicated in the pathophysiologic process of atherogenesis, thrombogenesis and restenosis after interventional procedures. Lipoproteins provide important chemical linkages among these three complex phenomena. Lipoproteins participate in atherogenesis and play a major role in plaque fissuring, the pathophysiologic common denominator of acute ischemic syndromes. Thrombogenesis is majoraly affected by the action of lipids on platelets, coagulation and fibrinolysis. LDL tend to destabilize platelet membrane activity, macrophages, endothelial and smooth muscle cell function; HDL tend to reverse these abnormalities. The metabolism of , a metabolite of the essential polyunsaturated lipoprotein, linoleic , is integral to platelet and endothelial cell membrane formation, via the cyclooxygenase-prostanoid pathway.  also is metabolized by the lipoxygenase-leukotreine pathway in neutrophils and monocytes. The relationship of dyslipoproteinemias (increased LDL and Lp(a); decreased HDL) to restenosis after angioplasty has been reported, though there is not universal agreement about causality. Lipid lowering regimens and other pharmacotherapy have had favorable effect slowing the rate of atherogenesis, decreasing the frequency of cardiac events (perhaps by "stabilizing" vulnerable plaques) and causing regression in some atheromata. The salutary effect of lipid-lowering agents upon the incidence of restenosis after angioplasty is problematic. Some investigators have found a statistically significant correlation, while others have not; but studies have not been standardized. In conclusion, the study of lipid metabolism across a wide range of physiochemical activities and the interaction of these phenomena describe complex, genetically determined linkages which instruct (and often humble) investigators in their study of lipids in health and disease.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30883776>Peripheral Artery Disease Is Associated with a Deficiency of Erythrocyte Membrane n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids.</a></h2><p>Population-based data suggest that individuals who consume large dietary amounts of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have lower odds of peripheral artery disease (PAD); however, clinical studies examining n-3 PUFA levels in patients with PAD are sparse.

Data regarding the relationship between insufficient platelet inhibition and thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing neurovascular procedures remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of insufficient platelet inhibition and thromboembolic complications in patients with intracranial aneurysm undergoing stent treatment. METHODS The authors prospectively recruited patients with intracranial aneurysms undergoing stent treatment and maintained the data in a database. MRI with diffusion-weighted sequences was performed within 24 hours of stent insertion to identify acute ischemic lesions. The authors used thromboelastography to assess the degree of platelet inhibition in response to clopidogrel and aspirin. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential risk factors of thromboembolic complications. RESULTS One hundred sixty-eight patients with 193 aneurysms were enrolled in this study. Ninety-one of 168 (54.2%) patients with acute cerebral ischemic lesions were identified by diffusion-weighted MRI. In 9 (5.4%) patients with ischemic lesions, transient ischemic attack or stroke was found at discharge, and these complications were found in 11 (6.5%) patients during the follow-up period. The incidence of periprocedural thromboembolic complications increased with resistance to antiplatelet agents, hypertension, , complete occlusion, and aneurysm of the anterior circulation. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the anterior circulation and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) inhibition percentage were independent risk factors of perioperative thromboembolic complications. The maximum amplitude and ADP inhibition percentage were independent risk factors for thromboembolic complications during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS The ADP inhibition percentage is related to thromboembolic complications after stent placement for intracranial aneurysms. The increase of the ADP inhibition may decrease the risk of thromboembolic complications.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15819800>Effect of different immunosuppressive therapies on the lipid pattern in kidney-transplanted rats.</a></h2><p>We analyzed the effect of oral administration of cyclosporine-methylprednisone (CsA-MP) and sirolimus (SRL) on the lipid pattern of kidney-transplanted rats after a 7-day survival.

PUFA n-3 include alpha linolenic  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), while PUFA n-6 include linoleic  (LA) and  (AA). Since PUFA n-3 consumption has been shown to be inversely correlated with coronary heart diseases (CHD) incidence, clinical trials have been principally conducted by administering fish oil supplements or purified PUFA n-3. The relationship between dietary PUFA n-3 and CHD is believed to be only partially mediated by their effects on plasma lipoprotein profile. PUFA n-3 have shown to reduce only slightly total and LDL cholesterol, probably as they crowd saturated fatty acids out of diet. Data on HDL cholesterol suggest that PUFA n-3 produce only a small increase in this fraction. The effect of PUFA n-3 supplementation on plasma triglycerides (TG) is much more important, with a reduction of about 25% in normolipidemic subjects and about 50% in hypertriglyceridemic patients. This effect seems to be mediated by an inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, and VLDL secretion, and an increase in apo B liver degradation. They also increase lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in a reduction of post-prandial TG. PUFA n-3 might be used as second line therapy, additional or alternative to fibrates and nicotinic , in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia.

Consistently, 18β-GA suppressed AEA-induced adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells through the downregulation of AEA-induced MAPK activation and expression of adipogenic genes including C/EBP-α and PPAR-γ. The protein levels of fatty  synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 were also decreased and the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was increased in 18β-GA pretreated cells. The supplementation of 18β-GA significantly lowered body weight, fat weight, and plasma lipids levels in obese animal models.These results may provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in anti-adipogenic and anti-obesity effects of 18β-GA by suppressing the activation of CB1R induced by AEA.

There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05).

Rabbits were fed either a control diet (CD) or a diet containing 1 % cholesterol (HD) for 5-6 weeks. The level of fatty acids was measured in plasma. The levels of PG and nitric oxide (NO) released from the aorta were also determined. Vascular morphology of the aorta was characterized by intima and media thickness measurements.

PGI(2) and NO were diminished and PGF(2α) levels, the PGI(2)/TXA(2) ratio and the intima/media ratio were increased in rabbits fed with HD. In conclusion, feeding HD for a short period increased ARA plasma levels and unbalanced release of vasodilator/vasoconstrictor PG redirected the pathway to vasoconstrictor metabolite release. These lipid metabolism alterations in addition to the reduced NO levels and the moderate changes in the vascular morphology contributed to the endothelial dysfunction in this animal model.

Fish oil also produced a clear decrease of plasma triacylglycerol levels. Coconut oil increased the percentages of 12:0 and 14:0 fatty acids, while menhaden oil increased those of 20:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3.

Total cholesterol, phospholipid and protein contents of high and low density lipoproteins increased by coconut oil feeding. When coconut oil was replaced by menhaden oil, total cholesterol was significantly reduced in high, low and very low density lipoproteins. All chemical components of VLDL were decreased by menhaden oil feeding.

Inflammation is a key feature of the immune system, functioning to defend tissue integrity and function. However, chronic stimulation of inflammatory mediators leads to lasting vascular reactivity, insulin resistance, , and, subsequently, chronic disease. Dietary practices to minimize inflammatory stimuli and CVD risk include regular intakes of fatty fish rich in the eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids that compete with the more pervasive membrane fatty , , disrupting the metabolic cascades that stimulate inflammation. Another effective dietary strategy is to consume less  by reducing beef, poultry, fish, and eggs from the diet (e.g., adopting a vegetarian-like diet). Since oxidative stress plays a prominent role in immune system activation, regular ingestion of ample amounts of fruits and vegetables (8+ servings/d) rich in antioxidant compounds, the polyphenols, carotenoids, and vitamin C (e.g., citrus, tomatoes, berries, carrots, and greens), lowers inflammatory mediators and risk for chronic disease. Whole grains, legumes, and nuts have also been demonstrated in clinical trials to effectively reduce inflammatory mediators and risk for CVD.

Although both drugs reduced plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, gemfibrozil reduced plasma triglycerides more effectively and simvastatin reduced plasma cholesterol more effectively. LDL cholesterol was reduced with simvastatin. With both drugs, total serum apo-B concentration decreased. With gemfibrozil, this was due to an exclusive reduction (-46%) of very low/intermediate-density lipoprotein (VLDL + IDL) apo-B, whereas simvastatin decreased apo-B in both VLDL + IDL and LDL (34% and 15%, respectively). Initially, a dense LDL subfraction profile was present in all patients. The decrease in LDL cholesterol with simvastatin was due to a decrease in all isolated LDL subfractions except LDL2; gemfibrozil increased LDL1 and LDL2 cholesterol (p = 0.001) and reduced LDL4 cholesterol, resulting in a more buoyant LDL subfraction profile compared with simvastatin. In both groups, a predominance of small dense LDL remained despite therapy. LDL fatty  composition showed a shift from oleic  to linoleic  after gemfibrozil;  increased after simvastatin.

Dietary oilseed proteins (e.g., cottonseed and soy protein) are known to reduce the severity of diet-induced hypertriglyceridemia, but their influence on drug-induced hypertriglyceridemia has not been studied previously. In the present study, the ability of dietary cottonseed protein (as cottonseed flour) to prevent drug-induced hypertriglyceridemia was investigated by feeding male Fischer 344 rats diets having casein or cottonseed protein flour with or without 13-cis-retinoic . Animals were fed diets for 2 weeks. Retinoid administration was associated with the induction of hypertriglyceridemia and with changes in serum fatty  profile, the most noticeable being lowered levels of . Levels of this fatty  were 35 and 54% of control levels for retinoid-treated animals fed casein and cottonseed flour, respectively. Animals fed cottonseed flour had lower serum triglyceride levels than ones fed casein for both retinoid-containing and control diets. Dietary cottonseed flour had no effect on food intake or body weight and did not affect serum drug levels. Thus, dietary cottonseed protein can reduce the severity of retinoid-induced hypertriglyceridemia without having adverse effects on food intake or growth; in addition, because levels of 13-cis-retinoic are unaffected by cottonseed protein, it is unlikely that the chemopreventive effectiveness of the drug will be compromised by the inclusion of this protein in the diet.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262499>GC-MS based metabolomics strategy to distinguish three types of acute pancreatitis.</a></h2><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a progressive systemic inflammatory response with high morbidity and high mortality, which is mainly caused by alcohol, bulimia, gallstones and .

Thus, the aim of this study was to measure the enzymatic activity and gene expression of delta-6 desaturase in liver of hHTg rats and the tissue FA composition in relation to insulin action.Glucose, triglycerides and insulin in plasma were measured using commercially available enzymatic sets. The hepatic delta-6 desaturase activity in hHTg rats was determined radiometrically in a microsomal fraction using the 1-14C-linoleic  as substrate. delta-6 Desaturase gene expression was measured by the Northern blot technique using a specific cDNA probe. Tissue FA profile was determined by gas chromatography in the total lipid fraction extracted to chloroform. The glucose turnover rate was measured in conscious freely moving animals with the aid of euglycemic hyperinsulinic clamp method.Tissue triglycerides showed a high accumulation in skeletal muscle of hHTg rats. In the liver of these animals, a defect in delta-6 desaturase enzymatic activity was found, while the gene expression for delta-6 desaturase was not changed. Such decreased delta-6 desaturase activity in the liver was linked to a decrease of delta-6 desaturase index as calculated from the liver FA composition. Also the concentration of  (a final metabolite in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-6 series) was significantly decreased in hHTg rat liver. These changes in FA metabolism were accompanied by a decreased glucose infusion rate (a measure of in vivo insulin action) required to maintain euglycemia at hyperinsulinemia in hHTg rats, and correlated with the hepatic delta-6 desaturase activity.1. hHTg rats showed a reduced activity of the delta-6 desaturase in liver without any changes in gene expression for this enzyme; 2. such impairment is accompanied by a lower delta-6 desaturase index (18:2n-6/18:3n-6) found in the liver of these animals and by specific FA profiles in the tissues, particularly regarding the amount of long-chain PUFAs and 18:2n-6 metabolites; and (4) these alterations seem to be related to the impaired insulin action of hHTg rats.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7979101>Erythrocyte membrane fatty  composition in hypercholesterolaemia.</a></h2><p>The fatty  composition of the erythrocyte membrane was determined in 22 hypercholesterolaemic patients managed by dietary restriction, and compared with that of 22 normocholesterolaemic controls, roughly matched for age and sex with the patient group.

This effect was partially related to the cholesterol-lowering, in that three days of treatment with atorvastatin significantly decreased platelet O2- production, while no significant change in LDL-cholesterol levels was observed. Platelets incubated with LDL cholesterol showed an increased O2- production, which was significantly inhibited by AACOCF3 (-78%) and DPI (-56%).LDL cholesterol increases platelet O2- production by activating PLA2 and NADH/NADPH enzymes.

Acute niacin treatment inhibits nonesterified fatty  release from adipocytes and stimulates prostaglandin release from skin Langerhans cells, but the acute effects diminish upon prolonged treatment, while the beneficial effects remain. To gain insight in the prolonged effects of niacin on lipid metabolism in adipocytes, we used a mouse model with a human-like lipoprotein metabolism and drug response [female APOE*3-Leiden.CETP (apoE3 Leiden cholesteryl ester transfer protein) mice] treated with and without niacin for 15 weeks. The gene expression profile of gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) from niacin-treated mice showed an upregulation of the "biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids" pathway, which was corroborated by quantitative PCR and analysis of the FA ratios in gWAT. Also, adipocytes from niacin-treated mice secreted more of the PUFA DHA ex vivo. This resulted in an increased DHA/ (AA) ratio in the adipocyte FA secretion profile and in plasma of niacin-treated mice. Interestingly, the DHA metabolite 19,20-dihydroxy docosapentaenoic  (19,20-diHDPA) was increased in plasma of niacin-treated mice. Both an increased DHA/AA ratio and increased 19,20-diHDPA are indicative for an anti-inflammatory profile and may indirectly contribute to the atheroprotective lipid and lipoprotein profile associated with prolonged niacin treatment.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10953635>[Insulinemia, fatty acids in plasma lipids and lipoproteins and oxidation of VLDL and LDL in ].</a></h2><p>Both insulin resistance and  are connected with an increased oxidative stress, playing a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis.

AGE inhibitors such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine (PM) inhibit both the formation of AGEs and development of complications in animal models of diabetes. PM also inhibits the chemical modification of protein by advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs) during lipid peroxidation reactions in vitro. We show here that several PM adducts, formed in incubations of PM with linoleate and arachidonate in vitro, are also excreted in the urine of PM-treated animals. The PM adducts N-nonanedioyl-PM (derived from linoleate), N-pentanedioyl-PM, N-pyrrolo-PM, and N-(2-formyl)-pyrrolo-PM (derived from arachidonate), and N-formyl-PM and N-hexanoyl-PM (derived from both fatty acids) were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of rat urine.

However, the relationship among the serum lipid profiles, the FA composition of the red blood cell (RBC) membranes and genetic variations in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) genes in Japanese men is unclear. In this study, the subjects recruited were 137 Japanese men, 40 to 60 y old, who had a regular health checkup. Their serum lipid profile and the relative FA composition of the RBC membranes were measured. They were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs174553, rs174546, rs99780 and rs174583 in FADS gene. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to detect the relationship among , the FA composition of the RBC and the FADS genotypes. As a result, the homozygous genotype for the minor alleles in rs174553, rs174546, rs99780 were found to be associated with lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and a lower LDL-C/total-cholesterol ratio. The homozygous genotype for the minor alleles reduced the risk of high LDL-C level (R2=0.50, β=-0.20, p=0.009), whereas, the  (AA) levels in the carriers of the homozygous genotype for the minor alleles tended to be lower compared with the carriers of the major alleles. However, no significant differences were observed in any FA level among the three genotypes for four SNPs. These results indicate that the appropriate management of serum LDL-C levels depending on genetic predisposition in FADS genotypes should be encouraged.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8770320>Oxidative structural modifications of low density lipoprotein in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.</a></h2><p>Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), as a result of the increased levels and prolonged residence time of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in plasma, have a strong tendency toward accumulation of LDL-cholesterol in the arterial wall, causing premature atherosclerosis. This phenomenon may enhance per se the physiological degradation of both protein and lipid component of LDL, which be more susceptible to oxidative damage induced by oxygen radicals. It is well known that LDL may undergo oxidative modification before being taken up by macrophages which are then transformed into foam cells. It has been suggested that platelet-activating factor (PAF) may play an important role in atherogenesis and PAF catabolism is known to be mediated by serum acetylhydrolase, an enzyme that is normally associated with LDL. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the structural properties of LDL, including acetylhydrolase activity, in homozygous FH as compared to normolipidemic subjects before and after xanthine/xanthine oxidase-mediated oxidation. We studied 8 homozygous FH patients matched with 8 normolipidemic volunteers. Lipids of LDL fraction were extracted and verified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. Fatty acids were methylated and injected into a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer. Vitamin E in LDL was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As an index of susceptibility of LDL to oxidative modifications, the formation of lipid-conjugated dienes was continuously monitored at 234 nm. Lipid peroxidation was also evaluated from the amount of both lipid peroxides (LPO) and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) content. Apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 on LDL was carried on polyacrylamide and agarose gel electrophoresis. In the homozygous FH patients, the relative content of cholesteryl ester was slightly increased. Interestingly, the relative amount of  (20:4) was constantly increased in each lipid fraction in homozygous FH patients. The amount of vitamin E was not significantly different in the patient group from that in the control group. However, LDL from patients carried lower levels of vitamin E (nmol/mg LDL) than controls (2.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.3 P = NS). The results shows that lag time (min) was decreased (82 +/- 19 vs. 111 +/- 21; P < 0.05) and the maximal rate of diene production and total diene production was increased in homozygous FH patients. Mean levels of MDA were similar in both groups before oxidation, but levels after initiation of oxidation were significantly higher in the patient group. In contrast, mean levels of LPO were already higher in patients before oxidation (58 vs. 27 nmol/mg of protein; P < 0.05), and after initiation of oxidation were also significantly higher at each time points. When oxidized LDL was run on a polyacrylamide gel, an extensive apo B-100 fragmentation replaced by lower molecular mass fragments ranging from 45,000 to 205,000 m.wt., was observed only in LDL from homozygotes. Relative LDL agarose gel mobility shows that LDL from patients migrated higher than LDL of controls. Finally acetylhydrolase activity associated with LDL in patients was significantly reduced as compared to controls. Thus, in homozygous FH patients, LDL appeared more susceptible to oxidation in vitro; the indices for LDL oxidizability were all significantly different from those of controls. This phenomenon might be due to prolonged residence time of LDL in these patients, as suggested from high basal LPO levels and lower vitamin E levels carried by LDL. This hypothesis may explain together with the high content of , the enhanced susceptibility of LDL from homozygous FH patients to oxidative damage.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296567>Insulin resistance and impaired functional vasodilation in obese Zucker rats.</a></h2><p>Individuals with metabolic syndrome exhibit insulin resistance and an attenuated functional vasodilatory response to exercise. We have shown that impaired functional vasodilation in obese Zucker rats (OZRs) is associated with enhanced thromboxane receptor (TP)-mediated vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that insulin resistance, hyperglycemia/, and the resultant ROS are responsible for the increased TP-mediated vasoconstriction in OZRs, resulting in impaired functional vasodilation. Eleven-week-old male lean Zucker rats (LZRs) and OZRs were fed normal rat chow or chow containing rosiglitazone (5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 2 wk. In another set of experiment, LZRs and OZRs were treated with 2 mM tempol (drinking water) for 7-10 days. After the treatments, spinotrapezius muscles were prepared, and arcade arteriolar diameters were measured following muscle stimulation and  (AA) application (10 muM) in the absence and presence of the TP antagonist SQ-29548 (1 muM). OZRs exhibited higher insulin, glucose, triglyceride, and superoxide levels and increased NADPH oxidase activity compared with LZRs. Functional and AA-induced vasodilations were impaired in OZRs. Rosiglitazone treatment improved insulin, glucose, triglyceride, and superoxide levels as well as NADHP oxidase activity in OZRs. Both rosiglitazone and tempol treatment improved vasodilatory responses in OZRs with no effect in LZRs. SQ-29548 treatment improved vasodilatory responses in nontreated OZRs with no effect in LZRs or treated OZRs. These results suggest that insulin resistance and the resultant increased ROS impair functional dilation in OZRs by increasing TP-mediated vasoconstriction.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24528690>Omega-3 free fatty acids for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia: the EpanoVa fOr Lowering Very high triglyceridEs (EVOLVE) trial.</a></h2><p>Omega-3 fatty acids in free fatty  form have enhanced bioavailability, and plasma levels are less influenced by food than for ethyl ester forms.The aim was to evaluate the safety and lipid-altering efficacy in subjects with severe hypertriglyceridemia of an investigational pharmaceutical omega-3 free fatty  (OM3-FFA) containing eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic .This was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, out-patient study.

The cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase inhibitor metyrapone had no effect on -induced relaxations. The present study hypothesized that a lipoxygenase metabolite of  mediated the response. Incubation of rabbit aorta with [14C] resulted in the synthesis of a previously unidentified 14C-labeled metabolite and was called the unknown factor. Production of the unknown factor was not inhibited by indomethacin and decreased by lipoxygenase inhibitors. Production of the unknown factor and -induced relaxations were dependent on an intact endothelium, indicating that the cellular source of the unknown relaxant factor was the endothelial cell. This was confirmed by demonstrating the ability of cultured rabbit aortic endothelial cells to produce the unknown factor from [14C]. Feeding rabbits a 2% cholesterol diet for 2 wk induced hypercholesterolemia without causing atherosclerosis. In the cholesterol-fed rabbits, indomethacin enhanced -induced relaxations in norepinephrine-precontracted aortas (maximal relaxation 49.0 +/- 2.5 vs. 35.5 +/- 1.7%, cholesterol-fed vs. normal) and increased production of the unknown factor compared with normal rabbits. The partially purified unknown factor elicited an approximately 26% inhibition of the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine in intact rabbit aorta. Further purification of the unknown factor by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography system resulted in isolation of a radioactive product that relaxed precontracted rabbit aorta.

After 6 weeks on a lipid-lowering diet, patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 3.4 mmol/l were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, policosanol or pravastatin 10 mg tablets that were taken with the evening meal for 8 weeks. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.00001) lowered LDL-cholesterol (19.3%), total cholesterol (13.9%) and the ratios of LDL-cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (28.3%) and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (24.4%). Pravastatin significantly (p < 0.00001) lowered LDL-cholesterol (15.6%), total cholesterol (11.8%) and the ratios (p < 0.0001) of LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (18.9%) and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (15.7%). Policosanol, but not pravastatin, significantly increased (p < 0.001) levels of HDL-cholesterol (18.4%) and reduced (p < 0.01) triglycerides (14.1%). Policosanol was more effective (p < 0.05) than pravastatin in inhibiting platelet aggregation induced by all agonists and it significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) platelet aggregation induced by  at 1.5 and 3 mmol/l by 42.2% and 69.5%, respectively, platelet aggregation induced by collagen 0.5 microgram/ml (p < 0.05) (16.6%) and that induced by adenosine diphosphate 1 mumol/l (p < 0.01) (20.3%). Pravastatin significantly reduced (p < 0.001) (27%) only platelet aggregation induced by  3 mmol/l. Both drugs significantly decreased (p < 0.00001) endothelemia levels but final values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the policosanol than in the pravastatin group. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated. Pravastatin significantly (p < 0.01) increased serum levels of alanine amine transferase but individual values remained within normal.

The endothelium is the source of a number of vasoactive compounds which may be altered by the disease process. For example, synthesis of the  metabolite thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) increases in atherosclerosis. Non-selective blockade of vascular and platelet thromboxane (TP) receptors retards the progression of the disease in various animal models. We have previously identified a subset of NZW rabbits that lack only vascular (v) TP receptors, referred to as vTP-. These rabbits provide a unique model to elucidate the role of vascular TP receptors in hypercholesterolemia. Studies evaluated vascular responses to phenylephrine and acetylcholine in isolated aortic rings obtained from vTP- and vTP+ rabbits fed 0.5% cholesterol diet for a period of only 3 weeks. In the cholesterol-fed vTP- rabbits, contractions to phenylephrine were reduced compared to the vTP+ cholesterol-fed rabbits. Acetylcholine-induced relaxations were greater in cholesterol-fed vTP- rabbits compared to cholesterol-fed vTP+ rabbits. While the overall incidence of aortic lesions was small after only 3 weeks of cholesterol-feeding, results indicated a reduction in lesions in the vTP- compared to the vTP+ rabbits. In summary, these studies are the first to show that if rabbits lack only vascular TP receptors, impaired vascular reactivity responses normally associated with hypercholesterolemia are diminished.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22395372>[The frequency of aspirin resistance by a modified thrombelastography method and its relationship with clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with stable coronary artery disease].</a></h2><p>Aspirin is the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular medicine.

The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of a higher dose of policosanol, a cholesterol-lowering drug, (40 mg/day) with the effects of 20 mg/day policosanol on platelet aggregation in healthy volunteers and type II hypercholesterolaemic patients. 2. Study subjects were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, placebo or policosanol (20 or 40 mg/day) for 30 days once a day. Blood sampling was performed at baseline and after 30 days on therapy. 3. Platelet aggregation was induced with three aggregating agents:  (AA), collagen and low doses of ADP. 4. Policosanol (20 and 40 mg/day) moderately yet significantly reduced platelet aggregation, but no differences were observed in the effects produced by either dose of policosanol. In healthy volunteers, policosanol at 20 and 40 mg/day inhibited aggregation induced by 2 mmol/L AA (28.2 and 24.9%, respectively), 1 micro g/mL collagen (21.1 and 20.2%) and 1 micro mol/L ADP (30.9 and 29.1%). Changes that occurred following the administration of placebo were not significant, although an upward trend for collagen- and ADP-induced aggregation occurred in normal and hypercholesterolaemic subjects, respectively, thus partially masking the effects of policosanol on these responses. 5. The antiplatelet effects of policosanol at 20 and 40 mg/day in hypercholesterolaemic patients were also similar, so that both doses inhibited aggregation induced by 1.5 mmol/L AA (20.1 and 33.0%, respectively), 0.5 micro g/mL collagen (22.7 and 21.1%) and 1 micro mol/L ADP (40.5 and 34.7%). 6. In addition, after 30 days of therapy, 20 and 40 mg/day policosanol significantly (P < 0.01) reduced low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (15.9 and 17.0%, respectively) and total cholesterol (12.4 and 12.3%, respectively; P < 0.05), yet increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol values by 5% in both groups (P < 0.05). 7. Triglycerides were decreased compared with baseline, but not with respect to the placebo. 8. We conclude that the antiplatelet effects induced by 40 mg/day policosanol administered for 30 days to healthy volunteers and to hypercholesterolaemic patients were similar to the effects induced by 20 mg/day policosanol.

Atherosclerosis followed by thrombosis (atherothrombosis) is the pathological process underlying most myocardial, cerebral, and peripheral vascular events. Atherothrombosis is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory process that involves interactions between many cell types (including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets) and processes (including migration, proliferation, and activation). Despite a wealth of knowledge from many recent studies using knockout mouse and human genetic studies (GWAS and candidate approach) identifying genes and proteins directly involved in these processes, traditional cardiovascular risk factors (, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, sex, and age) remain the most useful predictor of disease. Eicosanoids (20 carbon polyunsaturated fatty  derivatives of  and other essential fatty acids) are emerging as important regulators of cardiovascular disease processes. Drugs indirectly modulating these signals, including COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors, have proven to play major roles in the atherothrombotic process. However, the complexity of their roles and regulation by opposing eicosanoid signaling, have contributed to the lack of therapies directed at the eicosanoid receptors themselves. This is likely to change, as our understanding of the structure, signaling, and function of the eicosanoid receptors improves. Indeed, a major advance is emerging from the characterization of dysfunctional naturally occurring mutations of the eicosanoid receptors. In light of the proven and continuing importance of risk factors, we have elected to focus on the relationship between eicosanoids and cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10720603>High-fat diet elevates blood pressure and cerebrovascular muscle Ca(2+) current.</a></h2><p>Dietary fat contributes to the elevation of blood pressure and increases the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. Previous observations have shown that voltage-gated Ca(2+) current density is significantly increased in hypertension and can be affected by free fatty acids (FAs). We hypothesized that a diet of elevated fat level would lead to an increase in blood pressure, an elevation of L-type Ca(2+) current, and an increase in saturated FA content in vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. Male Osborne-Mendel rats were fed normal rat chow or a high-fat diet (Ob/HT group) for 8 weeks. Blood pressures in the Ob/HT group increased moderately from 122.5+/-0.7 to 134.4+/-0.8 mm Hg (P<0.05, n=26). Voltage-clamp examination of cerebral arterial cells revealed significantly elevated L-type Ca(2+) current density in the Ob/HT group. Voltage-dependent inactivation of the Ob/HT L-type channels was significantly delayed. Total serum FA contents were significantly elevated in the Ob/HT group, and HPLC analyses of fractional pools of FAs from segments of abdominal aorta revealed that  levels were elevated in the phospholipid fraction in Ob/HT. No differences in vascular membrane cholesterol contents were noted. Plasma cholesterol was significantly elevated in portal venous and cardiac blood samples from Ob/HT rats. These findings suggest that an elevation of plasma FAs may contribute to the development of hypertension via a process involving the elevation of Ca(2+) current density and an alteration of channel kinetics in the vascular smooth muscle membrane.</p><p>Keyword: hyperlipedemia</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17415466>Plasma content of cholesterol and glycerol alcohols depends on the number of fatty  double bonds in lipoprotein lipid pool.</a></h2><p>The number of the fatty  double bonds (unsaturation degree) in the plasma lipid pool was evaluated by automated ozone titration. A positive relationship between the content of double bonds, cholesterol, and glycerol was detected. The higher was plasma cholesterol level, the more double bonds contained fatty acids. At cholesterol level of 0.8-18.9 mmol/liter the double bond/cholesterol ratio approached 4.0 and double bond/glycerol ratio was 1.3-1.5. The maximum content of double bonds was detected in LDL. It was hypothesized that the greater part of plasma cholesterol is esterified with  possessing 4 double bonds; three fatty acids are esterified with glycerol, which altogether have 1-3 double bonds. It seems that plasma cholesterol level indirectly but significantly reflects the level of essential polyenic fatty acids, while glycerol reflects the levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The role of cholesterol in the plasma consists in the participation in transfer of essential fatty  in the nonpolar form and their absorption by cells.

The percentage of  in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine of liver, platelets, and aorta was lower in the marine oil groups than in the control group, seal oil being more effective than squid oil. Maximal platelet aggregation induced by collagen was significantly lower in both marine oil groups. Platelet thromboxane (TX) A2 production induced by collagen or thrombin was markedly reduced by feeding seal or squid oils, the reduction being more pronounced in the seal oil than in the squid oil group. Aortic prostacyclin (PGI2) production was the same among the three groups. The ratio of the productions of aortic PGI2 and platelet TXA2 was significantly higher in the seal oil than in the control group. Although there was no difference in intimal thickness among the three groups, the aortic cholesterol content was significantly lower in the marine oil groups than in the control group.

One half of survivors remain disabled, and one seventh requires institutional care. Aspirin remains the cornerstone of primary and secondary stroke prevention; meanwhile, aspirin resistance is one of the possible causes of stroke recurrence. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and biochemical aspirin resistance in patients with recurrent ischemic stroke.We studied demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, stroke subtypes, radiologic findings and biochemical aspirin resistance tests using both  (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) on admission and 24 h after observed aspirin ingestion.Of the 82 patients with recurrent cerebral ischemia included in this study, 37 (45%) patients were poor compliant with aspirin. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the demographic characteristics, stroke severity, laboratory tests, radiological findings or vascular risk factors. On admission, 19.6% and 4.8% of patients showed aspirin resistance, while 24 h after supervised 300 mg single aspirin dose ingestion, it was 9.8% and 2.4% using ADP and AA-induced LTA respectively. Of the eight aspirin resistant patients, two only showed resistance using both AA and ADP. Aspirin resistance was statistically significantly higher in the male gender, older age, , smokers and in all lacunar strokes using AA.Biochemical aspirin resistance in one's series was rather rare (2.4%) and was more prevalent in patients with lacunar strokes. Clinical aspirin failure may often be contributed to poor compliance with aspirin intake.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Because prostaglandin (PG)I2, an  (20:4) metabolite, is a key substance generated by human lymphatics, both from exogenous and endogenous substrates, it is reasonable to assume that altered nutritional intake of precursor fatty acids (FA) influences formation of respective eicosanoids qualitatively and quantitatively, and thereby modify its biological effects on human lymphatics. We, therefore, examined the effect of 2 other FA-precursors, dihomo-gamma-linolenic (20:3) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5) on the formation of the respective PG-metabolites in human lymphatics removed from the legs in patients undergoing amputation after traumatic injury. 20:3 and 20:5 were poorer substrates to form PGs. Because these PGs exert different biological actions and their synthesis may be altered by vascular environmental risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, , and availability of FA precursors and therefore nutrition, PGs may profoundly modulate the lymphatic contractile response under a variety of circumstances.

Compared to oxylipins derived from  (AA) by cyclooxygenase action, i.e. prostanoides, only limited information is available about the endogenous levels of hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-FA of linoleic  (LA), AA, α-linolenic  (ALA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) in humans. Particularly, it is unknown how metabolic disorders affect endogenous oxylipin levels in humans. Therefore, in the present study we compared the serum concentrations of 44 oxylipins in 20 normolipidemic with 20 hyperlipidemic (total cholesterol >200 mg/dl; LDL-C>130 mg/dl; TG>150 mg/dl) men (age 29-51 y). The serum concentration varied strongly among subjects. For most hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-FA the concentrations were comparable to those in plasma reported in earlier studies. Despite the significant change in blood lipid levels the hyperlipidemic group showed only minor differences in oxylipin levels. The hyperlipidemic subjects had a slightly higher serum concentration of 8,9-DiHETrE, 5-HEPE, 10,11-DiHDPE, and a lower concentration of 12,13-DiHOME, 12-HETE, 9,10-DiHODE, and 12,13-DiHODE compared to normolipidemic subjects. Overall the hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-FA levels were not changed suggesting that mild combined  has no apparent effect on the concentration of circulating oxylipins. By contrast, serum levels of several hydroxy-, epoxy-, and dihydroxy-FA are dependent on the individual status of the parent FA. Particularly, a strong correlation between the EPA content in the erythrocyte membrane and the serum concentration of EPA derived oxylipins was observed. Given that the synthesis of EPA from other n-3 FA in humans is low; this suggests that oxylipin levels can be directly influenced by the diet.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

LDL isolated from the plasmas of 25 subjects affected by familial hypercholesterolemia and 15 control subjects was oxidatively modified with Cu2+ in vitro, and the differences in LDL susceptibilities (lag and propagation phases) to lipid peroxidation were studied by measuring the changes in fluorescence intensity.

Pigs were fed two meals per day and daily insulin injections were used in diabetic pigs to maintain plasma glucose between 250 and 350 mg/dl. Diabetic dyslipidemic (DF) pigs exhibited greater coronary atherosclerosis and increased collagen deposition in internal mammary artery compared with normoglycemic hyperlipidemic pigs. Although total and LDL CH concentrations did not differ, triglyceride (TG) were increased in DF pigs and FPLC analysis indicated that the LDL/HDL CH ratio was significantly increased in DF compared with HF pigs. The LDL fraction of DF pigs contained larger, lipid enriched particles resembling IDL. Consumption of the high fat/CH diet caused a moderate increase in the percentage of 14:0 fatty acids in plasma lipids and this was compensated by small-moderate declines in several unsaturated fatty acids. There was a significant increase in phospholipid  in DF compared with HF pigs. Atorvastatin protected diabetic pigs from atherosclerosis and decreased total and VLDL TG, but exerted minimal effects on the FPLC lipoprotein and plasma fatty  profiles and plasma concentrations of total and LDL CH, vitamin A, vitamin E, and lysophosphatidylcholine. Across all groups the plasma CH concentration was positively correlated with hepatic CH concentration.

The essence of the microinflammatory state is the innate immune response, which is central to the occurrence and development of DN. Members of the inflammasome family, including both "receptors" and "regulators", are key to the inflammatory immune response. Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and other inflammasome components are able to detect endogenous danger signals, resulting in activation of caspase-1 as well as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and other cytokines; these events stimulate the inflammatory cascade reaction, which is crucial for DN. Hyperglycaemia,  and hyperuricaemia can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which then mediates the occurrence and development of DN through the K channel model, the lysosomal damage model and the active oxygen cluster model. In this review, we survey the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in various signalling pathways and highlight different aspects of their influence on DN. We also explore the important effects of the NLRP3 inflammasome on kidney function and structural changes that occur during DN development and progression.
