Lipoxygenase pathway, catalyzing the first two steps of the transformation of  into leukotrienes is implicated in several processes such as cell differentiation, inflammation and carcinogenesis. Development of drugs that interfere with the formation or effects of these metabolites would be important for the treatment of various diseases like asthma, psoriasis, ulcerative , rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, and blood vessel disorders. Till now, asthma consists of the only pathological case in which improvement has been shown by lipoxygenase LO inhibitors. Thus, the research has been directed towards the development of drugs that interfere with the formation of leukotrienes. In order to explore the anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects of antioxidant acrylic/cinnamic acids a series of derivatives bearing the appropriate moieties have been synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation and evaluated for their biological activities. The compounds have shown important antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity and very good inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase while some of them were tested for their anticancer activity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26194111>The role of 15-LOX-1 in  and -associated colorectal cancer.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation is known to be mechanistically linked to the development of cancer. This article reviews and discusses the role of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) in the resolution of  and prevention of -associated colorectal cancer.15-LOX-1 is an inducible and highly regulated enzyme in cells that play an important role in the production of lipid signaling mediators from linoleic  and . Together, these acids and 15-LOX-1 are the driving force for the resolution of acute and chronic inflammation in normal cells. Widespread inflammation can progress from local inflammation to ulcerative , tumorigenesis, and finally invasive, metastatic, or benign colon cancer. Thus, reversing inflammation will halt the proliferation of cancerous cells. Decreased expression of 15-LOX-1 may lead to the development of -associated colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer.n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution products of 15-LOX-1 that can potentially prevent -associated colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934114>Lowering the dietary omega-6: omega-3 does not hinder nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease development in a murine model.</a></h2><p>It is hypothesized that a high dietary n-6:n-3 (eg, 10-20:1) is partly responsible for the rise in obesity and related health ailments. However, no tightly controlled studies using high-fat diets differing in the n-6:n-3 have tested this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and  development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and . Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and tight-junction proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to  development or changes in tight-junction protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that , or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ToF-SIMS was used to obtain mass spectra and chemical maps from the mucosal surface of human normal (NC), inflamed (IC), and dysplastic (DC) colon tissues. Chemical mapping with a lateral resolution of ≈ 1 μm allowed to evaluate zonation of fatty acids and amino acids as well as the morphological condition of the intestinal glands. High mass resolution ToF-SIMS spectra showed chemical differences in lipid and amino  composition as a function of pathological state. In positive ion mode, mono- (MAG), di- (DAG), and triacylglycerol (TAG) signals were detected in NC tissues, while in IC and DC tissues, the only cholesterol was present as lipid class representative. Signals from fatty acids, collected in negative ion mode, were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). PCA showed a strict correlation between IC and DC samples, due to an increase of stearic, , and linoleic . In the same way, differences in the amino  composition were highlighted through multivariate analysis. PCA revealed that glutamic , leucine/isoleucine, and valine fragments are related to IC tissues. On the other hand, tyrosine, methionine, and tryptophan peaks contributed highly to the separation of DC tissues. Finally, a classification of NC, IC, and DC patients was also achieved through hierarchical cluster analysis of amino  fragments. In this case, human colonic inflammation showed a stronger relationship with normal than dysplastic condition.

Dysregulation of the immune system based on genetic, environmental, and other factors seems to be involved in the onset of IBD, but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, radical treatments for ulcerative  and Crohn's disease remain to be found, and IBD is considered to be a refractory disease.The aim of this study is to obtain novel insights into IBD via metabolite profiling of interleukin (IL)-10 knockout mice (an IBD animal model that exhibits a dysregulated immune system).In this study, the metabolites in the large intestine and plasma of IL-10 knockout mice were analyzed. In our analytical system, two kinds of analysis (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) were used to detect a broader range of metabolites, including both hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites. In addition, an analysis of lipid mediators in the large intestine and ascites of IL-10 knockout mice was carried out.The levels of a variety of metabolites, including lipid mediators, were altered in IL-10 knockout mice. For example, high large intestinal and plasma levels of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) were observed. In addition, - and DHA-related lipid cascades were upregulated in the ascites of the IL-10 knockout mice.Our findings based on metabolite profiles including lipid mediators must contribute to development of researches about IBD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26246200>Maternal and neonatal dietary intake of balanced n-6/n-3 fatty acids modulates experimental  in young adult rats.</a></h2><p>The imbalance of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the maternal diet impairs intestinal barrier development and sensitizes the colon response to inflammatory insults in the young rats. With a view to overcoming this issue, we designed this study to investigate the effect of maternal and neonatal intake of different proportions of n-6/n-3 fatty acids on colon inflammation in the young adult rats.Female Wistar rats were assigned into four groups, and each group fed one of four semisynthetic diets, namely n-6, low n-3, n-6/n-3 and n-3 fatty acids for 8 weeks prior to mating, during gestation and lactation periods. At weaning, the pups were separated from the dams and fed diet similar to the mothers.  was induced on postnatal day 35, by administering 2 % dextran sulfate sodium in drinking water for 10 days.  was assessed based on the clinical and inflammatory markers in the colon. Fatty  analysis was done in liver, RBC, colon and spleen.A balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA diet significantly improved the body weight loss, rectal bleeding and mortality in rats. This was associated with lower myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, TNF-α and IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and iNOS levels in the colon tissues. Fatty  analysis has shown that the /docosahexaenoic  ratio was significantly lower in liver, RBC, colon and spleen in n-6/n-3 and n-3 diet groups.We demonstrate that balanced n-6/n-3 PUFA supplementation in maternal and neonatal diet alters systemic AA/DHA ratio and attenuates colon inflammation in the young adult rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25480980>Two distinct leukotriene B4 receptors, BLT1 and BLT2.</a></h2><p>Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent inflammatory mediator derived from . Two G protein-coupled receptors for LTB4 have been identified: a high-affinity receptor, BLT1, and a low-affinity receptor, BLT2. Both receptors mainly couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-like G proteins and induce cell migration. 12(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic  (12-HHT) was identified to bind BLT2 with higher affinity than LTB4. Expression of BLT1 was confirmed in type 1 helper T cells, type 2 helper T cells, type 17 helper T cells, effector CD8(+) T cells, dendritic cells and osteoclasts in addition to granulocytes, eosinophils and macrophages, and BLT1-deficient mice showed greatly reduced phenotypes in models of various inflammatory diseases, such as peritonitis, bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. In mice, BLT2 expression is restricted to intestinal epithelial cells and epidermal keratinocytes. BLT2-deficient mice showed enhanced  after administration of dextran sulfate, possibly due to reduced intestinal barrier function. An aspirin-dependent reduction in 12-HHT production was responsible for delayed skin wound healing, showing that the 12-HHT/BLT2 axis also plays an important role in skin biology. BLT1 and BLT2 are therefore potential targets for the development of novel drugs.© The Authors 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Japanese Biochemical Society.

Here, we performed the following analysis in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced  model using LC-MS/MS. Oral administration of 2% DSS in mice for 4 days resulted in severe intestinal inflammation by day 7, which gradually subsided by day 18. Based on the disease scoring index (assigned on the basis of fecal condition and weight loss), we defined the phases of  as induction (days 0-4), acute inflammation (days 4-7), recovery (days 7-9), and late recovery (days 9-18). Across all phases, 58 lipid mediators were detected in the inflamed colon tissue. In the induction phase, the production of n-6 fatty -derived prostaglandin E and thromboxane B increased by ∼2-fold. In the acute inflammation phase, the production of n-6 fatty -derived leukotrienes increased by >10-fold, while that of n-3 fatty -derived hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids decreased. In the recovery phase, a precursor of protectin D1 (17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic ) increased over 3-fold. These observations suggested dynamic changes in the production of lipid mediators across different phases of the disease and their potential regulation in healing .Copyright © 2018 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25908302>Effect of acute and chronic DSS induced  on plasma eicosanoid and oxylipin levels in the rat.</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids and oxylipins are potent lipid mediators involved in the regulation of inflammation. In order to evaluate their role and suitability as biomarkers in , we analyzed their systemic levels in the acute and chronic phase of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced . Male Fischer 344 rats were treated in three cycles with 4% DSS in the drinking water (4 days followed by 10 days recovery) and blood was drawn 3 days prior to the first DSS treatment and on days 4, 11, 32 and 39. Histopathological evaluation of the colon tissue after 42 days showed that the animals developed a mild to severe chronic . Consistently, prostaglandin levels were massively (twofold) elevated in the colonic tissue. LC-MS based targeted metabolomics was used to determine plasma oxylipin levels at the different time points. In the acute phase of inflammation directly after DSS treatment, epoxy-fatty  (FA), dihydroxy-FA and hydroxy-FA plasma concentrations were uniformly elevated. With each treatment cycle the increase in these oxylipin levels was more pronounced. Our data suggest that in the acute phase of  release of polyunsaturated FAs from membranes in the inflamed tissue is reflected by a uniform increase of oylipins formed in different branches of the  cascade. However, during the recovery phases the systemic oxylipin pattern is not or only moderately altered and does not allow to evaluate the onset of chronic inflammation in the colon.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A Review.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation takes part in the pathogenesis of some malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract including colorectal (CRC), gastric, and esophageal cancers. The use of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty  (ω3-PUFA) supplements for chemoprevention or adjuvant therapy of gastrointestinal cancers is being investigated in recent years. Most evidence has been reported in CRC, although their protective role has also been reported for -induced gastric cancer or Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma. Studies based on ω3-PUFA supplementation in animal models of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and CRC revealed positive effects on cancer prevention, reducing the number and size of tumors, down-regulating -derived eicosanoids, upregulating anti-oxidant enzymes, and reducing lipid peroxidation, whereas contradictory results have been found in induced  and -associated cancer. Beneficial effects have also been found in FAP and ulcerative  patients. Of special interest is their positive effect as adjuvants on radio- and chemo-sensitivity, specificity, and prevention of treatment complications. Some controversial results obtained in CRC might be justified by different dietary sources, extraction and preparation procedures of ω3-PUFAs, difficulties on filling out food questionnaires, daily dose and type of PUFAs, adenoma subtype, location of CRC, sex differences, and genetic factors. Studies using animal models of inflammatory bowel disease have confirmed that exogenous administration of active metabolites derived from PUFAs called pro-resolving mediators like lipoxin A4, -derived, resolvins derived from eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic (DHA), and docosapentaenoic (DPA) acids as well as maresin 1 and protectins DHA- and DPA-derived improve disease and inflammatory outcomes without causing immunosuppression or other side effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830399>Italian cohort of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease is characterised by variation in glycerophospholipid, free fatty acids and amino  levels.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of pathologies characterised by chronic inflammation of the intestine and an unclear aetiology. Its main manifestations are Crohn's disease and ulcerative . Currently, biopsies are the most used diagnostic tests for these diseases and metabolomics could represent a less invasive approach to identify biomarkers of disease presence and progression.The lipid and the polar metabolite profile of plasma samples of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have been compared with healthy individuals with the aim to find their metabolomic differences. Also, a selected sub-set of samples was analysed following solid phase extraction to further characterise differences between pathological samples.A total of 200 plasma samples were analysed using drift tube ion mobility coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for the lipid metabolite profile analysis, while liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the polar metabolite profile analysis.Variations in the lipid profile between inflammatory bowel disease and healthy individuals were highlighted. Phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and fatty acids were significantly changed among pathological samples suggesting changes in phospholipase A and  metabolic pathways. Variations in the levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids were also found. Furthermore, a decrease in amino acids levels suggests mucosal damage in inflammatory bowel disease.Given good statistical results and predictive power of the model produced in our study, metabolomics can be considered as a valid tool to investigate inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25460828>The role of PGE2 in intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Release of the free fatty   (AA) by cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and its subsequent metabolism by the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes produces a broad panel of eicosanoids including prostaglandins (PGs). This study sought to investigate the roles of these mediators in experimental models of inflammation and inflammation-associated intestinal tumorigenesis. Using the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model of experimental , we first investigated how a global reduction in eicosanoid production would impact intestinal injury by utilizing cPLA2 knockout mice. cPLA2 deletion enhanced colonic injury, reflected by increased mucosal ulceration and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Increased disease severity was associated with a significant reduction in the levels of several eicosanoid metabolites, including PGE2. We further assessed the precise role of PGE2 synthesis on mucosal injury and repair by utilizing mice with a genetic deletion of microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1), the terminal synthase in the formation of inducible PGE2. DSS exposure caused more extensive acute injury as well as impaired recovery in knockout mice compared to wild-type littermates. Increased intestinal damage was associated with both reduced PGE2 levels as well as altered levels of other eicosanoids including PGD2. To determine whether this metabolic redirection impacted inflammation-associated intestinal tumorigenesis, Apc(Min/+) and Apc(Min/+):mPGES-1(-/-) mice were exposed to DSS. DSS administration caused a reduction in the number of intestinal polyps only in Apc(Min/+):mPGES-1(-/-) mice. These results demonstrate the importance of the balance of prostaglandins produced in the intestinal tract for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and impacting tumor development.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Male Wistar rats were administered AA at 0, 5, 35 or 240 mg/kg daily by gavage for 8 weeks. Inflammatory bowel disease was induced by replacing drinking water with 3 % DSS solution during the last 7 d of the AA dosing period. These animals passed loose stools, diarrhoea and red-stained faeces. Cyclo-oxygenase-2 concentration and myeloperoxidase activity in the colonic tissue were significantly increased in the animals given AA at 240 mg/kg compared with the animals given AA at 0 mg/kg. Thromboxane B2 concentration in the medium of cultured colonic mucosae isolated from these groups was found to be dose-dependently increased by AA, and the increase was significant at 35 and 240 mg/kg. Leukotriene B4 concentration was also significantly increased and saturated at 5 mg/kg. In addition, AA at 240 mg/kg promoted DSS-induced colonic mucosal oedema with macrophage infiltration. In contrast, administration of AA for 8 weeks, even at 240 mg/kg, showed no effects on the normal rats. These results suggest that in rats with bowel disease AA metabolism is affected by oral AA, even at 5 mg/kg per d, and that excessive AA may aggravate inflammation, whereas AA shows no effects in rats without inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29580941>Increased epoxyeicosatrienoic acids may be part of a protective mechanism in human ulcerative , with increased CYP2J2 and reduced soluble epoxide hydrolase expression.</a></h2><p>Previous preclinical evidence has suggested that the elevation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) derived from the cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases-dependent metabolism of  has important anti-inflammatory effects. However, the levels of EETs and their synthetic and metabolic enzymes in human ulcerative  has not been evaluated.To evaluate EETs and the expression of relevant CYP isoforms and the metabolizing enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), tissue biopsies were collected from 16 pairs of ulcerative  patients' tissues and matched with adjacent non-inflamed tissues. EETs were extracted from tissue homogenates and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.The concentration of EETs was higher in ulcerative  tissues compared with matched adjacent non-inflamed tissues (1.91 ± 0.98 ng/mg vs. 0.96 ± 0.77 ng/mg, mean ± SD, P < 0.01). As shown by immunohistochemistry, sEH was present in the cytoplasm and intestinal mucosa and showed a decline in ulcerative  tissues compared with matched adjacent non-inflamed tissues. Western blot analyses showed reduced sEH expression in ulcerative  tissues compared with matched adjacent non-inflamed tissues, whereas CYP2J2 increased in ulcerative  tissues (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference observed in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 protein expression between them (P > 0.05).Our data suggest that the increase in EET levels may be part of a protective mechanism in ulcerative .

Several studies have pinpointed the initiating role of longstanding/relapsing inflammatory insult on the intestinal mucosa, with the activation of different pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ), chemokines and metabolites of  resulting in the activation of key transcription factors such as NF-κB. Longstanding inflammation may also modify the intestinal microbiota, prompting the overgrowth of genotoxic microorganisms, which may act as further cancer promoters. Most of the molecular dysregulation occurring in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis is documented in -associated adenocarcinoma too, but marked differences have been established in both their timing and prevalence. Unlike sporadic cancers, TP53 alterations occur early in IBD-related carcinogenesis, while APC dysregulation emerges mainly in the most advanced stages of the oncogenic cascade. From the therapeutic standpoint, -associated cancers are associated with a lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than the sporadic variant. Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, are significantly involved in -associated cancer development and progression. The focus now is on identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, with a view to ultimately designing patient-tailored therapies.Copyright © 2016 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.

In such cases, the immune system fails to recognize between foreign agents and its own body cells. Different factors, such as genetic factors (CD25, STAT4), epigenetic factors (DNA methylation, histone modifications) and environmental factors (xenobiotics, drugs, hormones) trigger autoimmunity. Glucocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), immunosuppressive and biological agents are currently used to manage autoimmune diseases of different origins. However, complete cure remains elusive. Many dietary and natural products including polyphenols have been widely studied as possible alternative treatment strategies for the management of autoimmune disorders. Polyphenols possess a wide-range of pharmacological and therapeutic properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. As immunomodulatory agents, polyphenols are emerging pharmaceutical tools for management of various autoimmune disorders including vitiligo, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis (MS). Polyphenols activate intracellular pathways such as  dependent pathway, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway and epigenetic modulation, which regulate the host's immune response.

The colon of mice was histologically observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic  Schiff (PAS) staining. The serum malondialdehyde (MDA), an endogenous indicator of oxidative stress, was chemically measured. Proinflammatory and NADPH oxidase genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).Cyp4a14-KO mice had a significantly higher number of goblet cells in the colon and were more resistant to DSS-induced  compared with the WT mice. The DSS-treated KO mice had lower levels of MDA. Consistent with the milder inflammatory pathological changes, DSS-treated KO mice had lower levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA in the liver and the colon. Moreover, the colon of DSS-treated Cyp4a14-KO and WT mice had higher mRNA levels of two members of NADPH oxidases, Nox2 and Nox4, suggesting that both Nox2 and Nox4 are inflammatory markers. By contrast, DSS-treated WT and KO mice had drastically decreased epithelium-localized Nox1 and dual oxidase (Duox) 2 mRNA levels, coinciding with the erosion of the mucosa induced by DSS.These results suggests a hypothesis that the increased goblet cell in the colon of Cyp4a14-KO mice provides protection from mucosal injury and Cyp4a14-increased oxidative stress exacerbates DSS-induced .

EETs have pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory activity. Using a Connectivity Map (CMAP) approach, we identified an inverse-correlation between an exemplar EPHX2 inhibitor (EPHX2i) compound response and an inflammatory bowel disease patient-derived signature. To validate the gene-disease link, we tested a pre-clinical tool EPHX2i (GSK1910364) in a mouse disease model, where it showed improved outcomes comparable to or better than the positive control Cyclosporin A. Up-regulation of cytoprotective genes and down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production were observed in colon samples obtained from EPHX2i-treated mice. Follow-up immunohistochemistry analysis verified the presence of EPHX2 protein in infiltrated immune cells from Crohn's patient tissue biopsies. We further demonstrated that GSK2256294, a clinical EPHX2i, reduced the production of IL2, IL12p70, IL10 and TNFα in both ulcerative  and Crohn's disease patient-derived explant cultures. Interestingly, GSK2256294 reduced IL4 and IFNγ in ulcerative , and IL1β in Crohn's disease specifically, suggesting potential differential effects of GSK2256294 in these two diseases.

The present study aimed to elucidate the expression of TRPV4 in the gastrointestinal tract and the pathogenic roles of TRPV4 in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced . TRPV4-immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial-like cells of the mouse tongue, esophagus, stomach, ileum, and colon; TRPV4 expression in the tongue was higher than other gastrointestinal tracts. TRPV4 colocalized with a type IV cell marker sonic hedgehog in circumvallate papillae. These findings suggest that TRPV4 contributes to sour taste sensing by regulating type III taste cell differentiation in mice. DSS-induced  was significantly attenuated in TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4KO) mice when compared to wild-type mice. DSS treatment upregulated TRPV4 expression in vascular endothelia of colonic mucosa and submucosa. DSS treatment increased vascular permeability, which was abolished in TRPV4KO mice. The activation of TRPV4 decreased VE-cadherin expression in mouse aortic endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. These findings indicate that the upregulation of TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells contributes to the progression of colonic inflammation via the activation of vascular permeability.

However, the effects of IA on -associated colorectal cancer (CRC) and its mechanisms are still unknown.The study was designed to evaluate the effect of IA on CRC and explore its underlying mechanisms.The effect of IA on  related CRC were evaluated in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mice and the underlying mechanisms were revealed by metabolomics, which were further validated in vivo and in vitro.The Balb/c mice were treated with AOM/DSS to induce CRC model and fed with normal diet with or without 0.02% IA. After the experimental period, samples of plasma were collected and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time off light mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF). Multivariate statistical tools were used to identify the changes of serum metabolites associated with CRC and responses to IA treatment. HT 29 and HCT 116 cells were stimulated by palmitate (PA) and cultured under hypoxia. Western blot, Q-PCR, and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to confirm the molecular pathway in vivo and in vitro.Our results showed IA significantly inhibited the inflammatory  symptoms such as disease activity index score, shortening of colon tissues and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. In metabolomic study, 31 potential metabolites associated with CRC were identified and 24 of them were reversed by IA treatment. Most of biomarkers were associated with  metabolism, glycerophospholipid catabolism, and phospholipid metabolism, suggesting lipid metabolism might be involved in the beneficial effect of IA on CRC. Furthermore, we also found IA could decrease the expressions of SREBP-1 and its target gene in the colon tissues of AOM/DSS mice. It could down-regulate the triglyceride (TG) content and the expressions of HIF1α, SREBP-1, FASN, and ACC in HT 29 and HCT 116 cells. The inhibitory effect of IA on SREBP-1 was also attenuated by desferrioxamine (DFX), suggesting HIF1α is involved in the regulation of IA on SREBP-1.IA prevents early colonic carcinogenesis in AOM/DSS mice and reprogramed lipid metabolism partly through HIF1α/SREBP-1.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

The PGE2 receptor is classified into 4 specific G-protein coupled subtypes, EP1-EP4, and their distribution accounts for the multiple effects of this prostanoid. PGE2 prevents -reflux esophagitis and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions through EP1 receptors, while endogenous PGs protect the stomach against cold restraint stress mediated by mainly PGI2/IP receptors and partly EP4 receptors. PGE2 also exhibits a protective effect against -induced duodenal damage and indomethacin-induced small intestinal lesions mediated by EP3/EP4 receptors; these effects in the stomach, duodenum, or small intestine are associated functionally with inhibition of gastric contraction (EP1), stimulation of duodenal HCO3 - secretion (EP3/EP4), or suppression of bacterial invasion due to the inhibition of intestinal motility (EP4) as well as stimulation of mucus secretion (EP3/EP4), respectively. PGE2 also prevents ischemiainduced enteritis and dextran sulfate sodium-induced  mediated by EP4 receptors, and the protective mechanisms may be related to the stimulation of mucus secretion and the down-regulation of immune response, respectively. Furthermore, PGE2 shows a healing-promoting effect on gastric ulcers and small intestinal lesions through the up-regulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stimulation of angiogenesis via the activation of EP4 receptors. Finally, COX-1 is mainly responsible for the production of endogenous PGs involved in mucosal protection, while COX-2 is mainly responsible for those involved in the healing of gastric ulcers or small intestinal lesions. These findings contribute to future development of new strategies for the treatment of GI diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630407>The endogenous bioactive lipid prostaglandin D-glycerol ester reduces murine  via DP1 and PPARγ receptors.</a></h2><p>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). COX-2 is mostly known for the production of prostaglandins (PGs) from . However, it also metabolizes the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide into the less well-studied bioactive lipids PG-glycerol esters (PG-Gs) and PG-ethanolamides (PG-EAs or prostamides). We previously showed that PGD-G, a product of 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2, has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, we used the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of  in mice to explore the role of PGD-G in murine models of IBD. Colon inflammation was assessed using macroscopic and histologic scores, myeloperoxidase activity, and expression of inflammatory mediators by real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA. We also compared the effects of PGD-G with those of PGD and PGD-EA. Finally, we used receptor antagonists to gain mechanistic insight into the receptors responsible for the observed effects. PGD-G reduced DSS-induced , but PGD and PGD-EA did not have the same effect. Furthermore, we showed that PGD-G is an agonist of the PGD receptor 1 (DP1) and that some of the effects of PGD-G were blocked by antagonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and DP1. Therefore, PGD-G could be one of the products from the COX-2/prostaglandin D synthase axis to exert beneficial effects in .-Alhouayek, M., Buisseret, B., Paquot, A., Guillemot-Legris, O., Muccioli, G.

Modification of fat metabolism may alter inflammation and disease severity. Our aim was to assess differences in dietary and serum fatty  levels between control and UC subjects and associations with disease activity and inflammatory cytokines.Dietary histories, serum, and colonic tissue samples were prospectively collected from 137 UC subjects and 38 controls. Both histologic injury and the Mayo Disease Activity Index were assessed. Serum and tissue cytokines were measured by Luminex assay. Serum fatty acids were obtained by gas chromatography.UC subjects had increased total fat and oleic  (OA) intake, but decreased  (AA) intake vs controls. In serum, there was less percent saturated fatty  (SFA) and AA, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), linoleic , OA, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosapentaenoic  (DPA) in UC. Tissue cytokine levels were directly correlated with SFA and inversely correlated with PUFA, EPA, and DPA in UC subjects, but not controls. 5-aminosalicylic  therapy blunted these associations.In summary, we found differences in serum fatty acids in UC subjects that correlated with pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines.

Unexpectedly, we found that transgenic mice globally overexpressing human sPLA2-X (PLA2G10-Tg) displayed striking immunosuppressive and lean phenotypes with lymphopenia and increased M2-like macrophages, accompanied by marked elevation of free ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites.

Recently we reported that one of the serotonin-fatty  conjugates, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), previously found in gut tissue of mouse and pig, attenuates the IL-23-IL-17 signaling axis in LPS-stimulated mice macrophages. However, its presence and effects in humans remained to be elucidated. Here, we report for the first time its identification in human intestinal (colon) tissue, along with a series of related N-acyl serotonins. Furthermore, we tested these fatty  conjugates for their ability to inhibit the release of IL-17 and CCL-20 by stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Serotonin conjugates with palmitic  (PA-5-HT), stearic  (SA-5-HT) and oleic  (OA-5-HT) were detected in higher levels than arachidonoyl serotonin (AA-5-HT) and DHA-5-HT, while eicosapentaenoyl serotonin (EPA-5-HT) could not be quantified. Among these, DHA-5-HT was the most potent in inhibiting IL-17 and CCL-20, typical Th17 pro-inflammatory mediators, by Concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated human PBMCs. These results underline the idea that DHA-5-HT is a gut-specific endogenously produced mediator with the capacity to modulate the IL-17/Th17 signaling response.

These lipid metabolites are involved in prompting and resolving the inflammatory response that leads to the onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to quantify these bioactive lipids in the colonic mucosa and to evaluate the potential link to cytokine gene expression during inflammatory events in ulcerative  (UC).Colon biopsies were taken from 15 treatment-naïve UC patients, 5 deep remission UC patients, and 10 healthy controls. Thirty-five oxylipins and 11 eCBs were quantified by means of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of mRNA for 10 cytokines were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Levels of ω-6-related oxylipins were significantly elevated in treatment-naïve patients with respect to controls, whereas the levels of ω-3 eCBs were lower. 15S-Hydroxy-eicosatrienoic  (15S-HETrE) was significantly upregulated in UC deep remission patients compared with controls. All investigated cytokines had significantly higher mRNA levels in the inflamed mucosa of treatment-naïve UC patients. Cytokine gene expression was positively correlated with several ω-6 -related oxylipins, whereas negative correlation was found with lipoxin, prostacyclin, and the eCBs.Increased levels of ω-6-related oxylipins and decreased levels of ω-3-related eCBs are associated with the debut of UC.

Previous studies showed that termination of inflammation can be achieved by adding pro-resolving lipids like DHA and EPA exogenously. However, the roles of these lipids in mucosal healing have not been investigated. To recapitulate intestinal healing process, mice were received dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days in the drinking water followed by regular tap water for 5 additional days. DSS-induced intestinal inflammation featuring body weight loss, histological tissue damage, increased cytokine production and infiltration of inflammatory cells was gradually reduced upon switching to water. To investigate whether endogenous lipids play a role in mucosal healing, the lipidomics analysis of mouse serum was performed. Reduced levels of , the biosynthetic precursor of prostaglandin F (PGF)2α, 19H-PGF1α, the metabolite of prostacyclin, and 20H-PGF2α, the metabolite of PGF2α, suggest subsiding inflammation. In contrast, increased levels of an active metabolite of resolvin D1 along with decreased levels of its precursor DHA as well as decreased levels of the precursor of resolvin E, 18-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic , suggest inauguration of mucosal healing by endogenous lipids. Furthermore, exogenously supplied fish oil enhanced the process even further. These results suggest the presence of mucosal healing regulated by endogenous pro-healing lipids and also indicate that the remission state of IBD could be prolonged by enhancing the levels of these lipids.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28507038>High-affinity pan-specific monoclonal antibodies that target cysteinyl leukotrienes and show efficacy in an acute model of .</a></h2><p>Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are a small family of biological signaling lipids produced by active leukocytes that contribute to diverse inflammatory disease states as a consequence of their engagement with dedicated G protein-coupled receptors. Immunization of mice with a CysLT-modified hapten carrier protein yielded novel monoclonal antibodies that display variable binding affinity to CysLTs. Solution binding assays indicated differing specificities among the antibodies tested, with antibody 10G4 displaying a preference for leukotriene C (LTC). X-ray crystallography of a humanized 10G4 Fab fragment in complex with LTC revealed that binding induces a hook-like conformation within the hydrocarbon tail of the lipid  moiety. Specific hydrogen bonding to the LTC carboxylate groups further stabilized the complex, while a water molecule mediated a hydrogen bond network that connected the N-terminal arm of l-glutathione to both the arachidonyl carboxylate of LTC and the antibody heavy chain.

A critical PUFA,  (ARA), is metabolized to a diverse set of lipids signaling molecules through cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, or cytochrome P450 hydroxylase; however, the majority of ARA is metabolized into anti-inflammatory epoxides  cytochrome P450 enzymes. These short-lived epoxide lipids are rapidly metabolized or inactivated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) into diol-containing products. sEH inhibition or knockout has been a practical approach to study the biology of the epoxide lipids, and has been shown to effectively treat inflammatory conditions in the preclinical models including gastrointestinal ulcers and  by shifting oxylipins to epoxide profiles, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and activation, and enhancing epithelial cell defense  increased mucin production, thus providing further evidence for the role of sEH as a pro-inflammatory protein.

This study aims to investigate the effects of inhibiting the enzymes responsible for PEA hydrolysis in colon inflammation in order to propose a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Two murine models of IBD were used to assess the effects of NAAA inhibition, FAAH inhibition, and PEA on macroscopic signs of colon inflammation, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of proinflammatory mediators in the colon, as well as on the -related systemic inflammation. NAAA inhibition increases PEA levels in the colon and reduces colon inflammation and systemic inflammation, similarly to PEA. FAAH inhibition, however, does not increase PEA levels in the colon and does not affect the macroscopic signs of colon inflammation or immune cell infiltration.
