There were four treatment groups. Each group of these rats received rice bran (control), the mixture of organisms, L. acidophilus, or S. faecalis (30 g/kg) along with a fat- and cholesterol-enriched diet for 4 wk. The serum total cholesterol concentration of the group fed the mixture of organisms was reduced by 15-33% compared with the other groups at the end of the 4-wk feeding period (P<0.05). The proportion of palmitic  in the serum phosphatidylcholine (PC) for the control group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of  in the serum PC for the mixed-organism group was also significantly higher than those of the other groups. The proportion of  in the liver PC for the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the control and S. faecalis groups. The ratio of /linoleic  was significantly higher in the liver PC of rats fed the mixed organisms compared with the control group (P<0.05). The delta6-desaturase activity in the liver microsomal fraction of the mixed-organism group was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The delta6-desaturase activity correlated positively with the ratio of /linoleic  of liver PC, the correlation coefficient (r) being 0.819 (P<0.001). The results indicate that the effect of the mixture of organisms was to increase delta6-desaturase activity and serum  and decrease cholesterol compared to the other organisms and control, but the mechanism whereby the enzyme activity was related to serum cholesterol does not appear to have been explored.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25019598>Contrasting effects of  and docosahexaenoic  membrane incorporation into cardiomyocytes on free cholesterol turnover.</a></h2><p>The preservation of a constant pool of free cholesterol (FC) is critical to ensure several functions of cardiomyocytes. We investigated the impact of the membrane incorporation of  (C20:4 ω6, AA) or docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 ω3, DHA) as ω6 or ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on cholesterol homeostasis in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. We measured significant alterations to the phospholipid FA profiles, which had markedly different ω6/ω3 ratios between the AA and DHA cells (13 vs. 1). The AA cells showed a 2.7-fold lower cholesterol biosynthesis than the DHA cells. Overall, the AA cells showed 2-fold lower FC masses and 2-fold higher cholesteryl ester masses than the DHA cells. The AA cells had a lower FC to phospholipid ratio and higher triglyceride levels than the DHA cells. Moreover, the AA cells showed a 40% decrease in ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-mediated and a 19% decrease in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux than the DHA cells. The differences in cholesterol efflux pathways induced by AA or DHA incorporation were not caused by variations in ABCs transporter expression and were reduced when ABC transporters were overexpressed by exposure to LXR/RXR agonists. These results show that AA incorporation into cardiomyocyte membranes decreased the FC turnover by markedly decreasing the endogenous cholesterol synthesis and by decreasing the ABCA1- and ABCG1-cholesterol efflux pathways, whereas DHA had the opposite effects. We propose that these observations may partially contribute to the beneficial effects on the heart of a diet containing a high ω3/ω6 PUFA ratio.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There are many studies dealing with the influence of lactobacilli on various pathological conditions, and some of the effects are strain-specific. This study was designed to test the effects of a particular Lactobacillus strain, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LA68 on fatty  composition of the liver and the brain of C57BL/6 mice in the absence of an underlying pathological condition. Female mice were supplemented with live L. rhamnosus LA68 bacteria for the duration of 1 month. Serum biochemistry was analyzed and liver and brain fatty  composition was assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. Significant changes in liver and brain fatty  composition were detected. In the liver tissue we detected an increase in palmitoleic  (p = 0.038), while in the brain compartment we found an increase in palmitic (p = 0.042), stearic (p = 0.017),  (p = 0.009) and docosahexaenoic  (p = 0.004) for control versus experimental group. These results show discrete changes caused by LA68 strain consumption. Even short duration of administration of LA68 influences the fatty  composition of the host which adds to the existing knowledge about Lactobacillus host interaction, and adds to the growing knowledge of metabolic intervention possibilities.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31428172>Study on the Antihypertensive Mechanism of  and  Based on Intestinal Flora-Host Metabolism.</a></h2><p>Our previous studies have shown that the combination of  and  (HD) had a good antihypertensive effect, but its potential mechanism remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of intestinal flora and serum metabolism induced by HD against hypertension. 16 spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) were divided into HD group (5.9 g/kg) and model group (M) (normal saline), with eight Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats as control group (W) (normal saline). Rats were fed by gavage once a day for 28 days. The changes of intestinal flora and serum metabolism were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS assay. HD decreased blood pressure steadily, improved the structure and composition of imbalance flora in SHRs, increased the abundance and diversity of flora, and decreased flora Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio.  sp.  increased remarkably in M group.  and  increased significantly in HD group, which were functionally related to the significant increase of ,  and  in W group, which were all  producing butyric , lactic , and regulating inflammation and other antihypertensive related factors. HD also changed the serum metabolic pattern of SHRs. 16 potential biomarkers related to inflammation, vasodilation, steroid hormones, oxidative stress, and etc. changed significantly, mainly enriched in  metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the dominant genius and species in three groups were highly correlated with steroid hormone biosynthesis,  metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism.

To better understand the molecular underpinnings of SNE on lipid metabolism and explore novel preventative strategies against SNE, we studied the regulatory mechanism of a potential probiotic, Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 on the lipid metabolism pathways involved in chickens with SNE.One hundred eighty one-day-old chickens were randomly divided into three groups and arranged with basal diet (control and SNE group). Added with BS15 (1 × 10 cfu/g) or Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) liquid medium for 28 days. The hepatic gene expression of each group was then measured using high-throughput analysis methods (RNA-Seq). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression changes of the related genes.The results showed that there are eleven lipid metabolic pathways were found during the prevention of BS15 treatment in SNE chickens by RNA-Seq, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and  metabolism. BS15 notably facilitated the expressions of fatty  binding protein 2 (FABP2), acyl-CoA synthetase bubblegum family member 1 (ACSBG1), perilipin 1 (PLIN1) and perilipin 2 (PLIN2), which were involved in PPAR signaling pathway of SNE chickens. Besides, suppression of phospholipase A2 group IVA (PLA2G4A) in  metabolism was observed in SNE chickens after BS15 prevention. The expression patterns of FABP2, ACSBG1, PLIN1, PLIN2 and PLA24G in qRT-PCR validation were consistent with RNA-Seq results.These findings indicate that SNE may affect the hepatic lipid metabolism of chickens.

Thus, it has been postulated that control of lipid mediators production by inhibition of PLA2 would be useful for the treatment of IBD. This hypothesis has been tested in the present study by examining the therapeutic effect of a novel natural probitic Bacillus subtilis PB6 (ATCC- PTA 6737). B. subtilis PB6 is found to secrete surfactins (cyclic lipopeptides) which have anti-bacterial potential. These surfactins inhibit PLA2, a rate-limiting enzyme involved in the  associated inflammatory pathway and could downregulate the inflammatory response by regulating the eicosanoid and cytokine pathways. With this concept, an experimental animal trial has been conducted in a rat model of 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic  (TNBS)-induced colitis. The oral administration of PB6 suppresses the colitis as measured by mortality rate, changes in the weight gain, colon morphology and the levels of plasma cytokines. The animals treated orally with PB6 at 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/kg thrice daily from day 4 to 10 significantly improve gross pathology of the colon and regain the colon weight to normal (p < 0.05), compared to TNBS-induced positive control. The plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, 1L-1beta, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) are also significantly lowered (p < 0.05) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-I0 and TGF-beta) significantly (p < 0.05) increased after the oral administration of PB6 on day 11. The present study supports the concept that PB6 inhibits PLA2 by the secreting surfactins. In a clinical investigation, it is found to be well tolerated by all the healthy volunteers.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14711634>Effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids in growth medium on lipid composition and on physicochemical surface properties of lactobacilli.</a></h2><p>Most probiotic lactobacilli adhere to intestinal surfaces, a phenomenon influenced by free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The present study investigated whether free linoleic , gamma-linolenic , , alpha-linolenic , or docosahexaenoic  in the growth medium alters the fatty  composition of lactobacilli and their physical characteristics. The most abundant bacterial fatty acids identified were oleic, vaccenic, and dihydrosterculic acids. PUFA, especially conjugated linoleic  (CLA) isomers and gamma-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, and alpha-linolenic acids, also were identified in lactobacilli. When lactobacilli were cultured in MRS broth supplemented with various free PUFA, the incorporation of a given PUFA into bacterial fatty acids was clearly observed. Moreover, PUFA supplementation also resulted in PUFA-dependent changes in the proportions of other fatty acids; major interconversions were seen in octadecanoic acids (18:1), their methylenated derivatives (19:cyc), and CLA. Intermittent changes in eicosapentaenoic  proportions also were noted. These results were paralleled by minor changes in the hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of lactobacilli, suggesting that PUFA interfere with microbial adhesion to intestinal surfaces through other mechanisms. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that free PUFA in the growth medium induce changes in bacterial fatty acids in relation to the regulation of the degree of fatty  unsaturation, cyclization, and proportions of CLA and PUFA containing 20 to 22 carbons. The potential role of lactobacilli as regulators of PUFA absorption may represent another means by which  could redirect the delicate balance of inflammatory mediators derived from PUFA within the inflamed intestine.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22308941>Increase of plasma fatty acids without changes in n-6/n-3-PUFA ratio in asymptomatic obese subjects.</a></h2><p>Obesity is associated with a low grade inflammation which contributes to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes.

When it comes to health care, innovations, though they may be something 'new', may not be beneficial if not demonstrated to be an improvement over what is current practice. Innovations in pediatric nutrition sometimes fall into this category. The establishment of safe water and milk supplies at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries is viewed as one of the greatest advances in preventative medicine and truly was an 'innovation', with its dramatic impact on infant mortality. Other innovations in pediatric nutrition included the development of the caloric method of infant feeding which led to the large-scale adoption of a single infant formula. This required cooperation with industry and ultimately led to the development of life-saving specialty formulas for various disease states including inborn errors of metabolism. Over the last 50 years there have been further modifications of term infant formula that have included taurine, carnitine, nucleotides, whey proteins, PUFAs including decosahexenoic  (DHA) and , , and prebiotics. Many of these additions are of questionable benefit and are questioned as true innovations. Though the addition of novel nutrients to infant formula has been an area of great interest, more basic research (including randomized controlled trial) is needed to determine many pediatric nutrient requirements including the lower and upper limits of nutrients added to infant formula. Such research could be facilitated by institutions such as the US National Institute of Child Health whose establishment in 1962 was a significant 'innovation' as it led to advances in pediatric nutritional research. Much more research is needed to determine basic pediatric nutritional requirements and pediatricians should strive for such true innovations.Copyright © 2010 S.

Colonic epithelial and CD90 mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as (myo) fibroblasts (CMFs), are abundant innate immune cells in normal colonic mucosa able to produce PGE . Herein, we tested the hypothesis that under colonic mucosal homeostasis, LbGG modulates the eicosanoid pathway resulting in increased PGE production in both epithelial and stromal cells. Among the five tested human colonic epithelial cell lines, only exposure of Caco-2 to LbGG for 24 hr led to the mobilisation of  with concomitant increase in the components within the leukotriene and COX-2-dependent PGE pathways.

Oral gavage of C57BL/6 mice for 5 days with LbGG (5 × 10 Colony-Forming Unit (CFU)/dose) increased COX-2 expression in the colonic mucosa. The majority of cells upregulating COX-2 protein expression were located in the colonic lamina propria and colocalised with α-SMA cells corresponding to the CMF phenotype. This process was myeloid differentiation factor-88-dependent, because silencing of myeloid differentiation factor-88 expression in CMFs abrogated LbGG-induced upregulation of COX-2 in culture and in vivo.

DHA and AA concentrations were higher in infants in the experimental formula group compared with the control formula group. No influence of the supplements on the response to vaccines was observed. Growth characteristics of term infants fed the starter formula containing a probiotic and LC-PUFA were similar to standard formula-fed infants.</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17555043>Effect on the immune system of germ-free piglets of  potentiated with polyunsaturated fatty acids.</a></h2><p>The present study investigated the influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on the immune system of germ-free piglets. Oil with increased content of omega-3 PUFA was administered to piglets from the experimental group (EG) for four weeks. Piglets from the control group (CG) received identical volumes of saline solution. At the age of 21 days both groups of germ-free piglets were inoculated perorally with Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei at a dose of 2 ml (1x10(8) mli). At the age of 28 days, i.e. after one-week colonisation of germ-free piglets with Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, significant differences were recorded in phagocytic activity of neutrophils (PANe) and phagocytic activity of potentially phagocytizing cells (PA) (P < 0.05). Between EG and CG there have been observed no significant differences in absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and numbers of IgM cells and in additional investigated parameters - number of CD2+ T lymphocytes, index of phagocytic activity of neutrophils (IPANe) and index of phagocytic activity (IPA). The total number of leukocytes (Le) in EG was also higher. Of the parameters determined in blood serum we observed a significant increase in concentration of alpha linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids and a parallel decrease in the level of .</p><p>Keyword: probiotics</p></html>
