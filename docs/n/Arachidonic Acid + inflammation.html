This study elucidated the mechanisms contributing to tumor development induced by the HBV X (HBx) gene of predominantly Asian genotype B HBV and its common HBx variants. To compare the potential tumorigenic effects of K130M/V131I (Mut) and wild-type (WT) HBx on HCC, the  () transposon system was used to deliver HBx Mut and WT into the livers of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ()-deficient mice and in the context of  () deficiency. From our results, HBx Mut had a stronger tumorigenic effect than its WT variant. Also, , necrosis, and fibrosis were evident in HBx experimental animals. Reduction of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) with increased phosphorylation of upstream serine/threonine kinase (AKT) was detected under HBx Mut overexpression. Thus, it is proposed that HBx Mut enhances disease progression by reducing FOXO1 via phosphorylation of AKT. At the metabolomic level, HBx altered the expression of genes that participated in  (AA) metabolism, as a result of  via accumulation of proinflammatory factors such as prostaglandins and leukotriene in liver. Taken together, the increased rate of HCC observed in chronic hepatitis B patients with K130M/V131I-mutated X protein, may be due to changes in AA metabolism and AKT/FOXO1 signaling. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggested that HBx-K130M/V131I-mutant variant promoted HCC progression by activating AKT/FOXO1 pathway and inducing stronger  in liver via AA metabolism.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899221>Development of an Optimized LC-MS Method for the Detection of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators in Biological Samples.</a></h2><p>The cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3 PUFA) are believed to be partly mediated by their oxygenated metabolites (oxylipins). In the last two decades interest in a novel group of autacoids termed specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) increased. These are actively involved in the resolution of . SPMs are multiple hydroxylated fatty acids including resolvins, maresins, and protectins derived from the n3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) as well as lipoxins derived from  (ARA). In the present paper, we developed an LC-MS/MS method for a comprehensive set of 18 SPMs derived from ARA, EPA, and DHA and integrated it into our targeted metabolomics platform. Quantification was based on external calibration utilizing five deuterated internal standards in combination with a second internal standard for quality assessment of sample preparation in each sample. The tandem mass spectrometric parameters were carefully optimized for sensitive and specific detection. The influence of source parameters of the used AB Sciex 6500 QTRAP instrument as well as electronic parameters and the selection of transitions are discussed. The method was validated/characterized based on the criteria listed in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline on bioanalytical method validation and method performance is demonstrated regarding recovery of internal standards (between 78 ± 4% and 87 ± 3% from 500 μL of human serum) as well as extraction efficacy of SPMs in spiked plasma (intra-day accuracy within ±20 and ±15% at 0.1 and 0.3 nM in plasma, respectively). Based on the lower limit of quantification of 0.02-0.2 nM, corresponding to 0.18-2.7 pg on column, SPMs were generally not detectable/quantifiable in plasma and serum supporting that circulating levels of SPMs are very low, i.e., <0.1 nM in healthy subjects. Following septic shock or peritonitis, SPMs could be quantified in the samples of several patients. However, in these studies with a small number of patients no clear correlation with severity of  could be observed.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191316>Dimethyl Sulfoxide Decreases Levels of Oxylipin Diols in Mouse Liver.</a></h2><p>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as a solvent and cryopreservative in laboratories and considered to have many beneficial health effects in humans. Oxylipins are a class of biologically active metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that have been linked to a number of diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMSO on oxylipin levels in mouse liver. Liver tissue from male mice (C57Bl6/N) that were either untreated or injected with 1% DMSO at 18 weeks of age was analyzed for oxylipin levels using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A decrease in oxylipin diols from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n6), alpha-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3n3) and docosahexeanoic  (DHA, C22:6n3) was observed 2 h after injection with DMSO. In contrast, DMSO had no effect on the epoxide precursors or other oxylipins including those derived from  (C20:4n6) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n3). It also did not significantly affect the diol:epoxide ratio, suggesting a pathway distinct from, and potentially complementary to, soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI). Since oxylipins have been associated with a wide array of pathological conditions, from arthritis pain to obesity, our results suggest one potential mechanism underlying the apparent beneficial health effects of DMSO. They also indicate that caution should be used in the interpretation of results using DMSO as a vehicle in animal experiments.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30445106>Tabernaemontana catharinensis leaves exhibit topical anti-inflammatory activity without causing toxicity.</a></h2><p>Tabernaemontana catharinensis, popularly known as snake skin, has been empirically used as an anti-inflammatory to treat cutaneous skin disorders. However, no study proves its effectiveness as a topical anti-inflammatory.We investigated the topical anti-inflammatory effect of T.catharinensis leaves crude extract (TcE) in irritant contact dermatitis models in mice and its preliminary toxicity profile.The topical anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by ear thickness measurement, inflammatory cell infiltration (MPO activity measurement and histological procedure) and cytokines levels. TcE qualitative phytochemical analysis was performed by UHPLC-ESI-HRMS and the TcE effect (therapeutic dose; 10 µg/ear) on preliminary toxicological parameters was also evaluated (on the 14° day of experiment).TcE (10 μg/ear) prevented the development of ear edema induced by cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin, , phenol, and croton oil with maximum inhibition of 100% to cinnamaldehyde, , phenol, and croton oil and 75 ± 6% to capsaicin. Besides, the TcE (10 μg/ear) also prevented the increase of MPO activity by 96 ± 2%, 48 ± 7%, 100%, 87 ± 8%, and 93 ± 4%, respectively, to the same irritant agents. The positive controls also prevented both ear edema and the increased of MPO activity by 100% and 42 ± 8% (HC-030031), 54 ± 6% and 80 ± 4% (SB-366791), 100% and 54 ± 5% (indomethacin), 100% and 80 ± 4% (dexamethasone in skin  model induced by phenol) and 100% and 97 ± 3% (dexamethasone in  model induced by croton oil), respectively. TcE also prevented the inflammatory cells infiltration and the increase of MIP-2, IL-1β and TNF-α levels irritant agents-induced. TcE topical anti-inflammatory effect may be attributed to the combined effect of indole alkaloids, terpenes, and phenolic compounds found in the extract and identified by dereplication method. The TcE' therapeutic dose proved to be safe in preliminary toxicological tests.Our results suggest that TcE could be an interesting strategy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Besides anti-oxidative effects, anti-inflammatory properties have been suggested as molecular modes of action, which may result from modulations of the  (AA) cascade. Here, we investigated the effects of a library of food polyphenols on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity in a cell-free assay, and in human neutrophils. Resveratrol, its dimer (ε-viniferin), and its imine analogue (IRA) potently blocked the 5-LOX-mediated LT formation in neutrophils with IC values in low μM-range. Among the tested flavonoids only the isoflavone genistein showed potent 5-LOX inhibition in neutrophils (IC = 0.4 ± 0.1 μM), however was ineffective on isolated 5-LOX. We exclude an interference with the 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP) in HEK_5-LOX/±FLAP cells and suggest global effects on intact immune cells. Using LC-MS based targeted oxylipin metabolomics, we analyzed the effects of 5-LOX-inhibiting polyphenols on all branches of the AA cascade in Ca-ionophore-challenged neutrophils. While ε-viniferin causes a clear substrate shunt towards the remaining AA cascade enzymes (15-LOX, cyclooxygenase - COX-1/2, cytochrome P450), resveratrol inhibited the COX-1/2 pathway and showed a weak attenuation of 12/15-LOX activity. IRA had no impact on 15-LOX activity, but elevated the formation of COX-derived prostaglandins, having no inhibitory effects on COX-1/2. Overall, we show that food polyphenols have the ability to block 5-LOX activity and the oxylipin pattern is modulated with a remarkable compound/structural specificity. Taken the importance of polyphenols for a healthy diet and their concentration in food supplements into account, this finding justifies further investigation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Models for two to six profiles were compared using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. Associations between AIx and the profiles were adjusted for age, sex, disease activity, fish oil supplementation, medications, physical activity and socio-economic status.

In the present study, we have used flow cytometry to evaluate the ability of oxidized PAPE (OxPAPE) and PAPS (OxPAPS) to promote or suppress an inflammatory phenotype on monocytes subsets and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). The results indicate that OxPAPE increases the frequency of all monocyte subpopulations expressing TNF-α, which promotes an inflammatory response. However, immune cell stimulation with OxPAPE in the presence of LPS results in a decrease of TNF-α expressed by classical monocytes. Incubation with OxPAPS and LPS induces a decrease in TNF-α produced by monocytes, and a significant decrease in IL-1β expressed by monocytes and mDCs, indicating that OxPAPS reduces the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory expression in these populations.

Hepoxilin A production was determined by Western blot identification of 12-lipoxygenase precursor (12-LO).  Chlamydial infection induced increased production of IL-2, IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in BAL fluid compared to uninfected animals. -infected mice responded with robust airway neutrophil infiltration and upon induction of AAD increased their production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by >3 fold compared to unsensitized groups. In addition, 12-LO mRNA was upregulated in infected, but not in uninfected AAD mice, suggesting the production of hepoxilin A. mRNA expression of HDC was induced only in neutrophils from the airways of -infected mice, but was not seen in AAD only or uninfected controls. When purified neutrophils from infected animals were challenged with chlamydial antigen  there was significant histamine release.  Our data confirms the production and release of hepoxilin A in the murine airways concomitant with airway neutrophilia in response to chlamydial infection.

The concept that stroke is a disorder solely of blood vessels has been expanded to include the effects of a detrimental interaction between glia, neurons, vascular cells, and matrix components, which is collectively referred to as the neurovascular unit. Following the acute stroke, the majority of which are ischemic, there is secondary neuroinflammation that both promotes further injury, resulting in cell death, but conversely plays a beneficial role, by promoting recovery. The proinflammatory signals from immune mediators rapidly activate resident cells and influence infiltration of a wide range of inflammatory cells (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, different subtypes of T cells, and other inflammatory cells) into the ischemic region exacerbating brain damage. In this review, we discuss how neuroinflammation has both beneficial as well as detrimental roles and recent therapeutic strategies to combat pathological responses. Here, we also focus on time-dependent entry of immune cells to the ischemic area and the impact of other pathological mediators, including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),  metabolites, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and post-translational modifications that could potentially perpetuate ischemic brain damage after the acute injury.

Maternal vitamin D deficiency resulted in lower total weight gain and placental weight (p < 0.05 for both) during pregnancy. Animals from VDD group demonstrated higher  (AA) levels in both the liver and plasma (p < 0.05 for both) as compared to control. Liver, plasma and placental monounsaturated fatty  levels (MUFA) were lower (p < 0.01 for all) while plasma total saturated fatty acids (SFA) (p = 0.05) were higher in the VDD group. Animals from the VDD group demonstrated lower ∆9-desaturase activity index (p < 0.01 for all) in the liver, plasma and placenta. The plasma ∆5-desaturase activity index (p < 0.05) was higher although no change was observed in the ∆6-desaturase activity index. However, the mRNA levels of liver ∆6-desaturase was lower (p < 0.05) in the VDD group. Our findings indicate that maternal vitamin D deficiency influences fatty  desaturase activity and expression and therefore alters maternal fatty  metabolism.Copyright © 2018.

Here, the anti-inflammatory effects of the AVX001 and AVX002 cPLA2α inhibitors were investigated.In vitro enzyme activity was assessed by a modified Dole assay. Effects on inhibiting IL-1β-induced release of  (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured using SW982 synoviocyte cells. In vivo effects were studied in prophylactic and therapetic murine collagen-induced arthritis models and compared to methotrexate (MTX) and Enbrel, commonly used anti-rheumatic drugs. The in vivo response to treatment was evaluated in terms of the arthritis index (AI), histopathology scores and by plasma levels of PGE2 following 14 and 21 days of treatment.Both cPLA2α inhibitors are potent inhibitors of cPLA2α in vitro. In synoviocytes, AVX001 and AVX002 reduce, but do not block, release of AA or PGE2 synthesis. In both CIA models, the AI and progression of arthritis were significantly lower in the mice treated with AVX001, AVX002, Enbrel and MTX than in non- treated mice. Several histopathology parameters of joint damage were found to be significantly reduced by AVX001 and AVX002 in both prophylactic and therapeutic study modes; namely articular cavity and peripheral tissue inflammatory cell infiltration; capillary and synovial hyperplasia; articular cartilage surface damage; and periostal and endochondral ossification. In comparison, MTX did not significantly improve any histopathology parameters and Enbrel only improved ossification. Finally, as a biomarker of  and as an indication that AVX001 and AVX002 blocked the cPLA2α target, we determined that plasma levels of PGE2 were significantly reduced in response to the AVX inhibitors and MTX, but not Enbrel.AVX001 and AVX002 display potent anti-inflammatory activity and disease-modifying properties in cellular and in vivo models. The in vivo effects of AVX001 and AVX002 were comparable to, or superior, to those of MTX and Enbrel. Taken together, this study suggests that cPLA2α inhibitors AVX001 and AVX002 are promising small molecule disease-modifying anti-rheumatic therapies.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30489335>Heterogeneity of NSAID-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease: has the time come for subphenotyping?</a></h2><p>NSAID-Exacerbated Disease (N-ERD) is a chronic eosinophilic inflammatory disorder of the respiratory tract occurring in patients with asthma and/or rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, whose symptoms are exacerbated by NSAIDs. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management of N-ERD, and to emphasize heterogeneity of this syndrome.Growing evidence indicates that N-ERD, which has been considered a separate asthma phenotype, is heterogenous, and can be divided in several subphenotypes varying in clinical characteristics. Pathophysiology of N-ERD is complex and extends beyond abnormalities in the  metabolism. Heterogeneity of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying development of airway  seems to be associated with variability in response to both anti-inflammatory and disease-specific treatments (e.g., with aspirin after desensitization).Progress in understanding of the pathophysiology of N-ERD leads to discovery and validation of new biomarkers facilitating diagnosis and predicting the response to treatment of the chronic  underlying upper (CRSwNP) and lower airway (asthma) symptoms. Better characterization of the immunophysiopathological heterogeneity of N-ERD (identification of endotypes) may allow more personalized, endotype-driven approach to treatment in the future.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591069>Current state and future prospect of the therapeutic strategy targeting cysteinyl leukotriene metabolism in asthma.</a></h2><p>Asthma is an allergic disorder with dominant type 2 airway , and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Inhalation of corticosteroids is the primary treatment for asthma along with add-on drugs, including long-acting β2 agonists and/or cysteinyl leukotriene (cys-LT) receptor antagonists, in patients with poorly controlled asthma. Cys-LTs are composed of leukotriene C4 (LTC), LTD, and LTE, which are enzymatically metabolized from . These molecules act as inflammatory mediators through different types of high-affinity receptors, namely, CysLT, CysLT, and CysLT (also named as GPR99). CysLT antagonists possessing anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects can be orally administered to patients with asthma. Recently, molecular biology-based studies have revealed the mechanism of inflammatory responses via other receptors, such as CysLT and CysLT, as well as the importance of upstream inflammatory regulators, including type 2 cytokines (e.g., interleukins 4 and 5), in controlling cys-LT metabolism. These findings indicate the therapeutic potential of pharmacological agents targeting cys-LT metabolism-related receptors and enzymes, and antibody drugs neutralizing or antagonizing type 2 cytokines.

Human macrophages express two  (AA) 15-lipoxygenating enzymes classified as ALOX15 and ALOX15B. ALOX15, which was first described in 1975, has been extensively characterized and its biological functions have been investigated in a number of cellular systems and animal models. In macrophages, ALOX15 functions to generate specific phospholipid (PL) oxidation products crucial for orchestrating the nonimmunogenic removal of apoptotic cells (ACs) as well as synthesizing precursor lipids required for production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that facilitate  resolution. The discovery of ALOX15B in 1997 was followed by comprehensive analyses of its structural properties and reaction specificities with PUFA substrates. Although its enzymatic properties are well described, the biological functions of ALOX15B are not fully understood. In contrast to ALOX15 whose expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages is strictly dependent on Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, ALOX15B is constitutively expressed.

Overexpression of ApoD in mouse neural tissue induces the development of a non-inflammatory hepatic steatosis in 12-month-old transgenic animals.

The earliest modulation of lipid metabolism and  occurred at 6 months with a transient overexpression of L-PGDS and concomitant overproduction of 15d-PGJ, a PPARγ agonist. Hepatic lipid accumulation was detectable as soon as 9 months. Inflammatory polarization balance varied in time, with a robust anti-inflammatory profile at 6 months coinciding with 15d-PGJ overproduction. Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were preferentially stored in the liver of 12-month-old transgenic mice and resulted in a higher omega-3/omega-6 ratio compared to wild type mice of the same age. Thus,  seems to be controlled by several mechanisms in the liver of transgenic mice: first by an increase in 15d-PGJ production and later by a beneficial omega-3/omega-6 ratio. PPARγ seems to play important roles in these processes. The accumulation of several omega fatty acids species in the transgenic mouse liver suggests that ApoD might bind to a broader range of fatty acids than previously thought.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, studies report anti-inflammatory activity in its essential oil (EORO). However, to better understand EORO's anti-inflammatory activity its necessary to understand its phytochemistry and the signaling pathways affected by it. Hence, this review aimed to describe EORO phytochemical profile, ethnopharmacological uses, some biological activities of EORO will be described but emphasizing its anti-inflammatory potential and possible mechanisms of action involved.The research was performed using the databases Medline, Embase, BVS Regional Portal, Science Direct, CAPES Journals, and Scopus; using the keywords "Rosmarinus officinalis", "anti-inflammatory" and "essential oil". Additional information was gathered from related textbooks, reviews, and documents.Until now about 150 chemical compounds were identified in EORO samples, more frequently reported molecules were 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, and camphor. Studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of EORO occur mainly through inhibition of NF-κB transcription and suppression of  cascade. Its antioxidant activity also aids by preventing injury caused by the reactive species of ; its smooth muscle relaxant activity contributes to ameliorating airway inflammatory diseases. Lastly, toxicity assessments indicate low toxicity to EORO.Current evidence indicates anti-inflammatory activity in EORO, supporting its ethnopharmacological uses in inflammatory-related diseases, and potential future applications. However, although considerable acute inflammatory models were tested, more chronic inflammatory models are needed; clinical studies are still absent, this may be due to the high doses needed for essential oils to exert pharmacological effects, but recent studies show this issue can be bypassed using the oil formulated as nanoemulsions to improve its bioavailability.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Expression of COX-2 and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) are elevated in allergic airways and their enzymatic products (e.g., prostaglandins and diols of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, respectively) have been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of AAI. Here, we evaluated the outcome of inhibiting the COX-2 and sEH enzymatic pathways with a novel dual inhibitor, PTUPB, in -induced AAI. Allergen-challenged mice were administered with 10 or 30 mg/kg of PTUPB, celecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor), -TUCB (selective sEH inhibitor) or vehicle daily by gavage and evaluated for various features of AAI. PTUPB and -TUCB at 30 mg/kg, but not celecoxib, inhibited eosinophilic infiltration and significantly increased levels of anti-inflammatory EETs in the lung tissue of allergen-challenged mice. -TUCB significantly inhibited allergen-induced IL-4 and IL-13, while a less pronounced reduction was noted with PTUPB and celecoxib. Additionally, -TUCB markedly inhibited eotaxin-2, an eosinophil-specific chemokine, which was only marginally reduced by PTUPB and remained elevated in celecoxib-treated mice. PTUPB or -TUCB administration reversed allergen-induced reduction in levels of various lipid mediators in the lungs, with only a minimal effect noted with celecoxib. Despite the anti-inflammatory effects, PTUPB or -TUCB did not reduce allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). However, development of structural changes in the allergic airways, such as mucus hypersecretion and smooth muscle hypertrophy, was significantly inhibited by both inhibitors. Celecoxib, on the other hand, inhibited only airway smooth muscle hypertrophy, but not mucus hypersecretion. In conclusion, dual inhibition of COX-2 and sEH offers no additional advantage relative to sEH inhibition alone in attenuating various features associated with -induced AAI, while COX-2 inhibition exerts only moderate or no effect on several of these features.

Prostaglandin (PG) E2, an  (AA)-derived lipid mediator, and its receptor subtype EP1 mediate depression-like behavior induced by repeated social defeat stress through attenuating prefrontal dopaminergic activity. Repeated social defeat stress activates microglia through innate immune receptors, and induces PGE2 synthesis through cyclooxygenase-1, a prostaglandin synthase enriched in microglia. PGD2, another AA-derived lipid mediator, has been implicated in depression induced by chronic stress, although either pro-depressive or anti-depressive actions have been reported. Chronic stress up-regulates hippocampal expression of 5-lipoxygenase, hence synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, thereby inducing depression through their receptors. Consistent with beneficial effects of n-3 fatty acids in the diet of depressive patients, resolvins-a novel class of pro-resolving lipid mediators-in the brain attenuate neuroinflammation-associated depression.

However, they have the potential to cause serious complications, such as gastrointestinal (GI) lesions, bleeding and cardiovascular (CV) problems. NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic actions by inhibiting the cyclooxygenases (COX)-1 and COX-2, key enzymes of the  (AA) cascade. However, not all the AA products or their receptors are pro-inflammatory. Therefore, given the multifaceted interactions of these lipid mediators where a single precursor can trigger multiple events with synergic or opposed function, it is easy to predict that any perturbation of this interplay will cause several unavoidable side effects. Today, we do not have a truly safe NSAID that minimizes GI damage and CV toxicity. One possibility to interfere with this intricate network, while trying to keep its fine balance, is to develop molecules affecting several targets. Different strategies have been proposed for a multitargeted intervention at different levels of the AA cascade, like inhibition of multiple upstream enzymes, such as COX, 5-lipoxygenase, or even soluble epoxide hydrolase and prostaglandin E synthase. Alternative strategies are more focused in the inhibition of targets downstream in the metabolic pathway, such as thromboxane synthase and/or blocking selective receptors.

The relationship between atherosclerosis and risk of neurodegeneration has been established, in particular with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Systemic atherosclerosis increases the risk of VCID by inducing cerebral infarction, or through systemic or local inflammatory factors that underlie both atherosclerosis and cognition. Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are involved in inflammatory processes, but with opposite roles.

Experimental studies and some clinical trials have demonstrated that omega-3 PUFA supplementation may reduce the risk of different phenotypes of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

Oligodendrocytes are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which populate the adult central nervous system, but their physiological capability to myelin synthesis is limited. The low intake of essential lipids for sphingomyelin synthesis in the human diet may account for increased demyelination and the reduced efficiency of the remyelination process. In our study on lipid profiling in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis brain, we revealed that during acute , nervonic  synthesis is silenced, which is the effect of shifting the lipid metabolism pathway of common substrates into proinflammatory  production. In the experiments on the human model of maturating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (hOPCs) in vitro, we demonstrated that fish oil mixture (FOM) affected the function of hOPCs, resulting in the improved synthesis of myelin basic protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and proteolipid protein, as well as sphingomyelin. Additionally, FOM reduces proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and enhances fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis by hOPCs was also demonstrated.

A recent genome-wide association study identified a locus in the fatty  desaturase (FADS) gene cluster conferring susceptibility to BD. In this study, we examined PUFA levels in patients with BD in relation to proinflammatory cytokines, FADS genotype, and dietary habits. We enrolled 83 patients with BD and 217 healthy controls who underwent plasma PUFA measurement. A subsample of 65 patients and 90 controls underwent plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) measurement, and three FADS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. Information on fish consumption was obtained by a self-reported diet history questionnaire. In comparing PUFA levels between patients and controls, significant differences were found for all 7 PUFAs tested. Specifically, n-3 eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) level was decreased, and n-6  level was increased in the patients (p < 0.0001 for both). Plasma IL-6 and TNFα levels were both significantly increased in the patients. Plasma EPA level was negatively correlated with IL-6 and TNFα levels. The FADS genotype, which was associated with increased n-6 PUFA levels, was also associated with marked elevation in TNFα levels. Less frequent fish intake was associated with low EPA and high IL-6 level. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for altered plasma PUFA and proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with BD. Furthermore, FADS genotype and fish consumption may contribute not only to altered PUFA levels but also to  in BD.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334399>IL-33 mediates allergy through mast cell activation: Potential inhibitory effect of certain cytokines.</a></h2><p>Mast cells (MCs) are hematopoietic immune cells commonly found in adjacent to blood vessels in the lamina propria of airway mucosa. They are important in allergic reactions since the cross-linking of their surface high affinity receptor FceRI induces activation of these cells, and provokes the synthesis, degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators including -derived eicosanoids (de novo synthesized), stored enzyme mediators, and inflammatory TH1 and TH2 cytokines, and chemokines. Interleukin (IL)-33 participates in innate and adaptive immunity and  and, acting on CD34+ cells, causes MC differentiation and maturation. IL-33 is generated by activated immune cells, and activates MCs which degranulate and release pro-inflammatory mediators. IL-33 is very important in mediating allergic  and can be induced by IL-1 beta. It is also called "alarmin" and is an inflammatory cytokine IL-1 family member, expressed from mocytes and MCs, which binds its receptor ST2, provoking its release after cell damage. MC-derived allergic compounds in response to IL-33 is critical to innate type 2 immunity. IL-37 is expressed by immune and non-immune cells after pro-inflammatory stimulus. IL-37, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, binds IL-18Ra and suppresses pro-inflammatory IL-1 beta released by activated immune cells such as macrophages. Here, we hypothesize that pro-inflammatory IL-1 family member cytokines released by activated MCs, mediating inflammatory allergic phenomenon, can be suppressed by IL-37.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30392748>Metabolomics study of the hepatoprotective effect of Phellinus igniarius in chronic ethanol-induced liver injury mice using UPLC-Q/TOF-MS combined with ingenuity pathway analysis.</a></h2><p>Phellinus igniarius (L.)

The levels of serum biomarkers were detected by an automatic biochemistry analyser. The histopathological changes of liver were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) was applied for investigating the dynamic changes of serum metabolites in chronic ethanol-induced liver injury mice and after treatment with PID. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was employed to identify the potential target of PID.PID could significantly reduce the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG) and total bile  (TBA) in serum and improved hepatic steatosis and . In terms of metabolism, a total of 36 serum differential metabolites were identified, and PID intervention regulated 24 of them, involving the key metabolic pathways such as the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, primary bile  biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acids biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism and  metabolism. On the mechanism, IPA showed that farnesol X receptor (FXR) was the major potential target for PID, and PID could improve chronic alcohol intake induced by the inhibition of mRNA expression of FXR in the liver and the activation of mRNA expression of FXR in the intestine in mice.The present study for the first time systematically illustrated the hepatoprotective effect of P. igniarius and preliminarily explored its potential target FXR.

Intimal infiltration and modification of plasma-derived lipoproteins and their uptake mainly by macrophages, with ensuing formation of lipid-filled foam cells, initiate atherosclerotic lesion formation, and deficient efferocytotic removal of apoptotic cells and foam cells sustains lesion progression. Defective efferocytosis, as a sign of inadequate  resolution, leads to accumulation of secondarily necrotic macrophages and foam cells and the formation of an advanced lesion with a necrotic lipid core, indicative of plaque vulnerability.

Their essentiality is largely due to their function as prostaglandin (PG) precursors. I spent most of my career in biochemistry determining how PG biosynthesis is regulated. PGs are lipid mediators formed in response to certain circulating hormones and cytokines. PGs act near their sites of synthesis to signal neighboring cells to coordinate their responses ( when platelets interact with blood vessels). The committed step in PG synthesis is the conversion of a 20-carbon omega-6 fatty  called  to prostaglandin endoperoxide H (PGH). Depending on the tissue and the hormone or cytokine stimulus, this reaction is catalyzed by either cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-1 or COX-2). Once formed, PGH is converted, again depending on the context, to one of several downstream PG subtypes that act via specific G protein-coupled receptors. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) block PG synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 is also inhibited by COX-2-selective inhibitors. Inhibition of COX-1 by low-dose aspirin prevents thrombosis. COX-2 inhibition reduces  and pain. Investigating the mysteries of COXs anchored my scientific career.

In this study, an analytical method based on bio-affinity ultrafiltration coupled with ultra performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (BAUF-UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was established for rapidly screening and identifying COX-2 ligands. Meanwhile, the specificity of the method was verified by denatured COX-2 and inactive compound. Next, the biological activity of ligands screened was proved by enzyme inhibition assay. The preferred binding modes for these COX-2 inhibitors were then determined by molecular docking. Finally, network pharmacology was used to explore the pathways involved anti-inflammatory effects. As a result, five COX-2 inhibitors were selected in the extract of Andrographis Herba (AH), including andrographolide (1), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographiside (2), andrographidine E (3), andrographidine D (4), and deoxyandrographolide (5).

These products are precursors for different lipid mediators which are associated with pathogenesis of various diseases such as asthma, atherosclerosis and cancer. Several LOXs suffer from substrate inhibition, a potential regulatory mechanism, yet it is unclear what is the cause of this phenomenon. One such enzyme is the coral 11R-LOX which displays a significant decrease in turnover rate at  concentrations above 30 μM. In this report, site-directed mutagenesis and inhibition assays were employed to shed light on the mechanism of substrate inhibition in 11R-LOX. We found that introduction of a positive charge to the active site entrance with Gly188Arg substitution completely eliminates the slow-down at higher substrate concentrations. Inhibition of 11R-LOX by its catalysis product, 11(R)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic , suggests an uncompetitive mechanism. We reason that substrate inhibition in 11R-LOX is due to additional fatty  binding by the enzyme:substrate complex at an allosteric site situated in the very vicinity of the active site entrance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX-2 inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-2, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET).

Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-2 metabolism in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET.

NOX2 is the enzyme responsible for a huge superoxide formation in macrophages, essential to eliminate pathogens inside the phagosome. The oxidase is an enzymatic complex comprised of a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b  (gp91/p22), three cytosolic subunits (p47, p40 and p67) and a Rac-GTPase. The enzyme becomes active when macrophages are exposed to appropriate stimuli that trigger the phosphorylation of cytosolic subunits and its migration to plasmatic membrane to form the active complex. It is proposed that AA stimulates NOX2 activity through AA interaction with different components of the NADPH oxidase complex. In inflammatory conditions, there is an increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that results in the production of nitrated derivatives of AA, such as nitroarachidonic  (NO-AA). NO-AA is capable to inhibit NOX2 activity by interfering with p47 migration to the membrane without affecting phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins. Also, NO-AA is capable to interact with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is involved on NOX2 active complex formation. It has been demonstrated that NO-AA forms a covalent adduct with PDI that could prevent the interaction with NOX2 and it would explain the inhibitory effects of the fatty  upon NOX2. Together, current data indicate that AA is an important activator of NOX2 formed in the early events of the inflammatory response, leading to a massive production of oxidants that may, in turn, promote NO-AA formation and shutting down the oxidative burst.

We aimed to define SHSe's impact on  mediators and infection in children with CF.Seventy-seven children with CF <10 years of age 35 infants <1 year; 42 children 1-10 years) were enrolled and hair nicotine concentrations measured as an objective surrogate of SHSe. AA signalling by serum and macrophage lipidomics,  using blood transcriptional profiles and in vitro macrophage responses to bacterial infection after SHSe were assessed.Hair nicotine concentrations were elevated in 63% of patients. Of the AA metabolites measured by plasma lipidomics, prostaglandin D (PGD) concentrations were decreased in children with CF exposed to SHSe, and associated with more frequent hospitalisations (p=0.007) and worsened weight z scores (p=0.008). Children with CF exposed to SHSe demonstrated decreased expression of the prostaglandin genes PTGES3 and PTGR2 and overexpression of inflammatory pathways. These findings were confirmed using an in vitro model, where SHSe was associated with a dose-dependent decrease in PGD and increased methicillin-resistant  survival in human CF macrophages.Infants and young children with CF and SHSe have altered AA metabolism and dysregulated inflammatory gene expression resulting in impaired bacterial clearance. Our findings identified potential therapeutic targets to halt early disease progression associated with SHSe in the young population with CF.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The dietary supplement palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Here, we investigated the effect of prophylactic PEA on the early immune response, clinical course, and survival of old mice after intracerebral  K1 infection. Nineteen-month-old wild type mice were treated intraperitoneally with two doses of either 0.1 mg PEA/kg in 250 μl vehicle solution ( = 19) or with 250 μl vehicle solution only as controls ( = 19), 12 h and 30 min prior to intracerebral  K1 infection. The intraperitoneal route was chosen to reduce distress in mice and to ensure exact dosing. Survival time, bacterial loads in cerebellum, blood, spleen, liver, and microglia counts and activation scores in the brain were evaluated. We measured the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, and CXCL1 in cerebellum and spleen, as well as of bioactive lipids in serum in PEA- and vehicle-treated animals 24 h after infection. In the absence of antibiotic therapy, the median survival time of PEA-pre-treated infected mice was prolonged by 18 h compared to mice of the vehicle-pre-treated infected group ( = 0.031). PEA prophylaxis delayed the onset of clinical symptoms ( = 0.037). This protective effect was associated with lower bacterial loads in the spleen, liver, and blood compared to those of vehicle-injected animals ( ≤ 0.037). PEA-pre-treated animals showed diminished levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in spleen 24 h after infection, as well as reduced serum concentrations of  and of one of its metabolites, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic . In the brain, prophylactic PEA tended to reduce bacterial titers and attenuated microglial activation in aged infected animals ( = 0.042). Our findings suggest that prophylactic PEA can counteract infection associated detrimental responses in old animals. Accordingly, PEA treatment slowed the onset of infection symptoms and prolonged the survival of old infected mice. In a clinical setting, prophylactic administration of PEA might extend the potential therapeutic window where antibiotic therapy can be initiated to rescue elderly patients.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31306767>Role of acyl-CoA synthetase ACSL4 in  metabolism.</a></h2><p>The activation of long-chain free fatty acids is the first step reaction of their usage in the cells and tissues, which are catalyzed by a family of enzymes called acyl-coenzyme A synthetases long-chain isoform (ACSL). The five ACSL enzymes identified in mammals are thought to have specific and differing functions. Among them, ACSL4 is a unique isozyme that preferentially catalyzes several polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as  (AA), and ACSL4 is thought to be an important isozyme for PUFA metabolism. Recent studies revealed that ACSL4 is involved in biological responses including , steroidogenesis, cell death, female fertility, and cancer. ACSL4 and its substrate PUFAs are thus likely to contribute to these responses. However, the roles of ACSL4 in PUFA metabolism are not fully understood.

Multiple clinical studies have reported dysregulated fatty  metabolism in severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanism responsible for this metabolic abnormality has attracted a lot of attention. In eosinophils, various stimuli (including cytokines, chemokines, and pathogen-derived factors) prime and/or induce leukotriene generation and secretion. Cell-cell interactions with component cells (endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts) also enhance this machinery to augment allergic responses. Nasal polyp-derived eosinophils from patients with eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present a characteristic fatty  metabolism with selectively higher production of leukotriene D. Interestingly, type 2 cytokines and microbiome components might be responsible for this metabolic change with altered enzyme expression.

Despite carefully controlled conditions, platelets become activated during storage, and platelet concentrates (PlaCs) may cause adverse inflammatory reactions in recipients. The time-dependent changes in the lipidome of clinical PlaCs, platelets isolated from PlaCs, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) thereof were examined by mass spectrometry. The relative amount of  containing glycerophospholipids, especially those in the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine classes during storage, but the relative amount of other polyunsaturated fatty  containing glycerophospholipids remained stable in all sample types. These changes were not directly translated to lipid mediator (LM) profile since the levels of -derived proinflammatory LMs were not specifically elevated. Instead, several monohydroxy pathway markers and functionally relevant LMs, both proinflammatory and proresolving, were detected in the PlaCs and the EVs, and some representatives of both kind clearly accumulated during storage. By Western blot, the key enzymes of these pathways were shown to be present in platelets, and in many cases, EVs.

In addition to , COX-2 oxidizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) to produce prostaglandin E (PGE)-glycerol (PGE-G); PGE-G is known to produce hyperalgesia. We tested the hypotheses that PGE-G is increased in DRGs of HbSS-BERK mice and sensitizes nociceptors (sensory neurons that respond to noxious stimuli), and that blocking its synthesis would decrease hyperalgesia in HbSS-BERK mice. Systemic administration of -flurbiprofen preferentially reduced production of PGE-G over that of PGE in DRGs, decreased mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, and decreased sensitization of nociceptors in HbSS-BERK mice. The same dose of -flurbiprofen had no behavioral effect in HbAA-BERK mice (the transgenic control), but local injection of PGE-G into the hind paw of HbAA-BERK mice produced sensitization of nociceptors and hyperalgesia.

Based on these three metabolic pathways, AA could be converted into various metabolites that trigger different inflammatory responses. In the kidney, prostaglandins (PG), thromboxane (Tx), leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are the major metabolites generated from AA. An increased level of prostaglandins (PGs), TxA and leukotriene B4 (LTB) results in inflammatory damage to the kidney. Moreover, the LTB-leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (BLT1) axis participates in the acute kidney injury via mediating the recruitment of renal neutrophils. In addition, AA can regulate renal ion transport through 19-hydroxystilbenetetraenoic  (19-HETE) and 20-HETE, both of which are produced by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) generated by the CYP450 enzyme also plays a paramount role in the kidney damage during the  process. For example, 14 and 15-EET mitigated ischemia/reperfusion-caused renal tubular epithelial cell damage. Many drug candidates that target the AA metabolism pathways are being developed to treat kidney . These observations support an extraordinary interest in a wide range of studies on drug interventions aiming to control AA metabolism and kidney .</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410359>Zileuton suppresses cholangiocarcinoma cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of the Akt signaling pathway.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory lipid mediators play an important role in several cancer types. Leukotrienes (LTs), pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, are involved in chronic  and cancer progression. They are derived from  by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity. On the other hand, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX-1) converts LTs into lipoxins (LXs), pro-resolving lipid mediators. LXs are involved in the attenuation of  and cancer development.We aimed to investigate the lipid mediator pathways, especially the LTs and LXs pathways, by studying 5-LOX and 15-LOX-1 expression in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissue. We also investigated the efficiency of zileuton (5-LOX inhibitor) treatment and BML-111 (LXA4 analog) addition on CCA cell lines properties.The expression of 5-LOX and 15-LOX-1 in fifty human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissue was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. In addition, the effect of zileuton and BML-111 on CCA cell growth and migration was demonstrated using a cell viability assay and wound-healing assay, respectively. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism by which zileuton inhibits CCA cell migration was revealed using immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis, respectively.We demonstrate that the upregulation of 5-LOX is significantly correlated with CCA recurrent status. A positive 15-LOX-1 signal was significantly associated with a longer survival time in CCA patients. We found that co-expression of 5-LOX and 15-LOX-1 resulted in a relatively good prognosis in CCA patients. In addition, zileuton could inhibit CCA cell migration as well as BML-111. Interestingly, zileuton treatment not only downregulated 5-LOX, but also upregulated 15-LOX-1, together with reversing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to mesenchymal-epithelial transition phenotype as observed in EMT marker western blot.These findings suggest that 5-LOX and 15-LOX-1 play a key role in CCA and may serve as targets for CCA therapy.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31244108>Engineered Substrate for Cyclooxygenase-2: A Pentapeptide Isoconformational to  for Managing .</a></h2><p>Beyond the conventional mode of working of anti-inflammatory agents through enzyme inhibition, herein, COX-2 was provided with an alternate substrate.

Its main manifestations are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Currently, biopsies are the most used diagnostic tests for these diseases and metabolomics could represent a less invasive approach to identify biomarkers of disease presence and progression.The lipid and the polar metabolite profile of plasma samples of patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease have been compared with healthy individuals with the aim to find their metabolomic differences. Also, a selected sub-set of samples was analysed following solid phase extraction to further characterise differences between pathological samples.A total of 200 plasma samples were analysed using drift tube ion mobility coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography for the lipid metabolite profile analysis, while liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the polar metabolite profile analysis.Variations in the lipid profile between inflammatory bowel disease and healthy individuals were highlighted. Phosphatidylcholines, lyso-phosphatidylcholines and fatty acids were significantly changed among pathological samples suggesting changes in phospholipase A and  metabolic pathways. Variations in the levels of cholesteryl esters and glycerophospholipids were also found.

Studies have indicated that 20-HETE has important functions in the modulation of vascular tone, ion transport,  reaction, and cellular proliferation. Both we and others have demonstrated that 20-HETE plays an important role in acute phase of ischemic stroke. However, little is known about the effect of 20-HETE on recovery phase of stroke. Crosstalk between the cells within the neurovascular unit is increasingly suspected of playing critical roles in stroke recovery. We found that CYP4A is upregulated in astrocytes exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), which increases the production of 20-HETE that promotes endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation and migration. siRNA suppression of CYP4A or 20-HETE inhibitor prevents this effect. In a mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia, inhibition of CYP4A reduces peri-infact angiogenesis and worsens neurological deficits 14 days after stroke. We further showed that ischemia injury increases VEGF and HIF-1α expression in cell cultures and ischemic brains, which is negated by a 20-HETE inhibitor-HET0016. Lastly, we showed that JNK signaling pathway is a component of 20-HETE regulated ischemic angiogenesis after stroke. Taken together, we demonstrated a positive influence of 20-HETE in angiogenesis in later stage of stroke. These molecular and in vivo findings also support a previously undescribed mechanism of crosstalk between reactive astrocytes and endothelial cells wherein 20-HETE promotes neurovascular remodeling and functional recovery after ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2018.

Nutraceutical and pharmaceutical effects of anthocyanins have been extensively studied. The objective of this work was to investigate the the effect of purified sour cherry extract using human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as the inflammatory model. HUVECs were isolated by enzymatic digestion and characterized by flow cytometry. The optimal concentration range of sour cherry extract was selected based on MTT, apoptosis, and necrosis assays. Cells were divided into three groups, incubating with M199 medium as control, or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with LPS plus anthocyanin extract (ACE). The effect of sour cherry extract on oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory factors, and  pathway was investigated. An amount of 50 μg/mL ACE (ACE) was able to increase the level of glutathione and decrease the ROS, thereby improving the unbalanced redox status in . ACE lowered pro-inflammatory cytokine levels including Interleukin-6 (IL-6), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). ACE affected the  pathway by reducing the LPS-induced enzyme expression (cyclooxygenase-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and prostacyclin synthase). The extract under investigation seems to have a pleiotropic effect including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, hemostatic, and vasoactive effects.

Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of monoacylglycerols. It is a proinflammatory enzyme that metabolises 2-arachidonoylglycerol, an endocannabinoid receptor ligand, into . Here, we investigated the impact of MAGL on  and fibrosis during chronic liver injury.C57BL/6J mice and mice with global invalidation of MAGL (MAGL  ), or myeloid-specific deletion of either MAGL (MAGL), ATG5 (ATG) or CB2 (CB2), were used. Fibrosis was induced by repeated carbon tetrachloride (CCl) injections or bile duct ligation (BDL). Studies were performed on peritoneal or bone marrow-derived macrophages and Kupffer cells.MAGL  or MAGL mice exposed to CCl or subjected to BDL were more resistant to  and fibrosis than wild-type counterparts. Therapeutic intervention with MJN110, an MAGL inhibitor, reduced hepatic macrophage number and inflammatory gene expression and slowed down fibrosis progression. MAGL inhibitors also accelerated fibrosis regression and increased Ly-6C macrophage number. Antifibrogenic effects exclusively relied on MAGL inhibition in macrophages, since MJN110 treatment of MAGL BDL mice did not further decrease liver fibrosis. Cultured macrophages exposed to MJN110 or from MAGL mice displayed reduced cytokine secretion. These effects were independent of the cannabinoid receptor 2, as they were preserved in CB2 mice. They relied on macrophage autophagy, since anti-inflammatory and antifibrogenic effects of MJN110 were lost in ATG5 BDL mice, and were associated with increased autophagic flux and autophagosome biosynthesis in macrophages when MAGL was pharmacologically or genetically inhibited.MAGL is an immunometabolic target in the liver. MAGL inhibitors may show promising antifibrogenic effects during chronic liver injury.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

While the mechanisms regulating macrophage recruitment in obesity have been delineated, the signals directing macrophage persistence in VAT are poorly understood. We previously showed that the neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 is expressed in the VAT of obese mice and humans, where it promotes macrophage accumulation. To better understand the source of netrin-1 and its effects on adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) fate and function in obesity, we generated mice with myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 (   ; Ntn1). Interestingly, Ntn1 mice showed a modest decrease in HFD-induced adiposity and adipocyte size, in the absence of changes in food intake or leptin, that was accompanied by an increase in markers of adipocyte beiging (, UCP-1). Using single cell RNA-seq, combined with conventional histological and flow cytometry techniques, we show that myeloid-specific deletion of netrin-1 caused a 50% attrition of ATMs in HFD-fed mice, particularly of the resident macrophage subset, and altered the phenotype of residual ATMs to enhance lipid handling. Pseudotime analysis of single cell transcriptomes showed that in the absence of netrin-1, macrophages in the obese VAT underwent a phenotypic switch with the majority of ATMs activating a program of genes specialized in lipid handling, including fatty  uptake and intracellular transport, lipid droplet formation and lipolysis, and regulation of lipid localization. Furthermore, Ntn1 macrophages had reduced expression of genes involved in  metabolism, and targeted LCMS/MS metabololipidomics analysis revealed decreases in proinflammatory eicosanoids (5-HETE, 6- LTB, TXB, PGD) in the obese VAT.

In this study, we supplemented hMSCs with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic , which serve as precursors for multiple LMs. We then determined the consequent compositional modifications in the fatty , phospholipid, and LM profiles. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that the supplemented PUFAs were incorporated into the main membrane phospholipid classes with different dynamics, with phosphatidylcholine serving as the first acceptor. Most importantly, the PUFA modifications were transferred into hMSC-EVs, which are known to mediate hMSC immunomodulation. Furthermore, the membrane-incorporated PUFAs influenced the LM profile by increasing the production of downstream prostaglandin E and proresolving LMs, including Resolvin E2 and Resolvin D6. The production of LMs was further enhanced by a highly proinflammatory stimulus, which resulted in an increase in a number of mediators, most notably prostaglandins, while other stimulatory conditions had less a pronounced impact after a 48-h incubation.

Multivariate analyses were performed along with separate analyses for each individual FFA.High HOMA-IR (p<0.001) and C-peptide (p<0.0001) levels were positively associated with a twofold to fourfold increased risk for developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Metabolite levels were also compared between estrogen-only and estrogen plus progestin users.Compared to nonusers, 276 metabolites were statistically significantly (P < 6.40 × 10) associated with estrogen-only use and 222 were associated with estrogen plus progestin use. The metabolites associated with both types of hormones included numerous lipids, acyl carnitines, and amino acids as well as the thyroid hormone thyroxine and the oncometabolite fumarate.

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a key regulator of metabolism and energy homeostasis; however, information about this system in ruminants is scarce. Therefore, this work aimed to assess the eCB system in subcutaneous AT, and to determine its relation to the metabolic profile in peripartum cows. Biopsies of AT were performed at 14 d prepartum, and 4 and 30 d PP from 18 multiparous peripartum cows. Cows were categorized retrospectively according to those with high body weight (BW) loss (HWL, 8.5 ± 1.7% BW loss) or low body weight loss (LWL, 2.9 ± 2.5% BW loss) during the first month PP. The HWL had higher plasma non-esterified fatty acids and a lower insulin/glucagon ratio PP than did LWL. Two-fold elevated AT levels of the main eCBs, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were found 4 d PP compared with prepartum in HWL, but not in LWL cows. AT levels of the eCB-like molecules oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide, and of  were elevated PP compared with prepartum in all cows. The abundance of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL), the 2-AG degrading enzyme, was lower in HWL vs. LWL AT PP. The relative gene expression of the cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2 in AT tended to be higher in HWL vs. LWL PP. Proteomic analysis of AT showed an enrichment of the inflammatory pathways' acute phase signaling and complement system in HWL vs. LWL cows PP. In summary, eCB levels in AT were elevated at the onset of lactation as part of the metabolic adaptations in PP dairy cows. Furthermore, activating the eCB system in AT is most likely associated with a metabolic response of greater BW loss, lipolysis, and AT  in PP dairy cows.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31392628>Alterations of HDL particle phospholipid composition and role of  in rheumatoid arthritis.</a></h2><p>The increased cardiovascular risk in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be explained by common quantitative circulating lipid parameters. The objective of the study was to characterize the modifications in HDL phosphosphingolipidome in patients with RA to identify qualitative modifications which could better predict the risk for CVD. Nineteen patients with RA were compared to control subjects paired for age, sex, BMI, and criteria of metabolic syndrome. The characterization of total HDL phosphosphingolipidome was performed by LC-MS/MS. RA was associated with an increased HDL content of lysophosphatidylcholine and a decreased content of PC (phosphatidylcholine), respectively, positively and negatively associated with cardiovascular risk. A discriminant molecular signature composed of 18 lipids was obtained in the HDL from RA patients. The detailed analysis of phospholipid species showed that molecules carrying omega-3 FA (fatty acids), notably docosahexaenoic  (C22:6 n-3), were depleted in HDL isolated from RA patients. By contrast, two PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) species carrying  (C20:4 n-6) were increased in HDL from RA patients. Furthermore, disease activity and severity indexes were associated with altered HDL content of 4 PE and 2 PC species. In conclusion, the composition of HDL phosphosphingolipidome is altered during RA. Identification of a lipidomic signature could therefore represent a promising biomarker for CVD risk. Although a causal link remains to be demonstrated, pharmacological and nutritional interventions targeting the normalization of the FA composition of altered phospholipids could help to fight against RA-related  and CVD risk.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105063>Diacylglycerol Lipase-β Is Required for TNF-α Response but Not CD8 T Cell Priming Capacity of Dendritic Cells.</a></h2><p>Diacylglycerol lipase-β (DAGLβ) hydrolyzes  (AA)-esterified diacylglycerols to produce 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and downstream prostanoids that mediate inflammatory responses of macrophages.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these processes are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles of the PTGES/PGE pathway in lung cancer progression. We found that prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), a key enzyme for PGE synthesis in the  pathway, was highly dysregulated in NSCLC. Dysregulated PTGES was essential for the promotion of tumor migration and metastasis of NSCLC cells. Knockdown of PTGES in lung cancer cells resulted in suppressed cell migration, which was reversed by exogenous PGE. Consistent with this, PTGES knockdown also reduced the expression of CSC markers, tumor sphere formation, colony forming activity, tumorigenicity, and lung metastasis in vivo. Dysregulated PTGES is mainly attributed to protein stabilization by USP9X, a deubiquitination enzyme. USP9X physically interacted with PTGES and prevented it from proteasome-directed degradation via deubiquitination. Consistent with this, USP9X expression was highly correlated with PTGES expression in NSCLC tumor tissues. Taken together, our results show that the upregulated USP9X-PTGES-PGE axis contributes significantly to the metastatic features of NSCLC.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30293595>Genetic variant in the 3'-untranslated region of the COX2 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes: A hospital-based case-control study.</a></h2><p>Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is caused by the decreased β-cell mass and insulin deficiency, and disease is characterized by hypoglycemia.

In this study, we evaluated rs5275 and rs689466 variants located on the COX-2 gene by PCR-RFLP in 100 T2DM patients and 100 control subjects. The interaction among COX2 variants and T2DM was analyzed using appropriate methods. The both variants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients and controls (p > 0.05). A significant association was observed for genotype distribution of COX2 rs5275 site between control and T2DM cases (p = 0.042).

Blocking COX-2 pathway would shunt AA metabolism to the other pathway, thereby decreasing the efficacy and exacerbating adverse effects. Here we demonstrated that reprogramming COX-2, 5-LOX, and CYP4A-mediated AA metabolism in macrophages by salidroside (Sal) ameliorates monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced . Compared with COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, Sal (80 mg/kg) presented a superior anti-arthritic profile in MSU crystal-treated rats, accompanied with the decreased expression of COX-2, 5-LOX, and CYP4A and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE ), leukotriene B4 (LTB ), and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE) in the synovial fluid macrophages. Sal decreased representative M1 marker (iNOS and CD86, etc.) expression and M1 cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) production, whereas it increased M2 marker (CD206 and Arg-1) expression and M2 cytokine (TGF-β and IL-10) production. The injection of conditioned medium from MSU crystal-treated macrophages into the ankle joint of rats reproduced the gouty , which was attenuated by Sal. Mechanistically, down-regulation of COX-2, 5-LOX, and CYP4A in the RAW264.7 and NR8383 macrophages by Sal skewed macrophage polarization away from the M1 phenotype, and thereby prevented neutrophil migration and chondrocyte degradation with STAT1 and NF-κB inactivation.

Moreover, EWSS and EYSS also remarkably inhibited the protein and mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the ears of TPA-treated mice. Comparatively, EWSS exerted more potent anti-inflammatory effect than that of EYSS.Our results revealed that both EWSS and EYSS are effective anti-inflammatory agents against acute and chronic inflammatory processes, and EWSS possess more potent anti-inflammatory effect than EYSS. The anti-inflammatory effect of the two herbs may be mediated, at least in part, by suppressing the mRNA expression of a panel of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β.Copyright © 2018.

ARASCO oil was administered orally for the first 7 d consecutively, followed by once weekly throughout the study (14 wk). At various time points, blood glucose and body weight and oral glucose tolerance tests were measured. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed to collect plasma and various organs and stored at -80°C. Plasma insulin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and lipoxin A4 were measured. Expression of the following genes was determined: nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) in pancreas and lipocalin 2 (LPCLN2) in adipose tissue. Various antioxidants were measured in the plasma and other tissues. Area under the curve and insulin sensitivity index were assessed by computing homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance, quantitative insulin check index, Matsuda, and Belfiore indices.ARASCO oil treatment decreased hyperglycemia, restored insulin sensitivity, suppressed , enhanced plasma lipoxin A4 levels, and reversed altered antioxidant status to near normal in animals with HFD + STZ-induced diabetes.These results suggest that ARASCO, a rich source of AA, can prevent HFD + STZ-induced diabetes in Wistar rats owing to its anti-inflammatory action. It remains to be seen whether ARASCO oil is useful in preventing or postponing the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Recent interest has focused on using microRNAs (miRNAs) as a novel treatment method for various cancers. miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, and have become attractive candidates for cancer treatment because they often simultaneously target multiple genes of similar biological function. One such miRNA is miR-146a-5p, which has been described as a tumor suppressive miRNA in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. In this study, we performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis following transfection of synthetic miR-146a-5p in an NSCLC cell line, A549, and validated our data with Gene Ontology and qRT-PCR analysis of known miR-146a-5p target genes. Our transcriptomic data revealed that miR-146a-5p exerts its tumor suppressive function beyond previously reported targeting of EGFR and NF-κB signaling. miR-146a-5p mimic transfection downregulated  metabolism genes, the RNA-binding protein HuR, and many HuR-stabilized pro-cancer mRNAs, including TGF-β, HIF-1α, and various cyclins. miR-146a-5p transfection also reduced expression and cellular release of the chemokine CCL2, and this effect was mediated through the 3' untranslated region of its mRNA. Taken together, our work reveals that miR-146a-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by controlling various metabolic and signaling pathways through direct and indirect mechanisms.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851234>Lysophosphatidylinositol-acyltransferase-1 is involved in cytosolic Ca oscillations in macrophages.</a></h2><p>Lysophosphatidylinositol-acyltransferase-1 (LPIAT1) specifically catalyzes the transfer of arachidonoyl-CoA to lysophosphoinositides. LPIAT mice have been shown to have severe defects in the brain and liver; however, the exact molecular mechanisms behind these conditions are not well understood. As immune cells have been implicated in liver  based on disfunction of LPIAT1, we generated Raw264.7 macrophages deficient in LPIAT1, using shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9. The amount of C38:4 species in phosphoinositides, especially in PtdInsP , was remarkably decreased in these cells. Unlike in wild-type cells, LPIAT1-deficient cells showed prolonged oscillations of intracellular Ca upon UDP stimulation, which is known to activate phospholipase Cβ through the Gq-coupled P2Y6 receptor, even in the absence of extracellular Ca . It is speculated that the prolonged Ca response may be relevant to the increased risk of liver  induced by LPIAT1 disfunction.© 2019 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30384230>Concentrations of legacy and new contaminants are related to metabolite profiles in Hudson Bay polar bears.</a></h2><p>There are very few metabolomics assessments based on field accumulated, uncontrolled contaminant exposures in wildlife, particularly in the Arctic. In the present study, targeted metabolomics and contaminant data were analyzed together to assess potential influences of contaminant exposure on the hepatic metabolome of male polar bears (n = 29) from the southern and western Hudson Bay (SHB and WHB respectively), Canada. The 29 metabolites identified as important in the differentiation of the two subpopulations after partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) included phosphatidylcholines (PCs), acylcarnitines (ACs; involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids), and the fatty  (FA)  (ARA). Perfluorinated alkyl substances, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and some highly chlorinated ortho-polychlorinated biphenyl congeners were greater in the SHB bears and were consistently inversely correlated with discriminating ACs and PCs between the subpopulations. The concentrations of discriminatory, legacy organochlorine pesticides along with one tetrachlorobiphenyl were greater in the WHB and were directly correlated with the VIP-identified ACs and PCs. ARA, glycerophospholipid and several amino  metabolic pathways were identified as different between subpopulations and/or were impacted. ARA is an important, conditionally essential, dietary n-6 FA and is also part of the  response, and elevated concentrations in the SHB could be related to differences in chronic contaminant exposure and/or differences in diet and/or season, among a number of possible explanations. Dietary tracers (stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) were correlated with some discriminatory metabolites, supporting the hypothesis that dietary variation was also an important factor in the differentiation of the subpopulations. The results suggest linkages between contaminant exposure in Hudson Bay polar bears and elements of the hepatic metabolome, particularly those related to lipid metabolism.Crown Copyright © 2018.

Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells derived from hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells which migrate and mature close to epithelial, blood vessels, and nerves. In almost all vascularized tissues there are MCs that produce, contain and release biologically active products including cytokines,  compounds, and proteases. In addition, MCs participate in innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate responses in the central nervous system (CNS) occur during neuroinflammatory phenomena, including migraine. Antigens found in the environment have a crucial role in inflammatory response, causing a broad range of diseases including migraine. They can be recognized by several innate immune cells, such as macrophages, microglia, dendritic cells and MCs, which can be activated trough Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. MCs reside close to primary nociceptive neurons, associate with nerves, and are capable of triggering local . MCs are involved in the pathophysiology of various tissues and organs, especially where there is an increase of angiogenesis. Activated MCs release preformed mediators include histamine, heparin, proteases (tryptase, chimase), hydrolases, cathepsin, carboxypeptidases, and peroxidase, and they also generate pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In addition, activated macrophages, microglia and MCs in the CNS release pro-inflammatory cytokines which provoke an increase of  product levels and lead to migraine and other neurological manifestations including fatigue, nausea, headaches and brain fog. Innate immunity and pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 cytokine family members can be inhibited by IL-37, a relatively new member of the IL-1 family. In this article, we report that some pro-inflammatory cytokines inducing migraine may be inhibited by IL-37, a natural suppressor of , and innate and acquired immunity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ischemia reperfusion (IR) was induced by clamping the left pulmonary hilum for 60 min, followed by 120 min of reperfusion in male C57BL/6 mice. Effects of URB602, a MAGL inhibitor, were evaluated in a preventive or therapeutic regimen (5 min before ischemia or reperfusion, respectively). Oxygenation index, wet-to-dry weight ratio and lung injury score were analyzed. Endocannabinoids including 2-AG, anandamide (AEA) and  (AA) levels, metabolites such as Prostaglandin I (PGI), Thromboxane B (TXB) and Leukotrienes B (LTB) and inflammatory markers (Interleukin 6 (IL-6) andTumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) in lung tissues were measured by using mass spectrometry or ELISA analyses. We found that IR increased the wet-to-dry weight ratio of lung and lung injury score and decreased oxygenation index as compared to the sham group. Moreover, treatment with URB602 in preventive or therapeutic regimen reduced the wet-to-dry weight ratio and lung injury score while increased oxygenation index when compared with the IR group, with a more improvement in the preventive regimen group. In addition, treatment with URB602 before ischemia increased 2-AG level but decreased metabolites (AA, PGI, TXB, LTB) and inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α).

An easy-to-use ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-based strategy was developed to characterize biomarkers of lipid peroxidation: leukotrienes E (LTE) and B (LTB) and 11β-prostaglandin F (11βPGF), present in urine of asthmatic patients (N = 27) and healthy individuals (N = 17). A semi-automatic eVol®-microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) was used to isolate the target analytes. Several experimental parameters with influence on the extraction efficiency and on the chromatographic resolution, were evaluated and optimized. The method was fully validated under optimal extraction (R-AX sorbent, 3 conditioning-equilibration cycles with 250 μL of ACN-water at 0.1% FA, 10 extract-discard cycles of 250 μL of sample at a pH of 5.1, elution with 2 times 50 μL of MeOH and concentration of the eluate until half of its volume) and chromatographic conditions (14-min analysis at a flow rate of 300 μL min-1 in an UHPLC-PDA equipped with a BEH C18 column), according to IUPAC guidelines. The findings indicated good recoveries (>95%) in addition to excellent extraction efficiency (>95%) at three concentration levels (low mid and high) with precision (RSDs) less than 11%. The lack-of-fit test, goodness-of-fit test and Mandel's fitting test, revealed good linearity within the concentration range. Good selectivity and sensitivity were achieved with a limits of detection ranging from 0.04 μg L for LTB4 to 1.12 μg L for 11βPGF2α, and limits of quantification from 0.10 μg L for the LTB4 to 2.11 μg L for 11βPGF2α. The successful application of the fully validated method shows that, on average, the asthmatic patients had significantly higher concentrations of 11βPGF (112.96 μg Lvs 62.56 μg L in normal controls), LTE (1.27 μg Lvs 0.89 μg L in normal controls), and LTB (1.39 μg Lvs 0.76 μg L in normal controls). The results suggest the potential of the target eicosanoids on asthma diagnosis, however, a larger and more extensive study will be necessary to confirm the data obtained and to guarantee a greater robustness to the approach.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to elucidate the expression of TRPV4 in the gastrointestinal tract and the pathogenic roles of TRPV4 in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. TRPV4-immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial-like cells of the mouse tongue, esophagus, stomach, ileum, and colon; TRPV4 expression in the tongue was higher than other gastrointestinal tracts. TRPV4 colocalized with a type IV cell marker sonic hedgehog in circumvallate papillae. These findings suggest that TRPV4 contributes to sour taste sensing by regulating type III taste cell differentiation in mice. DSS-induced colitis was significantly attenuated in TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4KO) mice when compared to wild-type mice. DSS treatment upregulated TRPV4 expression in vascular endothelia of colonic mucosa and submucosa. DSS treatment increased vascular permeability, which was abolished in TRPV4KO mice. The activation of TRPV4 decreased VE-cadherin expression in mouse aortic endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. These findings indicate that the upregulation of TRPV4 in vascular endothelial cells contributes to the progression of colonic  via the activation of vascular permeability.

PGHS have both oxygenase (COX) and peroxidase (POX) activities and is present in two isoforms (PGHS-1 and -2) expressed in different tissues and cell conditions. It has been reported that PGHS activity is inhibited by the nitrated form of AA, nitro- (NOAA), which in turn could be synthesized by PGHS under nitro-oxidative conditions. Specifically, NOAA inhibits COX in PGHS-1 as well as POX in both PGHS-1 and -2, in a dose and time-dependent manner. NOAA inhibition involves lowering the binding stability and displacing the heme group from the active site. However, the complete mechanism remains to be understood. This review describes the interactions of PGHS with NOAA, focusing on mechanisms of inhibition and nitration. In addition, using a novel approach combining EPR-spin trapping and mass spectrometry, we described possible intermediates formed during PGHS-2 catalysis and inhibition.

Blood samples from humans (healthy and patients with mild bleeding disorders) and wild-type (WT), mice were tested. Light transmission lumi-aggregometer (lumi-LTA) was performed in PRP using several concentrations of ADP, adrenaline, , collagen, PAR-1 peptide and ristocetin. Thrombus growth (N = 22) increased with shear within PL (4:40 ± 1.11, 3:25 ± 0.43 and 3:12 ± 0.48 mins [1000, 1500 and 2000s]) and AR chips (3:55 ± 0.42 and 1:49 ± 0.19 [240s and 600s]).

AR chip thrombus formation was inhibited by rivaroxaban (1 µM), but not with ticagrelor (10 µM). In contrast, PL chip thrombus formation was totally inhibited by ticagrelor. T-TAS shows an overall agreement with lumi-LTA in 87% of patients (n = 30) with normal PL counts recruited into the genotyping and phenotyping of platelet (GAPP) study and suspected to have a PL function defect.

Most mammalian genomes involve six or seven functional ALOX genes and among the corresponding ALOX-isoforms the ALOX15 orthologs are somewhat unique since they exhibit variable reaction specificity using  as substrate. The Evolutionary Hypothesis of mammalian ALOX15 reaction specificity (Prog. Lipid Res. 72, 55, 2018) suggests that ALOX15 orthologs of primates ranked higher in evolution than gibbons are 15-lipoxygenating enzymes. In contrast, mammals ranking lower than gibbons express dominantly 12-lipoxygenating lipoxygenases and gibbon ALOX15 constitutes a transition enzyme with pronounced dual reaction specificity. Here we predicted the reaction specificity of 95 different prototherian, metatherian and eutherian ALOX15 orthologs on the basis of their primary structures and characterized experimentally the reaction specificity of ten novel metatherian/eutherian enzymes representing different stages of mammalian evolution (gorilla, opossum, cape golden mole, dog, horseshoe bat, hedgehog, Sunda flying lemur, pika, chinchilla, kangaroo rat). We found that 97% of the currently sequenced mammalian ALOX15 including the enzymes of living and extinct hominids follow the Evolutionary Hypothesis. However, the ALOX15 orthologs of rabbits and of the Ord's kangaroo rat violate this mechanistic concept.

Increases in mRNA gene expression after supplementation were, however, modest and were not associated with changes in PGE. When baseline expression of PTGS1, PTGS2 and HPGD genes was included in the linear regression model containing dose and BMI, only PTGS2, the gene coding for the inducible form cyclooxygenase, was a significant predictor. Higher relative expression of PTGS2 predicted greater decreases in colonic PGE, accounting for an additional 13.6% of the inter-individual variance. In the final step of the regression model, greater decreases in total colonic fatty  concentrations predicted greater decreases in colonic PGE, contributing to an additional 18.7% of the variance. Overall, baseline BMI, baseline expression of PTGS2 and changes in colonic total fatty acids together accounted for 48% of the inter-individual variability in the change in colonic PGE. This is consistent with biochemical data showing that fatty acids which are not substrates for cyclooxygenases can activate cyclooxygenase-2 allosterically. Further clinical trials are needed to elucidate the factors that regulate the fatty  milieu of the human colon and how this interacts with key lipid metabolizing enzymes. Given the central role of PGE in colon carcinogenesis, these pathways may also impact on colon cancer prevention by other dietary and pharmacological approaches.Copyright © 2018.

We sought to investigate serum fatty  composition in CD, and associations of fatty acids with disease activity, cytokines, and adipokines. Serum was prospectively collected from 116 CD subjects and 27 non-IBD controls. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI). Serum fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography. Serum cytokines and adipokines were measured by Luminex assay. Dietary histories were obtained from a subset of patients. Nine serum cytokines and adipokines were increased in CD versus controls. CD subjects had increased percentage serum monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), dihomo-gamma linolenic  (DGLA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and oleic , but decreased  (AA) versus controls. The % total n-3 fatty acids and % EPA directly correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI, whereas the % total n-6 fatty acids were inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and HBI. CD subjects had increased caloric intake versus controls, but no alterations in total fat or PUFA intake. We found differences in serum fatty acids, most notably PUFA, in CD that correlated both with clinical disease activity and inflammatory cytokines. Our findings indicate that altered fatty  metabolism or utilization is present in CD and is related to disease activity.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31331571>Anti-inflammatory activity of herb products from Licania rigida Benth.</a></h2><p>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the systemic anti-inflammatory activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of the leaves of Licania rigida Benth (EHFLR) on models of systemic  in mice.The quantitative chemical profiles of phenolic acids and flavonoids were performed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Systemic anti-inflammatory activity was determined from carrageenan and dextran-induced paw edema models and the animals were orally treated (p.o.) with EHFLR at doses of 25, 50, 100 mg/kg, indomethacin (10 mg/kg) for carrageenan-induced paw edema and promethazine (6 mg/kg) for dextran-induced paw edema. The possible mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory action of the extract were evaluated by the paw edema models induced by histamine and , and by the model of carrageenan-induced peritonitis, where vascular permeability and leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity were evaluated.The results of the HPLC identified the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids, with chlorogenic  (1.16%) and Caempferol (0.81%) as the main constituents. From the results, it was concluded that the extract has an LD ≥5000 mg/kg when administered orally in mice as this dose did not trigger deaths in any of the observed groups. EHFLR (25 mg/kg) showed a significant antiderematogenic effect on histamine and -induced paw edema at the third hour of the tests, with a percentage of inhibition of 46.64% and 18.33%, respectively. The extract (25 mg/kg, p.o.) also significantly reduced vascular permeability and leukocyte migration in the peritoneal cavity.It is concluded that EHFLR exerts a systemic anti-inflammatory action, which seems to depend, at least in part, on the inhibition of  metabolism and the action of vasoactive amines. In addition, the extract reduced the leukocyte migration in the peritoneal cavity, indicating that its action may be linked to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An overactivity of the endocannabinoid system plays a pathophysiological role in the development of visceral obesity and insulin resistance. Moreover, elevated circulating endocannabinoid levels are also prevalent in atherosclerosis. The pathophysiological increase of endocannabinoid levels is due to an altered expression of endocannabinoid synthesizing and degrading enzymes induced by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines or lipids. Emerging experimental evidence suggests that enhanced endocannabinoid signalling affects atherosclerosis via multiple effects, including a modulation of vascular , leukocyte recruitment, macrophage cholesterol metabolism and consequently atherosclerotic plaque stability. In addition, recent findings in various metabolic disease models highlight the relevance of peripheral CB1 cannabinoid receptors in adipose tissue, liver and pancreas, which crucially regulate lipid and glucose metabolism as well as macrophage properties in these organs. This suggests that targeting the endocannabinoid system in the vasculature and peripheral organs might have a therapeutic potential for atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular  and improving metabolic risk factors.

Some intervention studies have demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) increase systemic concentrations of n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins and moderately decrease -derived oxylipins. There is no information on the dose-response of oxylipin concentrations after n-3 PUFA intake.The aim of this study was to quantify oxylipins in human plasma samples from an intervention study in which participants were randomly assigned to different daily intakes of EPA and DHA for 12 mo.Healthy adult men and women with low habitual fish consumption (n = 121) were randomly assigned to receive capsules providing doses of n-3 PUFAs reflecting 3 patterns of consumption of oily fish [1, 2, or 4 portions/wk with 3.27 g EPA + DHA (1:1.2, wt:wt) per portion] or placebo. Oxylipins were quantified in plasma after 3 and 12 mo. Relative and absolute changes of individual oxylipins were calculated and concentrations were correlated with the dose and the content of EPA and DHA in blood lipid pools.Seventy-three oxylipins, mostly hydroxy-, dihydroxy-, and epoxy-PUFAs, were quantified in the plasma samples. After 3 and 12 mo a linear increase with dose was observed for all EPA- and DHA-derived oxylipins. Cytochrome-P450-derived anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective epoxy-PUFAs increased linearly with n-3 PUFA dose and showed low interindividual variance (r2 > 0.95). Similarly, 5, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroxy-PUFAs as well as those formed autoxidatively increased linearly. These include the precursors of so-called specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), e.g., 17-hydroxy-DHA and 18-hydroxy-EPA.Plasma concentrations of biologically active oxylipins derived from n-3 PUFAs, including epoxy-PUFAs and SPM-precursors, increase linearly with elevated intake of EPA and DHA.

Linoleic  (18:2n6, LA) is an essential n-6 PUFA which is converted to  (20:4n6, AA) by desaturation and elongation via enzyme systems within the body. Biological transformation of PUFA through CYP-mediated hydroxylation, epoxidation, and allylic oxidation produces lipid mediators, which may be subsequently hydrolyzed to corresponding diol metabolites by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). In the current study, we investigate whether inhibition of sEH, which alters the PUFA metabolite profile, can influence LPS induced cardiotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Our data demonstrate that deletion of soluble epoxide hydrolase provides protective effects against LPS-induced cardiotoxicity by maintaining mitochondrial function.

The production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species by immune cells plays indeed an important role in the inflammatory mechanisms of host defence, and it is now clear that oxidative stress, viewed as an imbalance between such species and their elimination, can lead to many chronic inflammatory diseases. This review, the first of its kind, is aimed at exploring the manifold effects of SPMs on modulation of reactive species production, along with the mechanisms through which they either inhibit molecular signalling pathways that are activated by oxidative stress or induce the expression of endogenous antioxidant systems. Furthermore, the possible role of SPMs in oxidative stress-mediated chronic disorders is also summarized, suggesting not only that their anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties are strictly associated with their antioxidant role but also that these endogenous lipids might be exploited in the treatment of several pathologies in which uncontrolled production of ROS and RNS or impairment of the antioxidant machinery represents a main pathogenetic mechanism.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30662340>Lipopolysaccharide promoted proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes through JAK/STAT and AMPK-regulated cPLA2 expression.</a></h2><p>The proliferation and adipogenesis of preadipocytes played important roles in the development of adipose tissue and contributed much to the processes of obesity.

Studies suggested the potential roles of LPS in hepatic steatosis and in obese mice models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPS-regulated obesity remained largely unknown. Here we reported that LPS stimulated expression of cyosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), one of  regulators of obesity, in the preadipocytes. Pretreatment the inhibitors of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 or AMPK significantly reduced LPS-increased mRNA and protein expression of cPLA2 together with phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5 and AMPK, separately. Similarly, transfection of siRNA against JAK2 or AMPK abolished expression of cPLA2 and phosphorylation of JAK2 or AMPK together with downregulated expression of JAK2 and AMPK protein. LPS enhanced activation of STAT3 and STAT5 via JAK2-dependent manner in the preadipocytes. Transfection of JAK2 or AMPK siRNA further proofed the independence of JAK2 and AMPK in LPS-treated preadipocytes.

It has been shown that these lipids exhibit also regulatory functions in different cell types. FAs can serve as secondary messengers, as well as modulators of enzymatic activities and substrates for cytokines synthesis. More recently, it has been documented a direct activity of free FAs as ligands of membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear receptors, and cumulative evidence has emerged, demonstrating its participation in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. It has been long known that the central nervous system is enriched with poly-unsaturated FAs, such as  (C20:4ω-6) or docosohexaenoic (C22:6ω-3) acids. These lipids participate in the regulation of membrane fluidity, axonal growth, development, memory, and inflammatory response. Furthermore, a whole family of low molecular weight compounds derived from FAs has also gained special attention as the natural ligands for cannabinoid receptors or key cytokines involved in , largely expanding the role of FAs as precursors of signaling molecules. Nutritional deficiencies, and alterations in lipid metabolism and lipid signaling have been associated with developmental and cognitive problems, as well as with neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanism behind these effects still remains elusive. But in the last two decades, different families of proteins have been characterized as receptors mediating FAs signaling. This review focuses on different receptors sensing and transducing free FAs signals in neural cells: (1) membrane receptors of the family of G Protein Coupled Receptors known as Free Fatty  Receptors (FFARs); (2) cytosolic transport Fatty -Binding Proteins (FABPs); and (3) transcription factors Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs). We discuss how these proteins modulate and mediate direct regulatory functions of free FAs in neural cells. Finally, we briefly discuss the advantages of evaluating them as potential targets for drug design in order to manipulate lipid signaling.

In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty  β-oxidation, reduced hepatic  and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

The results shown DBT effectively treated anaemia in vivo. 11 metabolic pathways are involved in the therapeutic effect of DBT in vivo; S-adenosyl-l-methionine, glycine, l-cysteine,  (AA) and phosphatidylcholine(PC) were screened as hub metabolites in APH-and CTX-induced anaemia. A total of 288 targets were identified as major candidates for anaemia progression. The gene-set enrichment analysis revealed that the targets are involved in iron ion binding, haemopoiesis, reactive oxygen species production,  and apoptosis. The results also showed that these targets were associated with iron ion binding, haemopoiesis, ROS production, apoptosis,  and related signalling pathways. DBT can promote iron ion binding and haemopoiesis activities, restrain , production of reactive oxygen, block apoptosis, and contribute significantly to the DBT treat anaemia.Copyright © 2019 China Pharmaceutical University.

The purpose of this study is to propose an improved strategy for processing effect investigation. Frankincense and processed frankincense were used as research subjects. First, high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) and preparation high-performance liquid chromatography (PHPLC) techniques were used for major compounds isolation and minor compounds concentration. Processed frankincense was subjected to two stepwise solvent systems, namely, -hexane:ethanol:water (6:5:1) and -hexane:methyl-acetate:acetonitrile:water (4:4:3:4), to yield 12 fractions, and 18 compounds were further separated. Second, a comprehensive metabolomic analysis conducted by ultrahigh-performance liquid-chromatography/electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Qtof-MS) coupled with multivariate statistics was performed to fully characterize the chemical components and discover the potential biomarkers between frankincense and processed frankincense. In total, 81 metabolites, including the 18 separated compounds, were selected as potential biomarkers between frankincense and processed frankincense among 153 detected compounds for their VIP values of greater than one. The tirucallane-type compounds and components with 9,11-dehydro structures clearly occurred at high levels in the processed frankincense, while lupine-type compounds and those with 11-keto structures were significantly higher in frankincense. Then, a network pharmacology model was constructed to decipher the potential mechanisms of processing. Intestinal absorption properties prediction indicated the possibility of processing-related absorption enhancement. A systematic analysis of the constructed networks showed that the C-T network was constructed with 18 potential biomarkers and 69 targets. TNF and IL-1β were among the top-ranked and were linked by 8 and 7 pathways, which were mainly involved in . The  metabolism pathway exhibited the highest number of target connections. Finally, the prediction was validated experimentally by an intestinal permeability and efficacy assay. The experiments provided convincing evidence that processed frankincense harbored stronger inhibition effects toward TNF-α-, IL-1β- and -induced platelet aggregation. The processing procedure leads to changes of the chemical metabolites, which triggers the enhancement of absorption and cure efficiency. The global change of the metabolites, absorption and pharmacological effects of processing were depicted in a systematic manner.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058781>Oxylipins and Free Fatty Acids in Parenteral Lipid Emulsions Currently Used in Preterm Infant Care: An In Vitro Study.</a></h2><p>Lipid emulsions used to support nutrition in preterm infants contain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) as a source of essential fatty acids; these LCPUFAs and their parent polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) can be oxidized by a variety of mechanisms to bioactive molecules called oxylipins, which are signaling molecules that initiate and/or resolve .

However, both arthritis and many NSAIDs increase cardiovascular (CV) risks. The dose-dependency of the elevated CV risks of NSAIDs has not been well-studied. We tested the hypothesis that low but still effective doses of these drugs are void of CV side effects. As the model drug, we chose diclofenac because of its known high CV toxicity, as markers of CV risks, we assessed concentrations of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolites of  (ArA), and we used adjuvant arthritis as an experimental model of arthritis. Following 7 daily doses (2.5-15 mg/kg), the effective dosage range of diclofenac was identified (> 5 mg/kg/day). While 7 consecutive days of low therapeutic doses did not alter the CYP-mediated ArA metabolism, the highest dose of 15 mg/kg/day caused imbalances in ArA metabolic profiles toward cardiotoxicity by increasing the ratio of cardiotoxic 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  over cardioprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. This is suggestive of dose-dependency of NSAID cardiotoxicity, and that low therapeutic doses may be void of CV side effects.

To investigate the influence of inhibition of inflammatory pathways on the biogenic amine neurotransmitters metabolism in depressive rats, sertraline, and meloxicam, the inhibitors of  - cyclooxygenase-2/lipoxygenase (AA-COX-2/5-LO) pathways, were given to depressive rats. After the development of depression model by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 6 weeks, Successful modeling rats were selected and randomly divided into CUMS group and medication administration group. After given medicine, The biogenic amine neurotransmitters in rat cortex and hippocampus were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD). Compared with the normal group, the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) significantly decreased and the concentrations of Tyrosine (Tyr), Tryptophan (Trp), 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic  (DOPAC), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic  (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic  (5-HIAA) significantly increased in the CUMS group.

Caffeic  inhibited the decrease of NE and the increase of Trp and MHPG in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of AA-COX-2/5-LO pathways can improve the behaviors of depression rats and suppress CUMS-induced changes in biogenic amines.

Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) is the inducible isoform of enzyme which convert  to prostaglandins. It was known that alterations in COX2 gene functions contribute to the  process thus induce cancer progression, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, invasion and metastasis. A total of 114 cases 165 healthy individuals were included in present study. We aimed to evaluate possible association between the COX2; -765, -1195 polymorphisms and the risk of OSCC. The genotypes were determined by using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. In our study group the carriers of COX2 -765 C allele were statistically higher in patients compared with controls and individuals who had CC genotype had a 3,4 fold high risk for OSCC (p &lt;0,05). We also observed the COX2 -1195 AA genotype frequency was higher in cases that of healthy group and individuals who had AA genotype showed a 1,7 fold increased risk for OSCC (p &lt; 0,05). Haplotype analysis confirmed our result and revealed that the frequencies of COX2 -765C, -1195A haplotype frequencies were significantly higher in patients as compared with those of controls. In conclusion we suggest that COX2, -765, -1195 polymorphisms appear to be an important predictive factor and may be a prognostic biomarker for risk of OSCC.

We aimed to explore the role of MGL in the development of cholestatic liver and bile duct injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis (SC), a disease so far lacking effective pharmacological therapy. To this aim we analyzed the effects of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding to induce SC in wild type (WT) and knockout (MGL ) mice and tested pharmacological inhibition with JZL184 in the Mdr2 mouse model of SC. Cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry, liver histology, gene expression and western blot characterization of BA and FA synthesis/transport. Moreover, intestinal FAs and fecal microbiome were analyzed. Transfection and silencing were performed in Caco2 cells. MGL mice were protected from DDC-induced biliary fibrosis and  with reduced serum liver enzymes, increased FA/BA metabolism and β-oxidation. Notably, pharmacological (JZL184) inhibition of MGL ameliorated cholestatic injury in DDC-fed WT mice and protected Mdr2 from spontaneous liver injury, with improved liver enzymes,  and biliary fibrosis. In vitro experiments confirmed that silencing of MGL decreases prostaglandin E2 accumulation in the intestine upregulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) -α and -γ activity, thus reducing . Conclusions: Collectively, our study unravels MGL as a novel metabolic target, demonstrating that MGL inhibition may be considered as potential therapy for SC.© 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report a critical role of the induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cellular activation of a protein cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase 2 (TG2), in liver injury by AA. In cultures of hepatic cells, AA dose-dependently suppressed cell growth, which accompanied the induced nuclear accumulation of TG2, as demonstrated in EGFP-tagged, TG2-overexpressing hepatic cells. A chemical inhibitor/shRNA that acts against TG2 prevented AA-mediated cell growth suppression. In addition, AA provoked significant production of ROS, and antioxidants blocked AA-induced activation of nuclear TG2 and hepatic cell growth suppression. We propose that AA-mediated oxidative stress and TG2 transamidase activity might contribute to chronic liver injury and  and thereby serve as potential therapeutic targets for the chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451521>Effect of Intermittent Versus Continuous Low-Dose Aspirin on Nasal Epithelium Gene Expression in Current Smokers: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Trial.</a></h2><p>A chemopreventive effect of aspirin (ASA) on lung cancer risk is supported by epidemiologic and preclinical studies. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded study in current heavy smokers to compare modulating effects of intermittent versus continuous low-dose ASA on nasal epithelium gene expression and  (ARA) metabolism. Fifty-four participants were randomized to intermittent (ASA 81 mg daily for one week/placebo for one week) or continuous (ASA 81 mg daily) for 12 weeks. Low-dose ASA suppressed urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGEM; change of -4.55 ± 11.52 from baseline 15.44 ± 13.79 ng/mg creatinine for arms combined,  = 0.02), a surrogate of COX-mediated ARA metabolism, but had minimal effects on nasal gene expression of nasal or bronchial gene-expression signatures associated with smoking, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Suppression of urinary PGEM correlated with favorable changes in a smoking-associated gene signature ( < 0.01). Gene set enrichment analysis (GESA) showed that ASA intervention led to 1,079 enriched gene sets from the Canonical Pathways within the Molecular Signatures Database. In conclusion, low-dose ASA had minimal effects on known carcinogenesis gene signatures in nasal epithelium of current smokers but results in wide-ranging genomic changes in the nasal epithelium, demonstrating utility of nasal brushings as a surrogate to measure gene-expression responses to chemoprevention. PGEM may serve as a marker for smoking-associated gene-expression changes and systemic .

This cohort study, preliminary to a randomized control trial (RCT), is aimed at evaluating, in a series of T1D children assuming Mediterranean diet and an intake of cholecalciferol of 1000U/day from T1D onset, if ω-3 co-supplementation preserves the residual endogen insulin secretion (REIS). Therefore, the cohort of 22 "new onsets" of 2017 received ω-3 (eicosapentenoic  (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic  (DHA), 60 mg/kg/day), and were compared retrospectively vs. the 37 "previous onsets" without ω-3 supplementation. Glicosilated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), the daily insulin demand (IU/Kg/day) and IDAA1c, a composite index (calculated as IU/Kg/day × 4 + HbA1c%), as surrogates of REIS, were evaluated at recruitment (T0) and 12 months later (T12).

Therefore, oxylipid profiles may be useful as novel biomarkers of colon polyp presence. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma non-esterified oxylipids and the presence of colon polyps. A total of 123 Caucasian men, ages 48 to 65, were categorized into three groups: those with no polyps, those with one or more hyperplastic polyps, and those with one or more adenomas. Plasma non-esterified oxylipids were analyzed using solid phase extraction and quantified using a targeted HPLC tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA with Dunn's test for multiple comparison and generalized linear models to adjust for confounding factors such as age, anthropometrics, and smoking status. In general, monohydroxy omega-6-derived oxylipids were significantly increased in those with polyps. Concentrations of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (HETE) and 11-HETE were significantly higher in those with hyperplastic polyps and adenomas compared to those with no polyps. -derived HETEs were significantly associated with colon polyp types, even after adjusting for age, smoking, and body mass index or waist circumference in regression models.

Additionally, for the first time in chickens, we evaluated oxygen consumption by platelet mitochondria as a biomarker of mitochondria function in response to ASA- and vE. LPS challenge compromised bird growth rates, but neither dietary ASA nor vE significantly ameliorated this effect; however, gradually increasing dietary vE levels were more effective than basal levels. ASA regulated  metabolism, providing an eicosanoid synthesis substrate, whereas gradually increasing vE levels evoked aspirin resistance during challenge. Gene expression in immune tissues was highly variable, indicating a complex regulatory network controlling inflammatory pathways. However, unlike COX-1, COX-2 and CYP450 exhibited increased mRNA expression in some cases, suggesting an initiation of novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving signals during challenge.

They act mainly by inhibition of cyclooxygenases. Meloxicam (MEL) is a drug designed for cyclooxygenase-2 selectivity, which is upregulated upon , acting as a key enzyme for the conversion of  to prostaglandins. Although some studies in dairy cows showed positive results in recovery from mastitis when MEL was added to the treatments, direct effects of MEL on the immune system of mastitic cows are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of MEL on the immune response of bovine mammary epithelial cells (MEC) with or without simultaneous immune stimulation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns of common mastitis pathogens. Mammary epithelial cells from 4 cows were isolated and cultured. To evaluate dose effects of MEL, MEC were challenged with or without 0.2 µg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS; serotype O26:B6 from Escherichia coli) with addition of increasing concentrations of MEL (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg/mL). The addition of MEL prevented the increase of mRNA expression of key inflammatory factors in LPS-challenged MEC in a dose-dependent manner. To investigate the effects of MEL on pathogen-specific immune responses of MEC, treatments included challenges with LPS from E. coli and lipoteichoic  from Staphylococcus aureus with or without 1.5 mg/mL MEL for 3, 6, and 24 h. Meloxicam prevented the increase of mRNA abundance of key inflammatory mediators in response to LPS and lipoteichoic , such as tumor necrosis factor, serum amyloid A, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the chemokines IL-8 and CXC chemokine ligands 3 and 5. The prostaglandin E synthesis in challenged and nonchallenged cells was reduced by MEL within 24 h. Furthermore, MEL reduced the viability and consequently the total RNA yield of the cells. However, mRNA abundance of apoptosis-related enzymes was not affected by any treatment. Meloxicam had clear dose-dependent effects on the immune response of MEC to pathogen-associated molecular patterns of common mastitis pathogens by preventing increased expression of important factors involved in . This nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug also has detrimental effects on cell viability. How these effects would influence the elimination of pathogens from an infected mammary gland during mastitis therapy with meloxicam needs to be further investigated.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group.

AA metabolites, including COXs and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), are well known immunomodulators. However, the relative contribution of COX-2 and COX-1 isoforms in the downstream proinflammatory responses and cognitive deficit in HH remains unknown. In the present study, AA metabolism via the COX pathway was investigated in Sprague Dawley rats after 0, 1, 3, and 7 days of HH exposure. Furthermore, we investigated the inflammatory response and cell-type-specific induction of both COXs. Our data revealed that AA metabolites peaked on day 3 of HH exposure. Interestingly, we observed endothelial and microglial activation on day 1, accompanied by an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, followed by astrocyte activation on day 3. We showed that the increase in COX activity during HH culminated in a significant increase in hippocampal , concomitant with spatial memory impairment and neuronal injury at day 7 of HH. We showed HH induced distinct COX-1 expression in endothelial and microglial cells, whereas it induced COX-2 expression predominantly in neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes.

We previously reported that diesel engine exhaust (DE) could lead to structural changes in the placenta of in utero exposed rabbits (first generation, F1). The effects of maternal exposure to DE were further studied on second-generation (F2) rabbits. Pregnant F0 females were exposed to filtered, diluted DE (1 mg/m, median particle diameter: 69 nm) or clean filtered air (controls) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week by nose-only exposure during days 3-27 post-conception (dpc). Adult female offspring (F1) were mated to control males: F1 tissues and F2 foeto-placental units were collected at 28 dpc and placental structure and gene expression (microarray) analysed. Fatty  profiles were determined in foetal and maternal plasma, maternal liver and placenta. In F1, compared to controls, hepatic neutral lipid contents were increased in exposed animals without change in the blood biochemistry. In F2, the placental lipid contents were higher, with higher monounsaturated fatty acids and reduced pro-inflammatory  (AA), without placental structural changes.

Lipid mediators are signaling molecules which coordinately and intricately modulate . They are produced from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the cellular membrane via several enzymes including cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX). In the present study, we performed comprehensive analysis of lipid production in milk obtained from clinical or subclinical mastitic cows using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. We detected 26, 24, and 40 kinds of lipid constantly in healthy, subclinical, and clinical mastitic milk, respectively. In clinical mastitic milk, the amount of a major n-6 PUFA,  (AA), tended to increase, whereas amounts of major n-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic , tended to decrease. The amounts of several AA-derived lipids including COX-catalyzed prostaglandin (PG) D and PGE , and LOX-catalyzed leukotriene (LT) B were increased in clinical mastitic milk. Although subclinical mastitic milk represented similar trend of lipid production to healthy milk, amounts of several lipids such as LTD , 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic , and 14-epoxyeicosatrienoic  changed. These findings would be helpful for better understanding of mastitis pathology and give us some insights to develop a new diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231138>Replacement of an Indole Scaffold Targeting Human 15-Lipoxygenase-1 Using Combinatorial Chemistry.</a></h2><p>Human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) belongs to the class of lipoxygenases, which catalyze oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as  and linoleic .

PPAR are nuclear receptors activated by oxidised and nitrated fatty  derivatives as well as by cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGA and 15d-PGJ) during the inflammatory response. This results in the modulation of the pro-inflammatory response, preventing it from being excessively activated. Other activators of these receptors are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (, ALA, EPA, and DHA). The main function of PPAR during the inflammatory reaction is to promote the inactivation of NF-κB. Possible mechanisms of inactivation include direct binding and thus inactivation of p65 NF-κB or ubiquitination leading to proteolytic degradation of p65 NF-κB. PPAR also exert indirect effects on NF-κB. They promote the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, or heme oxygenase-1, resulting in a reduction in the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., secondary transmitters in inflammatory reactions.

At least in the case of COX-2, the enzyme becomes folded into a stable Eallo/Ecat pair. Some COX inhibitors ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coxibs) and common fatty acids (FAs) modulate Ecat activity by binding Eallo. However, the interactions and outcomes often differ between isoforms. For example, naproxen directly and completely inhibits COX-1 by binding Ecat but indirectly and incompletely inhibits COX-2 by binding Eallo. Additionally, COX-1 is allosterically inhibited up to 50% by common FAs like palmitic , whereas COX-2 is allosterically activated 2-fold by palmitic . FA binding to Eallo also affects responses to COX inhibitors. Thus, COXs are physiologically and pharmacologically regulated by the FA tone of the milieu in which each operates-COX-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and COX-2 in the Golgi apparatus. Cross-talk between Eallo and Ecat involves a loop in Eallo immediately downstream of Arg-120. Mutational studies suggest that allosteric modulation requires a direct interaction between the carboxyl group of allosteric effectors and Arg-120 of Eallo; however, structural studies show some allosterically active FAs positioned in COX-2 in a conformation lacking an interaction with Arg-120. Thus, many details about the biological consequences of COX allosterism and how ligand binding to Eallo modulates Ecat remain to be resolved.© 2019 Smith and Malkowski.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30782617>Effects of dietary fat on gut microbiota and faecal metabolites, and their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors: a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial.</a></h2><p>To investigate whether diets differing in fat content alter the gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low-fat diet to a diet high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate.In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18-35 years; body mass index <28 kg/m; 52% women) who completed the whole trial were included.

Important factors associated with resistance are gender; or  possibly associated with membrane microparticles (MP). It was decided to challenge the hypothesis that differential responses to dual antiplatelet therapy are conditioned by gender and/or proinflammatory status. The study involved 160 patients with stable coronary heart disease (118 men, 42 women) aged 65.2 ± 7.8 years. Patients were treated long-term with acetylsalicylic  (ASA); plus clopidogrel starting 6 days before percutaneous coronary intervention (both 75 mg/day). Response was evaluated using platelet aggregation with either  (the ASPI test; predominantly for ASA response) or adenosine diphosphate (the ADP test; predominantly for clopidogrel response). MP levels were measured as follows: total (MP-total); with TF expression (MP-TF); or platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP), as well as proinflammatory parameters: C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes (WBC) and platelet numbers (PLT). Analysis of platelet-aggregation levels with regard to gender revealed higher aggregation in women: with resistance to ASA (ASPI test: P = 0.0383, ADP test: P = 0.0027); resistance to clopidogrel (ASPI test: P = 0.0003; ADP test: P = 0.0566) and with sensitivity to both drugs with the ADP test (P = 0.0190). In women relative to men, regardless of response, significantly higher CRP (P = 0.0012), WBC (P = 0.0244) and PLT numbers (P = 0.0001) were found. In contrast, in men significantly higher concentrations of MP-TF (P = 0.0286) and triglycerides (P = 0.0296) were found in the clopidogrel-resistant group. We conclude that women have an inferior response to dual antiplatelet therapy relative to men, possibly associated with higher platelet reactivity (especially when measured with the ADP test), with a more accentuated proinflammatory status.

AA distributes differentially across membrane phospholipids, which is largely due to the action of coenzyme A-independent transacylase (CoA-IT), an enzyme that moves the fatty  primarily from diacyl phospholipid species to ether-containing species, particularly the ethanolamine plasmalogens. In this work, we examined the dependence of AA remodeling on plasmalogen content using the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and its plasmalogen-deficient variants RAW.12 and RAW.108. All three strains remodeled AA between phospholipids with similar magnitude and kinetics, thus demonstrating that cellular plasmalogen content does not influence the process. Cell stimulation with yeast-derived zymosan also had no effect on AA remodeling, but incubating the cells in AA-rich media markedly slowed down the process. Further, knockdown of cytosolic-group IVC phospholipase Aγ (cPLAγ) by RNA silencing significantly reduced AA remodeling, while inhibition of other major phospholipase A forms such as cytosolic phospholipase Aα, calcium-independent phospholipase Aβ, or secreted phospholipase A had no effect. These results uncover new regulatory features of CoA-IT-mediated transacylation reactions in cellular AA homeostasis and suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for cPLAγ in maintaining membrane phospholipid composition via regulation of AA remodeling.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30563864>5-oxoETE triggers nociception in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome through MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor D.</a></h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by chronic abdominal pain concurrent with altered bowel habit. Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) metabolites are increased in abundance in IBS and are implicated in the alteration of sensation to mechanical stimuli, which is defined as visceral hypersensitivity. We sought to quantify PUFA metabolites in patients with IBS and evaluate their role in pain. Quantification of PUFA metabolites by mass spectrometry in colonic biopsies showed an increased abundance of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic  (5-oxoETE) only in biopsies taken from patients with IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C). Local administration of 5-oxoETE to mice induced somatic and visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli without causing tissue . We found that 5-oxoETE directly acted on both human and mouse sensory neurons as shown by lumbar splanchnic nerve recordings and Ca imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We showed that 5-oxoETE selectively stimulated nonpeptidergic, isolectin B4 (IB4)-positive DRG neurons through a phospholipase C (PLC)- and pertussis toxin-dependent mechanism, suggesting that the effect was mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The MAS-related GPCR D (Mrgprd) was found in mouse colonic DRG afferents and was identified as being implicated in the noxious effects of 5-oxoETE. Together, these data suggest that 5-oxoETE, a potential biomarker of IBS-C, induces somatic and visceral hyperalgesia without  in an Mrgprd-dependent manner. Thus, 5-oxoETE may play a pivotal role in the abdominal pain associated with IBS-C.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

A critical PUFA,  (ARA), is metabolized to a diverse set of lipids signaling molecules through cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, or cytochrome P450 hydroxylase; however, the majority of ARA is metabolized into anti-inflammatory epoxides  cytochrome P450 enzymes. These short-lived epoxide lipids are rapidly metabolized or inactivated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) into diol-containing products. sEH inhibition or knockout has been a practical approach to study the biology of the epoxide lipids, and has been shown to effectively treat inflammatory conditions in the preclinical models including gastrointestinal ulcers and colitis by shifting oxylipins to epoxide profiles, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and activation, and enhancing epithelial cell defense  increased mucin production, thus providing further evidence for the role of sEH as a pro-inflammatory protein. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with COX-inhibitor activity are among the most commonly used analgesics and have demonstrated applications in the management of cardiovascular disease and intriguingly cancer. Major side effects of NSAIDs however are gastrointestinal ulcers which frequently precludes their long-term application. In this review, we hope to bridge the gap between NSAID toxicity and sEH-mediated metabolic pathways to focus on the role of epoxy fatty  metabolic pathway of PUFAs in NSAIDS-ulcer formation and healing as well as -related carcinogenesis. Specifically we address the potential application of sEH inhibition to enhance ulcer healing at the site of   their activity on altered lipid signaling, mitochondrial function, and diminished reactive oxygen species, and further discuss the significance of dual COX and sEH inhibitor in anti- and carcinogenesis.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400131>The Immunomodulatory and Anti-Inflammatory Role of Polyphenols.</a></h2><p>This review offers a systematic understanding about how polyphenols target multiple inflammatory components and lead to anti-inflammatory mechanisms. It provides a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds. Polyphenols regulate immunity by interfering with immune cell regulation, proinflammatory cytokines' synthesis, and gene expression. They inactivate NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and modulate mitogen-activated protein Kinase (MAPk) and  acids pathways. Polyphenolic compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AkT), inhibitor of kappa kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (IKK/JNK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which is a protein complex that controls protein synthesis, and JAK/STAT. They can suppress toll-like receptor (TLR) and pro-inflammatory genes' expression. Their antioxidant activity and ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of eicosanoids contribute as well to their anti- properties. They inhibit certain enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species ROS production like xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase (NOX) while they upregulate other endogenous antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione (GSH) peroxidase (Px). Furthermore, they inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) leading to a reduction in the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) and  antagonism. The effects of these biologically active compounds on the immune system are associated with extended health benefits for different chronic inflammatory diseases. Studies of plant extracts and compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to  such as diabetes, obesity, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, among other conditions.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30658644>A specific combined long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  supplementation reverses fatty  profile alterations in a mouse model of chronic asthma.</a></h2><p>The immune-modulating potential of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) based on their conversion into lipid mediators in inflammatory situations has been proven by several studies. Respecting the immune-modulative role of lipid mediators in bronchoconstriction, airway  and resolution of inflammatory processes, LCPUFAs play an important role in asthma. To design a disease-specific and most beneficial LCPUFA supplementation strategy, it is essential to understand how asthma alters LCPUFA profiles. Therefore, this study characterizes the alterations of LCPUFA profiles induced by allergic asthma. In addition, this study explores whether a simple eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) alone or a specific combined LCPUFA supplementation could restore imbalanced LCPUFA profiles.Mice were sensitized with a daily dose of 40 μg house dust mite (HDM)-extract in a recall model and fed with either normal diet, EPA or a specific combined (sc)-LCPUFA supplementation containing EPA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), γ -linolenic  (GLA) and stearidonic  (SDA) for 24 days. After recall with HDM, mice were sacrificed and blood and lung tissue were collected. Fatty  profiles were determined in plasma, blood cells and lung cells of asthmatic mice by capillary gas-chromatography.In lung cells of asthmatic mice,  (AA, p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) were increased while dihomo-γ-linolenic  (DGLA, p < 0.05) was decreased. EPA supplementation increased only EPA (p < 0.001) and docosapentaenoic  (DPA, p < 0.001), but neither DGLA nor DHA in lung cells of asthmatic mice. In contrast, a specific combined dietary supplementation containing n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs could decrease AA (p < 0.001), increase EPA (p < 0.001), DPA (p < 0.001) and DHA (p < 0.01) and could reverse the lack of DGLA (p < 0.05).In summary, allergic asthma alters LCPUFA profiles in blood and lung tissue. In contrast to the EPA supplementation, the distinct combination of n-3 and n-6 LCPUFAs restored the LCPUFA profiles in lung tissue of asthmatic mice completely. Subsequently, sc-LCPUFA supplementation is likely to be highly supportive in limiting and resolving the inflammatory process in asthma.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598849>TLR4 knockout can improve dysfunction of β-cell by rebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats.</a></h2><p>Studies showed that TLR4 knockout (TLR4) could mitigate obesity and insulin resistance induced by high-fat diet in rats. In this study, we further investigated the effects of TLR4 on islet function and pancreatic proteomics in obese rats by high-fat diet.PA-induced lipotoxicity β-cells, SD and TLR4 rats were used in this study. iTRAQ was used to screen out meaningful differential proteins.The protein expression level was evaluated by Western blotting; the cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay.TLR4 could reduce inflammatory and regulate body composition in obese rats, and improve β-cells function. The quantitative analysis of protein revealed that TLR4 rebalanced proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats. In addition, the pathways involved in differential proteins were mainly metabolic pathways,  metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction, pancreatic secretion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Further analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) revealed that Stk39 and Ass1 interacting through Mapk14-Ywhae were node proteins and participated in inflammatory response, carboxylic  metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process. In vitro experiments we confirmed that silencing TLR4 can inhibit PA-induced β-cell apoptosis, insulin secretion disorders, and increase Ass1 expression. While, overexpression of Ass1 in β-cell inhibited PA or LPS-induced β-cell damage.Our study confirmed that TLR4 could improve dysfunction of β-cell, and the underlying mechanism might be involved in ebalancing proteomics disorders in pancreas, affecting the expression of Ass1.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429830>PGE2 Augments Inflammasome Activation and M1 Polarization in Macrophages Infected With  Typhimurium and .</a></h2><p>Eicosanoids are cellular metabolites, which shape the immune response, including inflammatory processes in macrophages. The effects of these lipid mediators on  and bacterial pathogenesis are not clearly understood. Certain eicosanoids are suspected to act as molecular sensors for the recruitment of neutrophils, while others regulate bacterial uptake. In this study, gene expression analyses indicated that genes involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis including COX-1, COX-2, DAGL, and PLA-2 are differentially regulated in THP-1 human macrophages infected with  Typhimurium or . By using targeted metabolomics approach, we found that the eicosanoid precursor,  (AA) as well as its derivatives, including prostaglandins (PGs) PGF2α or PGE2/PGD2, and thromboxane TxB2, are rapidly secreted from macrophages infected with these Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. The magnitude of eicosanoid biosynthesis in infected host cells depends on the presence of virulence factors of  and  Typhimurium strains, albeit in an opposite way in  compared to  Typhimurium infection. Trials with combinations of EP2/EP4 PGE2 receptor agonists and antagonists suggest that PGE2 signaling in these infection models works primarily through the EP4 receptor. Downstream of EP4 activation, PGE2 enhances inflammasome activation and represses M2 macrophage polarization while inducing key M1-type markers. PGE2 also led to a decreased numbers of  within macrophages.

Microglia are the resident mononuclear immune cells of the central nervous system, and they play essential roles in the maintenance of homeostasis and responses to neuroinflammation. The orphan G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) has been reported to modulate  and is expressed in immune cells such as monocytes and microglia. However, its effects on neuroinflammation, mainly on the production of members of the  pathway in activated microglia, have not been elucidated in detail.In this present study, a series of coumarin derivatives, that exhibit GPR55 antagonism properties, were designed. The effects of these compounds on members of the  cascade were studied in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary rat microglia using Western blot, qPCR, and ELISA.We demonstrate here that the various compounds with GPR55 antagonistic activities significantly inhibited the release of PGE in primary microglia. The inhibition of LPS-induced PGE release by the most potent candidate KIT 17 was partially dependent on reduced protein synthesis of mPGES-1 and COX-2. KIT 17 did not affect any key enzyme involved on the endocannabinoid system. We furthermore show that microglia expressed GPR55 and that a synthetic antagonist of the GPR receptor (ML193) demonstrated the same effect of the KIT 17 on the inhibition of PGE.Our results suggest that KIT 17 is acting as an inverse agonist on GPR55 independent of the endocannabinoid system.

To this end, we used mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approaches combined with strategies to generate monocytes with different concentrations of AA.

On the contrary, the AA pool in triacylglycerol is expandable and can accommodate relatively large amounts of fatty . Stimulation of the cells with opsonized zymosan results in the expected decreases of cellular AA. Under all conditions examined, all of the AA decreases observed in stimulated cells were accounted for by decreases in the phospholipid pool; we failed to detect any contribution of the triacylglycerol pool to the response. Experiments utilizing selective inhibitors of phospholipid or triacylglyerol hydrolysis confirmed that the phospholipid pool is the sole contributor of the AA liberated by stimulated cells. Thus, the AA in the triacylglycerol is not a source of free AA for the lipid mediator signaling during stimulation of human foamy monocytes and may be used for other cellular functions.</p><p>Keyword: inflammation</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30731197>A molecular view of the function and pharmacology of -sensing ion channels.</a></h2><p>The pH in the different tissues and organs of our body is kept within tight limits.

ASIC inhibitors could be used as analgesic and anxiolytic drugs, and as drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke. For these reasons, ASICs have recently attracted increasing attention. Currently, no drugs are clinically used as ASIC modulators. ASICs are however targets of several peptide toxins from animals.

Dietary fatty acids, which are increased systemically in obese patients and are further increased after high-fat meals, affect the innate immune system and may contribute to dysfunctional immune responses to respiratory infection. In this study we investigated the effects of dietary fatty acids on immune responses to respiratory infection in pulmonary fibroblasts and a bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). Cells were challenged with BSA-conjugated fatty acids (ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFAs], ω-3 PUFAs, or saturated fatty acids [SFAs]) +/- the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic  (poly[I:C]) or bacterial compound lipoteichoic  (LTA), and release of proinflammatory cytokines was measured. In both cell types, challenge with  (AA) (ω-6 PUFA) and poly(I:C) or LTA led to substantially greater IL-6 and CXCL8 release than either challenge alone, demonstrating synergy. In epithelial cells, palmitic  (SFA) combined with poly(I:C) also led to greater IL-6 release. The underlying signaling pathways of AA and poly(I:C)- or LTA-induced cytokine release were examined using specific signaling inhibitors and IB. Cytokine production in pulmonary fibroblasts was prostaglandin dependent, and synergistic upregulation occurred via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, whereas cytokine production in bronchial epithelial cell lines was mainly mediated through JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. We confirmed these findings using rhinovirus infection, demonstrating that AA enhances rhinovirus-induced cytokine release.
