The activity of platelet Na+/H+ exchanger was measured in platelet rich plasma, using an optical swelling assay, according to Rosskopf et al.

We found that Na+/H+ exchange rate was significantly higher in diabetic patients in comparison to the controls (p = 0.0009). There was also a positive correlation between the activity of Na+/H+ exchanger and phospholipid dependent procoagulant activity in all plasma fractions. We did not find a significant association between Na+/H+ exchanger activity and metabolic parameters studied, however in patients with HbA1c level > 7.5% higher Na+/H+ exchange rates were noted. Total procoagulant activity did not rise significantly in diabetic patients, but was markedly higher in platelet poor and platelet filtrated plasma. It was supposed that it originated from platelet derived microparticles, enriched in phospholipids.

A commercial ELISA was used to determine the serum levels of anti-beta2-GPI (Immunotech) in isotypes IgG and IgA, and anti-cardiolipin levels (Milenia) in IgG and IgM. aPL screening also included L-alpha-phosphatidic acid, , L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol, L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol, and L-alpha-phosphatidyl-serine (Sigma, U.S.A.) in IgG and IgM. Statistical analysis of all aPL levels was made by cut-off levels for Ig isotypes by using 3 SD or 95th percentile calculated using STATGRAPHICS.Positive levels of antibodies against beta2-GPI in IgA are more frequently associated with a diagnosis of anti-phospholipid syndrome, pre-eclampsia, and autoimmune disease in pregnant women than with  in pregnancy.

Pregnant patients with  had higher serum levels in aPLs to DL-glycerol, inositol, L-serine, and beta2-glycoprotein. Positive aPL levels predominate in isotype IgG.

To characterize the process of intracellular bilirubin transport, the kinetic and thermodynamic activation parameters for the spontaneous transfer of bilirubin between small unilamellar egg lecithin vesicles were determined. Bilirubin-IX alpha was added to donor vesicles labeled with the fluorescent phospholipid probe, (5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl) dipalmitoyl- (dansyl-PE). When bound to the donor vesicles, bilirubin quenches the dansyl probe fluorescence through resonance energy transfer. The movement of bilirubin from dansyl-labeled donor vesicles to unlabeled acceptor vesicles was monitored directly by the reemergence of dansyl fluorescence over time. Vesicle fusion and intervesicle transfer of the dansyl-PE probe were excluded by quasielastic light scattering and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies. Stopped-flow analysis demonstrated that the transfer of bilirubin was described by a single-exponential function with a mean half-time of 2.0 +/- 0.1 ms (+/- SD) at 37 degrees C. The rate of bilirubin transfer was independent of acceptor vesicle concentration and decreased with increasing buffer ionic strength, indicating that intermembrane transfer occurred via aqueous diffusion, rather than vesicle collisions. The free energy of activation (delta G++) for the dissociation of bilirubin from donor vesicles was 14.2 kcal.mol-1. These studies suggest that bilirubin is associated with phospholipid bilayers at the membrane-water interface. We postulate that the movement of unconjugated bilirubin between intracellular membranes occurs via spontaneous transfer through the aqueous phase.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7546703>Lipofection reagents prepared by a simple ethanol injection technique.</a></h2><p>Cationic liposomes are being utilized for the delivery of DNA into mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Flow-cytometry was used for CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes analysis, commercial kits were used for VL-measurements, and commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine serum levels of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (GPI) of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA isotypes, and anticardiolipin levels (ACA) of IgG and IgM isotypes. APLs screening also included L-alpha-phosphatidic (ph) acid, , L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol, L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol, and L-alpha-phosphatidylserine of IgG and IgM autoantibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using cut-off levels for immunoglobulin-isotypes of aPLs using 3 S.D. or 95th percentile calculated using Statgraphics-software.In 14 of 21 patients treated by HAART an increased number of CD4+ T lymphocytes was detected, and in 14 of 21 patients VL decreased below detection threshold during the 5 years of observation.

Under the emulsified reaction system, both phospholipase and glycolipid hydrolytic activities were observed, except for the predominant lipase activity. The optimum conditions for different activity exhibition were also determined. Compared with its lipase activity, a little higher ratio of glycolipid hydrolytic activity (0.06) than phospholipase activity (0.02) was found. rGZEL preferred medium chain-length triglycerides, while lower activity was found for the longer-chain triglyceride. Using the monomolecular film technique, we found that the preference order of rGZEL to different phospholipids was 1,2-diacyl--glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS) > 1,2-dioleoyl--glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) sodium salt (PG) > 1,2-dioleoyl--glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) > l-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI) > cardiolipin (CL) > 3--phosphatidic acid sodium salt (PA) > l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), while no hydrolytic activity was detected for sphingomyelin (SM). Moreover, rGZEL showed higher galactolipase activity on 1,2-distearoyimonoglactosylglyceride (MGDG). A kinetic study on the stereo- and regioselectivity of rGZEL was also performed by using three pairs of pseudodiglyceride enantiomers (DDGs). rGZEL presented higher preference for distal DDG enantiomers than adjacent ester groups, however, no hydrolytic activity to the -2 position of diglyceride analogs was found.

Because of potent synergism, the antiviral selectivity of the diacylated L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine analog is > 10(4) when coadministered with azidothymidine.

(1996) Biochemistry 35, 11361-11368]. In contrast, the antimicrobial peptide buforin 2 discovered in the stomach tissue of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans efficiently crosses lipid bilayers without inducing severe membrane permeabilization or lipid flip-flop, and the Pro(11) residue plays a key role in this unique property [Kobayashi, S, Takeshima, K., Park, C. B., Kim, S. C., and Matsuzaki, K. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 8648-8654]. To elucidate the translocation mechanism, the secondary structure and the orientation of the peptide in lipid bilayers as well as the effects of the peptide concentration, the lipid composition, and the cis-trans isomerization of the Pro peptide bond on translocation efficiency were investigated. The translocation efficiencies of F10W-buforin 2 (BF2), P11A-BF2, and F5W-magainin 2 (MG2) across egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (EYPG)/egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (1/1) bilayers were dependent supralinearly on the peptide concentration, suggesting that the translocation mechanisms of these peptides are similar. The incorporation of the negative curvature-inducing lipid egg yolk L-alpha -phosphatidylethanolamine completely suppressed the translocation of BF2, indicating the induction of the positive curvature by BF2 on the membrane is related to the translocation process, similarly to MG2. In pure EYPG, where the repulsion between polycationic BF2 molecules is reduced, membrane permeabilization and coupling lipid flip-flop were clearly observed. Structural studies by use of Fourier transform infrared-polarized attenuated total reflection spectroscopy indicated that BF2 assumed distorted helical structures in EYPG/EYPC bilayers. A BF2 analogue with an alpha-methylproline, which fixed the peptide bond to the trans configuration, translocated similarly to the parent peptide, suggesting the cis-trans isomerization of the Pro peptide bond is not involved in the translocation process. These results indicate that BF2 crosses lipid bilayers via a mechanism similar to that of MG2. The presence of Pro(11) distorts the helix, concentrating basic amino acid residues in a limited amphipathic region, thus destabilizing the pore by enhanced electrostatic repulsion, enabling efficient translocation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22619539>Comparison of two kinds of nanomedicine for targeted gene therapy: premodified or postmodified gene delivery systems.</a></h2><p>The applications of ligand-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified nanocarriers have now emerged, as well as recognized strategies to provide the vectors with active targeting properties.

Neuraminidase activity, which resides in the glycoprotein NA, was inactivated exponentially with an increasing radiation dose, yielding a target size of 94 +/- 5 kilodaltons (kDa), in reasonable agreement with that of the disulfide-bonded dimer (120 kDa). All the other activities studied are properties of the HA glycoprotein and were normalized to the known molecular weight of the neuraminidase dimer. Virus-induced fusion activity was measured by two phospholipid dilution assays: relief of energy transfer between N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)dipalmitoyl-L-alpha- phosphatidylethanolamine (N-NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-dioleoyl- (N-Rh-PE) in target liposomes and relief of self-quenching of N-Rh-PE in target liposomes. Radiation inactivation of fusion activity proceeded exponentially with radiation dose, yielding normalized target sizes of 68 +/- 6 kDa by assay i and 70 +/- 4 kDa by assay ii. These values are close to the molecular weight of a single disulfide-bonded (HA1 + HA2) unit (75 kDa), the "monomer" of the HA trimer. A single monomer is thus inactivated by each radiation event, and each monomer (or some part of it) constitutes a minimal functional unit capable of mediating fusion. Virus-induced leakage of calcein from target liposomes and virus-induced leakage of hemoglobin from erythrocytes (hemolysis) both showed more complex inactivation behavior: a pronounced shoulder was present in both inactivation curves, followed by a steep drop in activity at higher radiation levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12765548>Phospholipase activity on N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines is critically dependent on the N-acyl chain length.</a></h2><p>We have recently shown that an endogenous phospholipase A2 from bovine erythrocytes does not hydrolyse NAPEs (N-acyl L-alpha-phosphatidylethanolamines), which accumulate remarkably in this system [Florin-Christensen, Suarez, Florin-Christensen, Wainszelbaum, Brown, McElwain and Palmer (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 7736-7741]. Here we investigate the causes underlying this resistance. N-acylation of PE () results in alteration of charge, head-group volume and conformation, the last two features depending on the N-acyl chain length. To evaluate each effect separately, we synthesized NAPEs with selected N-acyl chain length. We found that phospholipase A2 has considerable activity against N-acetyl PE, but is poorly active against N-butanoyl PE and only marginally active against N-hexanoyl PE, whereas the activity is completely lost when N-hexadecanoyl PE is presented as a substrate. On the other hand, N-hexanoyl PE does not inhibit phospholipase A2 activity, suggesting that this substrate fails to enter the hydrophobic channel. Phospholipase C presents a similar, but less sharp pattern. Molecular dynamics simulations of the polar head group of selected NAPEs reveal a substantially increased conformational variability as the N-acyl chain grows. This larger conformational space represents an increased impairment limiting the access of these molecules to the active site. Our data indicate that, whereas a change in charge contributes to diminished activity, the most relevant effects come from steric hindrance related to the growth of the N-acyl chain.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12054874>The activation energy for insertion of transmembrane alpha-helices is dependent on membrane composition.</a></h2><p>The physical mechanisms that govern the folding and assembly of integral membrane proteins are poorly understood. It appears that certain properties of the lipid bilayer affect membrane protein folding in vitro, either by modulating helix insertion or packing. In order to begin to understand the origin of this effect, we investigate the effect of lipid forces on the insertion of a transmembrane alpha-helix using a water-soluble, alanine-based peptide, KKAAAIAAAAAIAAWAAIAAAKKKK-amide. This peptide binds to preformed 1,2-dioleoyl-l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles at neutral pH, but spontaneous transmembrane helix insertion directly from the aqueous phase only occurs at high pH when the Lys residues are de-protonated. These results suggest that the translocation of charge is a major determinant of the activation energy for insertion. Time-resolved measurements of the insertion process at high pH indicate biphasic kinetics with time constants of ca 30 and 430 seconds. The slower phase seems to correlate with formation of a predominantly transmembrane alpha-helical conformation, as determined from the transfer of the tryptophan residue to the hydrocarbon region of the membrane. Temperature-dependent measurements showed that insertion can proceed only above a certain threshold temperature and that the Arrhenius activation energy is of the order of 90 kJ mol(-1). The kinetics, threshold temperature and the activation energy change with the mole fraction of 1,2-dioleoyl- (DOPE) introduced into the DOPC membrane. The activation energy increases with increasing DOPE content, which could reflect the fact that this lipid drives the bilayer towards a non-bilayer transition and increases the lateral pressure in the lipid chain region. This suggests that folding events involving the insertion of helical segments across the bilayer can be controlled by lipid forces.(c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8784191>An antimicrobial peptide, magainin 2, induced rapid flip-flop of phospholipids coupled with pore formation and peptide translocation.</a></h2><p>The effect of an antimicrobial peptide, magainin 2, on the flip-flop rates of phospholipids was investigated by use of fluorescent lipids, i.e., anionic N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)dipalmitoyl-L-alpha- phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE), 1-oleoyl-2-[12-((7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)- dodecanoyl]-L-alpha-phosphatidic acid (C12-NBD-PA), 1-oleoyl-2-[12- ((7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)- amino)dodecanoyl]-L-alpha-phosphatidyl-L-serine (C12-NBD-PS), and zwitterionic 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-((7- nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)caproyl]-L-alpha-phosphatidy lcholine (C6-NBD-PC).

The peptide accelerated the flip-flop half-lives of the fluorescent lipids to an order of minutes. Furthermore, the flip-flop was coupled with the membrane permeabilization and the peptide translocation [Matsuzaki, K., Murase, O., Fujii, N., & Miyajima, K. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6521-6526], suggesting pore-mediated flip-flop. The flip-flop rate was independent of the initial labeling conditions (outer leaflet label or inner leaflet label). From these results, a model was proposed, in which the lipids translocate across the membrane by lateral diffusion along the wall of the pores composed of the peptides and the lipids.

Therefore, we visualized liposome penetration into the human skin by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in vitro. Liposomes were prepared from phospholipids in different compositions and labeled with a fluorescent lipid bilayer marker, N-Rh-PE (-N-lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl). Fluorescently labelled liposomes were not able to penetrate into the granular layers of epidermis. However, the fluorescence from liposome compositions containing DOPE (dioleylphosphatidyl ethanolamine) was able to penetrate deeper into the stratum corneum than that from liposomes without DOPE. Pretreatment of skin with unlabeled liposomes containing DOPE or lyso-phosphatidyl choline (lyso-PC) enhanced the subsequent penetration of the fluorescent markers, N-Rh-PE and sulforhodamine B into the skin, suggesting possible enhancer activity, while most liposomes did not show such enhancement. Resonance energy transfer (RET) and calcein release assay between stratum corneum lipid liposomes (SCLLs) and the phospholipid vesicles suggested that the liposomes containing DOPE may fuse or mix with skin lipids in vitro and loosen the SCLL bilayers, respectively. Among the factors not affecting stratum corneum penetration were: negative charge, cholesterol inclusion and acyl chain length of the phospholipids.

Aggregation of these stripped coated vesicles (s-CV) is observed when they are placed under conditions that approximate the pH and ionic strength of the cell interior (pH 7.2, approximately 100 mM salt). This s-CV aggregation reaction is rapid (t1/2 < or = 0.5 min), independent of temperature within a range of 4-37 degrees C, and unaffected by ATP, guanosine-5\'-O-(3-thiophosphate), and in particular EGTA, distinguishing it from Ca(2+)-dependent membrane aggregation reactions. The process is driven by the action of membrane-associated AP molecules since partial proteolysis results in a full loss of activity and since aggregation is abolished by pretreatment of the s-CVs with a monoclonal antibody that reacts with the alpha subunit of AP-2. However, vesicle aggregation is not inhibited by PPPi, indicating that the previously characterized polyphosphate-sensitive AP-2 self-association is not responsible for the reaction. The vesicle aggregation reaction can be reconstituted: liposomes of phospholipid composition approximating that found on the cytoplasmic surfaces of the plasma membrane and of coated vesicles (70%  (type I-A), 15% L-alpha-phosphatidyl-L-serine, and 15% L-alpha-phosphatidylinositol) aggregated after addition of AP-2, but not of AP-1, AP-3 (AP180), or pure clathrin triskelions. Aggregation of liposomes is abolished by limited proteolysis of AP-2 with trypsin. In addition, a highly purified AP-2 alpha preparation devoid of beta causes liposome aggregation, whereas pure beta subunit does not, consistent with results obtained in the s-CV assay which also indicate the involvement of the alpha subunit. Using a fluorescence energy transfer assay we show that AP-2 does not cause fusion of liposomes under physiological solution conditions. However, since the fusion of membranes necessarily requires the close opposition of the two participating bilayers, the AP-2-dependent vesicle aggregation events that we have identified may represent an initial step in the formation and fusion of endosomes that occur subsequent to endocytosis and clathrin uncoating in vivo.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23919556>Influence of phospholipid composition on self-assembly and energy-transfer efficiency in  of light-harvesting 2 complexes.</a></h2><p>In the photosynthetic membrane of purple bacteria  of light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes capture the sunlight and transfer the excitation energy. In order to investigate the mutual relationship between the supramolecular organization of the pigment-protein complexes and their biological function, the LH2 complexes were reconstituted into three types of phospholipid membranes, consisting of L-α-phosphatidylglycerol (PG), L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), and L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/PG/cardiolipin (CL). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the type of phospholipids had a crucial influence on the clustering tendency of the LH2 complexes increased from PG over PC to PE/PG/CL, where the LH2 complexes formed large, densely packed clusters. Time-resolved spectroscopy uncovered a strong quenching of the LH2 fluorescence that is ascribed to singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet annihilation by an efficient energy transfer between the LH2 complexes in the artificial membrane systems. Quantitative analysis reveals that the intercomplex energy transfer efficiency varies strongly as a function of the morphology of the nanostructure, namely in the order PE/PG/CL > PC > PG, which is in line with the clustering tendency of LH2 observed by AFM. These results suggest a strong influence of the phospholipids on the self-assembly of LH2 complexes into  and concomitantly on the intercomplex energy transfer efficiency.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21261259>Nanotrap and mass analysis of aromatic molecules by phenyl group-modified nanoparticle.</a></h2><p>To functionalize the surface of nanoparticles with phenyl groups for subsequent cross-linking with aromatic molecules by mutual interactions, we prepared functional nanoparticles (d = 3 nm) by silanization with phenyl-triethoxysilane.

This increase was abolished by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalaprilat, given in vivo. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for enhanced eicosanoid production by glomeruli from rats with BUO, we measured the activities of phospholipase (PL) A2 and C and cyclooxygenase in glomeruli isolated from SOC and BUO rats. L-alpha-Phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific and  (PE)-specific PLA2 activities were significantly greater in glomerular membranes from rats with BUO than from SOC rats. Likewise, both the activity and amount of cyclooxygenase were significantly greater in glomerular membranes of rats with BUO. Cyclooxygenase and the PE-specific PLA2 in glomerular membranes of rats with BUO remained at the levels seen in SOC rats when animals were treated in vivo before BUO with the ACE inhibitor, enalaprilat, and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, OKY-046. Thus inhibition of vasoconstrictor formation leads to subsequent inhibition of vasodilator formation. In contrast to PE-specific PLA2, PC-specific PLA2 activities were further increased in glomerular membranes from both SOC and BUO rats pretreated with the two drugs.s The activity of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C (PIP2 PLC) was significantly decreased in glomeruli from rats with BUO compared with SOC rats. We conclude that the increased synthesis of vasodilatory eicosanoids by glomeruli from rats with BUO may be mediated by enhanced activities of PE-specific PLA2 and cyclooxygenase, which are apparently stimulated by the vasoconstrictors angiotensin and thromboxane.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12800138>Optimal covalent immobilization of glucose oxidase-containing liposomes for highly stable biocatalyst in bioreactor.</a></h2><p>The glucose oxidase-containing liposomes (GOL) were prepared by entrapping glucose oxidase (GO) in the liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), dimyristoyl  (DMPE), and cholesterol (Chol) and then covalently immobilized in the glutaraldehyde-activated chitosan gel beads. The immobilized GOL gel beads (IGOL) were characterized to obtain a highly stable biocatalyst applicable to bioreactor. At first, the glutaraldehyde concentration used in the gel beads activation as well as the immobilizing temperature and time were optimized to enhance the immobilization yield of the GOL to the highest extent. The liposome membrane composition and liposome size were then optimized to obtain the greatest possible immobilization yield of the GOL, the highest possible activity efficiency of the IGOL, and the lowest possible leakage of the entrapped GO during the GOL immobilization. As a result, the optimal immobilization conditions were found to be as follows: the liposome composition, PC/DMPE/Chol = 65/5/30 (molar percentage); the liposome size, 100 nm; the glutaraldehyde concentration, 2% (w/v); the immobilizing temperature, 4 degrees C; and the immobilizing time, 10 h. Furthermore, the optimal IGOL prepared were characterized by its rapidly increasing effective GO activity to the externally added substrate (glucose) with increasing temperature from 20 to 40 degrees C, and also by its high stability at 40 degrees C against not only the thermal denaturation in a long-term (7 days) incubation but also the bubbling stress in a bubble column. Finally, compared to the conventionally immobilized glucose oxidase (IGO), the higher operational stability of the optimal IGOL was verified by using it either repeatedly (4 times) or for a long time (7 days) to catalyze the glucose oxidation in a small-scale airlift bioreactor.Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is also known that the metastability in PE becomes more pronounced with decreasing acyl chain-length. In an attempt to study the metastable phase behavior of PE, we have synthesized diundecanoylphosphatidylethanolamine (diC11PE) and examined its polymorphic phase behavior. A single endothermic transition at 38 degrees C is detected between 10 and 55 degrees C by DSC for the nonheated sample of diC11PE in excess water. An immediate second heating scan done after cooling slowly of the same sample from the liquid-crystalline state shows a smaller endothermic transition at a lower temperature, 18 degrees C. However, the high-temperature transition at 38 degrees C can be detected, if the sample which has been heated above 38 degrees C is quench cooled from the liquid-crystalline to a temperature between 18 and 38 degrees C. Furthermore, two endothermic transitions at 18 and 38 degrees C and an exothermic transition at 19 degrees C are recorded for diC11PE after quench supercooling of the sample from the liquid-crystalline state to an appropriate temperature below 10 degrees C. The gel-state metastability of diC11PE can be most appropriately explained in terms of changes in interbilayer headgroup-headgroup interactions.

In this paper, a new kind of lipid coated upconverting nanoparticles consisiting of upconerting nanocrystal core and targeted lipid polymer shell was first reported for NIR triggered photodynamic therapy and cell imaging simultaneously. The lipid coated upconverting nanoparticles offers advantages to overcome the problem mentioned above. The UCN core works as a transducer to convert deeply penetrating near-infrared light to visible lights for activating photosensitizer and cell fluorescence imaging simultaneously. The amphiphilic lipid polymer RGD peptide conjugated poly (maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) grafted dioleoyl l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (RGD-PMAO-DOPE) acts as a shield. It can protect the system from catching by RES and target the whole system to the lesions. The experiment results show that the lipid coated upconverting nanoparticle is individual nanosphere with an average size of 20 nm. The drug loading can reach 9%. After NIR exposed, the MC540 was activated to produce singlet oxygen (ROS) successfully by the upconverting fluorescence emitted from UCN. Importantly, compared with nanoparticle without RGD decoration, the lipid coated upconverting nanoparticle can co-deliver the MC540 and UCNs into the same cell with higher efficiency. Besides, the MC540 loaded UCN/RGD-PMAO-DOPE nanoparticles showed significant inhibitory effect on tumor cells after NIR shining. Our data suggests that MC540 loaded UCN/RGD-PMAO-DOPE nanoparticle may be a useful nanoplatform for future PDT treatment in deep-cancer therapy.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

D., and Sharp, P. A. (2004) The RNAi revolution, Nature 430, 161-164]. Synthetic double-stranded RNA sequences (siRNA) of 21-23 nucleotides have been shown in particular to have the potential to silence specifically gene function in cultured mammalian cells. As a result, there has been a significant surge of interest in the application of siRNA in functional genomics programs as a means of deciphering specific gene function. However, for siRNA functional genomics studies to be valuable and effective, specific silencing of any given target gene is essential, devoid of nonspecific knockdown and toxic side effects. For this reason, we became interested in investigating cationic liposome/lipid-mediated siRNA delivery (siFection) as a meaningful and potentially potent way to facilitate effective functional genomics studies. Accordingly, a number of cationic liposome/lipid-based systems were selected, and their formulation with siRNA was studied, with particular emphasis on formulation parameters most beneficial for siRNA use in functional genomics studies. Cationic liposome/lipid-based systems were selected from a number of commercially available products, including lipofectAMINE2000 and a range of CDAN/DOPE systems formulated from different molar ratios of the cationic cholesterol-based polyamine lipid N(1)-cholesteryloxycarbonyl-3,7-diazanonane-1,9-diamine (CDAN) and the neutral helper lipid dioleoyl- (DOPE). Parameters that were been investigated included the lipid:nucleic acid ratio of mixing, the extent of cationic liposome/lipid-nucleic acid complex (lipoplex) formation plus medium used, the lipoplex particle size, the mode of delivery, and dose-response effects. Results suggest that concentrations during siRNA lipoplex (LsiR) formation are crucial for maximum knockdown, but the efficacy of gene silencing is not influenced by the size of LsiR particles. Most significantly, results show that most commercially available cationic liposome/lipid-based systems investigated here mediate a significant nonspecific downregulation of the total cellular protein content at optimal doses for maximal specific gene silencing and knockdown. Furthermore, one pivotal aspect of using siRNA for functional genomics studies is the need for at least minimal cellular toxicity. Results demonstrate that CDAN and DOPE with and without siRNA confer low toxicity to mammalian cells, whereas lipofectAMINE2000 is clearly toxic both as a reagent and after formulation into LsiR particles. Interestingly, LsiR particles formulated from CDAN and DOPE (45:55, m/m; siFECTamine) seem to exhibit a slower cellular uptake than LsiR particles formulated from lipofectAMINE2000. Intracellularly, LsiR particles formulated from CDAN and DOPE systems also appear to behave differently, amassing in distinct but diffuse small nonlysosomal compartments for at least 5 h after siFection. By contrast, LsiR particles formulated from lipofectAMINE2000 accumulate in fewer larger intracellular vesicles.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10887199>The biosynthesis of A2E, a fluorophore of aging retina, involves the formation of the precursor, A2-PE, in the photoreceptor outer segment membrane.</a></h2><p>The autofluorescent lipofuscin that accumulates in retinal pigment epithelial cells with age may contribute to an age-related decline in cell function. The major lipofuscin fluorophore, A2E, is a pyridinium bisretinoid. We previously proposed that the biogenesis of A2E involves the following: (i) formation of the Schiff base, N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine from all-trans-retinal and phosphatidylethanolamine in the photoreceptor outer segment membrane; (ii) further reaction of N-retinylidene phosphatidylethanolamine with retinal to yield phosphatidylethanolamine-bisretinoid, A2-PE; (iii) hydrolysis of A2-PE to generate A2E. To provide evidence for this biogenic scheme, all-trans-retinal was reacted with dipalmitoyl- to yield DP-A2-PE (A2-PE), as confirmed by UV, with mass spectrometry revealing the molecular ion at m/z 1222.9 (C(77)H(124)O(8)PN) accompanied by product ion at m/z 672.8, representing the phosphoryl-A2E fragment of A2-PE.

APP insertion into liposomes required neutral lipids, such as L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, in the target membrane. It was prevented in vesicles containing L-alpha-phosphatidylserine. The insertion was enhanced in acidic solutions, suggesting that it is modulated by specific charge/charge interactions. Surface-active properties and behaviour of APP were characterized during insertion of the protein in monomolecular films of L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine,  or L-alpha-phosphatidylserine. The presence of the lipid film enhanced the rate of adsorption of the protein at the interface, and the increase in surface pressure was consistent with APP penetrating the lipid film. The adsorption of APP on the lipid monolayers displayed a significant head group dependency, suggesting that the changes in surface pressure produced by the protein were probably affected by electrostatic interactions with the lipid layers. Our results indicate that the penetration of the protein into the lipid monolayer is also influenced by the hydrophobic interactions between APP and the lipid. CD spectra showed that a large proportion of the alpha-helical secondary structure of APP remained preserved over the pH or ionic strength ranges used. Our findings suggest that APP/membrane interactions are mediated by the lipid composition and depend on both electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, and that the variations observed are not due to major secondary structural changes in APP.

Recently, we developed a synthetic nonviral vector platform system known as LMD (liposome:mu:DNA) that was designed for further modular upgrading with tool-kits of chemical components. First-generation LMD systems were prepared from DC-Chol/DOPE cationic liposomes (DC-Chol=3beta-[N-(N\',N\'-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl] cholesterol, DOPE=dioleoyl-), mu peptide from the adenovirus core and plasmid DNA (pDNA). Here we report attempts to realise peptide-targeted gene delivery that build upon the LMD platform. Our strategy was to prepare novel lipopeptides with a lipid moiety designed to insert into the outer lipid bilayer of LMD particles whilst simultaneously presenting a peptide moiety for cell-surface receptor binding. One main functional peptide sequence was selected (PLAEIDGIELA; tenascin peptide sequence) known to target alpha(9)beta(1)-integrin proteins predominant on upper-airway epithelial cells. This sequence was investigated along with a corresponding control sequence. The syntheses of two classes (A and B) of lipopeptides are reported; the syntheses of class A lipopeptides requires a modification of Mitsunobu chemistry that could be of general utility to facilitate Mitsunobu reactions in other diverse systems. "Targeted" LMD and LD transfections with class A or B lipopeptides exhibit nonspecific peptide enhancements (up to one order of magnitude) over nonlipopeptide control transfections but few specific effects. Specific targeting effects can be seen if the overall LMD or LD particle cationic charge is lowered, but nonspecific effects are never eliminated. Whilst promising, these data now highlight the need for in vivo data and even a new modular, aqueous chemistry for the controlled adaptation of LMD particles in buffer in order for successful peptide-targeted, synthetic, nonviral gene delivery to be realised.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19206074>Effects of dimerization of the cell-penetrating peptide Tat analog on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action.</a></h2><p>The cell-penetrating peptide Tat (48-60) (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) derived from HIV-1 Tat protein showed potent antibacterial activity (MIC: 2-8 microM).

From the viewpoint of a weight basis and the monomer concentration, these dimeric peptides displayed almost similar antimicrobial activity against six bacterial strains tested but acted more rapidly against Staphylococcus aureus on kinetics of bactericidal activity, compared with monomeric Tat(W). Unlike monomeric Tat(W), these dimeric peptides significantly depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of intact S. aureus cells at MIC and induced dye leakage from bacterial-membrane-mimicking egg yolk /egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (7:3, w/w) vesicles. Furthermore, these dimeric peptides were less effective to translocate across lipid bilayers than monomeric Tat(W). These results indicated that the dimerization of Tat analog induces a partial change in the mode of its bactericidal action from intracellular target mechanism to membrane-targeting mechanism.

The model membranes used are prepared as "floating" phospholipid bilayers deposited at a silicon/water interface and separated from the solid substrate either by an adsorbed phospholipid bilayer, polymer cushions composed of polyethylene glycol lipids, or a lipid monolayer adsorbed onto a chemically grafted hydrocarbon layer. The cationic lipoplexes studied are those formed by the complexation of calf thymus DNA with dimethyl-dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB), with either cholesterol or dioleoyl- (DOPE) incorporated as "helper" lipid. The cationic lipoplexes are found to destroy three of the four types of (negatively charged) floating bilayers, with the rate of destruction dependent on the nature of the layer separating the floating bilayer from the silicon substrate. The only bilayers to remain intact after exposure to the lipoplexes were those fabricated above the chemically grafted (octadecyl) hydrocarbon layer. This supports the hypothesis that the high negative charge density of the SiO2 layer on the silicon surface may influence, by way of electrostatic interaction with the cationic lipid, the interaction of the lipoplexes with the model bilayer.

Measurement of the antimicrobial activities of compounds similar to carvacrol (e.g., thymol, cymene, menthol, and carvacrol methyl ester) showed that the hydroxyl group of this compound and the presence of a system of delocalized electrons are important for the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol. Based on this study, we hypothesize that carvacrol destabilizes the cytoplasmic membrane and, in addition, acts as a proton exchanger, thereby reducing the pH gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane.

In this work, mPEG-PE (polyethylene glycol-L-α-phosphatidylethanolamine) was synthesized and used to prepare nanoparticles composed of mPEG-PE and calcium phosphate for siRNA delivery. Calcium phosphate and mPEG-PE formed the stable hybrid nanoparticles through self-assembly resulting from electrostatic interaction in water. The average size of the hybrid nanoparticles was approximately 53.2 nm with a negative charge of approximately -16.7 mV, which was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. The nanoparticles exhibited excellent stability in serum and could protect siRNA from ribonuclease (RNase) degradation. The cellular internalization of siRNA-loaded nanoparticles was evaluated in SMMC-7721 cells using a laser scanning confocal microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry. The hybrid nanoparticles could efficiently deliver siRNA to cells compared with free siRNA. Moreover, the in vivo distribution of Cy5-siRNA-loaded hybrid nanoparticles was observed after being injected into tumor-bearing nude mice. The nanoparticles concentrated in the tumor regions through an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect based on the fluorescence intensities of tissue distribution. A safety evaluation of the nanoparticles was performed both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that the hybrid nanoparticle delivery system had almost no toxicity. These results indicated that the mPEG-PE/CaP hybrid nanoparticles could be a stable, safe and promising siRNA nanocarrier for anticancer therapy.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9011086>Purification of the Chlorella HUP1 hexose-proton symporter to homogeneity and its reconstitution in vitro.</a></h2><p>A prokaryotic biotin acceptor domain was fused to the carboxy terminal end of the Chlorella hexose-proton symporter. The plant symporter is biotinylated in vivo when expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The extended biotinylated transport protein is fully active, catalyzes accumulation of D-glucose analogs and restores growth of a glucose-uptake-deficient yeast strain. Crude membranes were solubilized with octyl-beta-D-glucoside in the presence of Escherichia coli . Biotinylated symporter was purified to homogeneity by biotinavidin affinity chromatography. The symporter protein was reconstituted together with cytochrome-c oxidase prepared from beef heart mitochondria into proteo-liposomes. Cytochrome-c oxidase is a redox-driven H(+)-pump generating a proton motive force (inside negative and alkaline) while transferring electrons from cytochrome-c to oxygen; this energy is used by the symporter to accumulate D-glucose at least 30-fold. In the absence of the driving force the transport protein facilitates diffusion of D-glucose until the concentration equilibrium is reached. It was shown that maximal transport activity depends highly on the amount of co-reconstituted cytochrome-c oxidase and that the symporter possesses 10% of its in vivo turnover number under optimized in vitro transport conditions.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2548499>Interaction of rat brain cytidylate cyclase with phospholipids.</a></h2><p>The interaction of rat brain cytidylate cyclase with some phospholipids such as L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (PC), L-alpha-phosphatidylserine (PS),  (PE) and L-alpha-phosphatidic acid (PA) was studied. Cytidylate cyclase activity of Triton X-100 - solubilized fraction was inhibited by PS, PE and PA, but not with PC. The addition of PC to the incubation mixture containing PS, PE or PA dose - dependently reversed the inhibition of enzyme activity by these phospholipids. Phospholipids showed similar effect on the intact membrane - bound enzyme. PC could reactivate the enzyme which was inactivated by deoxycholate treatment, suggesting that PC may be an important factor to reconstitute an active conformation of the enzyme. These findings indicate that cytidylate cyclase could be regulated by phospholipids constituting its microenvironment of the membrane.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7737166>A new cationic liposome encapsulating genetic material. A potential delivery system for polynucleotides.</a></h2><p>The endeavour to enhance gene therapy has led to increased research on the development of simple, efficient and safe delivery systems. This study deals with the use of an artificial cationic lipid on the encapsulation of genetic material in liposomes. The addition of a biologically degradable cationic phospholipid, dipalmitoyl- covalently coupled to L-lysine, in a standard liposome formulation allowed us to obtain vesicles with high entrapment of various polynucleotides. Polynucleotide degradation by nucleases is markedly prevented by these liposomes. The preparations were stable in both culture medium and human plasma. This latter finding is consistent with the weak binding of plasma proteins on the liposome surface. The efficiency of this new delivery system was demonstrated in antiviral assays. Finally, these liposomes displayed a relatively low cellular toxicity. All these findings indicate that these cationic vesicles are very suitable for genetic material vehiculation.</p><p>Keyword: metabolism</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3790521>Radiation inactivation analysis of influenza virus reveals different target sizes for fusion, leakage, and neuraminidase activities.</a></h2><p>The size of the functional units responsible for several activities carried out by the influenza virus envelope glycoproteins was determined by radiation inactivation analysis. Neuraminidase activity, which resides in the glycoprotein NA, was inactivated exponentially with an increasing radiation dose, yielding a target size of 94 +/- 5 kilodaltons (kDa), in reasonable agreement with that of the disulfide-bonded dimer (120 kDa). All the other activities studied are properties of the HA glycoprotein and were normalized to the known molecular weight of the neuraminidase dimer. Virus-induced fusion activity was measured by two phospholipid dilution assays: relief of energy transfer between N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)dipalmitoyl-L-alpha- phosphatidylethanolamine (N-NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-dioleoyl- (N-Rh-PE) in target liposomes and relief of self-quenching of N-Rh-PE in target liposomes. Radiation inactivation of fusion activity proceeded exponentially with radiation dose, yielding normalized target sizes of 68 +/- 6 kDa by assay i and 70 +/- 4 kDa by assay ii. These values are close to the molecular weight of a single disulfide-bonded (HA1 + HA2) unit (75 kDa), the "monomer" of the HA trimer. A single monomer is thus inactivated by each radiation event, and each monomer (or some part of it) constitutes a minimal functional unit capable of mediating fusion. Virus-induced leakage of calcein from target liposomes and virus-induced leakage of hemoglobin from erythrocytes (hemolysis) both showed more complex inactivation behavior: a pronounced shoulder was present in both inactivation curves, followed by a steep drop in activity at higher radiation levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).</p><p>Keyword: weight</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19206074>Effects of dimerization of the cell-penetrating peptide Tat analog on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action.</a></h2><p>The cell-penetrating peptide Tat (48-60) (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ) derived from HIV-1 Tat protein showed potent antibacterial activity (MIC: 2-8 microM). To investigate the effect of dimerization of Tat (48-60) analog, [Tat(W): GRKKRRQRRRPWQ-NH(2)], on antimicrobial activity and mechanism of bactericidal action, its dimeric peptides, di-Tat(W)-C and di-Tat(W)-K, were synthesized by a disulfide bond linkage and lysine linkage of monomeric Tat(W), respectively. From the viewpoint of a weight basis and the monomer concentration, these dimeric peptides displayed almost similar antimicrobial activity against six bacterial strains tested but acted more rapidly against Staphylococcus aureus on kinetics of bactericidal activity, compared with monomeric Tat(W). Unlike monomeric Tat(W), these dimeric peptides significantly depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of intact S. aureus cells at MIC and induced dye leakage from bacterial-membrane-mimicking egg yolk /egg yolk L-alpha-phosphatidyl-DL-glycerol (7:3, w/w) vesicles. Furthermore, these dimeric peptides were less effective to translocate across lipid bilayers than monomeric Tat(W). These results indicated that the dimerization of Tat analog induces a partial change in the mode of its bactericidal action from intracellular target mechanism to membrane-targeting mechanism. Collectively, our designed dimeric Tat peptides with high antimicrobial activity and rapid bactericidal activity appear to be excellent candidates for future development as novel antimicrobial agents.Copyright (c) 2009 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><p>Keyword: weight</p></html>
