<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14571796>Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of a diet supplemented with sesamin on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.</a></h2><p>The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of sesamin (a non-fat constituent of sesame oil) have been attributed to an increased accumulation of dihomo- , a precursor of 1-series prostaglandins, and the decreasing production of proinflammatory 2-series prostaglandins and 4-series leukotrienes by inhibiting the delta-5 desaturase activity. We investigated the effects of a diet containing sesamin on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.After feeding rats either a basal diet (control group) or a diet supplemented with sesamin (sesamin group) for 14 days, the rats underwent 60 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia and 3 hours of reperfusion. The phospholipid   composition of both  and lung tissue specimens were then analyzed. The plasma levels of leukotriene B4 and PCOOH (phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide) were also determined.The consumption of the dietary sesamin resulted in a significant increase in the dihomo-  content in the tissue phospholipids of the  and lung specimens. The amounts of polyunsaturated   in the lungs subjected to the ischemia-reperfusion injury were well preserved in the animals from the sesamin group. Despite a lack of differences in the levels of arachidonic , the plasma levels of leukotriene B4 in the rats fed dietary sesamin (88 +/- 15 pg) tended to be lower (P = 0.07) than those fed the control diet (110 +/- 20 pg). Furthermore, the plasma concentrations of PCOOH in the sesamin group (130 +/- 62 pmol) were also significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those in the control group (223 +/- 33 pmol).These findings indicate that a diet containing sesamin may thus reduce hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by inducing both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15678755>  composition of serum, adipose tissue, and  in rats fed diets containing corn oil or cottonseed oil.</a></h2><p>There have been few studies on the effect of cottonseed oil (CSO), one of the most commonly used vegetable oils in the United States, on indices of lipid status either in the rat or in any other species. Previous studies with rats have focused on the effect of CSO, versus that of other vegetable oils, on the concentration of cholesterol in serum and  or on a limited number of   in serum, adipose tissue, or . The present study was designed to compare more fully than in previous studies the effect of CSO to that of corn oil (CO) on the   composition of serum, adipose tissue, and . Two groups of male rats (n = 10 each) were used, each fed one of two purified diets containing 100 g/kg of either CO or CSO. Between-group differences included higher values (mol% total  ) in adipose tissue for palmitic  and stearic , but lower values in serum, adipose tissue, and  for cis-vaccenic  and oleic  (C18:1n-9) for the CSO group than the CO. In addition, values in serum, adipose tissue, and  for alpha-linolenic  (C18:3n-3) and its metabolite, docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3), were lower for the CSO group than the CO. There was no effect of diet on serum or tissue levels of n-6   (linoleic , dihomo- , and arachidonic ). Differences in   compositions noted, e.g., those for C18:ln-9 and C22:6n-3, mainly reflected compositional differences between the two oils. Thus, use of CSO rather than CO affected serum and tissue concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and n-3 polyunsaturated   (PUFAs) but had no effect on n-6 PUFA status.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p></html>
