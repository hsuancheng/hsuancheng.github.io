<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147338>Metabolic profiling in colorectal cancer reveals signature metabolic shifts during tumorigenesis.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises as the consequence of progressive changes from normal epithelial cells through polyp to tumor, and thus is an useful model for studying metabolic shift. In the present study, we studied the metabolomic profiles using high analyte specific gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) to attain a systems-level view of the shift in metabolism in cells progressing along the path to CRC. Colonic tissues including tumor, polyps and adjacent matched normal mucosa from 26 patients with sporadic CRC from freshly isolated resections were used for this study. The metabolic profiles were obtained using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. Our data suggest there was a distinct profile change of a wide range of metabolites from mucosa to tumor tissues. Various amino acids and lipids in the polyps and tumors were elevated, suggesting higher energy needs for increased cellular proliferation. In contrast, significant depletion of glucose and inositol in polyps revealed that  may be critical in early tumorigenesis. In addition, the accumulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine, and the decrease of uric  concentration, suggest that the purine biosynthesis pathway could have been substituted by the salvage pathway in CRC. Further, there was a step-wise reduction of  concentration from mucosa to tumors. It appears that to gain a growth advantage, cancer cells may adopt alternate metabolic pathways in tumorigenesis and this flexibility allows them to adapt and thrive in harsh environment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21538633>Ursodeoxycholic  treatment of hepatic steatosis: a (13)C NMR metabolic study.</a></h2><p>Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) is commonly used for the treatment of hepatobiliary disorders. In this study, we tested whether a 4-week treatment with this bile  (12-15 mg/kg/day) could improve hepatic fatty  oxidation in obese Zucker rats - a model for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatosis. After 24 h of fasting, livers were perfused with physiological concentrations of [U-(13) C]nonesterified fatty acids and [3-(13) C]lactate/[3-(13) C]pyruvate. Steatosis was associated with abundant intracellular glucose, lactate, alanine and methionine, and low concentrations of choline and betaine. Steatotic livers also showed the highest output of glucose and lactate. Glucose and glycolytic products were mostly unlabeled, indicating active glycogenolysis and  after 24 h of fasting. UDCA treatment resulted in a general amelioration of liver metabolic abnormalities with a decrease in intracellular glucose and lactate, as well as their output. Hepatic betaine and methionine were also normalized after UDCA treatment, suggesting the amelioration of anti-oxidative defenses. Choline levels were not affected by the bile , which may indicate a deficient synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins. The percentage contribution of [U-(13) C]nonesterified fatty acids to acetyl-coenzyme A entering the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle was significantly lower in livers from Zucker obese rats relative to control rats: 23.1 ± 4.9% versus 44.1 ± 2.7% (p < 0.01). UDCA treatment did not alter significantly fatty  oxidation in control rats, but improved significantly oxidation in Zucker obese rats to 46.0 ± 6.1% (p > 0.05), comparable with control group values. The TCA cycle activity subsequent to fatty  oxidation was reduced in steatotic livers and improved when UDCA was administered (0.24 ± 0.04 versus 0.37 ± 0.05, p = 0.05). We further suggest that the mechanism of action of UDCA is either related to the activity of the farnesoid receptor, or to the amelioration of the anti-oxidative defenses and cell nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+) /NADH) ratio, favoring TCA cycle activity and β-oxidation.Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7679932>The measurement of enzyme activities in the resting human polymorphonuclear leukocyte--critical estimate of a method.</a></h2><p>As a system for study, the isolated human polymorphonuclear leukocyte combines the advantages of a quasi-non-invasive preparation with a nearly complete complement of enzymes of carbohydrate and  metabolism. However, small sample volumes and, in some cases, very low enzyme activities make high demands on sample processing, storage, and performance of continuous measurements, if the enzyme activities are to be measured with acceptable reproducibility. In the presented study several aspects of homogenization, storage, and continuous measurement were scrutinized, to identify critical steps and consider ways of optimizing the method. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were separated from the blood of healthy subjects by sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation. After ultrasonic homogenization, 13 enzymes of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic  cycle, and glycogen metabolism were determined photometrically. The variation of several conditions showed: 1. The duration of exposure to ultrasound for the homogenization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes has no influence over a wide range of time. 2. Addition of the detergents Triton X-100 and , as well as the SH-group protector dithiothreitol, to the homogenizing medium increased the measured activities of only a few enzymes. 3. Considerable inaccuracy was encountered when the suspension was divided into parts for homogenization with different additives; such splitting of the suspension should therefore be performed only when necessary, as in the determination of reference values (e.g. protein or DNA content of the cell suspension). 4. Twenty four-fold determination of enzyme activities from one homogenate resulted in precisions between 4.5% (citrate synthase) and 14.4% (transketolase), which is satisfactory for the low activities (as low as 1 U/l) in the homogenate. 5. The reproducibility of enzyme activities, measured in homogenates of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from different blood samples drawn simultaneously, was only slightly worse than that of the continuous measurement method itself. Thus, the precision of the measurement of enzyme activity seems to be the main determinant of the overall method. In conclusion, the described procedure of separation, homogenization, and enzyme measurement in human polymorphonuclear leukocyte meets the requirements of biochemical or clinical trials and can be recommended for clinical metabolic studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/993208>Inhibition of  in brain by a phospholipid effect on interconversion of fructose phosphates. A possible regulatory control on utilization of glucose 6-phosphate.</a></h2><p>Glucose 6-phosphate accumulation in 10,000 X g supernatant of rat brain was enhanced up to 16-fold by the addition of phosphatidylcholine, other common phospholipids, or linoleate. This glucose 6-phosphate is of endogenous origin via UDP-glucose and glucose 1-phosphate but not glucose. The accumulation is the result of inhibition of  by an effect of phospholipid on the interconversion of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Brain is therefore capable of gluconeogenesis from fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. A regulatory function for phospholipid which coordinates  and other major routes of utilization of glucose 6-phosphate in brain, e.g. inositol synthesis, is proposed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7979171>Early changes in  metabolism in rats exposed to an acute level of deoxycholate and fed a Nigerian-like diet.</a></h2><p>Early alterations in cellular  metabolism, reductive biosynthesis and enzymes related to cell proliferation were studied in 40 Wistar albino rats exposed to an acute level of deoxycholate (DOC), and fed different diets. The animals were divided into four equal groups and fed ad libitum either a normal diet (ND), a high-carbohydrate high-fibre (HCF) diet, or a high-protein high-fat (HPF) diet. Three times weekly intrarectal injection of 40 mg/0.2 ml DOC was given to three groups of the rats for 9 weeks. The specific activities of phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were all significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the DOC-treated animals compared with the physiological saline-treated control. Reductive biosynthetic enzyme activities (malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase-NADP(+)-dependent, and ATP-citrate lyase) were reduced in the DOC-treated animals compared with the control. Feeding rats with the HCF diet significantly (p < 0.05) lowered the specific activities of the enzymes of glycolysis, of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxidative) and hyaluronidase and proteinase compared with those of the HPF-fed rats. These results show an altered enzymic profile in rats fed an HCF and an HPF diet compared with rats fed the ND and suggests a protective role of the HCF diet against the development of colon cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12767687>Cytotoxic mechanisms of hydrosulfide anion and cyanide anion in primary rat hepatocyte cultures.</a></h2><p>Hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide are known to compromise mitochondrial respiration through inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase and this is generally considered to be their primary mechanism of toxicity. Experimental studies and the efficiency of current treatment protocols suggest that H(2)S may exert adverse physiological effects through additional mechanisms. To evaluate the role of alternative mechanisms in H(2)S toxicity, the relative contributions of electron transport inhibition, uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) to hydrosulfide and cyanide anion cytotoxicity in primary hepatocyte cultures were examined. Supplementation of hepatocytes with the glycolytic substrate, fructose, rescued hepatocytes from cyanide anion induced toxicity, whereas fructose supplementation increased hydrosulfide anion toxicity suggesting that hydrosulfide anion may compromise  in hepatocytes. Although inhibitors of the MPTP opening were protective for hydrosulfide anion, they had no effect on cyanide anion toxicity, consistent with an involvement of the permeability transition pore in hydrosulfide anion toxicity but not cyanide anion toxicity. Exposure of isolated rat liver mitochondria to hydrosulfide did not result in large amplitude swelling suggesting that if H(2)S induces the permeability transition it does so indirectly through a mechanism requiring other cellular components. Hydrosulfide anion did not appear to be an uncoupler of mitochondrial respiration in hepatocytes based upon the inability of oligomycin and fructose to protect hepatocytes from hydrosulfide anion toxicity. These findings support mechanisms additional to inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase in hydrogen sulfide toxicity. Further investigations are required to assess the role of the permeability transition in H(2)S toxicity, determine whether similar affects occur in other cell types or in vivo and evaluate whether this may provide a basis for the design of more effective therapeutic measures for hydrogen sulfide intoxication.</p></html>
