In the current study, DPP-IV inhibitory peptides were identiﬁed from mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained by papain. The results showed that all the mare whey protein hydrolysates obtained at various hydrolysis durations possessed more potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared with intact whey protein. The 4-h hydrolysates showed the greatest DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.18 mg/mL. The 2 novel peptides from 4-h hydrolysate fractions separated by successive chromatographic steps were characterized by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The novel peptides Asn-Leu-Glu-Ile-Ile-Leu-Arg and Thr-Gln-Met--Asp-Glu-Glu-Ile-Met-Glu---Arg, which corresponded to β-lactoglobulin 1 f(71-77) and β-lactoglobulin 1 f(143-155), demonstrated DPP-IV inhibitory activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 86.34 and 69.84 μM, respectively. The DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the 2 peptides was retained or even improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion in vitro. Our findings indicate that mare whey protein-derived peptides may possess potential as functional food ingredients in the management of type 2 .Copyright © 2017 American Dairy Science Association.

Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to either a high body condition group (HBCS; n = 19) or a normal body condition group (NBCS; n = 19) and were fed different diets until dry-off (d -49 relative to calving) to amplify the difference. The groups were also stratified for comparable milk yields (NBCS: 10,361 ± 302 kg; HBCS: 10,315 ± 437 kg). At dry-off, the NBCS cows (parity: 2.42 ± 1.84; body weight: 665 ± 64 kg) had a body condition score (BCS) <3.5 and backfat thickness (BFT) <1.2 cm, whereas the HBCS cows (parity: 3.37 ± 1.67; body weight: 720 ± 57 kg) had a BCS >3.75 and BFT >1.4 cm. During the dry period and the subsequent lactation, both groups were fed identical diets but maintained the BCS and BFT differences. Blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies (semitendinosus) were repeatedly (d -49, +3, +21, and +84 relative to calving) collected for assessing the concentrations of free AA and the mRNA abundance of various components of mTOR and UPS. The differences in BCS and BFT were maintained throughout the study. The circulating concentrations of most AA with the exception of Gly, Gln, Met, and  increased in early lactation in both groups. The serum concentrations of Ala (d +21 and +84) and Orn (d +84) were lower in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, but those of Gly, His, Leu, , , Met, and Orn on d -49 and Ile on d +21 were greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. The serum concentrations of 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, and 3-methylhistidine:creatinine ratio increased after calving (d +3) but did not differ between the groups. The muscle concentrations of all AA (except for Cys) remained unchanged over time and did not differ between groups. The muscle concentrations of Cys were greater on d -49 but tended to be lower on d +21 in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. On d +21, mTOR and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 mRNA abundance was greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, whereas ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 was not different between the groups. The mRNA abundance of ubiquitin-activating enzyme 1 (d +21), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 1 (d +21), atrogin-1 (d +21), and ring finger protein-1 (d +3) enzymes was greater in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows, whereas ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2 was not different between the groups. The increased mRNA abundance of key components of mTOR signaling and of muscle-specific ligases of HBCS cows may indicate a simultaneous activation of anabolic and catabolic processes and thus increased muscle protein turnover, likely as a part of the adaptive response to prevent excessive loss of skeletal muscle mass during early lactation.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

It is affecting approximately up to 14% of all pregnancies with an increasing tendency. GDM has been related to relevant short-term and long-term health complications for both mother and offspring. Recent studies strongly emphasized the role of several essential amino acids in the pathogenesis of  and highlighted their strong correlation with insulin resistance, but there are no references related to modifications in D-AAs in biological fluids. As D-AA elimination proceeds mainly by renal excretion, urine was the selected sample to evaluate the alterations in free D-AAs ratio in a GDM study. Only 1 mL of first void urine or standard solution was required for purification, by using a Discovery DSC-SCX SPE cartridge (500 mg/3 mL) and derivatization into their N(O)-pentafluoropropionyl amino acid 2-propyl esters. Enantiomeric separation was carried out by GC-MS on a Chirasil-L- N-propionyl-L-valine-tert-butylamide polysiloxane fused-silica capillary column (25 m×0.25 mm I.D., 0.12 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), under programmed temperature elution. Detection was performed with an ion trap mass analyzer, operating in the full scan mode in the m/z 50-350 range. 14 pairs of derivatives of D-and L-AAs were separated. The steps of sample preparation, derivatization and GC-MS conditions were optimized for both urine and standards. Several conditions affecting the SPE procedure, such as sorbent mass/volume ratio of the cartridge, sample dilution and pH, were optimized. Volume of reagents and solvents and reaction temperature and time were also tested for the derivatization. Regarding the GC-MS parameters, split ratio, temperature program and mass range were optimized. The final method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision for D-Ala, D-Pro, D-Ser, D-Met, D-, D-Glu, D-Orn and D-. Identification of AAs in urine samples was based on retention time and mass spectra. Urine from 20 women with GDM and 20 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (after 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test), matched according to the week of gestation and age (22-28 week of gestation and age 24-37 years), were enrolled into the study. %D-Relative amounts were determined for Ala, , Thr, Ser, Leu, Asx (Asp+Asn), Glx (Glu+Gln), Met, , Tyr, Orn and . Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were observed only for D- and higher values were found in the GDM group. It is possible that D- could be involved in metabolic/signaling pathways to compensate early stages of insulin resistance, although further work is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
