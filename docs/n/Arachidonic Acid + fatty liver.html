Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and   (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of  X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28325998>Glucomannan- and glucomannan plus spirulina-enriched pork affect    profile, LDL receptor expression and antioxidant status in Zucker fa/fa rats fed atherogenic diets.</a></h2><p>We evaluated the effects of glucomannan or glucomannan plus spirulina-restructured pork (RP) on    profile, desaturase/elongase enzyme activities and oxidative status of Zucker fa/fa rats for seven weeks. Control (C), glucomannan (G) and glucomannan/spirulina (GS)-RP; HC (cholesterol-enriched control), HG and HGS (cholesterol-enriched glucomannan and glucomannan/spirulina-RP) experimental diets were tested. Increased metabolic syndrome markers were found in C, G and GS rats. Cholesterol feeding increased  size, fat, and cholesterol and reduced antioxidant enzyme levels and expressions. Cholesterolemia was lower in HG and HGS than in HC. GS vs. G showed higher stearic but lower oleic levels. SFA and PUFA decreased while MUFA increased by cholesterol feeding. The /linoleic and docosahexaenoic/alpha-linolenic ratios were lower in HC, HG, and HGS vs. C, G, and GS, respectively, suggesting a delta-6-elongase-desaturase system inhibition. Moreover, cholesterol feeding, mainly in HGS, decreased low-density-lipoprotein receptor expression and the delta-5-desaturase activity and increased the delta-9-desaturase activity. In conclusion, the  production of highly unsaturated  acids was limited to decrease their oxidation in presence of hypercholesterolaemia. Glucomannan or glucomannan/spirulina-RP has added new attributes to their functional properties in meat, partially arresting the negative effects induced by high-fat-high-cholesterol feeding on the    and antioxidant statuses.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191316>Dimethyl Sulfoxide Decreases Levels of Oxylipin Diols in Mouse .</a></h2><p>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as a solvent and cryopreservative in laboratories and considered to have many beneficial health effects in humans. Oxylipins are a class of biologically active metabolites of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) that have been linked to a number of diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of DMSO on oxylipin levels in mouse .  tissue from male mice (C57Bl6/N) that were either untreated or injected with 1% DMSO at 18 weeks of age was analyzed for oxylipin levels using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). A decrease in oxylipin diols from linoleic  (LA, C18:2n6), alpha-linolenic  (ALA, C18:3n3) and docosahexeanoic  (DHA, C22:6n3) was observed 2 h after injection with DMSO. In contrast, DMSO had no effect on the epoxide precursors or other oxylipins including those derived from  (C20:4n6) or eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5n3). It also did not significantly affect the diol:epoxide ratio, suggesting a pathway distinct from, and potentially complementary to, soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHI). Since oxylipins have been associated with a wide array of pathological conditions, from arthritis pain to obesity, our results suggest one potential mechanism underlying the apparent beneficial health effects of DMSO. They also indicate that caution should be used in the interpretation of results using DMSO as a vehicle in animal experiments.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25483240>Relationship between sperm quality parameters and the   composition of the muscle,  and testis of European eel.</a></h2><p>This study looks at the correlations that  acids have with different tissues in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) during hormonally-induced sexual maturation, with different sperm quality parameters. In order to evaluate the different dynamics of the use of  acids, a categorization of the results from each sperm quality parameter (volume, concentration, motility and velocity) was performed. Low and moderate correlations were observed between muscle tissue and some sperm quality parameters but no high correlations were found. Eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n3, EPA) in the  seems to have a role in determining the volume of sperm produced. This can be explained by the fact that EPA is a major requirement in the early phases of sperm production (probably as a component of the spermatozoal membrane). In addition, the levels of α-linolenic  (18:3-n3, ALA) and linoleic  (18:2-n6, LA) in the  decreased when sperm motility increased. In all the tissues, a negative correlation was observed between  (20:4n-6, ARA) and the different sperm velocity parameters. The fact that an increase in the consumption of ARA coincides with an increase in the speed of spermatozoa, highlights the important role that this   plays not only in sperm production, but also in sperm velocity. All this information could prove useful in the development of suitable broodstock diets to improve sperm quality and subsequently, the larval development of this species.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Dysregulated   metabolism in the  plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Cytochrome P450 omega-hydroxylase 4A14 (CYP4A14) is a homolog of human CYP4A hydroxylase that catalyzes omega-hydroxylation of medium-chain  acids and  in mice. The goal of this study was to determine the role of CYP4A14 in the development and the progression of NAFLD. Here, we showed that hepatic CYP4A expression was up-regulated in the livers of patients and three murine models of NAFLD. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CYP4A14 in the livers of C57BL/6 mice resulted in a  phenotype with a significant increase in hepatic   translocase (FAT/CD36) expression. In contrast, CYP4A14 gene-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet or a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet exhibited attenuated  lipid accumulation and reduced hepatic FAT/CD36 expression. In addition, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis was markedly ameliorated in MCD diet-fed CYP4A14-deficient mice. Collectively, CYP4A14 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both SS and NASH and may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NAFLD.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358367>Hyperinsulinemia shifted energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies in early nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from high-fat high-sucrose diet induced Bama minipigs.</a></h2><p>The minipig can serve as a good pharmacological model for human subjects. However, the long-term pathogenesis of high-calorie diet-induced metabolic syndromes, including NASH, has not been well described in minipigs. We examined the development of metabolic syndromes in Bama minipigs that were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 23 months, by using histology and serum biochemistry and by profiling the gene expression patterns in the livers of HFHSD pigs compared to controls. The pathology findings revealed microvesicular steatosis, iron overload,  synthesis, lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant capacity, increased cellular damage, and inflammation in the . RNA-seq analysis revealed that 164 genes were differentially expressed between the livers of the HFHSD and control groups. The pathogenesis of early-stage NASH was characterized by hyperinsulinemia and by de novo synthesis of  acids and nascent triglycerides, which were deposited as lipid droplets in hepatocytes. Hyperinsulinemia shifted the energy supply from glucose to ketone bodies, and the high ketone body concentration induced the overexpression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The iron overload, CYP2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 overexpression promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which resulted in  and linoleic  peroxidation and, in turn, led to malondialdehyde production and a cellular response to ROS-mediated DNA damage.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30206714>Pparγ Is Involved in the Transcriptional Regulation of  LC-PUFA Biosynthesis by Targeting the Δ6Δ5  Acyl Desaturase Gene in the Marine Teleost Siganus canaliculatus.</a></h2><p>As the first marine teleost demonstrated to have the ability of long-chain polyunsaturated  acids (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis from C PUFA precursors, the rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus provides us a unique model for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts aiming at the replacement of dietary fish oil (rich in LC-PUFA) with vegetable oils (rich in C PUFA precursors but devoid of LC-PUFA). In the study of transcription regulation of gene encoding the Δ6Δ5  acyl desaturase (Δ6Δ5 Fads), a rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the first step of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish, a binding site for the transcription factor (TF), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), was predicted in Δ6Δ5 fads2 promoter by bioinformatics analysis, and thus the present study focused on the regulatory roles of Pparγ on Δ6Δ5 fads2. First, the activity of the Δ6Δ5 fads2 promoter was proved to be downregulated by pparγ overexpression and upregulated by treatment of Pparγ antagonist (GW9662), respectively, in HEK 293T cells with the dual luciferase reporter assay. Pparγ was further confirmed to interact with the promoter by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Moreover, in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells, GW9662 decreased the expression of pparγ together with increase of Δ6Δ5 fads2 mRNA. Besides, Δ6Δ5 fads2 expression was increased by pparγ RNAi knockdown and reduced by its mRNA overexpression. Furthermore, knockdown of pparγ induced a high conversion of 18:3n-3 to 18:4n-3 and 18:2n-6 to 18:3n-6, while pparγ mRNA overexpression led to a lower conversion of that, and finally a significant decrease of 20:4n-6(ARA), 20:5n-3(EPA), and 22:6n-3(DHA) production. The results indicate that Pparγ is involved in the transcriptional regulation of  LC-PUFA biosynthesis by targeting Δ6Δ5 fads2 in rabbitfish, which is the first report of Pparγ involvement in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25639214>Identification of Genes Selectively Regulated in Human Hepatoma Cells by Treatment With Dyslipidemic Sera and PUFAs.</a></h2><p>Serum composition is linked to metabolic diseases not only to understand their pathogenesis but also for diagnostic purposes. Quality and quantity of nutritional intake can affect disease risk and serum composition. It is then possible that diet derived serum components directly affect pathogenetic mechanisms. To identify involved factors, we evaluated the effect on gene expression of direct addition of dyslipidemic human serum samples to cultured human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Sera were selected on the basis of cholesterol level, considering this parameter as mostly linked to dietary intake. Cells were treated with 32 sera from hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic subjects to identify differentially regulated mRNAs using DNA microarray analysis. We identified several mRNAs with the highest modulations in cells treated with dyslipidemic sera versus cells treated with normal sera. Since the two serum groups had variable polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) contents, selected mRNAs were further assessed for their regulation by docosahexaenoic  (DHA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and  (AA). Four genes resulted both affected by serum composition and PUFAs: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoenzymeA synthase 2 (HMGCS2), glutathione S-transferase alpha 1 (GSTA1),  expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) and apolipoprotein M (ApoM). HMGCS2 expression appears the most relevant and was also found modulated via transcription factors peroxysome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) and forkhead box O1 (FoxO1). Our data indicate that expression levels of the selected mRNAs, primarily of HMGCS2, could represent a reference of nutritional intake, PUFAs effects and dyslipidemic diseases pathogenesis.© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26691839> lipid metabolism is altered by increased circulating estrogen to androgen ratio in male mouse.</a></h2><p>Estrogens are suggested to lower the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in both sexes. In this study, we investigated how the increased circulating estrogen-to-androgen ratio (E/A) alters  lipid metabolism in males. The cytochrome P450 aromatase (P450arom) is an enzyme converting androgens to estrogens. Male mice overexpressing human aromatase enzyme (AROM+ mice), and thus have high circulating E/A, were used as a model in this study. Proteomics and gene expression analyses indicated an increase in the peroxisomal β-oxidation in the  of AROM+ mice as compared with their wild type littermates. Correspondingly, metabolomic analysis revealed a decrease in the amount of phosphatidylcholines with long-chain  acids in the plasma. With interest we noted that the expression of Cyp4a12a enzyme, which specifically metabolizes  (AA) to 20-hydroxy AA, was dramatically decreased in the AROM+ . As a consequence, increased amounts of phospholipids having AA as a   tail were detected in the plasma of the AROM+ mice. Overall, these observations demonstrate that high circulating E/A in males is linked to indicators of higher peroxisomal β-oxidation and lower AA metabolism in the .

However, the specific defects that precipitate these abnormalities are yet to be fully elucidated. After binding to insulin, the plasma membrane-embedded insulin receptor transmembrane protein initiates a cascade of phosphorylation that leads to the activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and subsequently to the initiation of some metabolic actions of insulin. The activities of this receptor, insulin binding, and tyrosine kinase activation is dependent on its plasma lipid environment. Published data on the influence of omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated  acids on insulin response are scarce. Moreover, the findings of the published investigations, most of which used omega-3 and -6, polyunsaturated - blends, have been inconclusive. Hence, further, well thought out research is needed. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the effect of treatments with linoleic  (LNA),  (ARA), alpha-linolenic  (ALA), docoshexaenoic  (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) on cell membrane composition and consequently on the insulin-signaling pathway and specifically AKT phosphorylation.Human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) and  hepatocellular (HepG2) cells were treated with or without 40 µM of LNA, ARA, ALA, EPA, or DHA for 48 h, the - composition of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from the treated cells by capillary gas liquid chromatograph. Cells were incubated for 30 min with or without human insulin (50 ng/mL), and the phosphorylation of AKT was assessed with the use of Western blotting.The  acids were incorporated in the PtdCho and PtdEtn of both cell lines, but the level of incorporation was higher in HT29. Phosphorylation of AKT increased when HT29 was treated with LNA (P < 0.05) and ARA (P < 0.01) but not with ALA, EPA, or DHA. A similar but non-significant increase in AKT phosphorylation was observed in LNA- and ARA- treated HepG2 cells.The finding of this investigation demonstrates that plasma membrane lipid bilayer enrichment with LNA or ARA treatment enhances insulin action by AKT activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the effects of metformin on maternal and fetal lipid metabolism and hepatic inflammation using a rat model of diet-induced obesity during pregnancy.Female Wistar rats (6-7 weeks old) were fed normal or high calorie diets for 5 weeks. After mating with normal-diet fed males, half of the high calorie-fed dams received metformin (300 mg/kg, daily); dams (8 per group) continued diets through gestational day 19. Maternal and fetal livers and fetal brains were analyzed for  acids and for   metabolism-related gene expression. Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc testing.When compared to control-lean maternal livers, obesogenic-diet-exposed maternal livers showed significantly higher saturated  acids (14:0 and 16:0) and monounsaturated  acids (16:1n7 and 18:1n9) and lower polyunsaturated (18:2n6 and 20:4n6 []) and anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated  acids (18:3n3 and 22:6n3 [docosahexaenoic ]) (p < 0.05).

Atlantic salmon has the capacity to synthesise both LC-PUFA and cholesterol, but little is known about the regulation of synthesis and how it varies throughout salmon life span. Here, we present a systemic view of lipid metabolism pathways based on lipid analyses and transcriptomic data from salmon fed contrasting diets of plant or fish oil from first feeding. We analysed four tissues (stomach, pyloric caeca, hindgut and ) at three life stages (initial feeding 0·16 g, 2·5 g fingerlings and 10 g juveniles). The strongest response to diets higher in plant oil was seen in pyloric caeca of fingerlings, with up-regulation of thirty genes in pathways for cholesterol uptake, transport and biosynthesis. In juveniles, only eleven genes showed differential expression in pyloric caeca. This indicates a higher requirement of dietary cholesterol in fingerlings, which could result in a more sensitive response to plant oil. The LC-PUFA elongation and desaturation pathway was down-regulated in pyloric caeca, probably regulated by srebp1 genes. In , cholesterol metabolism and elongation and desaturation genes were both higher on plant oil. Stomach and hindgut were not notably affected by dietary treatment. Plant oil also had a higher impact on   composition of fingerlings compared with juveniles, suggesting that fingerlings have less metabolic regulatory control when primed with plant oil diet compared with juveniles.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933256>Combined effect of telmisartan and fluvastatin on  metabolism in human  microsomes.</a></h2><p>1. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), metabolites of  (AA) via cytochrome P450s, have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system involving vasodilation.

To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers,  acids (FA) and stable isotopes (δ N and δ C), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, , red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs (∑saturated FA, ∑monounsaturated FA and ∑polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic , , oleic  and δ N) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition. These results provide further knowledge on the foraging strategies adopted by batoids in communal nursery areas, information that is required for improving spatial conservation and management planning.© 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25934114>Lowering the dietary omega-6: omega-3 does not hinder nonalcoholic  disease development in a murine model.</a></h2><p>It is hypothesized that a high dietary n-6:n-3 (eg, 10-20:1) is partly responsible for the rise in obesity and related health ailments. However, no tightly controlled studies using high-fat diets differing in the n-6:n-3 have tested this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to determine the role that the dietary n-6:n-3 plays in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and colitis development. We hypothesized that reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 would hinder the development of NAFLD and colitis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed high-fat diets, differing in the n-6:n-3 (1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1), for 20 weeks. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the hepatic phospholipid  (AA):eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic . Hepatic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, macrophage polarization, gene expression of inflammatory mediators, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and oxidative capacity were assessed as well as colonic inflammatory signaling, and gene expression of inflammatory mediators and tight-junction proteins. Although reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 lowered the hepatic phospholipid AA:eicosapentaenoic  and AA:docosahexaenoic  in a dose-dependent manner and mildly influenced inflammatory signaling, it did not significantly attenuate NAFLD development. Furthermore, the onset of NAFLD was not paired to colitis development or changes in tight-junction protein gene expression. In conclusion, reducing the dietary n-6:n-3 did not attenuate NAFLD progression; nor is it likely that colitis, or gut permeability, plays a role in NAFLD initiation in this model.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study aimed to examine whether eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and  (ARA) supplementation can protect fish cells against the negative impact of chlorpyrifos (CPF). Atlantic salmon hepatocytes were exposed to either 100 μM CPF, 200 μM EPA, 200 μM ARA, or combinations of these for 48 h, and endpoints included lipid droplet formation, gene expression, and global metabolomic analysis. The results showed that polyunsaturated   (PUFA) supplementation modified the cell lipid composition, reduced uptake of CPF and increased the cellular number and size of lipid droplets. CPF exposure induced the transcription of ppara and fabp3, and reduced the levels of several PUFAs, and lead to accumulation of monoacylglycerols (MAGs) in the cells. Supplementation of EPA or ARA did not prevent CPF-induced accumulation of MAGs and only to a limited degree rescued the response on other lipids. CPF exposure further reduced energy metabolism, a response partly restored by PUFA supplementation. Reduced levels of glutathione indicated oxidative stress; an effect not ameliorated by the PUFAs. Altogether, this study shows that PUFA supplementation only modestly protects Atlantic salmon hepatocytes against the negative impact of CPF.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

A preferential accumulation of specific C20-C24   species, especially  (C20:4) and docosahexaenoic acids (C22:6), was revealed in culture-activated HSCs along with an upregulation of transcription of   desaturases (Scd1, Scd2) and elongases (Elovl5, Elovl6). This was accompanied with an enrichment of activated HSCs with 36:4 and 38:4 phosphatidylcholine species containing polyunsaturated  acids and associated accumulation of selective lipid mediators, including endocannabinoids and related N-acylethanolamides, as well as ceramides. An increase in 2-arachidonoylglycerol and N-arachydonoylethanolamide concentrations was observed along with an upregulation of Daglα mRNA expression in HSCs during culture activation.

Nonetheless, how dietary lipids affect existing obesity remains unknown.  (AA), a derivative of linoleic , is one of the crucial n-6  acids. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AA affects obesity through associating microbiota-driven inflammation with hypothalamus-adipose- axis. Four-week old C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) for 10weeks to induce obesity, and then fed a HFD enriched with 10g/kg of AA or a continuous HFD in the following 15weeks. Systemic adiposity and inflammation, metabolic profiles, gut microbiota composition, short-chain  acids production, hypothalamic feeding regulators, browning process of adipocytes, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance in adipose were investigated. The results indicated that AA aggravates obesity for both genders whereas sex-dependently affects gut microbiota composition. Also, AA favors pro-inflammatory microbiota and reduces butyrate production and circulating serotonin, which augments global inflammation and triggers hypothalamic leptin resistance via microglia accumulation in male. AA exacerbates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis along with amplified inflammation through TLR4-NF-κB pathway and induces insulin resistance. Reversely, AA alleviates obesity-related disorders via rescuing anti-inflammatory and butyrate-producing microbiota, up-regulating GPR41 and GPR109A and controlling hypothalamic inflammation in female. Nevertheless, AA modifies adipocyte browning and promotes lipid mobilization for both genders. We show that AA affects obesity likely through a gut-hypothalamus-adipose- axis.

Pekinenal significantly induced L02 cell damage, which was characterised by necrosis and apoptosis.

Further, screening correlation coefficients between the intensities of all metabolites and the extent of L02 cell damage (MTT) identified 12 biomarker hits: ten were downregulated and two were upregulated.

These epoxy FAs comprise epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxy-octadecenoic acids (EpOMEs), which are formed by CYP epoxygenases from  (AA) and linoleic , respectively, and then are hydrolyzed to their respective diols, the so-called DHETs and DiHOMEs. Although EETs and EpOMEs are also substrates for mEH, its role in lipid signaling is considered minor due to lower abundance and activity relative to sEH. Surprisingly, we found that in plasma from mEH KO mice, hydrolysis rates for 8,9-EET and 9,10-EpOME were reduced by 50% compared to WT plasma. This strongly suggests that mEH contributes substantially to the turnover of these FA epoxides-despite kinetic parameters being in favor of sEH. Given the crucial role of  in controlling plasma diol levels, we next studied the capacity of sEH and mEH KO  microsomes to synthesize DHETs with varying concentrations of AA (1-30 μM) and NADPH. mEH-generated DHET levels were similar to the ones generated by sEH, when AA concentrations were low (1 μM) or epoxygenase activity was curbed by modulating NADPH. With increasing AA concentrations sEH became more dominant and with 30 μM AA produced twice the level of DHETs compared to mEH. Immunohistochemistry of C57BL/6  slices further revealed that mEH expression was more widespread than sEH expression. mEH immunoreactivity was detected in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells, and bile duct epithelial cells, while sEH immunoreactivity was confined to hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells. Finally, transcriptome analysis of WT, mEH KO, and sEH KO  was carried out to discern transcriptional changes associated with the loss of EH genes along the CYP-epoxygenase-EH axis. We found several prominent dysregulations occurring in a parallel manner in both KO livers: (a) gene expression of Ephx1 (encoding for mEH protein) was increased 1.35-fold in sEH KO, while expression of Ephx2 (encoding for sEH protein) was increased 1.4-fold in mEH KO ; (b) Cyp2c genes, encoding for the predominant epoxygenases in mouse , were mostly dysregulated in the same manner in both sEH and mEH KO mice, showing that loss of either EH has a similar impact. Taken together, mEH appears to play a leading role in the hydrolysis of 8,9-EET and 9,10-EpOME and also contributes to the hydrolysis of other FA epoxides. It probably profits from its high affinity for FA epoxides under non-saturating conditions and its close physical proximity to CYP epoxygenases, and compensates its lower abundance by a more widespread expression, being the only EH present in several sEH-lacking cell types.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30630053>Apolipoprotein D overexpression alters hepatic prostaglandin and omega   metabolism during the development of a non-inflammatory hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a secreted lipocalin associated with neuroprotection and lipid metabolism. Overexpression of ApoD in mouse neural tissue induces the development of a non-inflammatory hepatic steatosis in 12-month-old transgenic animals. Previous data indicates that accumulation of , ApoD's preferential ligand, and overactivation of PPARγ are likely the driving forces in the development of the pathology. However, the lack of inflammation under those conditions is surprising. Hence, we further investigated the apparent repression of inflammation during hepatic steatosis development in aging transgenic animals. The earliest modulation of lipid metabolism and inflammation occurred at 6 months with a transient overexpression of L-PGDS and concomitant overproduction of 15d-PGJ, a PPARγ agonist. Hepatic lipid accumulation was detectable as soon as 9 months. Inflammatory polarization balance varied in time, with a robust anti-inflammatory profile at 6 months coinciding with 15d-PGJ overproduction. Omega-3 and omega-6  acids were preferentially stored in the  of 12-month-old transgenic mice and resulted in a higher omega-3/omega-6 ratio compared to wild type mice of the same age. Thus, inflammation seems to be controlled by several mechanisms in the  of transgenic mice: first by an increase in 15d-PGJ production and later by a beneficial omega-3/omega-6 ratio. PPARγ seems to play important roles in these processes. The accumulation of several omega  acids species in the transgenic mouse  suggests that ApoD might bind to a broader range of  acids than previously thought.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Male Wistar rats were fed a low-fat diet containing no GTE or a high-fat (HF) diet containing GTE at 0%, 1%, or 2% for 8 weeks. Insulin resistance and total hepatic  acids increased following HF feeding (P<.05) and these were normalized by GTE at 1-2%. GTE (1-2%) normalized hepatic malondialdehyde without affecting cytochrome P450 2E1 mRNA expression, which was otherwise increased by HF feeding. HF-mediated increases in hepatic COX-2 protein and activity as well as PGE2 concentrations were normalized by GTE (1-2%). COX-2 activity and PGE2 were correlated to each other, and to serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic NFκB-binding activity (P<.05; r=0.28-0.49). GTE attenuated HF-mediated increases in total hepatic n-6 and n-3, without affecting the n-6/n-3 ratio. GTE did not affect HF-mediated increases in n-6 in nonesterified   (NEFA) and phospholipid pools, whereas n-3 and n-6/n-3 in both pools were unaffected by GTE and HF feeding. GTE decreased total hepatic  without affecting HF-mediated increases in  in NEFA or phospholipid pools.

Traditional lipidomics analysis using  homogenates or plasma dilutes and averages lipid concentrations, and does not provide spatial information about lipid distribution. We aimed to characterize the distribution of specific lipid species related to NAFLD severity by performing label-free molecular analysis by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Fresh frozen  biopsies from obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery ( n = 23) with various degrees of NAFLD were cryosectioned and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MSI. Molecular identification was verified by tandem MS. Tissue sections were histopathologically stained, annotated according to the Kleiner classification, and coregistered with the MSI data set. Lipid pathway analysis was performed and linked to local proteome networks. Spatially resolved lipid profiles showed pronounced differences between nonsteatotic and steatotic tissues. Lipid identification and network analyses revealed phosphatidylinositols and  metabolism in nonsteatotic regions, whereas low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism was associated with steatotic tissue. Supervised and unsupervised discriminant analysis using lipid based classifiers outperformed simulated analysis of  tissue homogenates in predicting steatosis severity. We conclude that lipid composition of steatotic and nonsteatotic tissue is highly distinct, implying that spatial context is important for understanding the mechanisms of lipid accumulation in NAFLD.

Phospholipases and  acids play key roles in the creation of inflammation by change in metabolic activities and production of lipid mediators. The aim of this study was to investigate the amount of secretory phospholipase-A2 (sPLA2) and difference of   pattern in oral reactive hyperplasia and adjacent normal appearing tissues in patients with oral reactive lesions.Paired samples of oral hyperplastic (OH) and adjacent normal-appearing tissue of 45 patients were investigated in this study. The collected samples were analyzed with enzymatic spectrophotometric method in terms of the amount of sPLA2 and composition of  acids by gas-liquid chromatography method.The amount of sPLA2 (1.8-fold, p < 0.001), stearic  (1.2-fold, p < 0.001), oleic  (1.1-fold, p = 0.01),  (1.5-fold, p < 0.001) and docosahexaenoic  (1.3-fold, p = 0.02) were increased, while the amount of palmitoleic  (-45%, p < 0.001) and linoleic  (-19%, p < 0.001) were reduced in the OH tissue samples. Furthermore, the results demonstrated significant associations between the type and location of tissue samples with monounsaturated  acids (MUFAs) and n-3 polyunsaturated  acids. Tissue samples from patients with inflammatory fibroepithelial hyperplasia showed relatively higher MUFAs and lower n-3 polyunsaturated  acids than other type of lesions.Localized changes in the sPLA2 activity and composition of   are associated with oral reactive hyperplasia and the type of pathological response.

Phagocytosis test on foam cells with or without cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) expression was conducted to observe the cellular uptake of the SA or AA modified rHDL and the non-modified one. Raman spectroscopy, guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) denaturation experiment and in vitro evaluation of drug release were used to analyze the related mechanism.In comparison with the non-modified rHDL, AA modification could reduce the packing order of the rHDL phospholipid acyl chains, leading to the decreased apoA-I binding extent with lipid and the increased drug release, while the opposite was true for SA modification. The AA-modified rHDL exhibited a higher uptake of foam cells expressing CETP than the non-modified one, while the SA-modified one showed the lowest cellular uptake among the three rHDLs.Increased unsaturation level can facilitate lipid-interchange process where the cargo in rHDL core may transfer to VLDL more easily, and then promote the endocytosis mediated by the VLDL receptor.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30862046>Metabolomics Characterizes the Effects and Mechanisms of Quercetin in Nonalcoholic  Disease Development.</a></h2><p>As metabolomics is widely used in the study of disease mechanisms, an increasing number of studies have found that metabolites play an important role in the occurrence of diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects and mechanisms of quercetin in high-fat-sucrose diet (HFD)-induced nonalcoholic  disease (NAFLD) development using nontargeted metabolomics. A rat model of NAFLD was established by feeding with an HFD for 30 and 50 days. The results indicated quercetin exhibited hepatoprotective activity in 30-day HFD-induced NAFLD rats by regulating   related metabolites (adrenic , etc.), inflammation-related metabolites (, etc.), oxidative stress-related metabolites (2-hydroxybutyric ) and other differential metabolites (citric , etc.). However, quercetin did not improve NAFLD in the 50-day HFD; perhaps quercetin was unable to reverse the inflammation induced by a long-term high-fat diet. These data indicate that dietary quercetin may be beneficial to NAFLD in early stages. Furthermore, combining metabolomics and experimental approaches opens avenues to study the effects and mechanisms of drugs for complex diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30070994>Parental high dietary  levels modulated the hepatic transcriptome of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) progeny.</a></h2><p>Disproportionate high intake of n-6 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) in the diet is considered as a major human health concern. The present study examines changes in the hepatic gene expression pattern of adult male zebrafish progeny associated with high levels of the n-6 PUFA  (ARA) in the parental diet. The parental generation (F0) was fed a diet which was either low (control) or high in ARA (high ARA). Progenies of both groups (F1) were given the control diet. No differences in body weight were found between the diet groups within adult stages of either F0 or F1 generation. Few differentially expressed genes were observed between the two dietary groups in the F0 in contrast to the F1 generation. Several links were found between the previous metabolic analysis of the parental fish and the gene expression analysis in their adult progeny. Main gene expression differences in the progeny were observed related to lipid and retinoid metabolism by PPARα/RXRα playing a central role in mediating changes to lipid and long-chain   metabolism. The enrichment of genes involved in β-oxidation observed in the progeny, corresponded to the increase in peroxisomal β-oxidative degradation of long-chain  acids in the parental fish metabolomics data. Similar links between the F0 and F1 generation were identified for the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway in the high ARA group. In addition, estrogen signalling was found to be affected by parental high dietary ARA levels, where gene expression was opposite directed in F1 compared to F0. This study shows that the dietary n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio can alter gene expression patterns in the adult progeny. Whether the effect is mediated by permanent epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in developing gametes needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30350408>Dietary Oat Bran Increases Some Proinflammatory Polyunsaturated - Oxidation Products and Reduces Anti-Inflammatory Products in Apolipoprotein E Mice.</a></h2><p>Oat bran is suggested to attenuate atherosclerotic conditions by regulating dyslipidemia, endothelial function, and oxidative damage. Through the measurement of oxidized polyunsaturated   (PUFA), oxidative stress, and inflammation status in  and heart tissues of apolipoprotein E (ApoE  ), mice fed with high fat diet (HFD) or HFD with oat bran (HFD + Oat) were investigated. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), PUFA and over 40 types of its oxidized products were assessed. The HFD + Oat group had augmented adrenic  (ADA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and suppressed n-3 docosapentaenoic  levels in the  tissues compared to the HFD group.  (ARA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) levels were elevated and ADA was suppressed in the heart tissues of the HFD + Oat group compared to the HFD group. Furthermore, enzymatically mediated oxidized ARA product levels (9-, 11- and 20-HETE [hydroxyeicosatetraenoic ], and PGF ) were augmented and those of the oxidized DHA products (4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, and 14-HDHA [hydroxy-docosahexaenoic ]) were reduced in the  tissues of the HFD + Oat group. It also increased 17-F -dihomo-isoprostane and 7-F -dihomo-isofuran derived from nonenzymatic oxidation of ADA in the heart and  tissues, and those from ALA namely 16-F -phytoprostane and 16(RS)-13-epi-STΔ -9-phytofuran. Our study showed oat bran to be a weak antioxidant and lacked anti-inflammatory properties in atherosclerotic mice. Elevation of oxidized PUFA products that are potentially proinflammatory and vasoconstrictors (HETE, PGF ) with simultaneous reduction of those that are anti-inflammatory (HDHA) may not be desirable in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076986>Serum and Fecal Oxylipins in Patients with Alcohol-Related  Disease.</a></h2><p>Alcohol-related  disease is one of the most prevalent chronic  diseases worldwide.

Nevertheless, oxylipins are not well studied in alcohol-related  disease.(1) To characterize the patterns of bioactive ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated   metabolites in alcohol use disorder and alcoholic hepatitis patients and (2) to identify associations of serum oxylipins with clinical parameters in patients with alcohol-related  disease.We performed a comprehensive liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of serum and fecal oxylipins derived from ω-6 , ω-3 eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic  in a patient cohort with alcohol-related  disease.Our results show profound alterations in the serum oxylipin profile of patients with alcohol use disorder and alcoholic hepatitis compared to nonalcoholic controls. Spearman correlation of the oxylipins with clinical parameters shows a link between different serum oxylipins and intestinal permeability, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, platelet count, steatosis, fibrosis and model for end-stage  disease score. Especially, higher level of serum 20-HETE was significantly associated with decreased albumin, increased hepatic steatosis, polymorphonuclear infiltration, and 90-day mortality.Patients with alcohol-related  disease have different oxylipin profiles.

Here we investigated how changes in fish feed affected the metabolism of mice fed diets containing fillets from such farmed salmon. We demonstrate that replacement of fish oil with rapeseed oil or soybean oil in fish feed had distinct spillover effects in mice fed western diets containing the salmon. A reduced ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated  acids in the fish feed, reflected in the salmon, and hence also in the mice diets, led to a selectively increased abundance of  in the phospholipid pool in the livers of the mice. This was accompanied by increased levels of hepatic ceramides and -derived pro-inflammatory mediators and a reduced abundance of oxylipins derived from eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic . These changes were associated with increased whole body insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Our data suggest that an increased ratio between n-6 and n-3-derived oxylipins may underlie the observed marked metabolic differences between mice fed the different types of farmed salmon. These findings underpin the need for carefully considering the type of oil used for feed production in relation to salmon farming.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These specific roles may be of crucial importance in a context of exposure to pollutants. We recently showed that the   profile of rainbow trout  cell phospholipids modulates sensitivity to an acute methylmercury challenge. In order to investigate mechanisms of effects, we herein tested whether specific polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) may protect cells from methylmercury through decreasing intracellular mercury accumulation and/or enhancing cellular defences (e.g. via modulation of gene expression patterns). We also investigated the inverse relationship and assessed the impact of methylmercury on cellular   metabolism. To do so, the   composition of rainbow trout  cell phospholipids was first modified by incubating them in a medium enriched in a specific PUFA from either the n-3 family (alpha-linolenic , ALA; eicosapentaenoic , EPA) or the n-6 family (linoleic , LA; , AA). Cells were then exposed to methylmercury (0.15 or 0.50 μM) for 24 h and sampled thereafter for assessing phospholipid   profile, intracellular total mercury burden, and expression pattern of genes involved in   metabolism, synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules and stress response. We observed that cells incorporated the given PUFA and some biotransformation products in their phospholipids. Methylmercury had few impacts on this cellular phospholipid composition. None of the PUFA enrichments affected the cellular mercury burden, suggesting that the previously observed cytoprotection conferred by ALA and EPA was not linked to a global decrease in cellular accumulation of mercury.   enrichments and methylmercury exposure both modulated gene expression patterns. Genes involved in the synthesis of PUFA-derived signalling molecules, in stress response and the orphan cytochrome P450 20A1 were identified as possible sites of interaction between  acids and methylmercury in rainbow trout  cells.Copyright © 2018.

We examined the roles of the major n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), and the major n-6 PUFA, AA, in FASN expression in, and proliferation of, human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.The cells were treated for 48 h with BSA or 60 μM BSA-bound DHA, AA, or oleic  (OA, 18:1n-9), then were incubated with or without estradiol or insulin. Western blot and H-thymidine incorporation assay were used to determine the role of DHA on FASN regulation and MCF-7 cell proliferation.DHA, but neither AA nor OA, inhibits estradiol-induced and insulin-induced expression of the precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (p-SREBP-1), its mature form (m-SREBP-1), and FASN. Estradiol or insulin stimulation increased the pAkt/Akt and pS6/S6 ratios, expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN, and cell proliferation, and these effects were decreased by DHA. The DHA-induced decrease in FASN expression resulted from reduced pAkt/Akt signaling and not pERK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling. In addition, DHA enhanced the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on pAkt signaling and expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN. However, addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathways, 1 h before addition of estradiol or insulin increased the pAkt/Akt ratio and FASN expression, and this effect was inhibited by addition of DHA 48 h before rapamycin.We conclude that, in MCF-7 cells, DHA inhibits pAKT signaling and thus expression of p-SREBP-1, m-SREBP-1, and FASN and cell proliferation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29506628>The determination of the effect of some 1,3,4 thiadiazole derivatives on biochemical content ( Acids, Sterols, Lipophilic Vitamins) in rat .</a></h2><p>Thiadiazole derivatives and its metal compounds have antibacterial, antifungal, antitumoral, antiproliferative and antioxidant properties.

However, such roles of COX in fish remain largely unknown. In this study, we designed three semi-purified diets, namely ARA-free (control), ARA, and ARA + acetylsalicylic  (ASA; a COX inhibitor), and used them to feed grass carp (27.65 ± 3.05 g) for 8 weeks. The results showed that dietary ARA significantly increased the amount of ARA in the hepatopancreas, muscle, and kidney (P < 0.05), whereas this increase was reduced by dietary ASA. The hepatopancreatic prostaglandin E content increased in the ARA group, and this increase was inhibited by ASA (P < 0.05). ARA decreased the lipid content in the hepatopancreas, whereas ASA recovered lipid content to a significant level (P < 0.05). ARA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of   synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase in the hepatopancreas (P < 0.05). However, ASA did not rescue the mRNA expression of these genes (P > 0.05). Interestingly, ARA significantly enhanced the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α gene expression, and this increase was attenuated by ASA (P < 0.05). Finally, ARA significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in the kidney, and ASA attenuated the expression of toll-like receptor 22 and MyD88 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings suggest that COX metabolites play important roles in the inhibition of lipid accumulation in the hepatopancreas of grass carp fed with ARA and that regulation of gene expression promotes lipid catabolism rather than lipogenic activities.

The most affected genes were cyp4a12, ephx2, cyp2d9 and cyp1a2, demonstrating 5 folds or more down-regulation. These findings suggest that chronic sertraline treatment induced toxic histological alterations in the hepatic tissues and reduced the gene expression of drug metabolizing enzymes. Patients on chronic sertraline treatment may be on risk of hepatotoxicity with reduced capacity to metabolize drugs and  acids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To better understand the molecular underpinnings of SNE on lipid metabolism and explore novel preventative strategies against SNE, we studied the regulatory mechanism of a potential probiotic, Lactobacillus johnsonii BS15 on the lipid metabolism pathways involved in chickens with SNE.One hundred eighty one-day-old chickens were randomly divided into three groups and arranged with basal diet (control and SNE group). Added with BS15 (1 × 10 cfu/g) or Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) liquid medium for 28 days. The hepatic gene expression of each group was then measured using high-throughput analysis methods (RNA-Seq). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression changes of the related genes.The results showed that there are eleven lipid metabolic pathways were found during the prevention of BS15 treatment in SNE chickens by RNA-Seq, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and  metabolism. BS15 notably facilitated the expressions of   binding protein 2 (FABP2), acyl-CoA synthetase bubblegum family member 1 (ACSBG1), perilipin 1 (PLIN1) and perilipin 2 (PLIN2), which were involved in PPAR signaling pathway of SNE chickens. Besides, suppression of phospholipase A2 group IVA (PLA2G4A) in  metabolism was observed in SNE chickens after BS15 prevention. The expression patterns of FABP2, ACSBG1, PLIN1, PLIN2 and PLA24G in qRT-PCR validation were consistent with RNA-Seq results.These findings indicate that SNE may affect the hepatic lipid metabolism of chickens. Meanwhile, BS15 pretreatment may provide a prospective natural prophylaxis strategy against SNE through improving the PPAR signaling pathway and  metabolism.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211867>Effects of corn dried distillers' grains with solubles on performance, egg quality, yolk   composition and oxidative status in laying ducks.</a></h2><p>The study investigated the effects of increasing content of corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in the diets of laying ducks on oxidative status, laying performance, egg quality, and egg yolk   composition. Longyan females (1080) with similar BW at 17 wk of age were randomly assigned to 6 treatment groups, each consisting of 6 replicates of 30 birds. The basal diet (I) was a typical corn-soybean ration while the experimental diets (II to VI) substituted corn DDGS for soybean meal and wheat bran and a small reduction of corn. The level of substitution in diets (II to VI) was 6%, 12%, 18%, 24% and 30%. The experiment lasted for 18 wk. Average egg weight decreased linearly as the level of corn DDGS inclusion increased (P < 0.001). Haugh unit, albumen weight, and proportion declined as linear responses to corn DDGS substitution (P < 0.05), but yolk color linearly increased (P < 0.001); the proportions of oleic (C18:1) and total monounsaturated  acids in egg yolk linearly decreased with increasing corn DDGS and many of the key polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) like linoleic (C18:2n-6),  (C20:4n-6) and α-linolenic (C18:3n-3) acids linearly increased (P < 0.001), but not those of eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n-3) and docoshexaenoic (C22:6n-3) acids. The PUFAs n-6/n-3 ratio linearly increased with increasing corn DDGS level (P < 0.001). Increasing corn DDGS linearly increased hepatic expression of GPX1, HO-1, and Nrf2 and hepatic activity of GSH-Px and the  content of MDA (P < 0.001). There were no treatment effects on egg production, egg mass, feed conversion ratio, eggshell thickness, strength, and yolk cholesterol content (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the current study indicates that the use of corn DDGS is possible as a replacement, primarily for soybean meal at levels up to 18% in the diets of laying ducks without affecting laying performance, egg quality, and antioxidant status. Increasing amounts of corn DDGS linearly increased egg yolk concentrations of key  acids like like C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 and the antioxidant enzyme activity of GSH-Px through the Nrf2 pathway to avoid oxidative stress.© 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27401401>Characterization of the Cytochrome P450 epoxyeicosanoid pathway in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an emerging public health problem without effective therapies. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases metabolize  into bioactive epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have potent anti-inflammatory and protective effects. However, the functional relevance of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid metabolism pathway in the pathogenesis of NASH remains poorly understood. Our studies demonstrate that both mice with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH and humans with biopsy-confirmed NASH exhibited significantly higher free EET concentrations compared to healthy controls. Targeted disruption of Ephx2 (the gene encoding for soluble epoxide hydrolase) in mice further increased EET levels and significantly attenuated MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and injury, as well as high fat diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation, systemic glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that dysregulation of the CYP epoxyeicosanoid pathway is a key pathological consequence of NASH in vivo, and promoting the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of EETs warrants further investigation as a novel therapeutic strategy for NASH.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Diets were isonitrogenous. Zinc L-selenomethionine complex was used to increase Se content and corn oil was used to increase the energy content. The experiment lasted 42 days. Broiler growth performance was not significantly affected by dietary treatments.  glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity increased (P<0.05) in broilers fed high Se and energy diets compared to other ones. Whole blood GPx activity was higher in Se supplemented groups however, it was reduced by age. Thyroid hormone concentrations were unaffected by dietary treatments. A significant increase of linoleic and  concentration (P<0.001) was observed in the  of broilers fed diets with moderately increased energy content and supplemented with Se compared to those fed diets with moderately increased energy content alone.

Variants of P450 4A11 have been associated with high blood pressure and resistance to anti-hypertensive drugs, and 20-HETE has both pro- and antihypertensive properties relating to increased vasoconstriction and natriuresis, respectively. These physiological activities are likely influenced by the redox environment, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we found that reducing agents ( dithiothreitol and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) strongly enhanced the catalytic activity of P450 4A11, but not of 10 other human P450s tested. Conversely, added HO attenuated P450 4A11 catalytic activity. Catalytic roles of five of the potentially eight implicated Cys residues of P450 4A11 were eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis. Using an isotope-coded dimedone/iododimedone-labeling strategy and mass spectrometry of peptides, we demonstrated that the heme-thiolate cysteine (Cys-457) is selectively sulfenylated in an HO concentration-dependent manner. This sulfenylation could be reversed by reducing agents, including dithiothreitol and dithionite. Of note, we observed heme ligand cysteine sulfenylation of P450 4A11 e in kidneys and livers derived from  transgenic mice. We also detected sulfenylation of murine P450 4a12 and 4b1 heme peptides in kidneys. To our knowledge, reversible oxidation of the heme thiolate has not previously been observed in P450s and may have relevance for 20-HETE-mediated functions.© 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694146>Dietary uptake of omega-3  acids in mouse tissue studied by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).</a></h2><p>Dietary intake of omega-3  acids is associated with considerable health benefits, including the prevention of metabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Specific and sensitive mass spectrometry assays enabled discrimination of the regioselectivity of hydroxylation of these two  acids. CYP4Z1 generated 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-hydroxy LA, whereas the 12-hydroxy metabolite was not detected. HET0016, the prototypic CYP4 inhibitor, only weakly inhibited laurate metabolite formation (IC ∼15 M). CYP4Z1 preferentially oxidized AA to the 14(S),15(R)-epoxide with high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, a reaction that was also insensitive to HET0016, but neither 20-HETE nor 20-carboxy-AA were detectable metabolites. Docking of LA and AA into a CYP4Z1 homology model was consistent with this preference for internal   oxidation. Thus, human CYP4Z1 has an inhibitor profile and product regioselectivity distinct from most other CYP4 enzymes, consistent with CYP4Z1's lack of a covalently linked heme.

It is not known if dietary PUFA increases lipid metabolites in brain or reduces neuroinflammation in neonates. We hypothesized that dietary PUFAs might suppress neuroinflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine over-production and promoting inflammatory resolution in the periphery and brain.

Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma-linolenic  and palmitoleic , were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29763591>Scp-2/Scp-x ablation in Fabp1 null mice differentially impacts hepatic endocannabinoid level depending on dietary fat.</a></h2><p>Dysregulation of the hepatic endocannabinoid (EC) system and high fat diet (HFD) are associated with non-alcoholic  disease.  cytosol contains high levels of two novel endocannabinoid binding proteins-   binding protein (FABP1) and sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2). While Fabp1 gene ablation significantly increases hepatic levels of  (ARA)-containing EC and sex-dependent response to pair-fed high fat diet (HFD), the presence of SCP-2 complicates interpretation. These issues were addressed by ablating Scp-2/Scp-x in Fabp1 null mice (TKO). In control-fed mice, TKO increased hepatic levels of arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) in both sexes. HFD impacted hepatic EC levels by decreasing AEA in TKO females and decreasing 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) in WT of both sexes. Only TKO males on HFD had increased hepatic 2-AG levels. Hepatic ARA levels were decreased in control-fed TKO of both sexes. Changes in hepatic AEA/2-AG levels were not associated with altered amounts of hepatic proteins involved in AEA/2-AG synthesis or degradation. These findings suggested that ablation of the Scp-2/Scp-x gene in Fabp1 null mice exacerbated hepatic EC accumulation and antagonized the impact of HFD on hepatic EC levels-suggesting both proteins play important roles in regulating the hepatic EC system.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Cod filets contain less than 2g fat per kg, whereof approximately 50% is EPA and DHA. However, a large fraction of these n-3 PUFAs is present in the phospholipid (PL) fraction and may have high bioavailability and capacity to change the endocannabinoid profile. Here we investigated whether exchanging meat from a lean terrestrial animal with cod in a background Western diet would alter the endocannabinoid tone in mice and thereby attenuate obesity development and hepatic lipid accumulation. Accordingly, we prepared iso-caloric diets with 15.1 energy (e) % protein, 39.1 e% fat and 45.8 e% carbohydrates using freeze-dried meat from cod filets or pork sirloins, and using a combination of soybean oil, corn oil, margarine, milk fat, and lard as the fat source. Compared with mice receiving diets containing pork, mice fed cod gained less adipose tissue mass and had a lower content of hepatic lipids. This was accompanied by a lower n-6 to n-3 ratio in  PLs and in red blood cells (RBCs) in the mice. Furthermore, mice receiving the cod-containing diet had lower circulating levels of the two major endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Together, our data demonstrate that despite the relatively low content of n-3 PUFAs in cod fillets, the cod-containing diet could exert beneficial metabolic effects.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is commonly associated with features of metabolic syndrome, particularly insulin resistance. NAFLD shares the basic pathogenic mechanisms with obesity and insulin resistance, such as mitochondrial, oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Lipoxygenases catalyze the conversion of poly-unsaturated  acids in the plasma membrane-mainly  and linoleic -to produce oxidized pro-inflammatory lipid intermediates. 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) has been studied extensively in setting of inflammation and insulin resistance.

One aspect of hepatic alterations is caused by increased fecal loss of the essential nutrient choline, following enterohepatic bile phosphatidylcholine (PC) cycle impairment. Hepatic PC synthesis, both de novo and via phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase (PEMT), is essential for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. VLDL-PC in particular contributes to the organism's supply with polyunsaturated  acids (LC-PUFA), namely  (C20:4) and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6). Consequently, choline deprivation and altered hepatic PC metabolism may affect plasma PC homeostasis and extrahepatic organ function.To investigate relationships between altered plasma choline and PC homeostasis and markers of lung function and inflammation in CF. To assess alterations in hepatic choline and PC metabolism of CF patients.Quantification of plasma/serum choline and PC species in adult CF patients compared to controls. Correlation of PC with forced expiratory vital capacity (FEV1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations. Analysis of choline and PC metabolism in CF compared to controls, using deuterated choline ([D₉-methyl]-choline) labeling in vivo.Mean choline and PC concentrations in CF patients were lower than in controls. Choline and PC concentrations as well as fractions of C22:6-PC and C20:4-PC correlated directly with FEV1, but inversely with IL-6. Plasma concentrations of deuterated PC were decreased for both pathways, whereas only in PC synthesized via PEMT precursor enrichment was decreased.In CF patients, hepatic and plasma homeostasis of choline and PC correlate with lung function and inflammation. Impaired hepatic PC metabolism, exemplarily shown in three CF patients, provides an explanation for such correlations. Larger studies are required to understand the link between hepatic PC metabolism and overall clinical performance of CF patients, and the perspective of choline substitution of these patients.© 2015 S.

Ablation of the Fabp1 gene (LKO) increases brain AEA and 2-AG by decreasing hepatic uptake of ARA to increase serum ARA, thereby increasing ARA availability for uptake by the brain. The brain also expresses sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2), which is also a cytosolic ARA-binding protein. To further resolve the role of SCP-2 independent of FABP1, mice ablated in the Scp-2/Scp-x gene (DKO) were crossed with mice ablated in the Fabp1 gene (LKO) mice to generate triple knock out (TKO) mice. TKO impaired the ability of LKO to increase brain AEA and 2-AG. While a high-fat diet (HFD) alone increased brain AEA, TKO impaired this effect. Overall, these TKO-induced blocks were not attributable to altered expression of brain proteins in ARA uptake, AEA/2-AG synthesis, or AEA/2-AG degrading enzymes. Instead, TKO reduced serum levels of free ARA and/or total ARA and thereby decreased ARA availability for uptake to the brain and downstream synthesis of AEA and 2-AG therein. In summary, Scp-2/Scp-x gene ablation in Fabp1 null (LKO) mice antagonized the impact of LKO and HFD on brain ARA and, subsequently, EC levels. Thus, both FABP1 and SCP-2 participate in regulating the EC system in the brain.© 2019 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30241945>Identification of biologically active δ-lactone eicosanoids as paraoxonase substrates.</a></h2><p>The mammalian paraoxonases (PONs 1, 2 and 3) are a family of esterases that are highly conserved within and between species. They exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, their physiological function(s) and native substrates are uncertain. Previous structure-activity relationship studies demonstrate that PONs have a high specificity for lipophilic lactones, suggesting that such compounds may be representative of native substrates. This report describes the ability of PONs to hydrolyze two bioactive δ-lactones derived from , 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic  lactone (5,6-DHTL) and cyclo-epoxycyclopentenone (cyclo-EC). Both lactones were very efficiently hydrolyzed by purified PON3. PON1 efficiently hydrolyzed 5,6-DHTL, but with a specific activity about 15-fold lower than PON3. 5,6-DHTL was a poor substrate for PON2. Cyclo-EC was a poor substrate for PON1 and not hydrolyzed by PON2. Studies with the PON inhibitor EDTA and a serine esterase inhibitor indicated that the PONs are the main contributors to hydrolysis of the lactones in human and mouse  homogenates. Studies with homogenates from PON3 knockout mouse livers indicated that >80% of the 5,6-DHTL and cyclo-EC lactonase activities were attributed to PON3. The findings provide further insight into the structural requirements for PONs substrates and support the hypothesis that PONs, particularly PON1 and PON3, evolved to hydrolyze and regulate a class of lactone lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated  acids.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, its role in NAFLD pathogenesis has not been supported by results obtained from high-fat feeding of iPLA2β-null (PKO) mice. Unlike livers of human NAFLD and genetically obese rodents,  induced by high-fat diet is not associated with depletion of hepatic phospholipids. We therefore tested whether iPLA2β could regulate obesity and hepatic steatosis in leptin-deficient mice by cross-breeding PKO with ob/ob mice to generate ob/ob-PKO mice. Here we observed an improvement in ob/ob-PKO mice with significant reduction in serum enzymes, lipids, glucose, insulin as well as improved glucose tolerance, and reduction in islet hyperplasia. The improvement in hepatic steatosis measured by  triglycerides,  acids and cholesterol esters was associated with decreased expression of PPARγ and de novo lipogenesis genes, and the reversal of β-oxidation gene expression. Notably, ob/ob livers contained depleted levels of lysophospholipids and phospholipids, and iPLA2β deficiency in ob/ob-PKO livers lowers the former, but replenished the latter particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) that contained  (AA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Compared with WT livers, PKO livers also contained increased PE and PC containing AA and DHA. Thus, iPLA2β deficiency protected against obesity and ob/ob  which was associated with hepatic -acyl phospholipid remodeling.

The calculated marginal utilisation efficiencies of EPA and ARA were high (62.1 and 91.9 % respectively) and a dietary ARA requirement was defined (0.012 g/kg(0.796)/day). The partial cDNA sequences of genes regulating eicosanoid biosynthesis were identified in barramundi tissues, namely cyclooxygenase 1 (Lc COX1a, Lc COX1b), cyclooxygenase 2 (Lc COX2) and lipoxygenase (Lc ALOX-5). Both Lc COX2 and Lc ALOX-5 expression in the  tissue were elevated in response to increasing dietary ARA, meanwhile expression levels of Lc COX2 and the mitochondrial   oxidation gene carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Lc CPT1a) were elevated in the kidney. A low level of EPA increased the expression of Lc COX1b in the . Consideration should be given to the EPA to ARA balance for juvenile barramundi in light of nutritionally inducible nature of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26797754>Mouse Strain Impacts   Uptake and Trafficking in , Heart, and Brain: A Comparison of C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster Mice.</a></h2><p>C57BL/6 and Swiss Webster mice are used to study lipid metabolism, although differences in   uptake between these strains have not been reported.

In heart, uptake of [1-(14)C]20:4n-6 was increased 1.7-fold in C57BL/6 mice. However, trafficking of [1-(14)C]22:6n-3 into the organic fraction of heart was significantly decreased 33 % in C57BL/6 mice. Although there were limited differences in   tracer trafficking in  or brain, [1-(14)C]16:0 incorporation into  neutral lipids was decreased 18 % in C57BL/6 mice. In heart, the amount of [1-(14)C]16:0 and [1-(14)C]22:6n-3 incorporated into total phospholipids were decreased 45 and 49 %, respectively, in C57BL/6 mice.

Isomaltulose, a naturally‑occurring disaccharide, is reported to improve glucose and lipid metabolisms in obese patients. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of isomaltulose on insulin resistance and various metabolites in NAFLD patients. Five male patients with NAFLD consumed 20 g isomaltulose or sucrose (control). Changes in insulin resistance and metabolites were evaluated by alterations of serum C‑peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) and metabolomic analysis from baseline to 15 min after the administration, respectively. There was no significant difference in changes of blood glucose level; however, the CPR level was significantly decreased in the Isomaltulose group compared to the control group (0.94±0.89 vs. ‑0.12±0.31, P=0.0216). In a metabolomic analysis, a significant alteration was seen in 52 metabolites between the control and Isomaltulose groups. In particular, the taurodeoxycholic  level significantly increased approximately 12.5‑fold, and the  level significantly decreased approximately 0.01‑fold.

Because other studies showed no incremental benefit in nearly preserved cardiac function, the question arises, whether the degree of cardiac dysfunction is involved. It is hypothesized that increased left ventricular (LV) wall stress affects the endogenous hepatic HUFA metabolism, which in turn exhibits adverse cardiac consequences.Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 30 patients with suspected cardiomyopathy. The serum   profile was assessed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Docosahexaenoic  (DHA; P = 0.002) and eicosapentaenoic  (EPA; by trend) levels were decreased in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction (≤ 50%) or LV dilatation (≥ 90 mL/m(2)). Decreased DHA (P = 0.003) and EPA (P = 0.022) levels were associated with a reduced LV ejection fraction. Decreased DHA level was correlated with increased end-diastolic (P = 0.047) and end-systolic LV wall stress (P = 0.001). Pseudocholinesterase activity was inversely correlated with end-diastolic (P = 0.020) and end-systolic LV wall stress (P = 0.025).DHA level was significantly reduced in heart failure. Similar, but less pronounced effects were found for EPA and  by trend. Increased LV wall stress was correlated with a reduced DHA level. Increased LV wall stress exhibits various adverse consequences (eg, increased oxygen consumption, favouring of arrhythmias, and an unfavourable remodelling). The increase of wall stress was paralleled by reduced HUFA level. Increased LV wall stress was correlated with reduced pseudocholinesterase, which is suggestive of hepatic congestion (ie, a cardiohepatic syndrome, involved in the altered   profile in heart failure) and has major consequences regarding the dose-efficacy of HUFA treatment.Copyright © 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

These lipid mediators are involved in fever, pain, and thrombosis and are produced from multiple cells as well as cell/cell interactions, for example, immune cells and epithelial/endothelial cells. Metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes, are linked with chronic low-grade inflammation, impacting the immune system and promoting a variety of chronic diseases. Recent Advances: Multiple studies have corroborated the important function of eicosanoids and their receptors in (non)-inflammatory cells in immunometabolic disorders (e.g., insulin resistance, obesity, and cardiovascular and nonalcoholic  diseases). In this context, LOX and COX products are involved in both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. In addition, recent work has elucidated the potent function of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e., lipoxins and resolvins) in resolving inflammation, protecting organs, and stimulating tissue repair and remodeling.Inhibiting/stimulating selected eicosanoid pathways may result in anti-inflammatory and proresolution responses leading to multiple beneficial effects, including the abrogation of reactive oxygen species production, increased speed of resolution, and overall improvement of diseases related to immunometabolic perturbations.Despite many achievements, it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying immunological/metabolic cross talk to offer substantial therapeutic promise.

Carboxylesterase (CES) has an important role in metabolism of irinotecan to its active metabolite, SN-38, in human . The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether CES activity was altered in ESKD patients.The present study investigated the effects of uremic serum, uremic toxins, and  acids on the hydrolysis of irinotecan and a typical CES substrate, p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA), in human  microsomes. Normal and uremic serum samples were deproteinized by treatment with methanol were used in the present study.The present study showed that both normal and uremic serum significantly inhibited CES-mediated metabolism of both irinotecan and PNPA. The inhibition by uremic serum was weaker than that by normal serum, suggesting that CES activity may be higher in ESKD patients. Although four uremic toxins did not affect PNPA metabolism,  inhibited it. There was no difference in inhibitory effect of PNPA metabolism between both mixtures of seven  acids used at concentrations equivalent to those present in 10% normal or uremic serum. Interestingly, those mixtures had a more pronounced effect than either 10% normal or uremic serum.The present study showed that the inhibition of CES activity by uremic serum was weaker than that by normal serum, suggesting that an increase in maximum plasma concentration of SN-38 in cancer patients with ESKD can be attributed to an accelerated CES-mediated irinotecan hydrolysis.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578529>Fish oil diet in pregnancy and lactation reduces pup weight and modifies newborn hepatic metabolic adaptations in rats.</a></h2><p>To determine the effects of a diet containing fish oil (FD) during pregnancy and lactation in rats on the metabolic adaptations made by the offspring during early extrauterine life and to compare it to an olive oil diet (OD).Rats were mated and randomly allocated to OD or FD containing 10 % of the corresponding oil.

Here we link fish oil, docosahexaenoic  (DHA) and  (AA) to the aging etiology via a redox-telomere-antioncogene axis based on D-galactose-induced aging mice. Both fish oil and PUFA enhanced hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and cardiac SOD activities within the range of 18%-46%, 26%-65% and 19%-58%, respectively, whereas reduced cerebral monoamine oxidase activity, plasma F2-isoprostane level and cerebral lipid peroxidation level by 56%-90%, 20%-79% and 16%-54%, respectively. Thus, PUFA improve the in vivo redox and oxidative stress induced aging process, which however does not exhibit a dose-dependent manner. Notably, both PUFA and fish oil effectively inactivated testicular telomerase and inhibited c-Myc-mediated telomerase reverse transcriptase expression, whereas n-3 PUFA rather than n-6 PUFA protected  and testes against telomere shortening within the range of 13%-25% and 25%-27%, respectively.

The mRNA of glucose-related genes and proteins elevated in mice fed the DHA diet with increases in DHA-derived and reductions in AA-derived EC and EC-like compounds. In addition, DHA feeding reduced plasma levels of various inflammatory cytokines, 5-lipoxygenase-dependent inflammatory mediators and the vasoconstrictive 20-HETE.This study provides evidence that DHA feeding altered ECS gene expression to reduce CB1 activation and reduce fat accretion. Furthermore, the DHA diet led to higher expression of genes associated with glucose use by muscle in mice, and reduced those associated with systemic inflammatory status.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28678821>A casein hydrolysate based formulation attenuates obesity and associated non-alcoholic  disease and atherosclerosis in LDLr-/-.Leiden mice.</a></h2><p>Obesity frequently associates with the development of non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerosis.

HFD and HFD+NI diets were isocaloric. A low fat diet (LFD, 10 Kcal%) was used for reference. Body weight, food intake and metabolic risk factors were assessed over time. At week 21, tissues were analyzed for WAT inflammation (crown-like structures), NAFLD and atherosclerosis. Effects of the individual NI components were explored in a follow-up experiment (n = 7/group).When compared to HFD control, treatment with the NI strongly reduced body weight to levels of the LFD group, and significantly lowered (P<0.01) plasma insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin and serum amyloid A (P<0.01).

Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and oleic  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining.

Here, we performed a plasma lipidomic analysis of normal and obese monkeys using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS).In total, 143 lipid species were identified, quantified, and classified into free  acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic  (LPA), and sphingomyelin (SM). Data analysis showed that the obese monkeys had increased levels of  acids palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C20:4), FFA especially palmitic  (C16:0), as well as certain PC species and SM species. Surprisingly, the plasma level of LPA-C16:0 was approximately four-fold greater in the obese monkeys.

Despite the fact that  is the second foremost polyunsaturated   besides docosahexaenoic , its role and the regulation of its transfer and mobilization in the brain are poorly known.Two groups of 39 adult male BALB/c mice were fed with an -enriched diet or an oleic -enriched diet, respectively, for 12 weeks. After 10 weeks on the diet, mice received intracerebroventricular injections of either NaCl solution or amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) oligomers. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were used to evaluate short- and long-term memory. At 12 weeks on the diet, mice were killed, and blood, , and brain samples were collected for lipid and protein analyses.We found that the administration of an -enriched diet for 12 weeks induced short-term memory impairment and increased deleterious effects of Aβ oligomers on learning abilities. These cognitive alterations were associated with modifications of expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  receptors, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glial fibrillary acidic protein in mouse cortex or hippocampus by the -enriched diet and Aβ oligomer administration. This diet also led to an imbalance between the main ω-6  acids and the ω-3  acids in favor of the first one in erythrocytes and the  as well as in the hippocampal and cortical brain structures. In the cortex, the dietary  also induced an increase of -containing phospholipid species in phosphatidylserine class, whereas intracerebroventricular injections modified several - and docosahexaenoic -containing species in the four phospholipid classes.

Placental and fetal availability of different DHA sources remains unclear. We investigated DHA availability in maternal lipoproteins, placenta and fetal tissues in pregnant sows fed DHA as phospholipid (PL) or TAG to identify the best DHA source during this period. Pregnant Iberian sows were fed diets containing 0·8 % DHA of total  acids as PL from egg yolk or TAG from algae oil during the last third of gestation (40 d). Maternal tissues, placentas and fetal tissues were obtained at delivery and DHA quantified by GC. Major Facilitator Superfamily Domain Containing 2a (MFSD2a) carrier expression was analysed in both placenta and fetal brain by Western blotting. Sows fed the DHA-PL diet showed higher DHA incorporation in plasma LDL but not in plasma total lipids. No differences were found in DHA content between groups in maternal , adipose tissue or brain. Placental tissue incorporated more DHA in both total lipids and PL fraction in sows fed DHA-PL. However, this did not lead to an enhanced DHA accretion either in fetal plasma, fetal  or fetal brain.

Previous work by us and others suggested that CD36 plays an important role in hepatic lipid homeostasis, but the results have been conflicting and the mechanisms were not well understood. In this study, by using CD36-overexpressing transgenic (CD36Tg) mice, we uncovered a surprising function of CD36 in regulating glycogen homeostasis. Overexpression of CD36 promoted glycogen synthesis, and as a result, CD36Tg mice were protected from fasting hypoglycemia. When challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), CD36Tg mice showed unexpected attenuation of hepatic steatosis, increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The HFD-fed CD36Tg mice also showed decreased levels of proinflammatory hepatic prostaglandins and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic  (20-HETE), a potent vasoconstrictive and proinflammatory  metabolite.

Compared to normal individuals, obese individuals have noted pathophysiological alterations which may alter the toxicokinetics of xenobiotics and therefore alter their toxicities. However, the effects of obesity on the toxicity of many widely utilized pesticides has not been established. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if the obese phenotype altered the toxicity of the most widely used organophosphate (OP) insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPS). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed normal or high-fat diet for 4weeks and administered a single dose of vehicle or CPS (2.0mg/kg; oral gavage) to assess cholinergic (acetylcholinesterase activities) and non-cholinergic (carboxylesterase and endocannabinoid hydrolysis) endpoints. Exposure to CPS significantly decreased red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, but not brain AChE activity, in both diet groups. Further, CPS exposure decreased hepatic carboxylesterase activity and hepatic hydrolysis of a major endocannabinoid, anandamide, in a diet-dependent manner with high-fat diet fed animals being more sensitive to CPS-mediated inhibition. These in vivo studies were corroborated by in vitro studies using rat primary hepatocytes, which demonstrated that   amide hydrolase and CES activities were more sensitive to CPS-mediated inhibition than 2-arachidonoylglycerol hydrolase activity. These data demonstrate hepatic CES and FAAH activities in high-fat diet fed mice were more potently inhibited than those in normal diet fed mice following CPS exposure, which suggests that the obese phenotype may exacerbate some of the non-cholinergic effects of CPS exposure.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we utilized hamsters fed a normal chow diet, a high-fat diet or a high cholesterol and high fat diet (HCHFD) as animal models to explore novel transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for ACSL4 expression under hyperlipidemic conditions. Through cloning hamster ACSL4 homolog and tissue profiling ACSL4 mRNA and protein expressions we observed a selective upregulation of ACSL4 in testis and  of HCHFD fed animals. Examination of transcriptional activators of the ACSL family revealed an increased hepatic expression of PPARδ but not PPARα in HCHFD fed hamsters. To explore a role of PPARδ in dietary cholesterol-mediated upregulation of ACSL4, we administered a PPARδ specific agonist L165041 to normolipidemic and dyslipidemic hamsters. We observed significant increases of hepatic ACSL4 mRNA and protein levels in all L165041-treated hamsters as compared to control animals. The induction of ACSL4 expression by L165041 in  tissue in vivo was recapitulated in human primary hepatocytes and hepatocytes isolated from hamster and mouse. Moreover, employing the approach of adenovirus-mediated gene knockdown, we showed that depletion of PPARδ in hamster hepatocytes specifically reduced ACSL4 expression. Finally, utilizing HepG2 as a model system, we demonstrate that PPARδ activation leads to increased ACSL4 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression, and consequently higher arachidonoyl-CoA synthetase activity.

Information regarding safety, growth performance, and efficacy of feeding camelina cake to pigs is limited. We therefore evaluated the effects of camelina cake inclusion in pig nursery diets. In total, 192 pigs (9.4 kg BW) were randomly allocated by sex to 48 pens, 2 heavy and 2 light pigs per pen. Pigs were fed 1 of 4 wheat-based diets including camelina cake (0%, 6%, 12%, or 18%; variety Celine) replacing soybean meal for 4 wk. Individual pigs, pen feed added, and orts were weighed weekly.

Gross pathological examination was conducted, and organ weights were measured. Samples of , back fat, belly fat, and jowl fat were collected for   analysis. Increasing dietary camelina cake inclusion linearly decreased ( 0.001) apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, GE and ash but did not affect ATTD of CP and P.

Increasing camelina cake inclusion linearly increased ( 0.001)  weight relative to BW, linearly decreased ( 0.050) kidney weight, but did not affect spleen, heart, and thyroid weights. Increasing camelina cake inclusion did not result in serological (large-animal standard panel, T3, and T4) or gross clinical (morphology) findings that might suggest toxicity.

The expressed enzyme was an NAD(P)H-dependent broad substrate specificity carbonyl reductase and was inhibited by  at 1.5 μm. Enzymological characterization indicated that the enzyme could be classified as a cytosolic-type carbonyl reductase. The enzyme's 3D structure was determined using the molecular replacement method at 1.98 Å resolution in the presence of NADPH and ethylene glycol. The asymmetric unit consisted of two subunits, and a noncrystallographic twofold axis generated the functional dimer. The structures of the subunits, A and B, differed from each other. In subunit A, the active site contained an ethylene glycol molecule absent in subunit B. Consequently, Tyr172 in subunit A rotated by 103.7° in comparison with subunit B, which leads to active site closure in subunit A. In Y172A mutant, the Km value for 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (model substrate) was 12.5 times higher than that for the wild-type enzyme, indicating that Tyr172 plays a key role in substrate binding in this carbonyl reductase. Because the Tyr172-containing active site lid structure (Ile164-Gln174) is not conserved in all known carbonyl reductases, our results provide new insights into substrate binding of carbonyl reductase.

Recently, fish-derived PUFAs have been associated with cardiovascular health, fetal development, and improvement of brain functions. Studies have shown that fish muscular tissues are rich in PUFAs, which are influenced by various factors, including genetic variations, regulatory profiles, and methylation status of desaturase genes during fatty acid desaturation and elongation processes. However, the genetic mechanism and the pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism in fishes remain unclear. The overall aim of this study was to assess differences in gene expression responses among fishes with different fatty acid levels. To achieve this goal, we conducted genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) using a 250K SNP array in a population of 203 samples of common carp () and identified nine SNPs and 15 genes associated with muscular PUFA content. Then, RNA-Seq and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of different groups with high and low EPA, DHA, ARA4, and ALA contents in muscle, liver and brain tissues were conducted, resulting in 6,750 differentially expressed genes and 5,631 genes with differentially methylated promoters. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of RNA-Seq and WGBS results identified enriched pathways for fatty acid metabolism, which included the adipocytokine signaling pathway, ARA4 and linoleic acid metabolism pathway, and insulin signaling pathway. Integrated analysis indicated significant correlations between gene expression and methylation status among groups with high and low PUFA contents in muscular tissues.

Diet and genotype had little effect on brain PUFAs even though brain Fads2 mRNA was low in HET. No differences in cytokine mRNA were found among groups under unstimulated conditions. In conclusion, differential PUFA profiles between HET mice and human FADS SNPs suggest low expression of both FADS1 and 2 genes in human minor haplotypes.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863097>Serum levels of endocannabinoids are independently associated with nonalcoholic  disease.</a></h2><p>To evaluate the association between circulating levels of endocannabinoids (eCBs) and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).The serum levels of the main eCBs, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and their endogenous precursor and breakdown product,  (AA), were analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in 105 volunteers screened for NAFLD.

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide test indicated inhibitory effects on HT-29 cells viability for FFAs, and monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol (DAG) species, while the lactate dehydrogenase test proved that FFAs were the more effective species to induce membrane injury. Conversely, all species did not exhibit actions on CCD-18 normal human colon cells viability. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of necrosis and apoptosis, while the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition test demonstrated high activity for 2-monoacylglycerols derived from Arasco and sunflower oils.

Recent advances have focused on how PUFA regulate the molecular signaling of microglia, especially in the context of neuroinflammation and behavior. Several active drugs regulate brain lipid signaling and provide proof of concept for targeting the brain. Because brain lipid metabolism relies on a complex integration of diet, peripheral metabolism, including the  and blood, which supply the brain with PUFAs that can be altered by genetics, sex, and aging, there are many pathways that can be disrupted, leading to altered brain lipid homeostasis.

LKO did not alter brain levels of  (ARA)-containing EC, i.e. arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), but decreased non-ARA-containing N-acylethanolamides (OEA, PEA) and 2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG) that potentiate the actions of AEA and 2-AG.

Fetal programming is characterized by adaptive responses to specific environmental conditions during early life stages, which may alter gene expression and permanently affect the structure and function of several organs and tissues, thus influencing the susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Regarding lipid metabolism during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, the maternal body accumulates fat, whereas in late pregnancy, the lipolytic activity in the maternal adipose tissue is increased. However, an excess or deficiency of certain  acids may lead to adverse consequences to the fetuses and newborns. Fetal exposure to trans  acids appears to promote early deleterious effects in the offspring's health, thereby increasing the individual risk for developing metabolic diseases throughout life. Similarly, the maternal intake of saturated  acids seems to trigger alterations in the  and adipose tissue function associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. The polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs), particularly long-chain PUFAs (long-chain PUFA-, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic ), play an important and beneficial physiologic role in the offspring who receive this   during critical periods of development. Therefore, the maternal nutritional condition and   intake during pregnancy and/or lactation are critical factors that are strongly associated with normal fetal and postnatal development, which influence the modifications in fetal programming and in the individual risk for developing metabolic diseases throughout life.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The current study aimed to explore the signaling pathway involved in HHcy-induced hepatic steatosis (HS). C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-methionine diet (HMD) for 4 and 8 weeks to establish the HHcy mouse model. Compared to a chow diet, the HMD induced hepatic steatosis and elevated hepatic expression of CD36, a   transport protein. The increased CD36 expression was associated with activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). In primary cultured hepatocytes, high levels of homocysteine (Hcy) treatment up-regulated CD36 and increased subsequent lipid uptake; both were significantly attenuated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of CD36 and AHR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Hcy promoted binding of AHR to the CD36 promoter, and transient transfection assay demonstrated markedly increased activity of the AHR response element by Hcy, which was ligand dependent. Mass spectrometry revealed significantly increased hepatic content of lipoxin A4 (LXA4 ), a metabolite of , in HMD-fed mice. Furthermore, overexpression of 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase 1, a LXA4 inactivation enzyme, inhibited Hcy-induced AHR activation, lipid uptake, and lipid accumulation. Moreover, LXA4 -induced up-regulation of CD36 and lipid uptake was inhibited by AHR siRNA in vitro in hepatocytes. Finally, treatment with an AHR antagonist reversed HHcy-induced lipid accumulation by inhibiting the AHR-CD36 pathway in mice.HHcy activates the AHR-CD36 pathway by increasing hepatic LXA4 content, which results in hepatic steatosis.

Insulin reduced HMGCS2 mRNA and protein levels in HepG2 cells, even when treated with PUFA and monosaccharides. Several nuclear receptors and transcription factors are involved in HMGCS2 expression regulation. While peroxysome proliferator activated receptor α (PPAR-α) agonist WY14643 increased HMGCS2 expression, this treatment was unable to affect PUFA-mediated regulation of HMGCS2 expression. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) inhibitor AS1842856 reduced HMGCS2 expression and suppressed induction promoted by  acids.

OCA induced the expression of several hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) epoxygenases, the enzymes responsible for EET synthesis, and mitigated HFD-induced hepatic injury. In vitro, induction of CYP450 epoxygenases was sufficient to inhibit NF-kB signaling and cell migration. The CYP450 epoxygenase pan-inhibitor gemfibrozil fully abolished the protective effect of OCA, indicating that OCA-mediated inhibition of NF-kB signaling was EET-dependent. In summary, NAFLD was characterized by an imbalance in arachidonate metabolism. FXR activation reprogramed arachidonate metabolism by inducing P450 epoxygenase expression and EET production. In vitro, FXR-mediated NF-kB inhibition required active P450 epoxygenases.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640217>Characterization of Lipid Profiles after Dietary Intake of Polyunsaturated  Acids Using Integrated Untargeted and Targeted Lipidomics.</a></h2><p>Illuminating the comprehensive lipid profiles after dietary supplementation of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) is crucial to revealing the tissue distribution of PUFAs in living organisms, as well as to providing novel insights into lipid metabolism.

This study aims to decipher the role of LXRs in the regulation of polyunsaturated   (PUFA) synthesis in macrophages in the context of atherosclerosis.Transcriptomic analysis in human monocytes and macrophages was used to identify putative LXR target genes among enzymes involved in PUFA biosynthesis. In parallel, the consequences of LXR activation or LXR invalidation on PUFA synthesis and distribution were determined. Finally, we investigated the impact of LXR activation on PUFA metabolism in vivo in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. mRNA levels of acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 3,   desaturases 1 and 2, and   elongase 5 were significantly increased in human macrophages after LXR agonist treatment, involving both direct and sterol responsive element binding protein-1-dependent mechanisms.

At offspring postnatal day (PND) 20, milk leptin and nutrients were determined. At the end of lactation, maternal  and MG   profile were measured. Desaturase (Δ6D and Δ5D) and elongase (ELOVL 5 and ELOVL 2) protein was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting (WB) in the  and WB in the MG. In mothers, , MG and milk fat content were higher in MO than in C.   (AA) and EPA and MG EPA were lower in MO than in C.  desaturases were higher in MO. The MG was heavier in MO than in C, with decreased Δ5D expression in MO. Desaturases and elongases were immunolocalised in parenchymal cells of both groups. Milk yield, water, carbohydrate content, EPA and DHA were lower, whereas milk leptin and AA were higher in MO than in C.

Several AA-derived eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes) and DGLA-derived eicosanoids are reported to promote and/or prevent atherosclerosis progression through, at least in part, its proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects. To elucidate the effects of D5D inhibition by a D5D inhibitor on atherosclerosis, we generated a potent, orally available and selective D5D inhibitor, 2-(2,2,3,3,3-Pentafluoropropoxy)-3-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy) phenyl]-5,7-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6-dione, compound-326, and examined its effects on Western-diet fed  knockout (KO) mice. Oral administration of compound-326 (3-10 mg/kg per day for 15 weeks) significantly inhibited the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta without affecting plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Compound-326 significantly decreased AA levels, while it increased DGLA levels in the  and the blood accompanied by decreases in AA-derived eicosanoid production and increases in DGLA-derived eicosanoid production from the blood cells. We conclude that compound-326 prevents the progression of atherosclerosis in Western-diet fed  KO mice by modulating a profile of eicosanoid production, suggesting that D5D inhibitors can be a novel remedy for preventing atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events.

Imbalanced   incorporation in membranes, including increased  and decreased DHA concentrations, is known to play a critical role in chronic inflammation associated with bacterial infection. Other lipids, such as EPA and alkylglycerols, are also known to play a role in inflammation, particularly by stimulating the immune system, decreasing inflammation and inhibiting bacterial growth. In this context, the goal of the present study was to assess the effect of dietary DHA/EPA, in a 2:1 ratio, and alkylglycerols, as natural compounds extracted from oils of rays and chimeras, respectively, on the inflammatory reaction induced by P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection in mice. To this end, mice were fed with a control diet or isolipidic, isoenergetic diets prepared with oils enriched in DHA/EPA (2:1) or alkylglycerols for 5 weeks before the induction of acute P. aeruginosa lung infection by endotracheal instillation. In our model, DHA/EPA (2:1) significantly improved the survival of mice after infection, which was associated with the acceleration of bacterial clearance and the resolution of inflammation leading to the improvement of pulmonary injuries. By contrast, alkylglycerols did not affect the outcomes of P. aeruginosa infection. Our findings suggest that supplementation with ray oil enriched in DHA/EPA (2:1) can be considered as a preventive treatment for patients at risk for P. aeruginosa infection.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845248>Biological and environmental influence on tissue   compositions in wild tropical tunas.</a></h2><p>This study examined the   composition of three sympatric tropical tuna species (bigeye Thunnus obesus, yellowfin T. albacares and skipjack tuna Kastuwonus pelamis) sampled in the Western Indian Ocean in 2013.

The  and the red muscle were the fattest tissues (i.e., higher levels of storage lipids) in all species and polar lipids were the lowest in the white muscle. Species and tissue types explained most differences in   compositions, while environmental factors had limited effects, except in the hepatic cell membrane where   composition varied with monsoons. Docosahexaenoic  (22:6n-3) was the major   in both polar and neutral lipid fractions, especially in muscles.

Overall, an important inter-individual variability in   compositions of structural lipids was found within tissue types despite considering biological factors that are most likely to influence this type of lipids.

Weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were therefore provided control diets or diets with higher linoleic  (LA) or with higher LA and α-linolenic  (LA+ALA) for 6 weeks. Kidneys, livers, and serum were analyzed for oxylipins and  acids. The proportion of tissue oxylipins derived from LA was greater than the relative proportion of LA itself, whereas  (AA) oxylipins were overrepresented in serum. Higher dietary LA increased kidney LA and AA oxylipins, despite not altering LA or AA. In , both LA and AA and their oxylipins were higher, whereas in serum only LA oxylipins were higher with higher dietary LA. Higher LA resulted in a higher ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFA-derived oxylipins; adding ALA to the LA diet mitigated this and many, but not all, effects of the LA diet. Approximately 40% of oxylipins detected were influenced by sex and, unlike their PUFA precursors, most (>90%) of these were higher in males. These differences in dietary LA and sex on oxylipin and   profiles further our understanding of the effects of  acids and may have implications for dietary LA recommendations.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25801059>Characterization of the comparative drug binding to intra- (   binding protein) and extra- (human serum albumin) cellular proteins.</a></h2><p>1.

Increased n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) ratio can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that characterize NASH. Our recent study with n-3 PUFA showed improvement in individual histologic parameters like steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation. We hypothesized that n-3 PUFA therapy mediated improvement in histologic parameters is modulated by lipidomic and proteomic changes.We therefore evaluated hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic profiles before and after n-3 PUFA therapy in subjects with NASH. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with NASH received 6-month treatment with n-3 PUFA (0.945 g/day [64% alpha-linolenic (ALA), 21% eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and 16% docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids]). Paired  biopsy and plasma collected before and after-n-3 PUFA therapy were assessed using mass spectrometry and gas chromatography for hepatic proteomics and plasma lipidomics. Data were matched to UniProt and LIPID MAPS database, respectively. Cytoscape software was used to analyze functional pathways. Twenty-seven NASH patients with paired  histology and plasma before and after n-3 PUFA treatment were studied.Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly increased ALA, EPA, and glycerophospholipids, and decreased  (p < 0.05 for all). Further, proteomic markers of cell matrix, lipid metabolism, ER stress and cellular respiratory pathways were also modulated. Interestingly, these alterations reflected functional changes highly suggestive of decreased cellular lipotoxicity potential; reduced ER proteasome degradation of proteins and induction of chaperones; and a shift in cell energy homeostasis towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation.Six-month treatment with omega-3 PUFAs significantly improved hepatic proteomic and plasma lipidomic markers of lipogenesis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial functions in patients with NASH.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) is due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells because of enhanced production of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines released by immunocytes infiltrating the pancreas in response to unknown exogenous and endogenous toxin(s). On the other hand, type 2 DM is due to increased peripheral insulin resistance secondary to enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF-α in response to high-fat and/or calorie-rich diet (rich in saturated and trans fats). Type 2 DM is also associated with significant alterations in the production and action of hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, BDNF, free radicals, gut hormones, and vagus nerve activity. Thus, type 1 DM is because of excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines close to β cells, whereas type 2 DM is due to excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the systemic circulation. Hence, methods designed to suppress excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines may form a new approach to prevent both type 1 and type 2 DM. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and similar surgeries ameliorate type 2 DM, partly by restoring to normal: gut hormones, hypothalamic neurotransmitters, eNO, vagal activity, gut microbiota, bioactive lipids, BDNF production in the gut and hypothalamus, concentrations of cytokines and free radicals that results in resetting glucose-stimulated insulin production by pancreatic β cells. Our recent studies suggested that bioactive lipids, such as , eicosapentaneoic , and docosahexaenoic  (which are unsaturated  acids) and their anti-inflammatory metabolites: lipoxin A4, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, may have antidiabetic actions. These bioactive lipids have anti-inflammatory actions, enhance eNO, BDNF production, restore hypothalamic dysfunction, enhance vagal tone, modulate production and action of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin, and influence gut microbiota that may explain their antidiabetic action. These pieces of evidence suggest that methods designed to selectively deliver bioactive lipids to pancreatic β cells, gut, , and muscle may prevent type 1 and type 2 DM.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30203570>Impact of Fabp1 Gene Ablation on Uptake and Degradation of Endocannabinoids in Mouse Hepatocytes.</a></h2><p> --binding protein (FABP1, L-FABP) is the major cytosolic binding/chaperone protein for both precursor  (ARA) and the endocannabinoid (EC) products N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Although FABP1 regulates hepatic uptake and metabolism of ARA, almost nothing is known regarding FABP1's impact on AEA and 2-AG uptake, intracellular distribution, and targeting of AEA and 2-AG to degradative hepatic enzymes. In vitro assays revealed that FABP1 considerably enhanced monoacylglycerol lipase hydrolysis of 2-AG but only modestly enhanced AEA hydrolysis by - amide hydrolase. Conversely, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of lipids from Fabp1 gene-ablated (LKO) hepatocytes confirmed that loss of FABP1 markedly diminished hydrolysis of 2-AG. Furthermore, the real-time imaging of novel fluorescent NBD-labeled probes (NBD-AEA, NBD-2-AG, and NBD-ARA) resolved FABP1's impact on uptake vs intracellular targeting/hydrolysis. FABP1 bound NBD-ARA with 2:1 stoichiometry analogous to ARA, but bound NBD-2-AG and NBD-AEA with 1:1 stoichiometry-apparently at different sites in FABP1's binding cavity. All three probes were taken up, but NBD-2-AG and NBD-AEA were targeted to lipid droplets. LKO reduced the uptake of NBD-ARA as expected, significantly enhanced that of NBD-AEA, but had little effect on NBD-2-AG. These data indicated that FABP1 impacts hepatocyte EC levels by binding EC and differentially impacts their intracellular hydrolysis (2-AG) and uptake (AEA).© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28396286>Altered mitochondrial and peroxisomal integrity in lipocalin-2-deficient mice with hepatic steatosis.</a></h2><p>Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a secreted adipokine that transports small hydrophobic molecules such as  acids and steroids.

The result of total   composition of HBV-cirrhotic patients with comparison of control subjects reveals that palmitic (24.54 g/100 g) and palmitoleic  (4.65 g/100 g) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher whereas eicosatrienoic (0.09 g/100 g),  (3.57 g/100 g), linoleic (22.75 g/100 g) and α-linolenic  (0.12 g/100 g) were significantly lower. Marker for stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD = ∆9-desaturase) activity i.e. palmitoleic: palmitic (0.2) and oleic: stearic  (1.5) ratios, originated higher in HBV-cirrhotic patients, while PUFA: SFA (0.6) was lower in HBV-cirrhosis patients as compared with control subjects. The serum SFA and MUFA were increased while PUFA were reduced in both total and free form.Present study concluded that hypolipidemia observed in HBV-cirrhosis patients, MELD were found to be independent predictors of survival and alteration in   composition, possibly due to impairment in   metabolism by enzymatic elongation and desaturation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29152236>Low levels of very-long-chain -3 PUFA in Atlantic salmon () diet reduce fish robustness under challenging conditions in sea cages.</a></h2><p>The present study aimed to determine the minimum requirements of the essential -3  acids EPA and DHA in Atlantic salmon () that can secure their health under challenging conditions in sea cages.

Study suggests that down-regulation of Cyp4a14 has an anti-inflammatory response in intestine. The present study was to test the function of Cyp4a14 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis.Female Cyp4a14-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with DSS for 6 days to induce colitis. The colon of mice was histologically observed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic  Schiff (PAS) staining. The serum malondialdehyde (MDA), an endogenous indicator of oxidative stress, was chemically measured. Proinflammatory and NADPH oxidase genes were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).Cyp4a14-KO mice had a significantly higher number of goblet cells in the colon and were more resistant to DSS-induced colitis compared with the WT mice. The DSS-treated KO mice had lower levels of MDA. Consistent with the milder inflammatory pathological changes, DSS-treated KO mice had lower levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA in the  and the colon. Moreover, the colon of DSS-treated Cyp4a14-KO and WT mice had higher mRNA levels of two members of NADPH oxidases, Nox2 and Nox4, suggesting that both Nox2 and Nox4 are inflammatory markers. By contrast, DSS-treated WT and KO mice had drastically decreased epithelium-localized Nox1 and dual oxidase (Duox) 2 mRNA levels, coinciding with the erosion of the mucosa induced by DSS.These results suggests a hypothesis that the increased goblet cell in the colon of Cyp4a14-KO mice provides protection from mucosal injury and Cyp4a14-increased oxidative stress exacerbates DSS-induced colitis. Therefore, Cyp4a14 may represent a potential target for treating colitis.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Relatively little is known about factors outside the central nervous system that may mediate the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on brain endocannabinoid levels. One candidate is the    binding protein (FABP1), a cytosolic protein highly prevalent in , but not detected in brain, which facilitates hepatic clearance of  acids. The impact of Fabp1 gene ablation (LKO) on the effect of high-fat diet (HFD) on brain and plasma endocannabinoid levels was examined and data expressed for each parameter as the ratio of high-fat diet/control diet. In male wild-type mice, HFD markedly increased brain N-acylethanolamides, but not 2-monoacylglycerols. LKO blocked these effects of HFD in male mice. In female wild-type mice, HFD slightly decreased or did not alter these endocannabinoids as compared with male wild type. LKO did not block the HFD effects in female mice. The HFD-induced increase in brain -derived arachidonoylethanolamide in males correlated with increased brain-free and total . The ability of LKO to block the HFD-induced increase in brain arachidonoylethanolamide correlated with reduced ability of HFD to increase brain-free and total  in males. In females, brain-free and total  levels were much less affected by either HFD or LKO in the context of HFD. These data showed that LKO markedly diminished the impact of HFD on brain endocannabinoid levels, especially in male mice.© 2016 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25881314>Differential regulation of protein expression in response to polyunsaturated  acids in the  of apoE-knockout mice and in HepG2 cells.</a></h2><p>Polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) are nutrients necessary for life. The  is the essential metabolic center, which aids in maintaining health via diverse biological actions. In the present work, a proteomics study was conducted with an aim to provide new insights into PUFA-regulated hepatic protein expression in apoE-knockout mice. Additionally, we investigated how n-3 PUFAs influence cytokine-challenge by using HepG2 cells as a model.Through the proteomic analysis using 2-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we found that 28, 23, 14, and 28 hepatic proteins were up-regulated at least a two-fold difference in intensity compared with the control group in mice treated with the docosahexaenoic , eicosapentaenoic , , and linoleic , respectively. In contrast, 12 hepatic proteins were down-regulated with a ratio value of less than 0.5 compared to their control counterparts by these four  acids. All of the altered proteins were then sorted according to their biochemical properties related to metabolism, redox stress/inflammation, enzymatic reactions, and miscellaneous functions. The results provide evidence that PUFAs may act as either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory agents. Cytokine-challenged HepG2 cells were used to reveal the anti-inflammatory function of n-3 PUFAs. The results showed that interleukin (IL)-1β combined with IL-6 induced C-reactive protein (CRP) mRNA expression and its protein secretion by HepG2 cells. The CRP promoter activity was significantly increased in the IL-6-treated cells, whereas IL-1β alone had no effect. However, IL-1β and IL-6 acted synergistically to further enhance CRP promoter activities. Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and the phosphorylation of the nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) during cytokine-induced CRP production.This study indicates that PUFAs induced changes in the hepatic protein profile in vivo. Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs exert their anti-inflammatory properties through differential molecular mechanisms in hepatic cells.

An unbalanced AA/EPA ratio in favor of AA leads to the development of different metabolic disorders, including non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different diets, alone and in combination with two physical activity programs, on the AA/EPA ratio value in erythrocyte membranes of patients with NAFLD. One hundred forty-two subjects with NAFLD were enrolled in the study and randomized into six treatment groups. AA/EPA ratio was significantly reduced after 90 days of treatment with only a program of aerobic activity. However, it appears that the combination of physical activity and a Low Glycemic Index Mediterranean Diet (LGIMD) was more efficacious in reducing AA/EPA levels, at 45 days of treatment, even if this effect was not maintained over time. The combined effect of diet and physical activity reduced the AA/EPA ratio value improving the score of steatosis.

Total FA profile of stomach contents and adipose tissue, triacylglycerols (TAG), and phospholipids (PL) from  and muscle of the omnivorous Astyanax fasciatus and the carnivorous Hoplias malabaricus were analyzed by gas chromatography. A prevalence of n-6PUFA, as 18:2n-6 (linoleic ) and 20:4n-6 (, ARA) was observed in the stomach contents and in the tissues of A. fasciatus from the PN reservoir. In contrast, n-3 LC-PUFA, as 20:5n-3 (eicosapentaenoic , EPA) was accumulated in fish tissues from Bil, resulting in higher n3/n6 and EPA/ARA ratios, compared to fish from PN. This differential FA accumulation was also observed for H. malabaricus, but differences were slightly minor, and no changes were observed in the EPA/ARA ratios between fish from both reservoirs. Regardless reservoir, FA profiles of TAG resembled that of their diet, whereas FA profiles of PL were more conservative and mainly comprised by LC-PUFA. We conclude that reservoir trophic status affected the FA composition of food resources available to these fish species, resulting in differential allocation of n-3 and n-6 FA.

However, ARA in both phospholipids and TAG was markedly present in the muscle and viscera of all specimens, particularly in C. japonicus and K. bigibbus. Moreover, their ARA levels were higher than the levels of DHA and EPA. The observed high ARA level is unusual in marine fish and might be characteristic of herbivorous fish.

In vitro adipocyte analysis including oxygen consumption by Seahorse and real-time PCR analysis were performed to confirm our in vivo findings.Ad-KO mice were protected against DIO, adipocyte death, and metabolic dysfunction. Adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) had reduced incorporation of AA into phospholipids (PL), free AA, and levels of the AA lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Additionally, adipocytes from Ad-KO mice fed HFD had reduced p53 activation and increased adipocyte oxygen consumption (OCR), which we demonstrated are direct effects of 4-HNE on adipocytes in vitro.These studies are the first to elucidate ACSL4's in vivo actions to regulate the incorporation of AA into PL and downstream effects on DIO-associated adipocyte dysfunction. By reducing the incorporation of AA into PL and free   pools in adipocytes, Ad-KO mice were significantly protected against HFD-induced increases in adipose and  fat accumulation, adipocyte death, gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) inflammation, and insulin resistance (IR). Additionally, deficiency of adipocyte ACSL4 expression in mice fed a HFD resulted in increased gWAT adipocyte OCR and whole body energy expenditure (EE).Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Echium oil (EO), which is rich in stearidonic  (SDA, 18:4n-3), could potentially improve the deposition of n-3 LC-PUFA as the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA is enhanced through bypassing the rate-limiting ∆6 desaturation step. We report for the first time an attempt to investigate whether the presence of a desaturase (Fads2) capable of ∆4 desaturation activities and an elongase (Elovl5) will leverage the provision of dietary SDA to produce a higher rate of LC-PUFA bioconversion. Experimental diets were designed containing fish oil (FO), EO or linseed oil (LO) (100FO, 100EO, 100LO), and diets which comprised equal mixtures of the designated oils (50EOFO and 50EOLO) were evaluated in a 12-week feeding trial involving striped snakeheads (Channa striata). There was no significant difference in growth and feed conversion efficiency. The hepatic   composition and higher expression of fads2 and elovl5 genes in fish fed EO-based diets indicate the utilization of dietary SDA for LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Collectively, this resulted in a higher deposition of muscle eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3) compared to LO-based diets. Dietary EO improved the ratio of n-3 LC-PUFA to n-6 LC-PUFA in fish muscle, which is desirable for human populations with excessive consumption of n-6 PUFA.

Diet had an effect on the majority of sperm  acids, on the total volume of extractable milt, and on the percentage of motile sperm. Here, our results suggest that the total volume of extractable milt is a DHA-dependent process, as we found the diets with the highest DHA levels induced the most milt while the diet with the lowest DHA level induced the least amount of milt. The diet with the highest level of ARA induced medium milt volumes but had the highest sperm motility.

The aim of this work was to study changes in the hepatic lipidome due to UDCA-LPE.High fat diet mouse model, mass spectometry, RT-PCR.Hepatic lipid extracts of HFD mice were analysed by mass spectrometry. The results determined higher levels of total, saturated, mono- and diunsaturated  acids (FA) in HFD mice, which were decreased by UDCA-LPE predominantly by the reducing the most abundant FA species palmitic  and oleic . Unlike other FA species, levels of long-chain polyunsaturated  acids (LCPUFA), which are composed of  (ARA), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA), were increased in HFD mice upon UDCA-LPE treatment, mainly due to elevated hepatic ARA pools. Analysis of hepatic phospholipids species showed a decrease in total phosphatidylcholine (PC), especially monounsaturated PC (PUFA-PC) levels in HFD mice. Loss of total PC was reversed due to UDCA-LPE by increasing hepatic PUFA-PC pools. Gene expression analysis showed that UDCA-LPE upregulated PPARα, a key transcriptional regulator of   oxidation, as well as downstream target genes CPT1α and AOX, which are crucially involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal   oxidation.UDCA-LPE modulates defective   metabolism during experimental NAFLD thereby restoring altered lipid profiles in addition to its pronounced anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, UDCA-LPE may be a promising drug candidate for the management of NAFLD.© 2015 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26543039>Dietary ALA from Spinach Enhances  n-3   Content to Greater Extent than Linseed Oil in Mice Fed Equivalent Amounts of ALA.</a></h2><p>Although several works have reported absorption rate differences of n-3 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFA) bound to different lipid forms, such as ethyl ester, triacylglycerol (TAG), and phospholipids, no studies have investigated the effect of n-3 PUFA from glycolipids (GL). The present study compared the   contents of tissue and serum lipids from normal C57BL/6J mice fed two types of α-linolenic  (ALA)-rich lipids, spinach lipid (SPL), and linseed oil (LO). ALA was primarily present as the GL form in SPL, while it existed as TAG in LO. Supplementation of both lipids increased ALA and its n-3 metabolites, eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic , and decreased n-6 PUFA, linoleic  and , in the livers, small intestines, and sera of the treated mice compared with those of the control group. When the comparison between the SPL and LO diets containing the same amount of ALA was conducted, the EPA and DPA levels in the  lipids from mice fed the SPL diet were significantly higher than those fed the LO diet.

Currently, the driver for this progression is not fully understood; in particular, it is not known how NAFLD and its early progression affects the distribution of lipids in the , producing lipotoxicity and inflammation. In this study, we used dietary and genetic mouse models of NAFL and NASH and translated the results to humans by correlating the spatial distribution of lipids in  tissue with disease progression using advanced mass spectrometry imaging technology. We identified several lipids with distinct zonal distributions in control and NAFL samples and observed partial to complete loss of lipid zonation in NASH. In addition, we found increased hepatic expression of genes associated with remodeling the phospholipid membrane, release of  (AA) from the membrane, and production of eicosanoid species that promote inflammation and cell injury. The results of our immunohistochemistry analyses suggest that the zonal location of remodeling enzyme LPCAT2 plays a role in the change in spatial distribution for AA-containing lipids. This results in a cycle of AA-enrichment in pericentral hepatocytes, membrane release of AA, and generation of proinflammatory eicosanoids and may account for increased oxidative damage in pericentral regions in NASH.NAFLD is associated not only with lipid enrichment, but also with zonal changes of specific lipids and their associated metabolic pathways. This may play a role in the heterogeneous development of NAFLD. (Hepatology 2017;65:1165-1180).© 2016 by The Authors.

We aimed to investigate the determinants of serum glycerophospholipids' FAs in CF with regard to the highest number of FAs and in the largest cohort to date. The study comprised 172 CF patients and 30 healthy subjects (HS). We assessed Fas' profile (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), CF transmembrane conductance regulator () genotype, spirometry, fecal elastase-1, body height and weight ,  disease, diabetes and colonization by . The amounts of saturated FAs (C14:0, C16:0) and monounsaturated FAs (C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9, C20:1n-9, C20:3n-9) were significantly higher in CF patients than in HS. C18:3n-6, C20:3n-6 and C22:4n-6 levels were also higher in CF, but C18:2n-6, C20:2n-6 and C20:4n-6, as well as C22:6n-3, were lower. In a multiple regression analysis, levels of seven FAs were predicted by various sets of factors that included age, genotype, forced expiratory volume in one second, pancreatic status and diabetes. FA composition abnormalities are highly prevalent in CF patients. They seem to be caused by both metabolic disturbances and independent clinical risk factors.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor,  (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic  (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,   amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the  and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264165>Binding of polyunsaturated  acids to LXRα and modulation of SREBP-1 interaction with a specific SCD1 promoter element.</a></h2><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the rate limiting enzyme in unsaturated   biosynthesis. This enzyme has an important role in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis and lipid oxidation, and alterations in these pathways may lead to several diseases. We examined, in HepG2 cell cultures, the mechanism of SCD1 regulation considering the involvement of two transcription factors:  X receptor alpha (LXRα) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), also investigating the effect of dietary polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) on this process. The analysis of SCD1 promoter allowed to identify a functional SREBP-1 binding site (SRE 1). LXRα activation increased SCD1 protein level through upregulation of SREBP-1 and its consequent binding to SRE 1 sequence. Polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic  (DHA, C22:6), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, C20:5) and  (AA, C20:4) were able to reduce SREBP-1 binding to SCD1 promoter, while saturated stearic  (SA, C18:0) did not give any effect. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed a direct binding of DHA, EPA and AA to LXRα. These data indicate a direct inhibitory interaction of PUFAs with LXRα, a consequent reduction of SREBP-1 and of its binding to SCD1 promoter.

Little information is known regarding the influence of lipid composition in the background diet on the modulatory effect of FO supplementation on CVDs. The present study was designed to investigate the influence of various background dietary lipids and FO on selected cardiovascular risk factors in rats. Adult Wistar rats were fed semisynthetic diet with FO at 1.0% or 2.0% along with other lipids, namely, medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs), monounsaturated  acids (MUFAs), n-6 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) and n-3 PUFAs, for 5 weeks. Some of the potent CVD risk factors were estimated in the rats. FO at 1.0% and 2.0% has significantly reduced serum lipid peroxides, total cholesterol, triglycerides (TAGs), tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein;  and adipose TAG and cholesterol levels in MCT, MUFA and n-6 PUFA diet groups. Notably, these alterations were comparatively higher in 1.0% FO-substituted MCT and MUFA diet groups. Interestingly, feeding of FO along with n-3 PUFAs did not show additive effect in attenuation of these factors. Serum  EPA and DHA levels were remarkably elevated in rats fed FO-enriched MCT or MUFA diets. Our results suggest that MCTs or MUFAs in the background diet might promote the beneficial effects of FO on CVDs.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum metabolic differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high-fat mice, in addition, the phenotype of  and fat stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in , glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3  , phosphatidylinositol phosphate and tyrosine metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of   metabolism and inflammation.

It was previously demonstrated that 10% of S-777469, a cannabinoid receptor 2 selective agonist, is metabolized to its carboxylic  metabolite (S-777469 5-carboxylic , 5-CA) in humans in vivo, while the formation of 5-CA is extremely low in human cryopreserved hepatocytes and  microsomes (HLMs). In this study, factors causing the different metabolite formation rates of S-777469 in vitro and in vivo were investigated. 2. Formation of 5-CA and S-777469 5-hydroxymethyl (5-HM), a precursor metabolite of 5-CA, was catalyzed by CYP2C9. , α-linolenic , oleic  and myristic , which have been reported to exist in  microsomes, inhibited S-777469 oxidation by CYP2C9, but serum albumin enhanced this reactions. 3. The IC50 values of these  acids for 5-CA formation from 5-HM were lower than those of 5-HM formation from S-777469. Serum albumin extensively enhanced 5-CA formation from 5-HM in comparison to 5-HM formation from S-777469. 4. CYP2C9 was the enzyme responsible for S-777469 oxidation in human livers.

For this purpose, a rat model for IDDM was established by streptozotocin application. The rats were randomly divided into four groups of 8 animals each: CON 6 (control group sacrificed after 6 months of the experiment), CON 12 (control group sacrificed after 12 months of the experiment), DM 6 (streptozotocin treated and sacrificed after 6 months of diabetes) and DM 12 (streptozotocin treated and sacrificed after 12 months of diabetes). The periods of 6 and 12 months were taken to observe the changes in lipid metabolism for chronic, long-term diabetes.   profiles of the  and skeletal muscle total lipids and phospholipids as well as desaturation indices for ∆6 desaturase (D6D), ∆5 desaturase (∆6D), ∆9 desaturase (∆9D) and de novo lipogenesis index (DNL) were estimated. Additionally the long-term effects (12 months) were tested in the brain, perirenal fat and bone marrow. The   composition of lipids was altered in IDDM rats in all tested tissues. The desaturation indices revealed the expected significant decrease in ∆9D and ∆5D indices in tested tissues, while indices for ∆6D were not influenced by diabetes. DNL revealed the strong inhibition of de novo lipogenesis in the  tissue. Values for  C20:4n6 () significantly decreased in  total lipids in DM 6 and DM 12 groups and in phospholipids in the DM 12 group. Surprisingly, values for C20:4n6 were also significantly lower in the brain tissue in the DM 12 group. Accumulation of C20:4n6 precursors (C18:2n6 and C20:3n6) was visible in all tissues. Docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n3) significantly decreased in  total lipids,  phospholipids and in the brain phospholipids of the DM 12 group. The present results show that age could exacerbate the expected decrease in the  synthesis of C20:4n6 in IDDM. Moreover, long-term diabetes could impair C22:6n3 synthesis in the  and muscle, and incorporation of both important  acids into brain phospholipids. In conclusion, numerous changes in   composition are caused by long-term diabetes in aged rats. These changes could be involved in the pathogenesis of senile and diabetes-induced damage.

Thus, our objective was to evaluate the effect of long-term consumption of weakly oxidised PUFA from flaxseed oil on oxidative stress biomarkers of LDL-receptor(-/-) mice. To test our hypothesis, mice were separated into three groups. The first group received a high-fat diet containing fresh flaxseed oil (CONT-), the second was fed the same diet prepared using heated flaxseed oil (OXID), and the third group received the same diet containing fresh flaxseed oil and had diabetes induced by streptozotocin (CONT+). Oxidative stress, aortic parameters and non-alcoholic  disease were assessed. After 3 months, plasma lipid profile, glucose levels, body weight, energy intake and dietary intake did not differ among groups. Likewise, oxidative stress, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic MDA expressed as nmol/mg portion (ptn) and antioxidant enzymes did not differ among the groups. Hepatic linoleic , α-linolenic ,  and EPA  declined in the OXID and CONT+ groups. Aortic wall thickness, lumen and diameter increased only in the OXID group.

Twenty-four C57Bl/6 mice were distributed into four experimental groups according to the diet consumed: Control Diet (CD), Structured Lipids Diet (SLD), High-fat Control Diet (HCD), High-fat Structured Lipids Diet (HSLD). The animals that were fed SLs presented a smaller weight gain, despite a larger intake of the diet. The lowest weight gain was reflected in reduced amounts of adipose tissue and lower  weight. A significant increase in lipids excreted by the animals in the feces was observed, despite there being no sign of toxicity or presence of diarrhea. The animals that consumed the HSLD presented lower total and LDL-cholesterol, increased HDL-cholesterol and increased hepatic  and docosahexaenoic  levels.

Cardiotoxicity is very rare in patients treated with erlotinib, but considerably more common after sunitinib treatment. We hypothesized that the deleterious effects of TKIs on the heart were related to their impact on cardiac metabolism.  Female FVB/N mice (10/group) were treated with therapeutic doses of sunitinib (40 mg/kg), erlotinib (50 mg/kg), or vehicle daily for two weeks. Echocardiographic assessment of the heart in vivo was performed at baseline and on Day 14. Heart, skeletal muscle,  and serum were flash frozen and prepped for non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics analysis.

Acute and chronic in vitro treatments with nano- and micromolar BPA doses showed increased anandamide levels in line with decreased activity of   amide hydrolase, the main anandamide hydrolytic enzyme, and induced triglyceride accumulation in HHL-5 cells in a CB1-dependent manner. We conclude that BPA is able to produce hepatosteatosis in zebrafish and human hepatocytes by up-regulating the endocannabinoid system.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27559358>Effects of dietary fat subtypes on glucose homeostasis during pregnancy in rats.</a></h2><p>Dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) have an impact on insulin secretion and sensitivity but whether and how these may be related to maternal glucose homeostasis during pregnancy is unclear.Female Wistar rats (240-250 g) were assigned to laboratory CHOW or high fat diets rich in either n-6 (safflower oil; n-6 group) or n-6 + n-3 (safflower oil + fish oil; n-3 group) PUFAs. After 10 days half of the animals in each diet group were inseminated and confirmed pregnant. An overnight fasted intravenous glucose tolerance test (500 mg glucose/kg body weight) was performed on chronically cannulated non-pregnant and 20-day pregnant rats.

As recently found, PUFAs play significantly protective roles in , cardiovascular system and kidney. They also are widely used in total parenteral nutrition. We evaluated the effect of omega-3 PUFA consumption on    composition and the expression of CYP2E1, one of the key enzymes in detoxification and prooxidant systems of  cells. To estimate the oxidative stress in  tissue, the antioxidant status and the level of lipid peroxidation were determined in a rodent model. Animals were divided into two groups: control (n = 10) and experimental (n = 10). Epadol-containing omega-3 PUFA fish oil capsules were administered to Wistar rats within 4 weeks (0.1 mL/100 g b.w./day). The consumption of omega-3 PUFAs resulted in changes of   composition of  tissue.

Similar conjugates were also characterized for -acetylcysteine (NAC) and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Extensive LC-MS/MS characterization using a synthetic α-linolenic hydroxy-endoperoxide (ALA-O) derivative revealed at least two types of mechanisms leading to thiol adduction: a mechanism involving the nucleophilic attack by thiolate anion on 1,2-dioxolane to form a sulfenate ester-bonded conjugate and a mechanism involving cleavage of the dioxolane to form a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl followed by the Michael addition reaction. Finally, we detected a GSH conjugate with hydroxy-endoperoxide derived from linoleic  (LA-O) in mice .

The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex, involving crosstalk between multiple organs, cell-types, and environmental and genetic factors. Dysfunction of the adipose tissue plays a central role in NAFLD progression. Here, we analysed transcriptomics data obtained from the Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) of NAFLD patients to understand how the VAT metabolism is altered at the genome scale and co-regulated with other cellular processes during the progression from obesity to NASH with fibrosis. For this purpose, we performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), a method that organizes the disease transcriptome into functional modules of cellular processes and pathways. Our analysis revealed the coordination of metabolic and inflammatory modules (termed "immunometabolism") in the VAT of NAFLD patients. We found that genes of , sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid metabolism were upregulated and co-expressed with genes of proinflammatory signalling pathways and hypoxia in NASH/NASH with fibrosis. We hypothesize that these metabolic alterations might play a role in sustaining VAT inflammation. Furthermore, immunometabolism related genes were also co-expressed with genes involved in Extracellular Matrix (ECM) degradation. Our analysis indicates that upregulation of both ECM degrading enzymes and their inhibitors (incoherent feedforward loop) potentially leads to the ECM deposition in the VAT of NASH with fibrosis patients.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703151>Omega-3 and -6   plasma levels are not associated with  cirrhosis-associated systemic inflammation.</a></h2><p> cirrhosis is associated with profound immunodysfunction, i.e. a parallel presence of chronic systemic inflammation and immunosuppression, which can result in acute-on-chronic  failure (ACLF).

Three experimental diets differing basically in DHA:EPA ratio, that is, 0·68 (diet D:E-0·68), 1·09 (D:E-1·09) and 2·05 (D:E-2·05), were randomly assigned to nine tanks of 3-year-old tongue sole (ten females and fifteen males in each tank). The feeding trail lasted for 90 d before and during the spawning season. Fish were reared in a flowing seawater system and fed to apparent satiation twice daily. Compared with diet D:E-0·68, diet D:E-1·09 significantly enhanced the oestradiol production in females, whereas diet D:E-2·05 significantly enhanced the testosterone production in males. In ovaries, diet D:E-1·09 induced highest mRNA expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). In testes, diet 2·05 resulted in highest mRNA expression of FSHR, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450c17 and 3β-HSD.   profiles in fish tissues reflected closely those of diets. Female fish had more gonadal EPA content but less DHA content than male fish, whereas there was a reverse observation in . In conclusion, the dietary DHA:EPA ratio, possibly combined with the dietary EPA: ratio, differentially regulated sex steroid hormone synthesis in mature female and male tongue soles.

The MBOAT7 is a susceptibility risk genetic locus for non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) and mental retardation. Although it has been shown that MBOAT7 is associated to membranes, the MBOAT7 topology remains unknown. To solve the topological organization of MBOAT7, we performed: A) solubilization of the total membrane fraction of cells overexpressing the recombinant MBOAT7-V5, which revealed MBOAT7 is an integral protein strongly attached to endomembranes; B) in silico analysis by using 22 computational methods, which predicted the number and localization of transmembrane domains of MBOAT7 with a range between 5 and 12; C) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with GFP-tagged MBOAT7 full length and truncated forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, co-immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Protease Protection (FPP) assay; D) in vitro analysis of living cells transfected with FLAG-tagged MBOAT7 full length forms, using a combination of Western Blotting, selective membrane permeabilization followed by indirect immunofluorescence. All together, these data revealed that MBOAT7 is a multispanning transmembrane protein with six transmembrane domains. Based on our model, the predicted catalytic dyad of the protein, composed of the conserved asparagine in position 321 (Asn-321) and the preserved histidine in position 356 (His-356), has a lumenal localization.

We studied the effect of stable TM6SF2 knock-down on the lipid content and composition, mitochondrial   oxidation and organelle structure of HuH7 hepatoma cells. Knock-down of TM6SF2 resulted in intracellular accumulation of TAGs, cholesterol esters, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine.

The PCs encountered relative and absolute  (AA, 20:4n-6) depletion, and AA was also reduced in the total cellular   pool. Synthesis and turnover of the hepatocellular glycerolipids was enhanced. The TM6SF2 knock-down cells secreted lipoprotein-like particles with a smaller diameter than in the controls, and more lysosome/endosome structures appeared in the knock-down cells.

In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced  injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased  lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial   β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs  in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

We describe a case series of 3 complicated obese patients who were administered parenteral nutrition (PN), primarily using ClinOleic 20%, an olive oil-based lipid emulsion with reduced amounts of the essential  acids, linoleic and α-linolenic, compared with more conventional soybean oil emulsions throughout their hospital admission. Essential   profiles were obtained for each of these patients to investigate EFAD as a potential cause of abnormal  enzymes. Although the profiles revealed reduced linoleic  and elevated Mead  levels, this was not indicative of the development of essential   deficiency, as reflected in the more definitive measure of triene/tetraene ratio. Instead, although the serum   panel reflected the markedly lower but still adequate dietary linoleic  content and greatly increased oleic  content in the parenteral lipid emulsion, the triene/tetraene ratio remained well below the level, indicating EFAD in each of these patients. The availability and use of new IV lipid emulsions in PN should encourage the clinician to review lipid metabolism based on the quantity of  acids provided in specific parenteral lipid emulsions and the expected impact of these lipid emulsions (with quite different   composition) on measured   profiles.© 2015 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29027487>Effect of tauroursodeoxycholic  on PUFA levels and inflammation in an animal and cell model of hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) and inflammatory response in an animal and cell model of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Rats were divided into control, tunicamycin (TM)-treated, and TM + tauroursodeoxycholic  (TUDCA)-treated groups. Hepatic ER stress was induced by TM and the ER stress inhibitor TUDCA was injected 30 min before induction of ER stress.  THLE-3 cells were treated with TM and TUDCA was administered in advance to decrease cytotoxic effects. Necroinflammation was evaluated in  sections, while cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit. ER stress was confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of C/EBP-homologous protein and 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein.  (C20:4n-6), dihomo-γ-linolenic  (C20:3n-6), eicosapentaenoic  (C20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic  (C22:6n-3) in  tissue and THLE-3 cells were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were measured in tissue and cell samples. Hepatic ER stress was accomplished by TM and was alleviated by TUDCA. TM treatment significantly decreased PUFAs in both  and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. PLA2, COX, and PGE2 levels were significantly increased in TM-treated rats and THLE-3 cells compared to controls. TUDCA leads to a partial restoration of  PUFA levels and decreased PLA2, COX, and PGE2.

Forty NMRI female mice were divided into control (mated with intact male) and seminal vesicle excised (SVX)-mated (mated with SVX-male) groups. The phospholipid  acids composition was monitored during the fi rst fi ve days of pregnancy using gas chromatography and also implantation rate was evaluated on fi fth day of pregnancy.We found that levels of linoleic  (LNA) and  (ARA) showed a decreasing trend from the fi rst to the third day of pregnancy and then started to increase on the fourth day and peaked on the fi fth day. In contrast, the level of saturated FA (SFA) increased on the second and third day of pregnancy compared to the fi rst (p<0.05) and then decreased on the fourth and fi fth. We also found that the seminal vesicle secretion could affect the levels of LNA, ARA, SFA, and PUFA in uterine phospholipids especially on second and third day. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between ARA level and implantation rate in control but not SVX-mated groups.It can be concluded that several uterus FA that have important roles in early pregnancy could be affected by seminal vesicle secretion.Copyright® by the International Brazilian Journal of Urology.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267642>Fundamental studies of adrenal retinoid-X-receptor: Protein isoform, tissue expression, subcellular distribution, and ligand availability.</a></h2><p>Adrenal gland reportedly expresses many nuclear receptors that are known to heterodimerize with retinoid-X-receptor (RXR) for functions, but the information regarding the glandular RXR is not adequate. Studies of rat adrenal homogenate by Western blotting revealed three RXR proteins: RXRα (55kDa), RXRβ (47kDa) and RXR (56kDa). RXRγ was not detectable. After fractionation, RXRα was almost exclusively localized in the nuclear fraction. In comparison, substantial portions of RXRβ and RXR were found in both nuclear and post-nuclear particle fractions, suggesting genomic and non-genomic functions. Cells immunostained for RXRα were primarily localized in zona fasciculata (ZF) and medulla, although some stained cells were found in zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona reticularis (ZR). In contrast, cells immunostained for RXRβ were concentrated principally in ZG, although some stained cells were seen in ZR, ZF, and medulla (in descending order, qualitatively). Analysis of adrenal lipid extracts by LC/MS did not detect 9-cis-retinoic  (a potent RXR-ligand) but identified all-trans retinoic . Since C20 and C22 polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) can also activate RXR, subcellular availabilities of unesterified  acids were investigated by GC/MS. As results,  (C20:4), adrenic  (C22:4), docosapentaenoic  (C22:5), and cervonic  (C22:6) were detected in the lipids extracted from each subcellular fraction. Thus, the RXR-agonizing PUFAs are available in all the main subcellular compartments considerably. The present findings not only shed light on the adrenal network of RXRs but also provide baseline information for further investigations of RXR heterodimers in the regulation of adrenal steroidogenesis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Since these cellular parameters can play an important role in the cellular response to organic and inorganic pollutants, a variation of the PUFA supply might modify the toxicity induced by such xenobiotics. In this work, we investigated whether the cellular   profile has an impact on the in vitro cell sensitivity to two environmental pollutants: methylmercury and cadmium. Firstly, the   composition of the rainbow trout  cell line RTL-W1 was modified by enriching the growth medium with either alpha-linolenic  (ALA, 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic  (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3), linoleic  (LA, 18:2n-6),  (AA, 20:4n-6) or docosapentaenoic  (DPA, 22:5n-6). These modified cells and their control (no PUFA enrichment) were then challenged for 24h with increasing concentrations of methylmercury or cadmium. We observed that (i) the phospholipid composition of the RTL-W1 cells was profoundly modulated by changing the PUFA content of the growth medium: major modifications were a high incorporation of the supplemented PUFA in the cellular phospholipids, the appearance of direct elongation and desaturation metabolites in the cellular phospholipids as well as a change in the gross phospholipid composition (PUFA and monounsaturated   (MUFA) levels and n-3/n-6 ratio); (ii) ALA, EPA and DPA enrichment significantly protected the RTL-W1 cells against both methylmercury and cadmium; (iv) DHA enrichment significantly protected the cells against cadmium but not methylmercury; (v) AA and LA enrichment had no impact on the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium; (vi) the abundance of 20:3n-6, a metabolite of the n-6 biotransformation pathway, in phospholipids was negatively correlated to the cell tolerance to both methylmercury and cadmium. Overall, our results highlighted the importance of the   supply on the tolerance of fish  cells to methylmercury and cadmium.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In experiment 1, 400 females and 40 males (30 week age) of Ross 308 broiler breeder (20 females and two males in each pen) were randomly assigned to one of the four diets with n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 4, 6, 8 and 16 (control). As a measure of hatchability, fertility of eggs and general incubation traits, 1,200 eggs (60 eggs from each pen) were collected and incubated for 21 days and embryo  and brain   profile in 14 and 21 days were determined. In experiment 2, 48 males (three males in each pen) randomly assigned to one of the four diets with n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 4, 6, 8 and 16 (control). Semen was collected twice weekly, and semen volume, spermatozoa concentration and motility and alive and dead spermatozoa were estimated. Egg production and egg mass were decreased by n-6/n-3 FA ratios of 4:1 and 6:1 (p < .05). There were no significant differences between treatments on breeder's body weight, eggs fertility and hatchability, embryonic mortality and semen features.

In conclusion, absolute amount of n-3 and n-6 FAs in broiler breeder diet may be more important than n-6/n-3 FA ratios and to consider reproductive and performance traits of breeders, it is necessary to supply higher levels of n-3 and n-6 FA with respect to n-6/n-3 FA ratios.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556989>Gut microbiota and host metabolism in  cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota has the capacity to produce a diverse range of compounds that play a major role in regulating the activity of distal organs and the  is strategically positioned downstream of the gut. Gut microbiota linked compounds such as short chain  acids, bile acids, choline metabolites, indole derivatives, vitamins, polyamines, lipids, neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormones have many biological functions. This review focuses on the gut microbiota and host metabolism in  cirrhosis. Dysbiosis in  cirrhosis causes serious complications, such as bacteremia and hepatic encephalopathy, accompanied by small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability. Gut dysbiosis in cirrhosis and intervention with probiotics and synbiotics in a clinical setting is reviewed and evaluated. Recent studies have revealed the relationship between gut microbiota and host metabolism in chronic metabolic  disease, especially, non-alcoholic  disease, alcoholic  disease, and with the gut microbiota metabolic interactions in dysbiosis related metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Recently, our understanding of the relationship between the gut and  and how this regulates systemic metabolic changes in  cirrhosis has increased.

Many clinical and experimental reports support the relationship between   metabolism and gut-microbiota. Various blood metabolome such as cytokines, amino acids, and vitamins are correlated with gut microbiota in probiotics-treated  cirrhosis patients.

Hence, including n-3 PUFA in the sow diet can be beneficial for reproduction. Both the amount and form (precursor  acids vs. long chain PUFA) of supplementation are important in this respect. Furthermore, including n-3 PUFA in the diet can have negative effects, such as decreased  (ARA) concentration and increased oxidative stress. This study aimed to compare the efficacy to increase eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) concentrations in the piglet, when different concentrations of linseed oil (LO, source of precursor α-linolenic ) or fish oil (FO, source of EPA and DHA) were included in the maternal diet. Sows were fed a palm oil diet or a diet including 0.5% or 2% LO or FO from day 45 of gestation until weaning. Linoleic  (LA) was kept constant in the diets to prevent a decrease in ARA, and all diets were supplemented with α-tocopherol acetate (150 mg/kg) and organic selenium (0.4 mg/kg) to prevent oxidative stress. Feeding 0.5% LO or 0.5% FO to the sows resulted in comparable EPA concentrations in the 5-day old piglet , but both diets resulted in lower EPA concentrations than when 2% LO was fed. The highest EPA concentration was obtained when 2% FO was fed. The DHA level in the piglet  could only be increased when FO, but not LO, was fed to the sows. The 2% FO diet had no advantage over the 0.5% FO diet to increase DHA in the piglet. Despite the constant LA concentration in the sow diet, a decrease in ARA could not be avoided when LO or FO were included in the diet. Feeding 2% FO to the sows increased the malondialdehyde concentration (marker for lipid peroxidation) in sow plasma, but not in piglets.Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320342>Prolonged niacin treatment leads to increased adipose tissue PUFA synthesis and anti-inflammatory lipid and oxylipin plasma profile.</a></h2><p>Prolonged niacin treatment elicits beneficial effects on the plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile that is associated with a protective CVD risk profile. Acute niacin treatment inhibits nonesterified   release from adipocytes and stimulates prostaglandin release from skin Langerhans cells, but the acute effects diminish upon prolonged treatment, while the beneficial effects remain. To gain insight in the prolonged effects of niacin on lipid metabolism in adipocytes, we used a mouse model with a human-like lipoprotein metabolism and drug response [female APOE*3-Leiden.CETP (apoE3 Leiden cholesteryl ester transfer protein) mice] treated with and without niacin for 15 weeks. The gene expression profile of gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) from niacin-treated mice showed an upregulation of the "biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids" pathway, which was corroborated by quantitative PCR and analysis of the FA ratios in gWAT. Also, adipocytes from niacin-treated mice secreted more of the PUFA DHA ex vivo. This resulted in an increased DHA/ (AA) ratio in the adipocyte FA secretion profile and in plasma of niacin-treated mice. Interestingly, the DHA metabolite 19,20-dihydroxy docosapentaenoic  (19,20-diHDPA) was increased in plasma of niacin-treated mice. Both an increased DHA/AA ratio and increased 19,20-diHDPA are indicative for an anti-inflammatory profile and may indirectly contribute to the atheroprotective lipid and lipoprotein profile associated with prolonged niacin treatment.Copyright © 2014 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25623480>Platelet  Deficiency May Contribute to Abnormal Platelet Function During Parenteral Fish Oil Monotherapy in a Piglet Model.</a></h2><p>Fish oil monotherapy has been an advance for treating intestinal failure-associated  disease (IFALD).

We have previously reported abnormal platelet function in neonatal piglets given fish oil monotherapy during parenteral nutrition (PN). The purpose of this study was to determine if abnormal   composition of the platelets could explain the prior observed antiplatelet effect.Neonatal piglets were assigned to 2 treatments: PN with fish oil monotherapy (FO; n = 4) or PN with soy oil (SO; n = 5). On day 14, plasma was collected and platelets isolated by centrifuging. The   content in plasma and platelet plug were measured using gas liquid chromatography and compared with controls (CON; n = 5).The  (AA) content in the FO group was on average half that of the SO group, in both the platelets (FO, 3.5% vs SO, 7.6%; P = .021; CON, 4.5%-11%) and the plasma (FO, 3.8% vs SO, 9.2%; P = .002; CON, 6.1%-9.5%).

We aimed to explore the role of MGL in the development of cholestatic  and bile duct injury in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis (SC), a disease so far lacking effective pharmacological therapy. To this aim we analyzed the effects of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) feeding to induce SC in wild type (WT) and knockout (MGL ) mice and tested pharmacological inhibition with JZL184 in the Mdr2 mouse model of SC. Cholestatic  injury and fibrosis were assessed by serum biochemistry,  histology, gene expression and western blot characterization of BA and FA synthesis/transport. Moreover, intestinal FAs and fecal microbiome were analyzed. Transfection and silencing were performed in Caco2 cells. MGL mice were protected from DDC-induced biliary fibrosis and inflammation with reduced serum  enzymes, increased FA/BA metabolism and β-oxidation. Notably, pharmacological (JZL184) inhibition of MGL ameliorated cholestatic injury in DDC-fed WT mice and protected Mdr2 from spontaneous  injury, with improved  enzymes, inflammation and biliary fibrosis. In vitro experiments confirmed that silencing of MGL decreases prostaglandin E2 accumulation in the intestine upregulating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) -α and -γ activity, thus reducing inflammation. Conclusions: Collectively, our study unravels MGL as a novel metabolic target, demonstrating that MGL inhibition may be considered as potential therapy for SC.© 2019 The Authors.

Tamoxifen, a widely used antiestrogenic agent for adjuvant therapy against estrogen-positive breast cancer, possesses side effects such as hepatic steatosis and phospholipidosis (PLD). In the present study, we administered tamoxifen to Sprague-Dawley rats and used lipidomics to reveal tamoxifen-induced alteration of the hepatic lipid profile and its association with the plasma lipid profile. Treatment with tamoxifen for 28 days caused hepatic PLD in rats. We compared the plasma and  lipid profiles in treated vs. untreated rats using a multivariate analysis to determine differences between the two groups. In total, 25 plasma and 45  lipids were identified and altered in the tamoxifen-treated group. Of these lipids,  (AA)-containing phosphatidylcholines (PCs), such as PC (17:0/20:4) and PC (18:1/20:4), were commonly reduced in both plasma and . Conversely, tamoxifen increased other phosphoglycerolipids in the , such as phosphatidylethanolamine (18:1/18:1) and phosphatidylinositol (18:0/18:2).

In contrast, the much more prevalent cytosolic FABP1 is not detectable in the brain but is instead highly expressed in the . Therefore, the possibility that FABP1 outside the central nervous system may regulate brain AEA and 2-AG was examined in wild-type (WT) and FABP1 null (LKO) male mice. LKO increased brain levels of AA-containing EC (AEA, 2-AG), correlating with increased free and total ARA in brain and serum. LKO also increased brain levels of non-ARA that contain potentiating endocannabinoids (EC*) such as oleoyl ethanolamide (OEA), PEA, 2-OG, and 2-PG. Concomitantly, LKO decreased serum total ARA-containing EC, but not non-ARA endocannabinoids. LKO did not elicit these changes in the brain EC and EC* as a result of compensatory up-regulation of brain protein levels of enzymes in EC synthesis (NAPEPLD, DAGLα) or cytosolic EC chaperone proteins (FABPs 3, 5, 7, SCP-2, HSP70), or cannabinoid receptors (CB1, TRVP1). These data show for the first time that the non-CNS  -binding protein FABP1 markedly affected brain levels of both ARA-containing endocannabinoids (AEA, 2-AG) as well as their non-ARA potentiating endocannabinoids.  -binding protein-1 (FABP-1) is not detectable in brain but instead is highly expressed in .

Of particular interest is the study of omega-3 and omega-6 long chain polyunsaturated  acids (LC-PUFAs), notably EPA (eicosapentaenoic , 20:5n-3), DHA (docosahexaenoic , 22:6n-3), and ARA (, 20:4n-6), and their transformation into bioactive lipid mediators. In this sense, new families of PUFA-derived lipid mediators, including resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protectins and maresins derived from DHA, are being increasingly investigated because of their active role in the "return to homeostasis" process and resolution of inflammation. Recent findings reviewed in the present study highlight that the omega-6   ARA appears increased, and omega-3 EPA and DHA decreased in most cancer tissues compared to normal ones, and that increments in omega-3 LC-PUFAs consumption and an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 2-4:1, are associated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate, colon and renal cancers. Along with their lipid-lowering properties, omega-3 LC-PUFAs also exert cardioprotective functions, such as reducing platelet aggregation and inflammation, and controlling the presence of DHA in our body, especially in our  and brain, which is crucial for optimal brain functionality. Considering that DHA is the principal omega-3 FA in cortical gray matter, the importance of DHA intake and its derived lipid mediators have been recently reported in patients with major depressive and bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study reviews the relationships between major diseases occurring today in the Western world and LC-PUFAs. More specifically this review focuses on the dietary omega-3 LC-PUFAs and the omega-6/omega-3 balance, in a wide range of inflammation disorders, including autoimmune diseases. This review suggests that the current recommendations of consumption and/or supplementation of omega-3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still need more fine tuning for overall human health and well being.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30543782>Subterminal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids: Crucial lipid mediators in normal physiology and disease states.</a></h2><p>Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes are superfamily of monooxygenases that hold the utmost diversity of substrate structures and catalytic reaction forms amongst all other enzymes. P450 enzymes metabolize  (AA) to a wide array of biologically active lipid mediators. P450-mediated AA metabolites have a significant role in normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions, hence they could be promising therapeutic targets in different disease states. P450 monooxygenases mediate the (ω-n)-hydroxylation reactions, which involve the introduction of a hydroxyl group to the carbon skeleton of AA, forming subterminal hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). In the current review, we specified different P450 isozymes implicated in the formation of subterminal HETEs in varied tissues. In addition, we focused on the role of subterminal HETEs namely 19-HETE, 16-HETE, 17-HETE and 18-HETE in different organs, importantly the kidneys, heart,  and brain. Furthermore, we highlighted their role in hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, diabetic retinopathy, non-alcoholic  disease, ischemic stroke as well as inflammatory diseases. Since each member of subterminal HETEs exist as R and S enantiomer, we addressed the issue of stereoselectivity related to the formation and differential effects of these enantiomers. In conclusion, elucidation of different roles of subterminal HETEs in normal and disease states leads to identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of new therapeutic modalities in different disease states.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

FABP3 was shown to be involved in long chain polyunsaturated  acids (LCPUFA) uptake in human trophoblastic choriocarcinoma cells, BeWo as the uptake of ,20:4n-6 (ARA) was decreased in FABP3-knockdown BeWo cells. However, the regulation of expression of FABP3 in these cells is not yet well known. The aim of the present study was to examine the FABP3 expression by LCPUFAs, insulin and LXR agonists in BeWo cells. Among all these  acids tested, only ARA dose-dependently stimulated the expression of FABP3 protein in these cells after 24h incubation while other  acids had no such effect. In addition, LXR agonist and insulin dose-dependently increased FABP3 protein expression in these cells after 24h incubation. Insulin-stimulated FABP3 protein expression was accompanied with an increased  uptake. Differentiated BeWo cells had lesser expression of FABP3 protein than in the undifferentiated cells as the cellular differentiation state was measured by hCG production. In preeclamptic placental tissue, lowered expression of FABP3 protein was observed compared with those in normal pregnancy. All these data indicate that FABP3 may in be part involved in ARA uptake in these cells and its expression may be regulated by ARA, insulin, LXR and the state of cellular differentiation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously observed that the levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) species containing long polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) are increased in in vitro activated HSCs. Here we investigated the cause and consequences of the rise in PUFA-TAGs by profiling enzymes involved in PUFA incorporation. We report that acyl CoA synthetase (ACSL) type 4, which has a preference for PUFAs, is the only upregulated ACSL family member in activated HSCs. Inhibition of the activity of ACSL4 by siRNA-mediated knockdown or addition of rosiglitazone specifically inhibited the incorporation of deuterated  (AA-d8) into TAG in HSCs. In agreement with this, ACSL4 was found to be partially localized around lipid droplets (LDs) in HSCs. Inhibition of ACSL4 also prevented the large increase in PUFA-TAGs in HSCs upon activation and to a lesser extent the increase of arachidonate-containing phosphatidylcholine species. Inhibition of ACSL4 by rosiglitazone was associated with an inhibition of HSC activation and prostaglandin secretion. Our combined data show that upregulation of ACSL4 is responsible for the increase in PUFA-TAG species during activation of HSCs, which may serve to protect cells against a shortage of PUFAs required for eicosanoid secretion.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We previously reported that diesel engine exhaust (DE) could lead to structural changes in the placenta of in utero exposed rabbits (first generation, F1). The effects of maternal exposure to DE were further studied on second-generation (F2) rabbits. Pregnant F0 females were exposed to filtered, diluted DE (1 mg/m, median particle diameter: 69 nm) or clean filtered air (controls) for 2 h/day, 5 days/week by nose-only exposure during days 3-27 post-conception (dpc). Adult female offspring (F1) were mated to control males: F1 tissues and F2 foeto-placental units were collected at 28 dpc and placental structure and gene expression (microarray) analysed.   profiles were determined in foetal and maternal plasma, maternal  and placenta. In F1, compared to controls, hepatic neutral lipid contents were increased in exposed animals without change in the blood biochemistry. In F2, the placental lipid contents were higher, with higher monounsaturated  acids and reduced pro-inflammatory  (AA), without placental structural changes. Conversely, the proportion of anti-inflammatory n-3 polyunsaturated  acids in F2 plasma was increased while that of AA was decreased. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of F2 placenta transcriptomic data identified that the proteasome complex and ubiquitin pathways genes were over-represented and ion channel function and inflammation pathways genes were under-represented in exposed animals. These preliminary results demonstrate that diesel engine exhaust exposure and in utero indirect exposure should be considered as a programming factor within the context of the DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease) with a probable intergenerational transmission.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26294003>Abnormalities in Plasma Phospholipid   Profiles of Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h2><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. In the present study, we aimed to profile the possible changes in plasma phospholipid   composition of HCC patients, and to identify the   biomarkers that could distinguish HCC patients from healthy controls. A total of 37 plasma samples from healthy controls and HCC patients were collected and their phospholipid   profiles were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Twenty-five  acids were identified and quantified, their proportions varied greatly between two groups, suggesting each group has its own   pattern. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis in terms of   profiles showed that HCC patients could be clearly distinguished from healthy controls. More importantly, linoleic  (18:2n-6), oleic  (18:1n-9),  (20:4n-6) and palmitic  (16:0) were identified as the potential   biomarkers of HCC patients. Additionally, to further identify the major cause of the abnormality of plasma   profile,   distributions of cancerous tissue and its surrounding tissue from 42 HCC patients were also examined. Due to have similar variation trend of major   biomarkers, linoleic  (18:2n-6), oleic  (18:1n-9), abnormalities in plasma phospholipid   profiles of HCC patients may be mainly attributed to the alternation of intrinsic   metabolism caused by cancer per se, but not to the differences in dietary factors.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25826533>Elevated levels of endocannabinoids in chronic hepatitis C may modulate cellular immune response and hepatic stellate cell activation.</a></h2><p>The endocannabinoid (EC) system is implicated in many chronic  diseases, including hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. Cannabis consumption is associated with fibrosis progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), however, the role of ECs in the development of CHC has never been explored. To study this question, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) were quantified in samples of HCV patients and healthy controls by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.   amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoaclyglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity was assessed by [3H]AEA and [3H]2-AG hydrolysis, respectively. Gene expression and cytokine release were assayed by TaqMan PCR and ELISpot, respectively. AEA and 2-AG levels were increased in plasma of HCV patients, but not in  tissues. Hepatic FAAH and MAGL activity was not changed. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), ECs inhibited IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 secretion. Inhibition of IL-2 by endogenous AEA was stronger in PBMC from HCV patients. In hepatocytes, 2-AG induced the expression of IL-6, -17A, -32 and COX-2, and enhanced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) co-cultivated with PBMC from subjects with CHC.

Most native N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) but only one 2-monoacylglycerol [i.e., 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)] displaced WT FABP1-bound fluorescently labeled endocannabinoids (ECs). While the T94A variant did not differ in affinity for AEA and most other NAEs, it exhibited a modestly higher affinity for OEA, as well as a higher affinity for 2-AG. Binding of AEA and 2-AG altered WT FABP1's secondary structure more extensively than any other previously examined ligand did. The T94A variant without a ligand was more susceptible to temperature-induced unfolding. While the T94A variant was much less sensitive to ligand (i.e., AEA or 2-AG)-induced conformational change, nevertheless binding of AEA and 2-AG significantly stabilized the T94A structure to thermal unfolding. These data provide the first evidence that ECs not only bind to but also alter the secondary structure of the human FABP1, with the latter markedly impacted by the T94A substitution, a variant strongly associated with hepatic accumulation of lipids and non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD).

Based on this report, we investigated whether TLR7 has a pivotal role in non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD). The TLR7 signaling pathway, which is activated by imiquimod (TLR7 ligand) naturally, induced autophagy and released insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) into medium from hepatocytes. Lipid accumulation induced by unsaturated   (UFA; :oleic  = 1:1) in hepatocytes, was attenuated in TLR7 and autophagy activation. Interestingly, TLR7 activation attenuated UFA-induced lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-Hydroxy-2-Nonenal (4-HNE). To clarify a possible pathway between TLR7 and lipid peroxidation, we treated hepatocytes with MDA and 4-HNE.

Our result indicated that the transcription of CYP2C45, together with PK and ALOX5, was increased in goose  upon overfeeding for 19 D (P < 0.05). In goose primary hepatocytes, CYP2C45 RNA expression was also upgraded by the treatment with various chemicals like insulin, the  acids, and PPAR agonists (P < 0.05). We also found that both CYP2C45 overexpression and troglitazone treatment could increase the expression of pyruvate kinase (PK) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), and furthermore, showed that the up-regulation of PK and ALOX5 induced by troglitazone could be suppressed by small interfering RNAs targeting CYP2C45 (P < 0.05).

In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the  cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota, which provides signals through the intestine to the , is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity.

Understanding molecular mechanisms of PUFA biosynthesis and regulation is a pre-requisite for sustainable use of vegetable oils in aquafeeds as current sources of fish oils are unable to meet increasing demands for omega-3 PUFAs. By generating CRISPR-mediated elovl2 partial knockout (KO), we have shown that elovl2 is crucial for multi-tissue synthesis of 22:6n-3 in vivo and that endogenously synthesized PUFAs are important for transcriptional regulation of lipogenic genes in Atlantic salmon. The elovl2-KOs showed reduced levels of 22:6n-3 and accumulation of 20:5n-3 and docosapentaenoic  (22:5n-3) in the , brain and white muscle, suggesting inhibition of elongation. Additionally, elovl2-KO salmon showed accumulation of 20:4n-6 in brain and white muscle. The impaired synthesis of 22:6n-3 induced hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (srebp-1),   synthase-b, Δ6fad-a, Δ5fad and elovl5.

The same analyses were conducted for the serum docosahexaenoic  to  (DHA:AA) ratio and individual   concentrations.During the follow-up period, 121 subjects died of cancer. Age- and sex-adjusted cancer mortality increased with lower serum EPA:AA ratio levels (P trend<0.05). In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, the subjects in the first quartile of the serum EPA:AA ratio had a 1.93-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.15-3.22) greater risk of cancer death than those in the fourth quartile. Lower serum EPA concentrations were marginally associated with higher cancer mortality (P trend<0.11), but the serum DHA or AA concentrations and the serum DHA:AA ratio were not (all P trend>0.37). With regard to site-specific cancers, lower serum EPA:AA ratio was associated with a higher risk of death from  cancer.

Schistosome development is hampered in the mice lacking just T cells, and is even more heavily retarded in the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice lacking both T and B lymphocytes. Nevertheless, it's still not clear about the underlying regulatory molecular mechanisms of schistosome growth and development by host's immune system. This study, therefore, detected and compared the serum metabolic profiles between the immunodeficient mice and immunocompetent mice (SCID mice vs. BALB/c mice) before and after S. japonicum infection (on the thirty-fifth day post infection using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Totally, 705 ion features in electrospray ionization in positive-ion mode (ESI+) and 242 ion features in ESI- mode were identified, respectively. First, distinct serum metabolic profiles were identified between SCID mice and BALB/c mice without S. japonicum worms infection. Second, uniquely perturbed serum metabolites and their enriched pathways were also obtained between SCID mice and BALB/c mice after S. japonicum infection, which included differential metabolites due to both species differences and differential responses to S. japonicum infection. The metabolic pathways analysis revealed that  metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated  acids, linoleic  metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic  metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and purine metabolism were enriched based on the differential serum metabolites between SCID mice and BALB/c mice after S. japonicum infection, which was addressed to be related to the retarded growth and development of S. japonicum in SCID mice. These findings provide new clues to the underlying molecular events of host's systemic metabolic changes on the growth and development of S. japonicum worms, and also provide quite promising candidates for exploitation of drugs or vaccines against schistosome and schistosomiasis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In humans, maternal obesity alters placental FA uptake, though the impact of diet remains uncertain. The  fetal  observed in offspring of Japanese macaques fed a high fat diet (HFD) was prevented with resveratrol supplementation during pregnancy. We sought to determine the effect of HFD and resveratrol, a supplement with insulin-sensitizing properties, on placental LCPUFA uptake in this model.J. macaques were fed control chow (15% fat, n = 5), HFD (35% fat, n = 10) or HFD containing 0.37% resveratrol (n = 5) prior to- and throughout pregnancy. At ∼ 130 d gestation (term = 173 d), placentas were collected by caesarean section.   uptake studies using (14)C-labeled oleic ,  (AA) and docosahexanoic  (DHA) were performed in placental explants.Resveratrol supplementation increased placental uptake of DHA (P < 0.05), while HFD alone had no measurable effect. Resveratrol increased AMP-activated protein kinase activity and mRNA expression of the   transporters FATP-4, CD36 and FABPpm (P < 0.05). Placental DHA content was decreased in HFD dams; resveratrol had no effect on tissue   profiles.Maternal HFD did not significantly affect placental LCPUFA uptake. Furthermore, resveratrol stimulated placental DHA uptake capacity, AMPK activation and transporter expression.

The water rat Nectomys squamipes is one of the most important non-human hosts in the schistosomiasis mansoni transmission in Brazil, being considered a wild reservoir. Cellular mechanisms that contribute to the physiological adaptation of this rodent to the Schistosoma mansoni parasite are poorly understood. Here we identified, for the first time, that a hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by excessive lipid accumulation with formation of lipid droplets (LDs) within hepatocytes, occurs in response to the natural S. mansoni infection of N. squamipes, captured in an endemic region. Significant increases of LD area in the hepatic tissue and LD numbers/hepatocyte, detected by quantitative histopathological and ultrastructural analyses, were paralleled by increased serum profile (total cholesterol and triglycerides) in infected compared to uninfected animals. Raman spectroscopy showed high content of polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) in the  of both groups. MALDI-TOFF mass spectroscopy revealed an amplified pool of omega-6 PUFA  in the  of infected animals. Assessment of  functional activity by the levels of hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST) did not detect any alteration during the natural infection. In summary, this work demonstrates that the natural infection of the wild reservoir N. squamipes with S. mansoni elicits hepatic steatosis in the absence of  functional harm and that accumulation of lipids, markedly PUFAs, coexists with low occurrence of inflammatory granulomatous processes, suggesting that lipid stores may be acting as a protective mechanism for dealing with the infection.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976364>Eicosapentaenoic / ratio as a possible link between non-alcoholic  disease and cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>The main causes of mortality from non-alcoholic  disease (NAFLD) are cardiovascular disease (CVD) and malignancy.

In this study, we investigated EPA/AA ratio in Japanese patients with NAFLD.Two hundred and fifty-four patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were retrospectively enrolled. Serum EPA/AA ratios were examined for each generation (<35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, ≥65 years), and the differences of EPA/AA ratios were evaluated based on steatotic grades and fibrotic stages.EPA/AA ratio in NAFLD patients was decreased compared to that reported in age-matched healthy controls. EPA/AA ratio, body mass index, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and steatotic grades in younger NAFLD patients were significantly worse than those in older NAFLD patients. Fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c and fibrotic stages in older NAFLD patients were significantly higher than those in younger NAFLD patients. No relation was found between EPA/AA ratio and histological findings.EPA/AA ratio was lower in NAFLD, especially in younger NAFLD patients. Considering the high mortality from CVD in NAFLD patients, low EPA/AA ratio in young age may influence the increased prevalence of CVD in their older age.

Most studies have focused on n-3 LC-PUFA accumulation in the brain from birth until 2years of age, well before the symptomatic onset of such disorders. The current study addresses changes that occur in childhood and adolescence. Postmortem brain (cortical gray matter, inferior temporal lobe; n=50) and  (n=60) from vervet monkeys fed a uniform diet from birth through young adulthood were collected from archived tissues. Lipids were extracted and   levels determined. There was a marked reduction in the ratio of n-6 LC-PUFAs,  (ARA) and adrenic  (ADR), relative to the n-3 LC-PUFA, docosahexaenoic  (DHA), in temporal cortex lipids from birth to puberty and then a more gradual decrease though adulthood. This decrease in ratio resulted from a 3-fold accumulation of DHA levels while concentrations of ARA remained constant. Early childhood through adolescence appears to be a critical period for DHA accretion in the cortex of vervet monkeys and may represent a vulnerable stage where lack of dietary n-3 LC-PUFAs impacts development in humans.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is specifically found in seeds from gymnosperms such as pine nuts. Published papers describe a decrease in  and plasma triacylglycerols in rats fed with this nutriment. The present study seeks to identify the action mechanism of Scia on triacylglycerol synthesis. In this way, its nutritional effect on FA metabolism involving the Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) is investigated.Scia is discerned in trace amount in various tissues of rats and in human serum. It is produced by Δ5-desaturation of 20:2n-6 in human transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines and also in rat hepatocytes. When Scia is incubated with cultured hepatocytes as a nutrient, the cellular FA profile is modified. In particular, the proportion of the monoenes (18:1n-9, 18:1n-7, 16:1n-7) are all decreased, correlating to the reduction of triacylglycerol amounts. This effect is mediated by the inhibition of SCD1 expression. Furthermore, Scia, as well as 20:3n-6 and 20:3n-9 but not 20:3n-3, strongly inhibit the SCD1 activity measured on  microsomes.Overall, this study shows that Scia, despite its unusual structure, contributes to the FA metabolism and reduced triacylglycerol release by inhibiting SCD1 activity.© 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in flaxseed decreases nutrient digestibility and limits the availability of n-3 FA. Addition of carbohydrase enzymes to flaxseed-based diets can decrease the anti-nutritive effects of NSP. We hypothesized that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation affect lipid content and alter expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in broiler . Five day-old broiler chicks were fed a corn-soybean basal diet with 0% flaxseed, a basal diet with 10% of flaxseed, or 10% flaxseed + 0.05% enzyme diet up to day 42 of growth. Total lipids, including long-chain (≥20C) n-3 FA and monounsaturated FA, were increased in flax-fed broiler livers. Enzyme addition reduced  and total long chain n-6 FA. These changes were similarly reflected in phosphatidylcholine lipid species. Dietary flax and enzyme treatments up-regulated PPARα target genes  and  while reducing expression of  FA synthesis-related genes. This study concludes that flaxseed and enzyme supplementation in broiler diets enhances LC n-3 FA species, while reducing n-6 FA species in hepatic phospholipids (PL).

We propose a simplified method for measuring the desaturase activity that combines the in vitro reaction by desaturase-expressing yeast cell homogenate and the detection of acyl-CoA product as butylamide derivatives by gas chromatography. To set up the in vitro reaction, we traced the in vivo activity of rat  ∆6   desaturase (D6d) expressed in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and determined the time taken for the D6d activity to reach its maximum level. The cell homogenate of yeast expressing the maximum D6d activity was made to react in vitro with linoleoyl-CoA to generate the D6d product, γlinolenoyl-CoA. This product was successfully detected as a peak corresponding to γ-linolenoyl butylamide on gas chromatography. This procedure, with low background expression, using non-labeled acyl-CoA as substrate, will contribute toward developing a simple in vitro desaturase assay.

The present study aimed at cloning and functionally characterizing genes encoding key desaturase and elongase enzymes, namely fads2, elovl5 and elovl2, involved in the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathways in tambaqui. First, a fads2-like desaturase was isolated from tambaqui. When expressed in yeast, the tambaqui Fads2 showed Δ6, Δ5 and Δ8 desaturase capacities within the same enzyme, enabling all desaturation reactions required for ARA, EPA and DHA biosynthesis. Moreover, tambaqui possesses two elongases that are bona fide orthologs of elovl5 and elovl2. Their functional characterization confirmed that they can operate towards a variety of PUFA substrates with chain lengths ranging from 18 to 22 carbons. Overall our results provide compelling evidence that demonstrates that all the desaturase and elongase activities required to convert LA and ALA into ARA, EPA and DHA are present in tambaqui within the three genes studied herein, i.e. fads2, elovl5 and elovl2.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, little knowledge exists linking acetaminophen to  free  acids and the eicosanoid-mediated signaling pathway. To this end, adult NMRI mice injected with a dose of 400 mg/kg acetaminophen were monitored for one week post-treatment.

Both linoleic  and --substrates in eicosanoid biosynthesis--were significantly influenced by overdose, and the latter peaked first among the free  acids examined here. There was a close similarity between the temporal dynamics of linoleic  and aspartate aminotransferases.

Overall, mice fed the DHA diet had 50% lower concentrations of  total FAs than did mice fed the control diet.These findings in transgenic mice suggest that a long-term diet rich in DHA suppresses the APOE4-specific disturbances in hepatic transport and concentration of AA and DHA and also reduces hepatic total FA concentrations, regardless of genotype.© 2016 American Society for Nutrition.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207550>Early Low-Fat Diet Enriched With Linolenic  Reduces  Endocannabinoid Tone and Improves Late Glycemic Control After a High-Fat Diet Challenge in Mice.</a></h2><p>Evidence suggests that alterations of glucose and lipid homeostasis induced by obesity are associated with the elevation of endocannabinoid tone. The biosynthesis of the two main endocannabinoids, N-arachidonoylethanolamine and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, which derive from , is influenced by dietary  acids (FAs). We investigated whether exposure to n-3 FA at a young age may decrease tissue endocannabinoid levels and prevent metabolic disorders induced by a later high-fat diet (HFD) challenge. Three-week-old mice received a 5% lipid diet containing lard, lard plus safflower oil, or lard plus linseed oil for 10 weeks. Then, mice were challenged with a 30% lard diet for 10 additional weeks. A low n-6/n-3 FA ratio in the early diet induces a marked decrease in  endocannabinoid levels. A similar reduction was observed in transgenic Fat-1 mice, which exhibit high tissue levels of n-3 FA compared with wild-type mice. Hepatic expression of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was concomitantly changed. Interestingly, some gene modifications persisted after HFD challenge and were associated with improved glycemic control. These findings indicate that early dietary interventions based on n-3 FA may represent an alternative strategy to drugs for reducing endocannabinoid tone and improving metabolic parameters in the metabolic syndrome.© 2016 by the American Diabetes Association.

We aimed to determine the impact of short-term fish oil (FO) intake on phospholipids composition and plaque pathology in 5xFAD mice, a widely used animal model of AD. A 3-week-long FO supplementation administered at 3 months of age decreased the number of dense core plaques in the 5xFAD cortex and changed phospholipids in the livers and brains of wild-type (Wt) and 5xFAD mice. Livers of both genotypes responded by increase of -3 and reciprocal decrease of -6  acids. In Wt brains, FO supplementation induced elevation of -3  acids and subsequent enhancement of -6/-3 ratio. However, in 5xFAD brains the improved -6/-3 ratio was mainly due to FO-induced decrease in  and adrenic -6  acids. Also, brain and  abundance of -3  acids were strongly correlated in Wts, oppositely to 5xFADs where significant brain- correlation exists only for -6  acids. Expression of omega-3 transporter Mfs2a remained unchanged after FO supplementation.

The aim was to assess this relationship. In a cross-sectional study, hepatic gene expression (Illumina Microarray) was first compared among 20 patients with simple steatosis (SS), 19 with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 24 healthy controls. The FA composition in hepatic total lipids was compared between SS and NASH, and associations between gene expression and FAs were examined. Gene expression differed mainly between healthy controls and patients (SS and NASH), including genes related to unsaturated FA metabolism. Twenty-two genes were differentially expressed between NASH and SS; most of them correlated with disease severity and related more to cancer progression than to lipid metabolism. Biologically active long-chain polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs; eicosapentaenoic  + docosahexaenoic , ) in hepatic total lipids were lower in NASH than in SS. This may be related to overexpression of FADS1, FADS2, and PNPLA3. The degree and direction of correlations between PUFAs and gene expression were different among SS and NASH, which may suggest that low PUFA content in NASH modulates gene expression in a different way compared with SS or, alternatively, that gene expression influences PUFA content differently depending on disease severity (SS versus NASH).Well-defined subjects with either healthy , SS, or NASH showed distinct hepatic gene expression profiles including genes involved in unsaturated FA metabolism. In patients with NASH, hepatic PUFAs were lower and associations with gene expression were different compared to SS.© 2015 by the American Association for the Study of  Diseases.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28716367>Redefining essential  acids in the era of novel intravenous lipid emulsions.</a></h2><p>The essentiality of  acids was determined by the Burrs in the 1920s. It is commonly accepted that provision of linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic acids (ALA) prevents and reverses essential   deficiency (EFAD). Development of alternative injectable lipid emulsions (ILE) low in LA and ALA has raised concern about their ability to prevent EFAD. This review provides biochemical evidence coupled with observations from animal and human studies that aim to characterize which  acids are truly essential to prevent EFAD. Retroconversion pathways and mobilization from body stores suggest that  and docosahexaenoic acids (ARA and DHA - the main derivatives of LA and ALA, respectively) also prevent EFAD. Our group first proposed the essentiality of ARA and DHA by feeding mice exclusively these  acids and proving that they prevent EFAD. Survival for 5 generations on this diet provides additional evidence that growth and reproductive capabilities are maintained. Moreover, the use of fish oil-based ILE, with minimal LA and ALA and abundant DHA and ARA, for treatment of intestinal failure-associated  disease, does not result in EFAD. These findings challenge the essentiality of LA and ALA in the presence of ARA and DHA. Evidence discussed in this review supports the idea that ARA and DHA can independently fulfill dietary essential   requirements. The imminent introduction of new ILE rich in ARA and DHA in the United States highlights the importance of understanding their essentiality, especially when provision of ALA and LA is below the established daily minimum requirement.Copyright © 2017.

The aim of the current investigation was to scrutinize the effect of GLA on mitochondrial mediated apoptosis and anti-inflammatory pathway against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced HCC.Chemical carcinogenesis in Wistar rats was introduced by an intra-peritoneal dose of DEN (200 mg/kg). The rats received the various doses of GLA for 22 weeks. The progressions of serum biomarkers and histopathology components of hepatic tissue were used to access the prophylactic effects.

The most prominent hepatic FABP,    binding protein (FABP1 or L-FABP), has high affinity for  (ARA) and ARA-CoA, suggesting that FABP1 may also bind ARA-derived ECs (AEA and 2-AG). Indeed, FABP1 bound ECs with high affinity as shown by displacement of FABP1-bound fluorescent ligands and by quenching of FABP1 intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence. FABP1 also had high affinity for most non-ARA-containing ECs, FABP1 inhibitors, EC uptake/hydrolysis inhibitors, and phytocannabinoids and less so for synthetic cannabinoid receptor (CBR) agonists and antagonists. The physiological impact was examined with  from wild-type (WT) versus FABP1 gene-ablated (LKO) male mice. As shown by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, FABP1 gene ablation significantly increased hepatic levels of AEA, 2-AG, and 2-OG. These increases were not due to increased protein levels of EC synthetic enzymes (NAPEPLD and DAGL) or a decreased level of EC degradative enzyme (FAAH) but correlated with complete loss of FABP1, a decreased level of SCP2 (8-fold less prevalent than FABP1, but also binds ECs), and a decreased level of degradative enzymes (NAAA and MAGL).

In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and  index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic , whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic  through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated   () in the embryonic  through upregulation of  X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased   β-oxidation and Na/K-ATPase activity in the embryonic  through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic  and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3.

The regulatory mechanisms of inflammation are incompletely understood. One possible regulatory mechanism is the endocannabinoid system. Endocannabinoids such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA) are generally anti-inflammatory via engagement of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) on innate cells; therefore, preventing the degradation of endocannabinoids by specific serine hydrolases such as   amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), and carboxylesterases (CES) might decrease inflammation. We hypothesized that the activities of these catabolic enzymes would decrease with a subsequent increase in 2-AG and AEA in a model of inflammation. Mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 or 24h, and inflammation was confirmed by an increase in interleukin-6 (il6) and il17 gene expression. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of serine hydrolases showed no significant difference in various serine hydrolase activities in brain or , whereas a modest decrease in Ces activity in spleen after LPS administration was noted. 2-AG hydrolase activity in the spleen was also decreased at 6h post LPS, which was corroborated by LPS treatment of splenocytes ex vivo. ABPP-MudPIT proteomic analysis suggested that the decreased 2-AG hydrolysis in spleen was due to a reduction in Ces2g activity. These studies suggest that the endocannabinoid system could be activated via suppression of a 2-AG catabolic enzyme in response to inflammatory stimuli as one mechanism to limit inflammation.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies showed that wild-caught female greater amberjack reared in sea cages and handled during the reproductive season, underwent extensive ovarian atresia. This atresia, however, was not related to an insufficient  transcription or oocyte uptake of vitellogenin (Vtg). In the present study, the structure of two greater amberjack vitellogenin receptors, namely Vtgr (Lr8-) and Lrp13, was characterized. Moreover, vtgr and lrp13 gene expression and the   profiles of specific phospholipids and neutral lipids were compared in the ovaries of wild and captive-reared greater amberjack during different phases of the reproductive cycle (i.e. early gametogenesis, advanced gametogenesis and spawning). Ovarian vtgr and lrp13 transcription was more active during early gametogenesis, suggesting that vitellogenin receptor transcripts were synthesized by previtellogenic oocytes and remained in the cellular mRNA pool until oocytes resumed meiosis and entered into secondary growth (i.e. vitellogenesis). Rearing of wild-caught greater amberjack in captivity together with handling during the reproductive season was associated with a reduced vtgr and lrp13 transcription and with a diminished capacity of oocytes in the early phase of gametogenesis (primary oocyte growth) to enter into vitellogenesis. During early gametogenesis, remarkable differences in the   composition were observed between wild and captive-reared individuals: all phospholipids of captive fish displayed dramatic increases of saturates (16:0 and 18:0) and decreases of  (ARA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). The present study confirms the susceptibility of greater amberjack reproductive function to handling stress and suggests that the consequent extensive atresia of vitellogenic follicles originated during the primary oocytes growth when the capacity of oocytes to synthesize vitellogenin receptors was reduced. The study also suggests that this reduced capacity was associated with an altered oocyte phospholipid   composition during early gametogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

High levels of sperm competition lead to increased metabolism to fuel higher sperm velocities. This enhanced metabolism can result in oxidative damage (including lipid peroxidation) and damage to the membrane. We hypothesized that in those species experiencing high levels of sperm competition there are changes in the - composition of the sperm membrane that makes the membrane more resistant to oxidative damage. Given that polyunsaturated  acids (PUFAs) are the most prone to lipid peroxidation, we predicted that higher sperm competition leads to a reduction in the proportion of sperm PUFAs. In contrast, we predicted that levels of sperm competition should not affect the proportion of PUFAs in somatic cells. To test these predictions, we quantified the - composition of sperm, testis and  cells in four mouse species (genus Mus) that differ in their levels of sperm competition. - composition in testis and  cells was not associated to sperm competition levels. However, in sperm cells, as predicted, an increase in sperm competition levels was associated with an increase in the proportion of saturated -acids (the most resistant to lipid peroxidation) and by a concomitant decrease in the proportion of PUFAs. Two particular  acids were most responsible for this pattern ( and palmitic ). Our findings thus indicate that sperm competition has a pervasive influence in the composition of sperm cells that ultimately may have important effects in sperm function.© 2015.

In , profiles of lipids revealed involvement of β-oxidation and biosynthesis of saturated and unsaturated  acids in PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity, while alterations in metabolism of  suggesting potential of PFOA to cause inflammation response in . These results provide insight into the mechanism and biomarkers for PFOA-induced effects.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29663407>Ground Beef High in Total Fat and Saturated  Acids Decreases X Receptor Signaling Targets in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Men and Women.</a></h2><p>We hypothesized that consumption of saturated  acids in the form of high-fat ground beef for 5 weeks would depress  X receptor signaling targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and that changes in gene expression would be associated with the corresponding changes in lipoprotein cholesterol (C) concentrations. Older men (n = 5, age 68.0 ± 4.6 years) and postmenopausal women (n = 7, age 60.9 ± 3.1 years) were assigned randomly to consume ground-beef containing 18% total fat (18F) or 25% total fat (25F), five patties per week for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p < 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, palmitic , and stearic , but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of oleic  (p < 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of palmitic  (p < 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of , eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p < 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p < 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p < 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.© 2018 AOCS.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29353041>FADS2 inhibition in essential   deficiency induces hepatic lipid accumulation via impairment of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion.</a></h2><p>  desaturase 2 (FADS2) is responsible for the first desaturation reaction in the synthesis of highly unsaturated  acids (HUFAs), such as  (20:4n-6) and eicosapentaenoic  (20:5n-3), and is involved in Mead  (20:3n-9) production during essential   deficiency (EFAD). In this study, an obvious hepatic lipid accumulation was observed in EFAD mice treated with a FADS2 inhibitor. FADS2 inhibition in the EFAD state reduced secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and markedly diminished Mead  in phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the  and plasma. As the results, the amount of C20 HUFAs in hepatic and plasma PC dramatically reduced in the EFAD mice treated with a FADS2 inhibitor, whereas the decrease of C20 HUFA levels of PC in EFAD mice was not observed because of the increased Mead  in PC. These results supposed that Mead  in PC is important as a component of VLDL. It is possible that Mead  plays the role of a substitute of HUFAs in VLDL secretion during EFAD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p><p>Keyword: fatty liver</p></html>
